We manage our business as three separate segments, an exploration and production segment, a marketing segment and a service operations segment which is comprised of our wholly owned drilling subsidiary. We refer you to Note 8 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements appearing in Item 8 of this report, which summarizes by segment our net income and capital expenditures for 2005, 2004 and 2003 and our assets as of December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003. Executive Summary Chesapeake is the second largest independent producer of natural gas in the United States and we own interests in approximately 30,600 producing oil and gas wells. Our strategy is focused on discovering, developing and acquiring onshore natural gas reserves primarily in the southwestern U.S. and secondarily in the Appalachian Basin in the eastern U.S. Our most important operating area has historically been the Mid Continent region, which includes Oklahoma, Arkansas, Kansas and the Texas Panhandle. At December 31, 2005, 51% of our proved reserves were located in the Mid Continent. During the past four years, we have also built significant positions in the South Texas and Texas Gulf Coast regions, the Permian Basin of West Texas and eastern New Mexico, the Barnett Shale area of north central Texas, the Ark La Tex area of East Texas and northern Louisiana and the emerging Fayetteville Shale play in Arkansas. As a result of our recent acquisition of Columbia Energy Resources, LLC and its subsidiaries, including Columbia Natural Resources, LLC (CNR) as described below, we now have a significant presence in the Appalachian Basin, principally in West Virginia, eastern Kentucky, eastern Ohio and southern New York. Chesapeake attributes its strong organic growth rates during 2005 and in the past five years to managements early recognition that oil and gas prices were undergoing structural change and its subsequent decision to invest aggressively in the building blocks of value creation in the E&P industry people, land and seismic. During the past five years, Chesapeake has invested more than $3.0 billion in new leasehold and 3 D seismic acquisitions and now owns what it believes to be the largest inventories of onshore leasehold (8.5 million net acres) and 3 D seismic (11.6 million acres) in the U.S. On this leasehold, the company has identified more than a 10 year drilling inventory of approximately 28,000 drilling locations. In addition, Chesapeake has significantly strengthened its technical capabilities during the past five years by increasing its land, geoscience and engineering staff by 400% to over 600 employees. Today, the company has more than 3,300 employees, of which approximately 70% work in the companys E&P operations and 30% work in the companys oilfield service operations. Oil and natural gas production for 2005 was 468.6 bcfe, an increase of 106.0 bcfe, or 29% over the 362.6 bcfe produced in 2004. We have increased our production for 16 consecutive years and 18 consecutive quarters. During these 18 quarters, Chesapeakes U.S. production has increased 262% for an average compound quarterly growth rate of 7% and an average compound annual growth rate of 33%. In addition to increased oil and natural gas production, the prices we received were higher in 2005 than in 2004. On a natural gas equivalent basis, weighted average prices (excluding the effect of unrealized gains or losses on derivatives) were $6.90 per mcfe in 2005 compared to $5.23 per mcfe in 2004. The increase in prices resulted in an increase in revenue of $782.2 million, and increased production resulted in an increase in revenue of $554.0 million, for a total increase in revenue of $1.336 billion (excluding the effect of unrealized gains or losses on derivatives). In each of the operating areas where Chesapeake sells its oil and natural gas, established marketing and transportation infrastructures exist thereby contributing to relatively high wellhead price realizations for our production. 32 Table of Contents During 2005, Chesapeake drilled 902 (686 net) operated wells and participated in another 1,066 (130 net) wells operated by other companies. The companys drilling success rate was 98% for company operated wells and 95% for non operated wells. During 2005, Chesapeake invested $1.511 billion in operated wells (using an average of 73 operated rigs), $309 million in non operated wells (using an average of approximately 66 non operated rigs) and $362 million in acquiring new 3 D seismic data and new leasehold (excluding leasehold acquired through acquisitions). Our acquisition expenditures totaled $4.9 billion during 2005 (including amounts paid for unproved leasehold and excluding $252 million of deferred taxes in connection with certain corporate acquisitions). We expect to continue replacing reserves through the drillbit and acquisitions, although the timing and magnitude of future additions are uncertain. Chesapeake began 2005 with estimated proved reserves of 4.902 tcfe and ended the year with 7.521 tcfe, an increase of 2.619 tcfe, or 53%. During 2005, we replaced 468.6 bcfe of production with an estimated 3.088 tcfe of new proved reserves, for a reserve replacement rate of 659%. This compares to reserve replacement of 578% and 459% for 2004 and 2003, respectively. Reserve replacement through the drillbit was 1.047 tcfe, or 223% of production (including a positive 17 bcfe from performance revisions and a positive 24 bcfe from oil and natural gas price increases), or 34% of the total increase. Reserve replacement through acquisitions was 2.041 tcfe, or 436% of production, or 66% of the total increase. Our annual decline rate on producing properties is projected to be 24% from 2006 to 2007, 16% from 2007 to 2008, 13% from 2008 to 2009, 11% from 2009 to 2010 and 10% from 2010 to 2011. Our percentage of proved undeveloped reserve additions to total proved reserve additions was approximately 36% in 2005, 56% in 2004 and 35% in 2003. Based on our current drilling schedule and budget, we expect that virtually all of the proved undeveloped reserves added in 2005 will begin producing within the next five years. Generally, proved developed reserves are producing at the time they are added or will begin producing within a year. On November 14, 2005, we acquired CNR and its significant natural gas reserves, acreage and mid stream assets for approximately $3.02 billion, of which $2.2 billion was in cash and $0.82 billion was in assumed liabilities related to CNRs working capital deficit and its prepaid sales agreement and hedging positions. The CNR assets consist of 125 mmcfe per day of natural gas production, 1.3 tcfe of proved reserves and approximately 3.2 million net acres of U.S. oil and gas leasehold, which we estimate have over 9,000 additional undrilled locations with reserve potential. CNR also owns extensive mid stream natural gas assets, including over 6,500 miles of natural gas gathering lines. In anticipation of todays tight drilling rig market, Chesapeake began making a series of investments in drilling rigs in 2001. In that year, Chesapeake formed its 100% owned drilling rig subsidiary, Nomac Drilling Corporation, with an investment of $26 million to build and refurbish five drilling rigs. Chesapeake has invested a total of $123 million in Nomacs 19 operating rigs, invested another $26 million in 25 rigs that Nomac is currently building, and budgeted an additional $191 million for completion of these rigs. In addition to Nomac, Chesapeake has also made four other major drilling rig investments. The first of these was its ownership of approximately 17% of the common stock of Pioneer Drilling Company (Pioneer), which we began acquiring in 2003. The company recently sold its Pioneer stock, realizing proceeds of $159 million and a pre tax gain of $116 million that it will recognize in the 2006 first quarter. Chesapeake re invested the Pioneer proceeds to acquire 13 rigs from privately held Martex Drilling Company, L.L.P. for $150 million. Chesapeake has invested $43 million in two private drilling rig contractors, DHS Drilling Company and Mountain Drilling Company, in which Chesapeake owns 45% and 49%, respectively. DHS owns ten drilling rigs and has three more rigs on order. Mountain owns one drilling rig and has ordered another nine rigs for delivery in 2006 and 2007. Chesapeakes drilling rig investments have served as a partial hedge to rising service costs and have also provided competitive advantages in making acquisitions and in developing its own leasehold on a more timely basis. As of December 31, 2005, the companys debt as a percentage of total capitalization (total capitalization is the sum of debt and stockholders equity) was 47% compared to 49% as of December 31, 2004. During 2005, we 33 Table of Contents received net proceeds of $5.252 billion through issuances of $1.380 billion of preferred equity, $1.025 billion of common equity, and $2.990 billion principal amount of senior notes. We issued 18.7 million shares of common stock in exchange for outstanding shares of our 4.125% and 5.0% (Series 2003) preferred stock and upon conversions of our 6.0% preferred stock. Additionally, we purchased and retired $564.4 million principal amount of outstanding senior notes during 2005. As a result of our debt transactions during 2005, we have extended the average maturity of our long term debt to over 10 years and have lowered our average interest rate to approximately 6.3%. We intend to continue to focus on improving the strength of our balance sheet. We believe our business strategy and operational performance will lead to an investment grade credit rating for our unsecured debt in the future. Our President and Chief Operating Officer, Tom L. Ward, resigned as a director, officer and employee of the company effective February 10, 2006. The Resignation Agreement provides for the immediate vesting of all of Mr. Wards unvested stock options and restricted stock on February 10, 2006. As a result of such vesting, options to purchase 724,615 shares of Chesapeakes common stock at an average exercise price of $8.01 per share and 1,291,875 shares of restricted common stock became immediately vested. As a result, the company expects to incur a non cash after tax charge of approximately $31.8 million in the first quarter 2006. Liquidity and Capital Resources Sources of Liquidity and Uses of Funds Our primary source of liquidity to meet operating expenses and fund capital expenditures (other than for certain acquisitions) is cash flow from operations. Based on our current production, price and expense assumptions, we expect cash flow from operations will exceed our drilling capital expenditures in 2006. Our budget for drilling, land and seismic activities during 2006 is currently between $3.0 billion and $3.2 billion. We believe this level of exploration and development will be sufficient to increase our reserves in 2006 and achieve our goal of a 10% to 20% increase in production over 2005 production (inclusive of acquisitions completed or scheduled to close in 2006 through the filing date of this report but without regard to any additional acquisitions that may be completed in 2006). However, higher drilling and field operating costs, drilling results that alter planned development schedules, acquisitions or other factors could cause us to revise our drilling program, which is largely discretionary. Any cash flow from operations not needed to fund our drilling program will be available for acquisitions, dividends, debt repayment or other general corporate purposes in 2006. Cash provided by operating activities was $2.407 billion in 2005, compared to $1.432 billion in 2004 and $938.9 million in 2003. The $975 million increase from 2004 to 2005 and the $493.1 million increase from 2003 to 2004 were primarily due to higher realized prices and higher volumes of oil and gas production. We expect that 2006 production volumes will be higher than in 2005 and that cash provided by operating activities in 2006 will exceed 2005 levels. While a precipitous decline in gas prices in 2006 would affect the amount of cash flow that would be generated from operations, we have 63% of our expected oil production in 2006 hedged at an average NYMEX price of $61.02 per barrel of oil and 71% (excluding the hedges assumed in the CNR acquisition and certain collars and options) of our expected natural gas production in 2006 hedged at an average NYMEX price of $9.43 per mcf. This level of hedging provides certainty of the cash flow we will receive for a substantial portion of our 2006 production. Depending on changes in oil and gas futures markets and managements view of underlying oil and natural gas supply and demand trends, however, we may increase or decrease our current hedging positions. Based on fluctuations in natural gas and oil prices, our hedging counterparties may require us to deliver cash collateral or other assurances of performance from time to time. At December 31, 2005 and March 10, 2006, we had $50 million of letters of credit securing our performance of hedging contracts. To mitigate the liquidity impact of those collateral requirements, we have negotiated caps on the amount of collateral that we might be required to post with seven of our counterparties. All of our existing commodity hedges that are not under our 34 Table of Contents secured hedge facilities (described below under Contractual Obligations) are with these counterparties and the maximum amount of collateral that we would be required to post with them is no more than $230 million in the aggregate. A significant source of liquidity is our $2.0 billion syndicated revolving bank credit facility which matures in February 2011. At March 10, 2006, there was $1.5 billion of borrowing capacity available under the revolving bank credit facility. We use the facility to fund daily operating activities and acquisitions as needed. We borrowed $5.682 billion and repaid $5.669 billion in 2005, we borrowed $2.160 billion and repaid $2.101 billion in 2004 and we borrowed and repaid $738 million in 2003 under our bank credit facility. We incurred $4.7 million, $2.2 million and $2.5 million of financing costs related to our revolving bank credit facility in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, as a result of amendments to the credit facility agreement. Also during 2005, we repaid the remaining credit facility balance of $96.1 million assumed in the CNR acquisition. We believe that our available cash, cash provided by operating activities and funds available under our revolving bank credit facility will be sufficient to fund our operating, interest and general and administrative expenses, our capital expenditure budget, our short term contractual obligations and dividend payments at current levels for the foreseeable future. The public and institutional markets have been our principal source of long term financing for acquisitions. We have sold debt and equity in both public and private offerings in the past, and we expect that these sources of capital will continue to be available to us in the future for acquisitions. Nevertheless, we caution that ready access to capital on reasonable terms and the availability of desirable acquisition targets at attractive prices are subject to many uncertainties, as explained under Risk Factors in Item 1A.

A prospectus supplement will be prepared at the time of an offering and will contain a description of the security issued, the plan of distribution and other information. We paid dividends on our common stock of $60.5 million, $38.9 million and $27.3 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, and we paid dividends on our preferred stock of $31.5 million, $40.9 million and $20.9 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. We received $21.6 million, $12.0 million and $9.3 million from the exercise of employee and director stock options and warrants in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. We paid $4.0 million and $2.1 million to purchase treasury stock in 2005 and 2003 to fund our matching contributions to our 401(k) make up plan. There were no treasury stock purchases made in 2004. In 2005, we paid $11.6 million to settle derivative liabilities assumed from CNR. 35 Table of Contents Outstanding payments from certain disbursement accounts in excess of funded cash balances where no legal right of set off exists increased by $61.2 million, $88.3 million and $28.3 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. All disbursements are funded on the day they are presented to our bank using available cash on hand or draws on our revolving bank credit facility. Historically, we have used significant funds to redeem or purchase and retire outstanding senior notes issued by Chesapeake.

The following table shows our capital expenditures during these years ($ in millions): 2005 2004 2003 Acquisitions of oil and gas companies, proved and unproved properties, net of cash acquired $ 3,925.5 $ 1,914.7 $ 1,261.3 Exploration and development of oil and gas properties 2,371.9 1,276.3 727.2 Additions to buildings and other fixed assets 417.5 126.7 71.5 Additions to investments 135.0 37.0 30.8 Additions to drilling equipment 66.8 23.1 1.2 Deposits for acquisitions 35.0 16.3 13.3 Total $ 6,951.7 $ 3,394.1 $ 2,105.3 Through divestitures of oil and gas properties, we received $9.8 million in 2005, $12.0 million in 2004 and $22.2 million, in 2003. Sales of other assets and investments in securities of other companies provided $20.4 million, $0.9 million and $5.8 million of cash in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Our accounts receivable are primarily from purchasers of oil and natural gas ($615.4 million at December 31, 2005) and exploration and production companies which own interests in properties we operate ($84.8 million at December 31, 2005). This industry concentration has the potential to impact our overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively, in that our customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic, industry or other conditions. We generally require letters of credit for receivables from customers which are judged to have sub standard credit, unless the credit risk can otherwise be mitigated. Our liquidity is not dependent on the use of off balance sheet financing arrangements, such as the securitization of receivables or obtaining access to assets through special purpose entities. We have not relied on off balance sheet financing arrangements in the past and we do not intend to rely on such arrangements in the future as a source of liquidity. We are not a commercial paper issuer.

(d) In 2005, we paid the remaining $57 million of the purchase price related to an acquisition transaction with Hallwood Energy Corporation in the fourth quarter of 2004. 37 Table of Contents During 2004 and continuing in 2005, we have taken several steps to improve our capital structure. These transactions enabled us to extend our average maturity of long term debt to over ten years with an average interest rate of approximately 6.3%. Maintaining a debt to total capitalization ratio below 50% and reducing debt per mcfe of proved reserves remain key goals of our business strategy. We completed the following significant financing transactions in 2005: First Quarter 2005 Amended our revolving bank credit facility to increase the committed borrowing base to $1.25 billion and extended the maturity of the facility to January 2010. Completed a private purchase of $11.0 million of our 8.375% Senior Notes due 2008 for $12.0 million (including a premium of $0.8 million). Second Quarter 2005 Completed private offerings of $600 million principal amount of 6.625% Senior Notes due 2016 and 4,600,000 shares of 5.0% cumulative convertible preferred stock having a liquidation preference of $100 per share. Net proceeds of approximately $1.032 billion from these transactions were used to finance acquisitions totaling $459 million that closed in the second quarter of 2005 and to repay debt incurred under our revolving bank credit facility to temporarily finance the BRG and the Laredo acquisitions completed in the first quarter. Completed a private placement of $600 million of 6.25% Senior Notes due 2018. Net proceeds of approximately $596.4 million were used to fund our purchases in June 2005 of $237.8 million of our 8.125% Senior Notes due 2011 for $255.3 million (including a premium of $16.8 million and transaction costs of $0.7 million) and $298.9 million of our 9.0% Senior Notes due 2012 for $341.0 million (including a premium of $41.3 million and transaction costs of $0.8 million) pursuant to tender offers for the 8.125% and 9.0% Senior Notes. Completed a private exchange of 45,000 shares of our outstanding 4.125% cumulative convertible preferred stock for 2,911,250 shares of common stock. No cash was received or paid in connection with this transaction. Third Quarter 2005 Completed cash tender offers for our 8.125% Senior Notes due 2011 and 9.0% Senior Notes due 2012. Approximately $0.3 million was used to purchase $0.1 million of 8.125% Senior Notes due 2011 and $0.2 million of 9.0% Senior Notes due 2012. Together with the amounts acquired in June 2005, we acquired a total of $237.9 million principal amount of 8.125% Senior Notes due 2011 and $299.1 million principal amount of 9.0% Senior Notes due 2012, representing 96.9% and 99.7%, respectively, of the amounts outstanding, in the tender offers, which expired on July 6, 2005. We redeemed the remaining $7.5 million of 8.125% and $0.9 million of 9.0% Senior Notes for $9.1 million (including a premium of $0.6 million) on August 17, 2005 based on the make whole redemption provisions in the indentures. Completed a number of transactions whereby we exchanged 133,675 shares of our 4.125% cumulative convertible preferred stock for 8,529,758 shares of our common stock. No cash was received or paid in connection with these transactions. Completed a number of transactions whereby we exchanged 697,724 shares of our 5.0% (Series 2003) cumulative convertible preferred stock for 4,354,439 shares of our common stock.

Net proceeds from both offerings of approximately $624.6 million were used to repay amounts outstanding under our revolving bank credit facility which resulted from acquisitions completed in the third quarter. Fourth Quarter 2005 Completed private offerings of $500 million of 6.875% Senior Notes due 2020, $690 million of 2.75% Contingent Convertible Senior Notes due 2035 and 5,750,000 shares of 5.00% cumulative convertible preferred stock having a liquidation preference of $100 per share. Net proceeds of approximately $1.718 billion along with cash on hand and borrowings under our credit facility were used to fund the CNR acquisition. Completed a public offering of 23 million shares of common stock at $31.46 per share. Net proceeds of approximately $696.4 million were used to repay outstanding borrowings under our revolving bank credit facility which were incurred to temporarily finance the CNR acquisition. Completed a number of transactions whereby we exchanged 45,515 shares of our 4.125% cumulative convertible preferred stock for 2,880,873 shares of our common stock. No cash was received or paid in connection with these transactions. Completed an exchange of 1,330 shares of 5.0% (Series 2003) cumulative convertible preferred stock for 8,281 shares of common stock. No cash was received or paid in connection with these transactions. Contractual Obligations We currently have a $2.0 billion syndicated revolving bank credit facility which matures in February 2011. The credit facility was increased from $1.25 billion to $2.0 billion in February 2006. As of December 31, 2005, we had $72.0 million of outstanding borrowings under this facility and had utilized $53.0 million of the facility for various letters of credit. Borrowings under the facility are collateralized by certain producing oil and natural gas properties and bear interest at either (i) the greater of the reference rate of Union Bank of California, N.A., or the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50% or (ii) London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), at our option, plus a margin that varies from 0.875% to 1.50% according to our senior unsecured long term debt ratings. The collateral value and borrowing base are redetermined periodically. The unused portion of the facility is subject to an annual commitment fee that also varies from 0.125% to 0.30% according to our senior unsecured long term debt ratings. Currently the annual commitment fee is 0.25%. Interest is payable quarterly or, if LIBOR applies, it may be payable at more frequent intervals. The credit facility agreement contains various covenants and restrictive provisions which limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness, purchase or redeem our capital stock, make investments or loans, and create liens. The credit facility agreement requires us to maintain an indebtedness to total capitalization ratio (as defined) not to exceed 0.65 to 1 and an indebtedness to EBITDA ratio (as defined) not to exceed 3.5 to 1. At December 31, 2005, our indebtedness to total capitalization ratio was 0.48 to 1 and our indebtedness to EBITDA ratio was 2.34 to 1. If we should fail to perform our obligations under these and other covenants, the revolving credit commitment could be terminated and any outstanding borrowings under the facility could be declared immediately due and payable. Such acceleration, if involving a principal amount of $10 million ($50 million in the case of our senior notes issued after 2004), would constitute an event of default under our senior note indentures which could in turn result in the acceleration of a significant portion of our senior note indebtedness. The credit facility agreement also has cross default provisions that apply to other indebtedness we may have with an outstanding principal amount in excess of $75 million. Some of our commodity price and financial risk management arrangements require us to deliver cash collateral or other assurances of performance to the counterparties in the event that our payment obligations exceed certain levels. As of December 31, 2005, we were required to post $50 million of collateral in the form of 39 Table of Contents letters of credit with respect to such derivative transactions. These collateral requirements were $50 million as of March 10, 2005. Future collateral requirements are uncertain and will depend on arrangements with our counterparties and fluctuations in natural gas and oil prices and interest rates. We currently have arrangements with five of our counterparties, with which we have outstanding transactions, that limit the amount of collateral that we would be required to post with them to no more than $230 million in the aggregate. We have two secured hedging facilities, each of which permits us to enter into cash settled natural gas and oil commodity transactions, valued by the counterparty, for up to $500 million. The scheduled maturity date for these facilities is May 2010. Outstanding transactions under each facility are collateralized by certain of our oil and natural gas properties that do not secure any of our other obligations. One of the hedging facilities is subject to an annual fee of 0.30% of the maximum total capacity and each of them has a 1.0% exposure fee, which is assessed quarterly on the average of the daily negative fair market value amounts, if any, during the quarter. As of December 31, 2005, the fair market value of the natural gas and oil hedging transactions was a liability of $92.9 million under one of the facilities and a liability of $10.9 million under the other facility. As of March 10, 2006, the fair market value of the same transactions was an asset of approximately $100 million and $400 million, respectively. The hedging facilities contain the standard representations and default provisions that are typical of such agreements. The agreements also contain various restrictive provisions which govern the aggregate gas and oil production volumes that we are permitted to hedge under all of our agreements at any one time. Two of our subsidiaries, Chesapeake Exploration Limited Partnership and Chesapeake Appalachia, L.L.C., are the borrowers under our revolving bank credit facility and Chesapeake Exploration Limited Partnership is the named party to our hedging facilities. The facilities are guaranteed by Chesapeake and all its other wholly owned domestic subsidiaries. Our revolving bank credit facility and secured hedge facilities do not contain material adverse change or adequate assurance covenants. Although the applicable interest rates and commitment fees in our bank credit facility fluctuate slightly based on our long term senior unsecured credit ratings, the bank facility and the secured hedge facilities do not contain provisions which would trigger an acceleration of amounts due under the facilities or a requirement to post additional collateral in the event of a downgrade of our credit ratings. In addition to outstanding revolving bank credit facility borrowings discussed above, as of December 31, 2005, senior notes represented approximately $5.4 billion of our long term debt and consisted of the following ($ in thousands): 7.5% Senior Notes due 2013 $ 363,823 7.0% Senior Notes due 2014 300,000 7.5% Senior Notes due 2014 300,000 7.75% Senior Notes due 2015 300,408 6.375% Senior Notes due 2015 600,000 6.625% Senior Notes due 2016 600,000 6.875% Senior Notes due 2016 670,437 6.5% Senior Notes due 2017 600,000 6.25% Senior Notes due 2018 600,000 6.875% Senior Notes due 2020 500,000 2.75% Contingent Convertible Senior Notes due 2035 690,000 Discount on senior notes (95,577 ) Discount for interest rate derivatives (11,349 ) $ 5,417,742 No scheduled principal payments are required on any of the senior notes until 2013, when $363.8 million is due. The holders of the 2.75% Contingent Convertible Senior Notes due 2035 may require us to repurchase all or a portion of these notes on November 15, 2015, 2020, 2025 and 2030 at 100% of the principal amount of the notes. 40 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2005 and currently, debt ratings for the senior notes are Ba2 by Moodys Investor Service (stable outlook), BB by Standard & Poors Ratings Services (stable outlook) and BB by Fitch Ratings (stable outlook). Our senior notes are unsecured senior obligations of Chesapeake and rank equally with all of our other unsecured indebtedness. All of our wholly owned domestic subsidiaries guarantee the notes. The indentures (other than the indentures issued after June 2005) contain covenants limiting our ability and our restricted subsidiaries ability to incur additional indebtedness; pay dividends on our capital stock or redeem, repurchase or retire our capital stock or subordinated indebtedness; make investments and other restricted payments; incur liens; engage in transactions with affiliates; sell assets; and consolidate, merge or transfer assets. The debt incurrence covenants do not presently restrict our ability to borrow under or expand our secured credit facility. As of December 31, 2005, we estimate that secured commercial bank indebtedness of approximately $3.6 billion could have been incurred under the most restrictive indenture covenant. The table below summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2005 ($ in thousands) Payments Due By Period Contractual Obligations Total Less than 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years More than 5 years Long term debt obligations $ 5,596,668 $ $ $ $ 5,596,668 Capital lease obligations 8,979 3,370 4,219 1,390 Operating lease obligations 13,759 4,124 6,310 2,623 702 Purchase obligations (a) 662,551 387,290 167,375 12,419 95,467 Standby letters of credit 57,609 57,609 Other long term obligations Total contractual cash obligations $ 6,339,566 $ 452,393 $ 177,904 $ 16,432 $ 5,692,837 (a) See Note 4 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for discussion regarding transportation and drilling contract commitments. Hedging Activities Oil and Gas Hedging Activities Our results of operations and operating cash flows are impacted by changes in market prices for oil and gas. To mitigate a portion of the exposure to adverse market changes, we have entered into various derivative instruments. Executive management is involved in all risk management activities and the Board of Directors reviews the companys hedging program at every Board meeting. We believe we have sufficient internal controls to prevent unauthorized hedging. As of December 31, 2005, our oil and gas derivative instruments were comprised of swaps, cap swaps, basis protection swaps, call options and collars. Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk contains a description of each of these instruments. Although derivatives often fail to achieve 100% effectiveness for accounting purposes, we believe our derivative instruments continue to be highly effective in achieving the risk management objectives for which they were intended. Hedging allows us to predict with greater certainty the effective prices we will receive for our hedged oil and gas production. We closely monitor the fair value of our hedging contracts and may elect to settle a contract prior to its scheduled maturity date in order to lock in a gain or loss. Commodity markets are volatile, and Chesapeakes hedging activity is dynamic. Mark to market positions under oil and gas hedging contracts fluctuate with commodity prices. As described above under Contractual Obligations, we may be required to deliver cash collateral or other assurances of performance if our payment obligations to our hedging counterparties exceed levels stated in our contracts. 41 Table of Contents Realized gains and losses from our oil and gas derivatives resulted in a net decrease in oil and gas sales of $401.7 million, or $0.86, per mcfe in 2005, a net decrease of $154.9 million, or $0.43, per mcfe in 2004 and a net decrease of $17.4 million, or $0.06, per mcfe in 2003. Oil and gas sales also include changes in the fair value of oil and gas derivatives that do not qualify as cash flow hedges under SFAS 133, as well as gains (losses) on ineffectiveness of instruments designated as cash flow hedges. Unrealized gains (losses) included in oil and gas sales in 2005, 2004 and 2003 were $41.1 million, $40.9 million and $10.5 million, respectively. Included in these unrealized gains (losses) are gains (losses) on ineffectiveness of cash flow hedges of ($76.3) million in 2005, ($8.2) million in 2004 and ($9.2) million in 2003. Changes in the fair value of oil and gas derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, to the extent effective in offsetting cash flows attributable to the hedged commodities, and locked in gains and losses of derivative contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income until being transferred to earnings in the month of related production. These unrealized losses, net of related tax effects, totaled $270.7 million, $4.4 million and $20.3 million as of December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. Based upon the market prices at December 31, 2005, we expect to transfer to earnings approximately $153.8 million of the loss included in the balance of accumulated other comprehensive income during the next 12 months when the transactions actually occur. A detailed explanation of accounting for oil and gas derivatives under SFAS 133 appears under Application of Critical Accounting Policies Hedging elsewhere in this Item 7. The fair values of our oil and gas derivative instruments are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as assets or liabilities. The estimated fair values of our oil and gas derivative instruments (including derivatives acquired from CNR) as of December 31, 2005 and 2004 are provided below: December 31, 2005 2004 ($ in thousands) Derivative assets (liabilities): Fixed price gas swaps $ (1,047,094 ) $ 57,073 Gas basis protection swaps 307,308 122,287 Fixed price gas cap swaps (161,056 ) (48,761 ) Fixed price gas counter swaps 37,785 4,654 Gas call options (a) (21,461 ) (5,793 ) Fixed price gas collars (9,374 ) (5,573 ) Fixed price gas locked swaps (34,229 ) (77,299 ) Floating price gas swaps 2,607 Fixed price oil swaps (16,936 ) Fixed price oil cap swaps (3,364 ) (8,238 ) Estimated fair value $ (945,814 ) $ 38,350 (a) After adjusting for the remaining $23.0 million and $3.2 million premium paid to Chesapeake by the counterparty, the cumulative unrealized loss related to these call options as of December 31, 2005 and 2004 was $1.6 million and $2.6 million, respectively. 42 Table of Contents Additional information concerning changes in the fair value of our oil and gas derivative instruments is as follows: December 31, 2005 2004 2003 ($ in thousands) Fair value of contracts outstanding, as of January 1 $ 38,350 $ (44,988 ) $ (14,533 ) Change in fair value of contracts during the period (771,076 ) (69,927 ) (31,078 ) Contracts realized or otherwise settled during the period 401,684 154,901 17,389 Fair value of new contracts when entered into during the period (614,772 ) (5,369 ) (16,766 ) Fair value of contracts when closed during the period 3,733 Fair value of contracts outstanding, as of December 31 $ (945,814 ) $ 38,350 $ (44,988 ) Interest Rate Derivatives We use interest rate derivatives to mitigate our exposure to the volatility in interest rates. For interest rate derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges (in accordance with SFAS 133), changes in fair value of interest rate derivatives are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as assets (liabilities) and the debts carrying value amount is adjusted by the change in the fair value of the debt subsequent to the initiation of the derivative. Any resulting differences are recorded currently as ineffectiveness in the consolidated statements of operations as an adjustment to interest expense. Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments not qualifying as fair value hedges are recorded currently as adjustments to interest expense. As of December 31, 2005, the following interest rate swaps were used to convert a portion of our long term fixed rate debt to floating rate debt were outstanding: Term Notional Amount Fixed Rate Floating Rate Fair Value Gain (Loss) ($ in thousands) September 2004 August 2012 $ 75,000,000 9.000 % 6 month LIBOR plus 452 basis points $ (2,734 ) July 2005 January 2015 $ 150,000,000 7.750 % 6 month LIBOR plus 289 basis points $ (5,133 ) July 2005 June 2014 $ 150,000,000 7.500 % 6 month LIBOR plus 282 basis points $ (5,327 ) September 2005 August 2014 $ 250,000,000 7.000 % 6 month LIBOR plus 205.5 basis points $ (5,004 ) October 2005 June 2015 $ 200,000,000 6.375 % 6 month LIBOR plus 112 basis points $ (1,344 ) October 2005 January 2018 $ 250,000,000 6.250 % 6 month LIBOR plus 99 basis points $ (3,240 ) October 2005 January 2016 $ 200,000,000 6.625 % 6 month LIBOR plus 129 basis points $ 282 In January 2006, we closed the interest rate swap on our 6.625% Senior Notes for $1.0 million. Subsequent to December 31, 2005, we entered into the following interest rate swaps (which qualify as fair value hedges) to convert a portion of our long term fixed rate debt to floating rate debt: Term Notional Amount Fixed Rate Floating Rate January 2006 January 2016 $ 250,000,000 6.625 % 6 month LIBOR plus 129 basis points March 2006 January 2016 $ 250,000,000 6.875 % 6 month LIBOR plus 120 basis points March 2006 August 2017 $ 250,000,000 6.500 % 6 month LIBOR plus 125.5 basis points In 2005, we closed various interest rate swaps for gains totaling $7.1 million. These interest rate swaps were designated as fair value hedges, and the settlement amounts received will be amortized as a reduction to realized interest expense over the remaining terms of the related senior notes. In March 2004, Chesapeake entered into an interest rate swap which required Chesapeake to pay a fixed rate of 8.68% while the counterparty paid Chesapeake a floating rate of six month LIBOR plus 0.75% on a notional amount of $142.7 million. On March 15, 2005, we elected to terminate the interest rate swap and paid $31.8 million to the counterparty. 43 Table of Contents Results of Operations General. For the year ended December 31, 2005, Chesapeake had net income of $948.3 million, or $2.51 per diluted common share, on total revenues of $4.665 billion. This compares to net income of $515.2 million, or $1.53 per diluted common share, on total revenues of $2.709 billion during the year ended December 31, 2004, and net income of $313.0 million, or $1.21 per diluted common share, on total revenues of $1.717 billion during the year ended December 31, 2003. The 2005 net income includes, on a pre tax basis, a $70.4 million loss on repurchased debt and $42.7 million in net unrealized gains on oil and gas and interest rate derivatives. The 2004 net income includes, on a pre tax basis, a $24.6 million loss on repurchased debt, a $4.5 million provision for legal settlements and $35.5 million in net unrealized gains on oil and gas and interest rate derivatives. The 2003 net income includes, on a pre tax basis, a $20.8 million loss on repurchased debt, a $6.4 million provision for legal settlements, $4.0 million in net unrealized losses on oil and gas and interest rate derivatives, and a $2.0 million impairment of our investment in Seven Seas Petroleum Inc. Oil and Gas Sales. During 2005, oil and gas sales were $3.273 billion compared to $1.936 billion in 2004 and $1.297 billion in 2003. In 2005, Chesapeake produced and sold 468.6 bcfe at a weighted average price of $6.90 per mcfe, compared to 362.6 bcfe in 2004 at a weighted average price of $5.23 per mcfe, and 268.4 bcfe in 2003 at a weighted average price of $4.79 per mcfe (weighted average prices for all years discussed exclude the effect of unrealized gains or (losses) on derivatives of $41.1 million, $40.9 million and $10.5 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively). The increase in prices in 2005 resulted in an increase in revenue of $782 million and increased production resulted in a $554 million increase, for a total increase in revenues of $1.336 billion (excluding unrealized gains or losses on oil and gas derivatives). The increase in production from period to period was due to the combination of production growth from drilling as well as acquisitions completed during those periods. For 2005, we realized an average price per barrel of oil of $47.77, compared to $28.33 in 2004 and $25.85 in 2003 (weighted average prices for all years discussed exclude the effect of unrealized gains or losses on derivatives). Natural gas prices realized per mcf (excluding unrealized gains or losses on derivatives) were $6.78, $5.29 and $4.85 in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Realized gains or losses from our oil and gas derivatives resulted in a net decrease in oil and gas revenues of $401.7 million or $0.86 per mcfe in 2005, a net decrease of $154.9 million or $0.43 per mcfe in 2004 and a net decrease of $17.4 million or $0.06 per mcfe in 2003. A change in oil and gas prices has a significant impact on our oil and gas revenues and cash flows. Assuming 2005 production levels, a change of $0.10 per mcf of gas sold would result in an increase or decrease in revenues and cash flow of approximately $42.2 million and $39.5 million, respectively, and a change of $1.00 per barrel of oil sold would result in an increase or decrease in revenues and cash flow of approximately $7.7 million and $7.2 million, respectively, without considering the effect of hedging activities. The following table shows our production by region for 2005, 2004 and 2003: Years Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Mmcfe Percent Mmcfe Percent Mmcfe Percent Mid Continent 297,773 64 % 268,459 74 % 233,559 87 % South Texas and Texas Gulf Coast 63,852 13 42,427 12 15,546 6 Ark La Tex and Barnett Shale 58,116 12 19,640 5 7,776 3 Permian 40,207 9 29,468 8 8,496 3 Appalachia 5,878 1 Other 2,751 1 2,599 1 2,979 1 Total Production 468,577 100 % 362,593 100 % 268,356 100 % 44 Table of Contents Natural gas production represented approximately 90% of our total production volume on an equivalent basis in 2005, compared to 89% in 2004 and 90% in 2003. Oil and Gas Marketing Sales. Chesapeake realized $1.393 billion in oil and gas marketing sales to third parties in 2005, with corresponding oil and gas marketing expenses of $1.358 billion, for a net margin of $35 million. Marketing activities are substantially for third parties who are owners in Chesapeake operated wells. This compares to sales of $773 million and $421 million, expenses of $755 million and $410 million, and margins of $18 million and $11 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively. In 2005 and 2004, Chesapeake realized an increase in volumes and prices related to oil and gas marketing sales as compared to the previous year. Production Expenses. Production expenses, which include lifting costs and ad valorem taxes, were $317.0 million in 2005, compared to $204.8 million and $137.6 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively. On a unit of production basis, production expenses were $0.68 per mcfe in 2005 compared to $0.56 and $0.51 per mcfe in 2004 and 2003, respectively. The increase in 2005 was primarily due to higher third party field service costs, energy costs and personnel costs. We expect that production expenses per mcfe produced for 2006 will range from $0.77 to $0.82. Production Taxes. Production taxes were $207.9 million in 2005 compared to $103.9 million in 2004 and $77.9 million in 2003. On a unit of production basis, production taxes were $0.44 per mcfe in 2005 compared to $0.29 per mcfe in both 2004 and 2003. The $104.0 million increase in production taxes in 2005 is due primarily to approximately 106.0 bcfe of increased production and the increase of $2.10 per mcfe in sales price (excluding gains or losses on derivatives). Included in 2004 is a credit of $6.8 million, or $0.02 per mcfe, related to certain Oklahoma severance tax abatements for the period July 2003 through December 2003. In April 2004, the Oklahoma Tax Commission concluded that a pre determined oil and gas price cap for 2003 sales had not been exceeded (on a statewide basis) and notified the company that it was eligible to receive certain severance tax abatements for the period from July 1, 2003 through June 30, 2004. The company had previously estimated that the average oil and gas sales prices in Oklahoma (on a statewide basis) could exceed the price cap, and did not reflect the benefit from these potential severance tax abatements until the first quarter of 2004. In general, production taxes are calculated using value based formulas that produce higher per unit costs when oil and gas prices are higher. We expect production taxes per mcfe to range from $0.41 to $0.46 during 2006 based on NYMEX prices of $54.00 per barrel of oil and natural gas wellhead prices ranging from $7.50 to $8.50 per mcfe produced. General and Administrative Expense. General and administrative expenses, which are net of internal payroll and non payroll costs capitalized in our oil and gas properties (see Note 11 of notes to consolidated financial statements), were $64.3 million in 2005, $37.0 million in 2004 and $23.8 million in 2003. General and administrative expenses were $0.14, $0.10 and $0.09 per mcfe for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The increase in 2005 and 2004 was the result of the companys overall growth. This growth has resulted in a substantial increase in employees and related costs. Included in general and administrative expenses is stock based compensation of $15.3 million in 2005, $4.8 million in 2004 and $0.9 million in 2003. During 2005, 3.9 million shares of restricted stock, net of forfeitures, were granted to employees. The cost of all outstanding restricted shares is amortized over a four year period which resulted in the recognition of $23.3 million of stock based compensation costs during 2005. Of this amount, $12.6 million was reflected in general and administrative expense, and the remaining $10.7 million was capitalized to oil and gas properties. Chesapeake did not issue restricted stock awards prior to 2004. Additionally, we recognized $3.9 million, $0.6 million and $0.9 million in stock based compensation expense in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, as a result of modifications made to previously issued stock options. Of the $3.9 million recognized in 2005, $1.2 million was capitalized to oil and gas properties. Stock based compensation was $0.03 per mcfe for 2005 and $0.01 per mcfe for 2004. We anticipate that general and administrative expenses for 2006 will be between $0.22 and $0.26 per mcfe produced including stock based compensation ranging from $0.08 and $0.10 per mcfe produced. 45 Table of Contents Chesapeake follows the full cost method of accounting under which all costs associated with property acquisition, exploration and development activities are capitalized. We capitalize internal costs that can be directly identified with our acquisition, exploration and development activities and do not include any costs related to production, general corporate overhead or similar activities. We capitalized $102.2 million, $51.7 million and $35.5 million of internal costs (excluding stock based compensation) in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, directly related to our oil and gas property acquisition, exploration and development efforts. Provision for Legal Settlements. In 2004, we recorded a provision for legal settlement of $4.5 million related to various litigation incidental to our business operations. In 2003, we recorded a $6.4 million provision related to the settlement of a class action lawsuit with certain Oklahoma royalty owners. Oil and Gas Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization. Depreciation, depletion and amortization of oil and gas properties was $894.0 million, $582.1 million and $369.5 million during 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The average DD&A rate per mcfe, which is a function of capitalized costs, future development costs, and the related underlying reserves in the periods presented, was $1.91, $1.61 and $1.38 in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The increase in the average rate from $1.61 in 2004 to $1.91 in 2005 is primarily the result of higher drilling costs, higher costs associated with acquisitions and the recognition of the tax effect of acquisition costs in excess of tax basis acquired in certain corporate acquisitions. We expect the 2006 DD&A rate to be between $2.15 and $2.20 per mcfe produced. Depreciation and Amortization of Other Assets. Depreciation and amortization of other assets was $51.0 million in 2005, compared to $29.2 million in 2004 and $16.8 million in 2003. The increase in 2005 and 2004 was primarily the result of higher depreciation costs resulting from the acquisition of various gathering facilities, compression equipment, construction of new buildings at our corporate headquarters complex and at various field office locations and the purchase of additional information technology equipment and software in 2005 and 2004. Property and equipment costs are depreciated on a straight line basis. Buildings are depreciated over 15 to 39 years, gathering facilities are depreciated over seven to 20 years, drilling rigs are depreciated over 15 years and all other property and equipment are depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from two to seven years. To the extent drilling rigs are used to drill our wells, a substantial portion of the depreciation is capitalized in oil and gas properties as exploration or development costs. We expect 2006 depreciation and amortization of other assets to be between $0.14 and $0.16 per mcfe produced. Interest and Other Income. Interest and other income was $10.5 million, $4.5 million and $2.8 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The 2005 income consisted of $3.0 million of interest income, $1.8 million of income related to equity investments, and $5.7 million of miscellaneous income. The 2004 income consisted of $2.1 million of interest income, $0.8 million of income related to earnings on investments, and $1.6 million of miscellaneous income. The 2003 income consisted of $1.0 million of interest income, a $0.4 million loss related to an equity investment, a $0.6 million gain on the final settlement of the sale of our Canadian subsidiary and $1.6 million of miscellaneous income. Interest Expense. Interest expense increased to $219.8 million in 2005 compared to $167.3 million in 2004 and $154.4 million in 2003 as follows: Years Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 ($ in millions) Interest expense on senior notes and revolving bank credit facility $ 299.6 $ 194.5 $ 163.2 Capitalized interest (79.0 ) (36.2 ) (13.0 ) Amortization of loan discount 5.7 4.5 1.6 Unrealized (gain) loss on interest rate derivatives (1.6 ) 5.3 6.5 Realized gain on interest rate derivatives (4.9 ) (0.8 ) (3.9 ) Total interest expense $ 219.8 $ 167.3 $ 154.4 Average long term borrowings $ 3,948 $ 2,428 $ 1,932 46 Table of Contents We use interest rate derivatives to mitigate our exposure to the volatility in interest rates. For interest rate derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges (in accordance with SFAS 133), changes in fair value of interest rate derivatives are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as assets (liabilities) and the debts carrying value amount is adjusted by the change in the fair value of the debt subsequent to the initiation of the derivative. Any resulting differences are recorded currently as ineffectiveness in the consolidated statements of operations as an adjustment to interest expense. Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments not qualifying as fair value hedges are recorded currently as adjustments to interest expense. A detailed explanation of our interest rate derivative activity appears below in Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Interest expense, excluding unrealized (gains) losses on derivatives and net of amounts capitalized, was $0.47 per mcfe in 2005 compared to $0.45 per mcfe in 2004 and $0.55 per mcfe in 2003. We expect interest expense for 2006 to be between $0.52 and $0.57 per mcfe produced (before considering the effect of interest rate derivatives). Loss on Investment in Seven Seas. In 2003, we reduced the carrying value of our 2001 investment in securities of Seven Seas Petroleum Inc. to zero by recording an impairment of $2.0 million. We recovered approximately $5.5 million on this investment in 2003 and recorded an impairment of $17.2 million in 2002. Loss on Repurchases or Exchanges of Debt. During the past three years we have repurchased or exchanged Chesapeake debt and incurred losses in connection with these transactions. We entered into these transactions in order to re finance a portion of our long term debt at a lower rate of interest. The following table shows the losses related to these transactions for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively ($ in millions): Notes Retired Loss on Repurchases/Exchanges For the Year Ended December 31, 2005: Premium Other (a) Total 8.375% Senior Notes due 2008 $ 19.0 $ 1.2 $ 0.1 $ 1.3 8.125% Senior Notes due 2011 245.4 17.3 4.4 21.7 9.0% Senior Notes due 2012 300.0 41.4 6.0 47.4 $ 564.4 $ 59.9 $ 10.5 $ 70.4 For the Year Ended December 31, 2004: 8.375% Senior Notes due 2008 $ 190.8 $ 16.1 $ 1.5 $ 17.6 8.5% Senior Notes due 2012 4.3 0.2 0.7 0.9 8.125% Senior Notes due 2011 482.8 6.0 6.0 $ 677.9 $ 16.3 $ 8.2 $ 24.5 For the Year Ended December 31, 2003: 8.5% Senior Notes due 2012 $ 106.4 $ 6.7 $ 14.1 (b) $ 20.8 (a) Includes write offs of discounts, deferred charges and interest rate derivatives associated with notes retired and transaction costs. (b) Includes a $12.0 million loss that was recognized based on the hedging relationship between the notes and an associated interest rate derivative. Income Tax Expense. Chesapeake recorded income tax expense of $545.1 million in 2005 compared to income tax expense of $289.8 million in 2004 and $191.8 million in 2003. Our effective income tax rate was 36.5% in 2005 compared to 36% in 2004 and 38% in 2003. The increase in 2005 reflected the impact state income taxes and permanent differences had on our overall effective rate. Our effective income tax rate will increase to 38% in 2006 to reflect our current assessment of expected increases in state income taxes and permanent differences. During 2003 and 2001, we determined that it was more likely than not that $4.4 million and $2.4 million, respectively, of the deferred tax assets related to Louisiana net operating losses would not be realized and we recorded a valuation allowance equal to such amounts during those years. In 2004, we acquired Louisiana oil and gas properties which resulted in us determining that it was more likely than not that the 47 Table of Contents $6.8 million of deferred tax assets related to Louisiana net operating losses would be realized. Therefore, the $6.8 million valuation allowance was reversed at December 31, 2004 as part of the recording of the purchase of these assets. All 2005 income tax expense was deferred, and we expect most, if not all, of our 2006 income tax expense to be deferred. Cumulative Effect of Accounting Change. Effective January 1, 2003, Chesapeake adopted SFAS No. 143, Accounting For Asset Retirement Obligation. Upon adoption of SFAS 143 in 2003, we recorded the discounted fair value of our expected future obligations of $30.5 million, a cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle, as an increase to earnings of $2.4 million (net of income taxes) and an increase in net oil and gas properties of $34.3 million. Loss on Conversion/Exchange of Preferred Stock. Loss on conversion/exchange of preferred stock was $26.9 million in 2005 compared to $36.7 million in 2004. The 2005 loss was the result of private exchanges of $224.2 million of our 4.125% cumulative convertible preferred stock for 14.3 million shares of common stock and private exchanges of $69.9 million of our 5.0% (Series 2003) cumulative convertible preferred stock for 4.4 million shares of common stock. The 2004 loss was the result of a private exchange of $30.0 million of our 6.0% cumulative convertible preferred stock for 3.2 million shares of common stock and a public exchange of $194.8 million of our 6.0% cumulative convertible preferred stock for 20.8 million shares of common stock. The loss on the exchanges represented the excess of the fair value of the common stock issued over the fair value of the securities issuable pursuant to the original conversion terms. We also incurred $1.2 million in transaction costs related to the public exchange. Application of Critical Accounting Policies Readers of this report and users of the information contained in it should be aware of how certain events may impact our financial results based on the accounting policies in place. The four policies we consider to be the most significant are discussed below. The companys management has discussed each critical accounting policy with the audit committee of the companys board of directors. The selection and application of accounting policies is an important process that changes as our business changes and as accounting rules are developed. Accounting rules generally do not involve a selection among alternatives, but involve an implementation and interpretation of existing rules and the use of judgment to the specific set of circumstances existing in our business. Hedging. Chesapeake uses commodity price and financial risk management instruments to mitigate our exposure to price fluctuations in oil and natural gas and interest rates. Recognized gains and losses on derivative contracts are reported as a component of the related transaction. Results of oil and gas derivative transactions are reflected in oil and gas sales, and results of interest rate hedging transactions are reflected in interest expense. The changes in the fair value of derivative instruments not qualifying for designation as either cash flow or fair value hedges that occur prior to maturity are reported currently in the consolidated statement of operations as unrealized gains (losses) within oil and gas sales or interest expense. Cash flows from derivative instruments are classified in the same category within the statement of cash flows as the items being hedged, or on a basis consistent with the nature of the instruments. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that derivative instruments (including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts) be recorded at fair value and included in the consolidated balance sheet as assets or liabilities. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation, which is established at the inception of a derivative. For derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, changes in fair value, to the extent the hedge is effective, are recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. Any change in the fair value resulting from ineffectiveness, as defined by SFAS 133, is recognized immediately in oil and gas sales. For derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges (in accordance with SFAS 133), 48 Table of Contents changes in fair value, as well as the offsetting changes in the estimated fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, are recognized currently in earnings. Differences between the changes in the fair values of the hedged item and the derivative instrument, if any, represent gains or losses on ineffectiveness and are reflected currently in interest expense. Hedge effectiveness is measured at least quarterly based on the relative changes in fair value between the derivative contract and the hedged item over time. Changes in fair value of contracts that do not qualify as hedges or are not designated as hedges are also recognized currently in earnings. See Hedging Activities above and Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk for additional information regarding our hedging activities. One of the primary factors that can have an impact on our results of operations is the method used to value our derivatives. We have established the fair value of all derivative instruments using estimates determined by our counterparties and subsequently confirmed the fair values internally using established index prices and other sources. These values are based upon, among other things, futures prices, volatility, time to maturity and credit risk. The values we report in our financial statements change as these estimates are revised to reflect actual results, changes in market conditions or other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Another factor that can impact our results of operations each period is our ability to estimate the level of correlation between future changes in the fair value of the hedge instruments and the transactions being hedged, both at the inception and on an ongoing basis. This correlation is complicated since energy commodity prices, the primary risk we hedge, have quality and location differences that can be difficult to hedge effectively. The factors underlying our estimates of fair value and our assessment of correlation of our hedging derivatives are impacted by actual results and changes in conditions that affect these factors, many of which are beyond our control. Due to the volatility of oil and natural gas prices and, to a lesser extent, interest rates, the companys financial condition and results of operations can be significantly impacted by changes in the market value of our derivative instruments. As of December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, the net market value of our derivatives was a liability of $968.3 million, an asset of $2.5 million and a liability of $75.4 million, respectively. The derivatives that we acquired in our CNR acquisition represented $661.4 million of the liability at December 31, 2005. With respect to our derivatives held as of December 31, 2005, an increase or decrease in natural gas prices of $0.10 per mmbtu would decrease or increase the estimated fair value of our derivatives by approximately $136 million. An increase or decrease in crude oil prices of $1.00 per barrel would decrease or increase the estimated fair value of our derivatives by approximately $8 million. Oil and Gas Properties. The accounting for our business is subject to special accounting rules that are unique to the oil and gas industry. There are two allowable methods of accounting for oil and gas business activities: the successful efforts method and the full cost method. Chesapeake follows the full cost method of accounting under which all costs associated with property acquisition, exploration and development activities are capitalized. We also capitalize internal costs that can be directly identified with our acquisition, exploration and development activities and do not include any costs related to production, general corporate overhead or similar activities. Under the successful efforts method, geological and geophysical costs and costs of carrying and retaining undeveloped properties are charged to expense as incurred. Costs of drilling exploratory wells that do not result in proved reserves are charged to expense. Depreciation, depletion, amortization and impairment of oil and gas properties are generally calculated on a well by well or lease or field basis versus the aggregated full cost pool basis. Additionally, gain or loss is generally recognized on all sales of oil and gas properties under the successful efforts method. As a result, our financial statements will differ from companies that apply the successful efforts method since we will generally reflect a higher level of capitalized costs as well as a higher oil and gas depreciation, depletion and amortization rate, and we will not have exploration expenses that successful efforts companies frequently have. Capitalized costs are amortized on a composite unit of production method based on proved oil and gas reserves. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense is also based on the amount of estimated reserves. If 49 Table of Contents we maintain the same level of production year over year, the depreciation, depletion and amortization expense may be significantly different if our estimate of remaining reserves changes significantly. Proceeds from the sale of properties are accounted for as reductions of capitalized costs unless such sales involve a significant change in the relationship between costs and the value of proved reserves or the underlying value of unproved properties, in which case a gain or loss is recognized. The costs of unproved properties are excluded from amortization until the properties are evaluated. We review all of our unevaluated properties quarterly to determine whether or not and to what extent proved reserves have been assigned to the properties, and otherwise if impairment has occurred. Unevaluated properties are grouped by major producing area where individual property costs are not significant and are assessed individually when individual costs are significant. We review the carrying value of our oil and gas properties under the full cost accounting rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission on a quarterly basis. This quarterly review is referred to as a ceiling test. Under the ceiling test, capitalized costs, less accumulated amortization and related deferred income taxes, may not exceed an amount equal to the sum of the present value of estimated future net revenues (adjusted for cash flow hedges) less estimated future expenditures to be incurred in developing and producing the proved reserves, less any related income tax effects. The two primary factors impacting this test are reserve levels and current prices, and their associated impact on the present value of estimated future net revenues. Revisions to estimates of natural gas and oil reserves and or an increase or decrease in prices can have a material impact on the present value of estimated future net revenues. The process of estimating natural gas and oil reserves is very complex, requiring significant decisions in the evaluation of available geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data. The data for a given property may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors, including additional development activity, evolving production history and a continual reassessment of the viability of production under changing economic conditions. As a result, material revisions to existing reserve estimates occur from time to time. Although every reasonable effort is made to ensure that reserve estimates reported represent the most accurate assessments possible, the subjective decisions and variances in available data for various properties increase the likelihood of significant changes in these estimates. As of December 31, 2005, approximately 78% of our proved reserves were evaluated by independent petroleum engineers, with the balance evaluated by our internal reservoir engineers. In addition, our internal engineers review and update our reserves on a quarterly basis. All reserve estimates are prepared based upon a review of production histories and other geologic, economic, ownership and engineering data we developed. Additional information about our 2005 year end reserve evaluation is included under Oil and Gas Reserves in Item 1 Business. In addition, the prices of natural gas and oil are volatile and change from period to period. Price changes directly impact the estimated revenues from our properties and the associated present value of future net revenues. Such changes also impact the economic life of our properties and thereby affect the quantity of reserves that can be assigned to a property. The volatility of oil and natural gas prices and the impact of revisions to reserve estimates can have a significant impact on the companys financial condition and results of operations. Our oil and gas depreciation, depletion and amortization rates have increased from $1.38 per mcfe in 2003 to $1.91 per mcfe in 2005 reflecting the impact of increases in prices and finding costs during these periods. As of December 31, 2005, a decrease in natural gas prices of $0.10 per mcf and a decrease in oil prices of $1.00 per barrel would reduce the companys estimated proved reserves by 3.5 bcfe and by 1.1 bcfe, respectively, as a result of economic truncation of the expected producing lives of some properties. Income Taxes. As part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate the federal and state income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which Chesapeake operates. This 50 Table of Contents process involves estimating the actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items, such as derivative instruments, depreciation, depletion and amortization, and certain accrued liabilities for tax and accounting purposes. These differences and our net operating loss carryforwards result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included in our consolidated balance sheet. We must then assess, using all available positive and negative evidence, the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income. If we believe that recovery is not likely, we must establish a valuation allowance. Generally, to the extent Chesapeake establishes a valuation allowance or increases or decreases this allowance in a period, we must include an expense or reduction of expense within the tax provisions in the consolidated statement of operations. Under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, an enterprise must use judgment in considering the relative impact of negative and positive evidence. The weight given to the potential effect of negative and positive evidence should be commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified. The more negative evidence that exists (a) the more positive evidence is necessary and (b) the more difficult it is to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed for some portion or all of the deferred tax asset. Among the more significant types of evidence that we consider are: taxable income projections in future years, whether the carryforward period is so brief that it would limit realization of tax benefits, future sales and operating cost projections that will produce more than enough taxable income to realize the deferred tax asset based on existing sales prices and cost structures, and our earnings history exclusive of the loss that created the future deductible amount coupled with evidence indicating that the loss is an aberration rather than a continuing condition. If (a) natural gas and oil prices were to decrease significantly below present levels (and if such decreases were considered other than temporary), (b) exploration, drilling and operating costs were to increase significantly beyond current levels, or (c) we were confronted with any other significantly negative evidence pertaining to our ability to realize our NOL carryforwards prior to their expiration, we may be required to provide a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. As of December 31, 2005, we had deferred tax assets of $726.5 million. Accounting for Business Combinations. Our business has grown substantially through acquisitions and our business strategy is to continue to pursue acquisitions as opportunities arise. We have accounted for all of our business combinations using the purchase method, which is the only method permitted under SFAS 141, Accounting for Business Combinations. The accounting for business combinations is complicated and involves the use of significant judgment. Under the purchase method of accounting, a business combination is accounted for at a purchase price based upon the fair value of the consideration given, whether in the form of cash, assets, stock or the assumption of liabilities. The assets and liabilities acquired are measured at their fair values, and the purchase price is allocated to the assets and liabilities based upon these fair values. The excess of the cost of an acquired entity, if any, over the net of the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill. The excess of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed over the cost of an acquired entity, if any, is allocated as a pro rata reduction of the amounts that otherwise would have been assigned to certain acquired assets. Determining the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired involves the use of judgment, since some of the assets and liabilities acquired do not have fair values that are readily determinable. Different techniques may be used to determine fair values, including market prices, where available, appraisals, comparisons to transactions for similar assets and liabilities and present value of estimated future cash flows, among others. Since these estimates involve the use of significant judgment, they can change as new information becomes available. 51 Table of Contents We believe that the consideration we have paid for our acquisitions has represented the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired at the time of purchase. Consequently, we have not recognized any goodwill from any of our business combinations, nor do we expect to recognize goodwill from similar business combinations that we may complete in the future. Disclosures About Effects of Transactions with Related Parties As of December 31, 2005, we had accrued accounts receivable from our two co founders, CEO Aubrey K. McClendon and former COO, Tom L. Ward, of $6.4 million and $6.4 million, respectively, representing joint interest billings from December 2005 which were invoiced and paid in January 2006. Since Chesapeake was founded in 1989, Messrs. McClendon and Ward have acquired small working interests in certain of our oil and gas properties by participating in our drilling activities. Joint interest billings to them are settled in cash immediately upon delivery of a monthly joint interest billing. Under the Founder Well Participation Program, approved by our shareholders in June 2005, Messrs. McClendon and Ward may elect to participate in all or none of the wells drilled by or on behalf of Chesapeake, but they are not allowed to participate only in selected wells. A participation election is required to be received by the Compensation Committee of Chesapeakes Board of Directors 30 days prior to the start of each calendar year. Their participation is permitted only under the terms outlined in the Founder Well Participation Program, which, among other things, limits their individual participation to a maximum working interest of 2.5% in a well and prohibits participation in situations where Chesapeakes working interest would be reduced below 12.5% as a result of their participation. In addition, the company is reimbursed for the cost of its leasehold acquired by Messrs. McClendon and Ward as a result of their well participation. As a result of the resignation of Mr. Ward on February 10, 2006, his participation in the Founder Well Participation Program will expire on August 10, 2006, which is also the expiration date of non competition covenants applicable to Mr. Ward. As disclosed in Note 8 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8, in 2005, Chesapeake had revenues of $851.4 million from oil and gas sales to Eagle Energy Partners I, L.P., an affiliated entity. During 2005, 2004 and 2003, we paid legal fees of $1.2 million, $1.1 million and $2.1 million, respectively, for legal services provided by a law firm of which a former director is a member. Recently Issued Accounting Standards The Financial Accounting Standards Board recently issued the following standards which were reviewed by Chesapeake to determine the potential impact on our financial statements upon adoption. In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 123(R), Share Based Payment, a revision of SFAS 123, accounting for stock based compensation. This statement establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services by requiring a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award. This statement is effective as of the beginning of the annual reporting period that begins after June 15, 2005. Since the issuance of SFAS 123(R), three FASB Staff Positions (FSPs) have been issued regarding SFAS 123(R). These FSPs, FSP FAS 123(R) 1 Classification and Measurement of Freestanding Financial Instruments Originally Issued in Exchange for Employee Services under FASB Statement No. 123(R), FSP FAS 123(R) 2 Practical Accommodation to the Application of Grant Date as Defined in FASB Statement No. 123(R), and FSP FAS 123(R) 3 Transition Election Related to Accounting for the Tax Effects of Share Based Payment Awards will be applicable upon the initial adoption of SFAS 123(R). Chesapeake will implement SFAS 123(R) in the first quarter of 2006 and the Black Scholes option pricing model will be used to value the stock options as of the grant date. Based on the stock options outstanding and unvested at December 31, 2005 and our current intention to limit future awards of stock options, we do not believe the new accounting requirement will have a significant impact on future results of operations. 52 Table of Contents In March 2005, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. (FIN) 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations. FIN 47 specifies the accounting treatment for conditional asset retirement obligations under the provisions of SFAS No. 143. FIN 47 is effective no later than the end of the fiscal year ending after December 15, 2005. We adopted this statement effective December 31, 2005. Implementation of FIN 47 did not have a material effect on our financial statements. In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, a replacement of APB Opinion No. 20 and FASB Statement No. 3. SFAS 154 requires retrospective application to prior period financial statements for changes in accounting principle, unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change. SFAS 154 also requires that retrospective application of a change in accounting principle be limited to the direct effects of the change. Indirect effects of a change in accounting principle should be recognized in the period of the accounting change. SFAS 154 is effective for accounting changes made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. The impact of SFAS 154 will depend on the nature and extent of any voluntary accounting changes and correction of errors after the effective date, but we do not currently expect SFAS 154 to have a material impact on our financial statements. In June 2005, the EITF reached a consensus on Issue No. 04 10, Determining Whether to Aggregate Operating Segments That Do Not Meet the Quantitative Thresholds. EITF Issue 04 10 confirmed that operating segments that do not meet the quantitative thresholds can be aggregated only if aggregation is consistent with the objective and basic principles of SFAS 131, Disclosure about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information. The consensus in this issue should be applied for fiscal years ending after September 30, 2005, and the corresponding information for earlier periods, including interim periods, should be restated unless it is impractical to do so. The adoption of EITF Issue 04 10 is not expected to have a material impact on our disclosures. In September 2005, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) reached a consensus on Issue No. 04 13, Accounting for Purchases and Sales of Inventory with the Same Counterparty. EITF Issue 04 13 requires that purchases and sales of inventory with the same counterparty in the same line of business should be accounted for as a single non monetary exchange, if entered into in contemplation of one another. The consensus is effective for inventory arrangements entered into, modified or renewed in interim or annual reporting periods beginning after March 15, 2006. The adoption of EITF Issue 04 13 is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements. Forward Looking Statements This report includes forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward looking statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future events. They include statements regarding oil and gas reserve estimates, planned capital expenditures, the drilling of oil and gas wells and future acquisitions, expected oil and gas production, cash flow and anticipated liquidity, business strategy and other plans and objectives for future operations and expected future expenses. Statements concerning the fair values of derivative contracts and their estimated contribution to our future results of operations are based upon market information as of a specific date. These market prices are subject to significant volatility. Although we believe the expectations and forecasts reflected in these and other forward looking statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance they will prove to have been correct. They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expected results are described under Risk Factors in Items 1. and 2. of this report and include: the volatility of oil and gas prices, our level of indebtedness, the strength and financial resources of our competitors, the availability of capital on an economic basis to fund reserve replacement costs, 53 Table of Contents our ability to replace reserves and sustain production, uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of oil and gas reserves and projecting future rates of production and the timing of development expenditures, uncertainties in evaluating oil and gas reserves of acquired properties and associated potential liabilities, inability to effectively integrate and operate acquired companies and properties, unsuccessful exploration and development drilling, declines in the value of our oil and gas properties resulting in ceiling test write downs, lower prices realized on oil and gas sales and collateral required to secure hedging liabilities resulting from our commodity price risk management activities, lower oil and gas prices could negatively affect our ability to borrow, and drilling and operating risks. We caution you not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this report, and we undertake no obligation to update this information. We urge you to carefully review and consider the disclosures made in this report and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission that attempt to advise interested parties of the risks and factors that may affect our business. ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Oil and Gas Hedging Activities Our results of operations and operating cash flows are impacted by changes in market prices for oil and gas. To mitigate a portion of the exposure to adverse market changes, we have entered into various derivative instruments. As of December 31, 2005, our oil and gas derivative instruments were comprised of swaps, cap swaps, basis protection swaps, call options and collars. These instruments allow us to predict with greater certainty the effective oil and gas prices to be received for our hedged production. Although derivatives often fail to achieve 100% effectiveness for accounting purposes, we believe our derivative instruments continue to be highly effective in achieving the risk management objectives for which they were intended. For swap instruments, Chesapeake receives a fixed price for the hedged commodity and pays a floating market price to the counterparty. The fixed price payment and the floating price payment are netted, resulting in a net amount due to or from the counterparty. For cap swaps, Chesapeake receives a fixed price and pays a floating market price. The fixed price received by Chesapeake includes a premium in exchange for a cap limiting the counterpartys exposure. In other words, there is no limit to Chesapeakes exposure but there is a limit to the downside exposure of the counterparty. Basis protection swaps are arrangements that guarantee a price differential for oil or gas from a specified delivery point. Chesapeake receives a payment from the counterparty if the price differential is greater than the stated terms of the contract and pays the counterparty if the price differential is less than the stated terms of the contract. For call options, Chesapeake receives a cash premium from the counterparty in exchange for the sale of a call option. If the market price exceeds the fixed price of the call option, then Chesapeake pays the counterparty such excess. If the market price settles below the fixed price of the call option, no payment is due from Chesapeake. Collars contain a fixed floor price (put) and ceiling price (call). If the market price exceeds the call strike price or falls below the put strike price, Chesapeake receives the fixed price and pays the market price. If the market price is between the call and the put strike price, no payments are due from either party. 54 Table of Contents Chesapeake enters into counter swaps from time to time for the purpose of locking in the value of a swap. Under the counter swap, Chesapeake receives a floating price for the hedged commodity and pays a fixed price to the counterparty. The counter swap is 100% effective in locking in the value of a swap since subsequent changes in the market value of the swap are entirely offset by subsequent changes in the market value of the counter swap. We refer to this locked in value as a locked swap. At the time Chesapeake enters into a counter swap, Chesapeake removes the original swaps designation as a cash flow hedge and classifies the original swap as a non qualifying hedge under SFAS 133. The reason for this new designation is that collectively the swap and the counter swap no longer hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows. Instead, the swap and counter swap effectively lock in a specific gain (or loss) that will be unaffected by subsequent variability in oil and gas prices. Any locked in gain or loss is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and reclassified to oil and gas sales in the month of related production. With respect to counter swaps that are designed to lock in the value of cap swaps, the counter swap is effective in locking in the value of the cap swap until the floating price reaches the cap (or floor) stipulated in the cap swap agreement. The value of the counter swap will increase (or decrease), but in the opposite direction, as the value of the cap swap decreases (or increases) until the floating price reaches the pre determined cap (or floor) stipulated in the cap swap agreement. However, because of the written put option embedded in the cap swap, the changes in value of the cap swap are not completely effective in offsetting changes in value of the corresponding counter swap. Changes in the value of cap swaps and the counter swaps are recorded as adjustments to oil and gas sales. Chesapeake enters into derivatives from time to time for the purpose of converting a fixed price gas sales contract to a floating price. We refer to these contracts as floating price swaps. For a floating price swap, Chesapeake receives a floating market price from the counterparty and pays a fixed price. In accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 39, to the extent that a legal right of setoff exists, Chesapeake nets the value of its derivative arrangements with the same counterparty in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Chesapeake enters into basis protection swaps for the purpose of locking in a price differential for oil or gas from a specified delivery point. We currently have basis protection swaps covering four different delivery points which correspond to the actual prices we receive for much of our gas production. By entering into these basis protection swaps, we have effectively reduced our exposure to market changes in future gas price differentials. As of December 31, 2005, the fair value of our basis protection swaps was $307.3 million. Currently, our basis protection swaps cover approximately 24% of our anticipated gas production remaining in 2006, 24% in 2007, 20% in 2008, and 14% in 2009. Gains or losses from derivative transactions are reflected as adjustments to oil and gas sales on the consolidated statements of operations. Realized gains (losses) included in oil and gas sales were ($401.7) million, ($154.9) million and ($17.4) million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Pursuant to SFAS 133, certain derivatives do not qualify for designation as cash flow hedges. Changes in the fair value of these non qualifying derivatives that occur prior to their maturity (i.e., temporary fluctuations in value) are reported currently in the consolidated statements of operations as unrealized gains (losses) within oil and gas sales. Unrealized gains (losses) included in oil and gas sales were $41.1 million, $40.9 million and $10.5 million, in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Following provisions of SFAS 133, changes in the fair value of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, to the extent they are effective in offsetting cash flows attributable to the hedged risk, are recorded in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. Any change in fair value resulting from ineffectiveness is recognized currently in oil and gas sales as unrealized gains (losses). We recorded a gain (loss) on ineffectiveness of ($76.3) million, ($8.2) million and ($9.2) million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. 55 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2005, we had the following open oil and gas derivative instruments designed to hedge a portion of our oil and gas production for periods after December 2005 (excluding derivatives acquired from CNR): Volume Weighted Average FixedPrice to beReceived (Paid) WeightedAveragePutFixedPrice Weighted AverageCallFixedPrice Weighted AverageDifferential SFAS 133Hedge Net PremiumsReceived ($ inthousands) FairValue atDecember 31,2005($ inthousands) Natural Gas (mmbtu): Swaps: 1Q 2006 93,030,000 10.60 Yes (34,043 ) 2Q 2006 61,880,000 9.03 Yes (80,285 ) 3Q 2006 62,560,000 9.02 Yes (87,205 ) 4Q 2006 52,155,000 9.42 Yes (80,961 ) 1Q 2007 37,800,000 10.72 Yes (40,253 ) 2Q 2007 20,020,000 9.04 Yes (9,700 ) 3Q 2007 20,240,000 9.04 Yes (10,526 ) 4Q 2007 20,240,000 9.56 Yes (11,900 ) 1Q 2008 14,105,000 10.28 Yes (9,199 ) 2Q 2008 14,105,000 7.94 Yes (10,122 ) 3Q 2008 14,260,000 7.96 Yes (10,140 ) 4Q 2008 14,260,000 8.48 Yes (10,492 ) Basis Protection Swaps: 1Q 2006 34,200,000 (0.33 ) No 66,338 2Q 2006 30,940,000 (0.31 ) No 21,892 3Q 2006 31,280,000 (0.31 ) No 17,380 4Q 2006 33,720,000 (0.32 ) No 22,268 1Q 2007 32,850,000 (0.29 ) No 24,990 2Q 2007 34,125,000 (0.35 ) No 23,208 3Q 2007 34,500,000 (0.35 ) No 18,471 4Q 2007 35,720,000 (0.32 ) No 20,078 1Q 2008 33,215,000 (0.29 ) No 19,800 2Q 2008 26,845,000 (0.25 ) No 17,689 3Q 2008 27,140,000 (0.25 ) No 14,136 4Q 2008 31,410,000 (0.28 ) No 12,716 1Q 2009 26,100,000 (0.32 ) No 9,076 2Q 2009 20,020,000 (0.28 ) No 8,026 3Q 2009 20,240,000 (0.28 ) No 5,505 4Q 2009 20,240,000 (0.28 ) No 5,735 Cap Swaps: 1Q 2006 7,200,000 7.11 5.06 No (28,331 ) 2Q 2006 11,830,000 6.84 5.13 No (40,761 ) 3Q 2006 11,960,000 6.85 5.13 No (42,622 ) 4Q 2006 11,960,000 6.89 5.13 No (49,342 ) Counter Swaps: 1Q 2006 (1,800,000 ) (6.19 ) No 9,267 2Q 2006 (1,820,000 ) (5.35 ) No 9,062 3Q 2006 (1,840,000 ) (5.33 ) No 9,353 4Q 2006 (1,840,000 ) (5.50 ) No 10,103 Call Options: 1Q 2006 1,800,000 12.50 No 1,890 (821 ) 2Q 2006 1,820,000 12.50 No 1,911 (781 ) 3Q 2006 1,840,000 12.50 No 1,932 (1,348 ) 4Q 2006 1,840,000 12.50 No 1,932 (2,408 ) 1Q 2007 1,800,000 12.50 No 1,890 (3,559 ) 2Q 2007 1,820,000 12.50 No 1,911 (1,285 ) 3Q 2007 1,840,000 12.50 No 1,932 (1,423 ) 4Q 2007 1,840,000 12.50 No 1,932 (2,371 ) 1Q 2008 1,820,000 12.50 No 1,911 (3,754 ) 2Q 2008 1,820,000 12.50 No 1,911 (893 ) 3Q 2008 1,840,000 12.50 No 1,932 (1,043 ) 4Q 2008 1,840,000 12.50 No 1,932 (1,775 ) 56 Table of Contents Volume Weighted Average FixedPrice to beReceived (Paid) WeightedAveragePutFixedPrice Weighted AverageCallFixedPrice Weighted AverageDifferential SFAS 133Hedge Net PremiumsReceived ($ inthousands) FairValue atDecember 31,2005($ inthousands) Collars: 1Q 2006 180,000 6.00 9.70 Yes (270 ) Locked Swaps: 1Q 2006 6,300,000 No (7,598 ) 2Q 2006 6,370,000 No (5,199 ) 3Q 2006 6,440,000 No (5,099 ) 4Q 2006 6,440,000 No (4,706 ) 1Q 2007 6,300,000 No (4,789 ) 2Q 2007 6,370,000 No (2,517 ) 3Q 2007 6,440,000 No (2,049 ) 4Q 2007 6,440,000 No (2,272 ) Floating Price Swaps: 1Q 2006 (2,700,000 ) (7.96 ) No 2,607 Total Natural Gas 23,016 (264,142 ) Oil (bbls): Swaps: 1Q 2006 900,000 60.00 Yes (1,739 ) 2Q 2006 880,000 59.88 Yes (2,760 ) 3Q 2006 828,000 60.16 Yes (2,858 ) 4Q 2006 828,000 59.78 Yes (3,415 ) 1Q 2007 360,000 57.13 Yes (2,495 ) 2Q 2007 91,000 51.04 Yes (1,200 ) 3Q 2007 92,000 50.56 Yes (1,233 ) 4Q 2007 92,000 50.11 Yes (1,236 ) Cap Swaps: 1Q 2006 135,000 57.82 40.67 No (565 ) 2Q 2006 136,500 57.82 40.67 No (825 ) 3Q 2006 138,000 57.82 40.67 No (1,057 ) 4Q 2006 92,000 56.53 40.00 No (917 ) Total Oil (20,300 ) Total Natural Gas and Oil $ 23,016 $ (284,442 ) We have established the fair value of all derivative instruments using estimates of fair value reported by our counterparties and subsequently evaluated internally using established index prices and other sources. The actual contribution to our future results of operations will be based on the market prices at the time of settlement and may be more or less than the fair value estimates used at December 31, 2005. Based upon the market prices at December 31, 2005, we expect to transfer approximately $153.8 million (net of income taxes) of the loss included in the balance in accumulated other comprehensive income to earnings during the next 12 months when the transactions actually occur. All transactions hedged as of December 31, 2005 are expected to mature by December 31, 2009. 57 Table of Contents Additional information concerning changes in the fair value of our oil and gas derivative instruments is as follows: December 31, 2005 2004 2003 ($ in thousands) Fair value of contracts outstanding, as of January 1 $ 38,350 $ (44,988 ) $ (14,533 ) Change in fair value of contracts during the period (771,076 ) (69,927 ) (31,078 ) Contracts realized or otherwise settled during the period 401,684 154,901 17,389 Fair value of new contracts when entered into during the period (614,772 ) (5,369 ) (16,766 ) Fair value of contracts when closed during the period 3,733 Fair value of contracts outstanding, as of December 31 $ (945,814 ) $ 38,350 $ (44,988 ) The change in the fair value of our derivative instruments since January 1, 2005 resulted mainly from an increase in oil and natural gas prices. Derivative instruments reflected as current in the consolidated balance sheet represent the estimated fair value of derivative instrument settlements scheduled to occur over the subsequent twelve month period based on market prices for oil and gas as of the consolidated balance sheet date. The derivative settlement amounts are not due and payable until the month in which the related underlying hedged transaction occurs. We assumed certain liabilities related to open derivative positions in connection with the CNR acquisition. In accordance with SFAS 141, these derivative positions were recorded at fair value in the purchase price allocation as a liability of $592 million. The recognition of the derivative liability and other assumed liabilities resulted in an increase in the total purchase price which is allocated to the assets acquired. Because of this accounting treatment, only cash settlements for changes in fair value subsequent to the acquisition date for the derivative positions assumed will result in adjustments to our oil and gas revenues upon settlement. For example, if the fair value of the derivative positions assumed do not change then upon the sale of the underlying production and corresponding settlement of the derivative positions, cash would be paid to the counterparties and there would be no adjustment to oil and gas revenues related to the derivative positions. If, however, the actual sales price is different from the price assumed in the original fair value calculation, the difference would be reflected as either a decrease or increase in oil and gas revenues, depending upon whether the sales price was higher or lower, respectively, than the prices assumed in the original fair value calculation. For accounting purposes, the net effect of these acquired hedges is that we have hedged the production volumes listed below market prices on the date of our acquisition of CNR. Pursuant to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 149, Amendment of SFAS 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, the derivative instruments assumed in connection with the CNR acquisition are deemed to contain a significant financing element and all cash flows associated with these positions will be reported as financing activity in the statement of cash flows for the periods in which settlement occurs. 58 Table of Contents The following details the CNR derivatives we have assumed: Volume Weighted AverageFixedPrice to beReceived(Paid) WeightedAveragePutFixedPrice Weighted AverageCall FixedPrice SFAS 133Hedge FairValue atDecember 31,2005($ inthousands) Natural Gas (mmbtu): Swaps: 1Q 2006 7,872,500 4.91 Yes (50,693 ) 2Q 2006 10,510,500 4.86 Yes (56,501 ) 3Q 2006 10,626,000 4.86 Yes (57,355 ) 4Q 2006 10,626,000 4.86 Yes (62,483 ) 1Q 2007 10,350,000 4.82 Yes (68,401 ) 2Q 2007 10,465,000 4.82 Yes (46,158 ) 3Q 2007 10,580,000 4.82 Yes (46,442 ) 4Q 2007 10,580,000 4.82 Yes (51,557 ) 1Q 2008 9,555,000 4.68 Yes (53,954 ) 2Q 2008 9,555,000 4.68 Yes (33,892 ) 3Q 2008 9,660,000 4.68 Yes (33,999 ) 4Q 2008 9,660,000 4.66 Yes (38,487 ) 1Q 2009 4,500,000 5.18 Yes (18,772 ) 2Q 2009 4,550,000 5.18 Yes (10,450 ) 3Q 2009 4,600,000 5.18 Yes (10,508 ) 4Q 2009 4,600,000 5.18 Yes (12,616 ) Total (652,268 ) Collars: 1Q 2009 900,000 4.50 6.00 Yes (3,380 ) 2Q 2009 910,000 4.50 6.00 Yes (1,754 ) 3Q 2009 920,000 4.50 6.00 Yes (1,773 ) 4Q 2009 920,000 4.50 6.00 Yes (2,197 ) Total (9,104 ) Total Natural Gas $ (661,372 ) In connection with the November 14, 2005 acquisition of Columbia Natural Resources, LLC (CNR), Chesapeake assumed obligations under forward gas sales agreements with Mahonia II Limited (Mahonia) to deliver a total of 8.9 bcf of natural gas to Mahonia through February 2006. As of December 31, 2005, the remaining 4.25 bcf of gas scheduled to be delivered under this contract has been recorded as a $60.9 million current accrued liability, based on the fair value of the delivery commitment at the date of acquisition. 59 Table of Contents Interest Rate Risk The table below presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates. As of December 31, 2005, the fair value of the fixed rate long term debt has been estimated based on quoted market prices. Years of Maturity 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Thereafter Total Fair Value ($ in millions) Liabilities: Long term debt fixed rate (a) $ $ $ $ $ $ 5,524.7 $ 5,524.7 $ 5,582.4 Average interest rate 6.3 % 6.3 % 6.3 % Long term debt variable rate $ $ $ $ $ $ 72.0 $ 72.0 $ 72.0 Average interest rate 7.3 % 7.3 % 7.3 % (a) This amount does not include the discount included in long term debt of ($95.6) million and the discount for interest rate swaps of ($11.3) million. Changes in interest rates affect the amount of interest we earn on our cash, cash equivalents and short term investments and the interest rate we pay on borrowings under our revolving bank credit facility. All of our other long term indebtedness is fixed rate and therefore does not expose us to the risk of earnings or cash flow loss due to changes in market interest rates. However, changes in interest rates do affect the fair value of our debt. Interest Rate Derivatives We use interest rate derivatives to mitigate our exposure to the volatility in interest rates. For interest rate derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges (in accordance with SFAS 133), changes in fair value of interest rate derivatives are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as assets (liabilities) and the debts carrying value amount is adjusted by the change in the fair value of the debt subsequent to the initiation of the derivative. Any resulting differences are recorded currently as ineffectiveness in the consolidated statements of operations as an adjustment to interest expense. Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments not qualifying as fair value hedges are recorded currently as adjustments to interest expense. As of December 31, 2005, the following interest rate swaps were used to convert a portion of our long term fixed rate debt to floating rate debt were outstanding: Term Notional Amount Fixed Rate Floating Rate Fair Value Gain (Loss) ($ in thousands) September 2004 August 2012 $ 75,000,000 9.000 % 6 month LIBOR plus 452 basis points $ (2,734 ) July 2005 January 2015 $ 150,000,000 7.750 % 6 month LIBOR plus 289 basis points $ (5,133 ) July 2005 June 2014 $ 150,000,000 7.500 % 6 month LIBOR plus 282 basis points $ (5,327 ) September 2005 August 2014 $ 250,000,000 7.000 % 6 month LIBOR plus 205.5 basis points $ (5,004 ) October 2005 June 2015 $ 200,000,000 6.375 % 6 month LIBOR plus 112 basis points $ (1,344 ) October 2005 January 2018 $ 250,000,000 6.250 % 6 month LIBOR plus 99 basis points $ (3,240 ) October 2005 January 2016 $ 200,000,000 6.625 % 6 month LIBOR plus 129 basis points $ 282 In January 2006, we closed the interest rate swap on our 6.625% Senior Notes for $1.0 million. Subsequent to December 31, 2005, we entered into the following interest rate swaps (which qualify as fair value hedges) to convert a portion of our long term fixed rate debt to floating rate debt: Term Notional Amount Floating Rate January 2006 January 2016 $ 250,000,000 6 month LIBOR plus 129 basis points March 2006 January 2016 $ 250,000,000 6 month LIBOR plus 120 basis points March 2006 August 2017 $ 250,000,000 6 month LIBOR plus 125.5 basis points 60 Table of Contents In 2005, we closed various interest rate swaps for gains totaling $7.1 million. These interest rate swaps were designated as fair value hedges, and the settlement amounts received will be amortized as a reduction to realized interest expense over the remaining terms of the related senior notes. In March 2004, Chesapeake entered into an interest rate swap which required Chesapeake to pay a fixed rate of 8.68% while the counterparty paid Chesapeake a floating rate of six month LIBOR plus 0.75% on a notional amount of $142.7 million. On March 15, 2005, we elected to terminate the interest rate swap and paid $31.8 million to the counterparty. 61 Table of Contents
