We manage our business as three separate segments: an exploration and production segment, a marketing segment and a service operations segment which is comprised of our wholly owned drilling and trucking subsidiaries. We refer you to Note 8 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements appearing in Item 8 of this report, which summarizes by segment our net income and capital expenditures for 2006, 2005 and 2004 and our assets as of December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. Executive Summary Chesapeake is the third largest independent producer of natural gas in the United States. We own interests in approximately 34,600 producing oil and natural gas wells that are currently producing approximately 1.7 bcfe per day, 92% of which is natural gas. Our strategy is focused on discovering, developing and acquiring onshore natural gas reserves in the U.S. east of the Rocky Mountains. Our most important operating area has historically been in various conventional plays in the Mid Continent region of Oklahoma, Arkansas, southwestern Kansas and the Texas Panhandle. At December 31, 2006, 47% of our estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves were located in the Mid Continent region. During the past five years, we have also built significant positions in various conventional and unconventional plays in the Fort Worth Basin in north central Texas; the Appalachian Basin, principally in West Virginia, eastern Kentucky, eastern Ohio and southern New York; the Permian and Delaware Basins of West Texas and eastern New Mexico; the Ark La Tex area of East Texas and northern Louisiana; and the South Texas and Texas Gulf Coast regions. We have established a top three position in nearly every major shale play in the U.S., including the Forth Worth Basin Barnett Shale, the Arkansas Fayetteville Shale, the Appalachian Basin Devonian Shale, the southeast Oklahoma Woodford Shale, the Delaware Basin Barnett and Woodford Shales, the Illinois Basin New Albany Shale and the Conasauga, Floyd and Chattanooga Shales in Alabama. Oil and natural gas production for 2006 was 578.4 bcfe, an increase of 109.8 bcfe, or 23% over the 468.6 bcfe produced in 2005. We have increased our production for 17 consecutive years and 22 consecutive quarters. During these 22 quarters, Chesapeakes U.S. production has increased 322% for an average compound quarterly growth rate of 6.8% and an average compound annual growth rate of 29.7%. In addition to increased oil and natural gas production, the prices we received were higher in 2006 than in 2005. On a natural gas equivalent basis, weighted average prices (excluding the effect of unrealized gains or losses on derivatives) were $8.86 per mcfe in 2006 compared to $6.90 per mcfe in 2005. The increase in prices resulted in an increase in revenue of $1.135 billion, and increased production resulted in an increase in revenue of $757.2 million, for a total increase in revenue of $1.892 billion (excluding the effect of unrealized gains or losses on derivatives). In each of the operating areas where Chesapeake sells its oil and natural gas, established marketing and transportation infrastructures exist, thereby contributing to relatively high wellhead price realizations for our production. During 2006, we led the nation in drilling activity with an average utilization of 98 operated rigs and 79 non operated rigs. Through this drilling activity, we drilled 1,488 (1,243 net) operated wells and participated in another 1,534 (206 net) wells operated by other companies. Our success rate was 99% for operated wells and 98% for non operated wells. To accelerate the development of our extensive prospect inventory, we have increased our current drilling activity to 132 operated rigs and we anticipate keeping our operated rig count between 130 and 140 31 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements rigs during 2007. In 2006, we added approximately 2,000 new employees to support our growth, which increased our total employee base to approximately 4,900 employees at December 31, 2006, and invested $771 million in leasehold (excluding leasehold acquired through corporate and asset acquisitions) and 3 D seismic data, all of which we consider the building blocks of future value creation. Chesapeake began 2006 with estimated proved reserves of 7.521 tcfe and ended the year with 8.956 tcfe, an increase of 1.435 tcfe, or 19%. During 2006, we replaced 578.4 bcfe of production with an estimated 2.013 tcfe of new proved reserves, for a reserve replacement rate of 348%. Reserve replacement through the drillbit was 1.345 tcfe, or 233% of production (including 729 bcfe of positive performance revisions and 212 bcfe of downward revisions resulting from natural gas price declines between December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2006) and 67% of the total increase. Reserve replacement through the acquisition of proved reserves was 668 bcfe, or 115% of production and 33% of the total increase. Our annual decline rate on producing properties is projected to be 25% from 2007 to 2008, 16% from 2008 to 2009, 13% from 2009 to 2010, 11% from 2010 to 2011 and 10% from 2011 to 2012. Our percentage of proved undeveloped reserve additions to total proved reserve additions was approximately 38% in 2006, 36% in 2005 and 56% in 2004. Based on our current drilling schedule and budget, we expect that virtually all of the proved undeveloped reserves added in 2006 will begin producing within the next three to five years. Generally, proved developed reserves are producing at the time they are added or will begin producing within one year. Chesapeake attributes its strong drilling results and production growth during 2006 (and in this decade) to managements early recognition that oil and natural gas prices were undergoing structural change and its subsequent decision to invest aggressively in the building blocks of value creation in the E&P industry people, land and seismic. During the past five years, Chesapeake has significantly strengthened its technical capabilities by increasing its land, geoscience and engineering staff to approximately 1,000 employees. Today, the company has approximately 4,900 employees, of which approximately 60% work in the companys E&P operations and 40% work in the companys oilfield service operations. Since 2000, Chesapeake has invested $6.6 billion in new leasehold and 3 D seismic acquisitions and now owns what it believes to be one of the largest inventories of onshore leasehold (10.4 million net acres) and 3 D seismic (16.3 million acres) in the U.S. On this leasehold, the company has an estimated 26,000 net drilling locations representing an approximate 10 year inventory of drilling projects. Chesapeakes direct and indirect drilling rig investments have served as an effective hedge to higher service costs and have also provided competitive advantages in making acquisitions and in developing the companys own leasehold on a more timely and efficient basis. As of December 31, 2006, Chesapeake had invested approximately $300 million to build or acquire 42 drilling rigs and to begin the construction of 14 additional rigs. During 2006, the company entered into a sale/leaseback transaction to monetize its investment in 24 rigs in exchange for cash proceeds of approximately $244 million. These rigs are under lease to Chesapeake through 2014 at which time the company has the option to reacquire them. Including the 24 rigs sold and subsequently leased back to Chesapeake, the companys drilling rig fleet should reach 81 rigs by mid year 2007, which would rank Chesapeake as the sixth largest drilling rig contractor in the U.S. Additionally, the company has a $77 million investment in two private drilling rig contractors, DHS Drilling Company and Mountain Drilling Company, in which Chesapeakes equity ownership is approximately 45% and 49%, respectively. DHS owns 16 rigs and Mountain is operating 4 rigs and has another 4 rigs under construction or on order for delivery in 2007. To further hedge its exposure to oilfield service costs and achieve greater operational efficiency, in 2006 Chesapeake invested $254 million to acquire a 19.9% interest in a privately held provider of well stimulation and high pressure pumping services with operations currently focused in Texas (principally in the Fort Worth Barnett Shale) and the Rocky Mountains. It also has expansion efforts underway in many other key regions in which Chesapeake operates. 32 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements As of December 31, 2006, the companys debt as a percentage of total capitalization (total capitalization is the sum of debt and stockholders equity) was 40% compared to 47% as of December 31, 2005. During 2006, we received net proceeds of $4.071 billion through issuances of $575 million of preferred equity, $1.8 billion of common equity and $1.8 billion principal amount of senior notes. We used the net proceeds from these offerings primarily to fund the purchase price for acquisitions and to repay outstanding indebtedness under our revolving bank credit facility. As a result of our debt transactions in 2005 and 2006, we have extended the average maturity of our long term debt to over nine years with an average interest rate of approximately 6.5%. We intend to continue to focus on improving the strength of our balance sheet. We believe our business strategy and operational performance will lead to an investment grade credit rating for our unsecured debt at some point in the future. Liquidity and Capital Resources Sources of Liquidity and Uses of Funds Our primary source of liquidity to meet operating expenses and fund capital expenditures (other than for certain acquisitions) is cash flow from operations. Based on our current production, price and expense assumptions, we expect our drilling, land and seismic capital expenditures in 2007 to exceed our cash flow from operations. Any additional funds required will be provided through additional borrowings under our bank credit facility. Our budget for drilling, land and seismic activities during 2007 is currently between $4.7 billion and $4.9 billion. We believe this level of exploration and development will be sufficient to increase our proved oil and natural gas reserves in 2007 and increase our total production by 14% to 18% (inclusive of acquisitions completed or scheduled to close in 2007 through the filing date of this report but without regard to any additional acquisitions that may be completed in 2007). However, higher drilling and field operating costs, drilling results that alter planned development schedules, acquisitions or other factors could cause us to revise our drilling program, which is largely discretionary. Cash provided by operating activities was $4.843 billion in 2006, compared to $2.407 billion in 2005 and $1.432 billion in 2004. The $2.436 billion increase from 2005 to 2006 and the $975 million increase from 2004 to 2005 were primarily due to higher realized prices and higher volumes of oil and natural gas production. We expect that 2007 production volumes will be higher than in 2006 and that cash provided by operating activities in 2007 will exceed 2006 levels. While a decline in natural gas prices in 2007 would affect the amount of cash flow that would be generated from operations, we currently have oil swaps in place covering 59% of our expected oil production in 2007 at an average NYMEX price of $71.90 per barrel of oil and natural gas swaps in place covering 48% of our expected natural gas production in 2007 at an average NYMEX price of $8.63 per mcf, along with natural gas collars covering 10% of our anticipated natural gas production for 2007 with an average NYMEX floor of $6.88 per mcf and an average NYMEX ceiling of $8.41 per mcf. Additionally, we have written call options covering 10% of our 2007 natural gas production at a weighted average price of $9.56. This level of hedging provides certainty of the cash flow we will receive for a substantial portion of our 2007 production. Depending on changes in oil and natural gas futures markets and managements view of underlying oil and natural gas supply and demand trends, however, we may increase or decrease our current hedging positions. Based on fluctuations in natural gas and oil prices, our hedging counterparties may require us to deliver cash collateral or other assurances of performance from time to time. All but three of our commodity price risk management counterparties require us to provide assurances of performance in the event that the counterparties mark to market exposure to us exceeds certain levels. Most of these arrangements allow us to minimize the potential liquidity impact of significant mark to market fluctuations by making collateral allocations from our bank credit facility or directly pledging oil and natural gas properties, rather than posting cash or letters of credit with the counterparties. As of December 31, 2006, we had outstanding collateral allocations and pledges of oil and natural gas properties, with respect to commodity price risk management transactions but were not required to post any collateral with our counterparties through letters of credit issued under our bank credit facility. As of 33 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements February 23, 2007, we had outstanding transactions with fifteen counterparties, eight of which hold collateral allocations from our bank facility or liens against certain oil and natural gas properties under our secured hedging facilities, and two of which do not require us to provide security for our risk management transactions. As of February 23, 2007, we were not required to post cash or letters of credit with the remaining five counterparties. Future collateral requirements are uncertain and will depend on the arrangements with our counterparties and highly volatile natural gas and oil prices. A significant source of liquidity is our $2.5 billion syndicated revolving bank credit facility which matures in February 2011. At February 23, 2007, there was $1.464 billion of borrowing capacity available under the revolving bank credit facility. We use the facility to fund daily operating activities and acquisitions as needed. We borrowed $8.370 billion and repaid $8.264 billion in 2006, we borrowed $5.682 billion and repaid $5.669 billion in 2005 and we borrowed $2.160 billion and repaid $2.101 billion in 2004 under our bank credit facility. We incurred $5.1 million, $4.7 million and $2.2 million of financing costs related to our revolving bank credit facility in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, as a result of amendments to the credit facility agreement. During 2005, we repaid the remaining credit facility balance of $96.1 million assumed in our 2005 acquisition of Columbia Natural Resources, LLC. We believe that our available cash, cash provided by operating activities and funds available under our revolving bank credit facility will be sufficient to fund our operating, debt service and general and administrative expenses, our capital expenditure budget, our short term contractual obligations and dividend payments at current levels for the foreseeable future. The public and institutional markets have been our principal source of long term financing for acquisitions. We have sold debt and equity in both public and private offerings in the past, and we expect that these sources of capital will continue to be available to us in the future to finance acquisitions. Nevertheless, we caution that ready access to capital on reasonable terms and the availability of desirable acquisition targets at attractive prices are subject to many uncertainties, as explained under Risk Factors in Item 1A.

A prospectus supplement will be prepared at the time of an offering and will contain a description of the security issued, the plan of distribution and other information. We paid dividends on our common stock of $87.0 million, $60.5 million and $38.9 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and we paid dividends on our preferred stock of $88.4 million, $31.5 million and $40.9 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. We received $73.2 million, $21.6 million and $12.0 million from the exercise of employee and director stock options and warrants in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. We paid 34 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements $86.2 million and $4.0 million to purchase treasury stock in 2006 and 2005. Of these amounts, $11.1 million and $4.0 million were used to fund our matching contribution to our 401(k) plans in 2006 and 2005, respectively. The remaining $75.1 million in 2006 was used to purchase shares of common stock to be used upon the exercise of stock options under certain stock option plans. There were no treasury stock purchases made in 2004. In 2006 and 2005, we paid $86.9 million and $11.6 million to settle a portion of the derivative liabilities assumed in our 2005 acquisition of Columbia Natural Resources, LLC. Outstanding payments from certain disbursement accounts in excess of funded cash balances where no legal right of set off exists increased by $70.0 million, $61.2 million and $88.3 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. All disbursements are funded on the day they are presented to our bank using available cash on hand or draws on our revolving bank credit facility. Historically, we have used significant funds to redeem or purchase and retire outstanding senior notes issued by Chesapeake, although we had no such transactions in 2006.

(b) We issued $63.7 million of our 7.75% Senior Notes and $470.5 million of our 6.875% Senior Notes. Our accounts receivable are primarily from purchasers of oil and natural gas ($617.8 million at December 31, 2006) and exploration and production companies which own interests in properties we operate ($135.3 million at December 31, 2006). This industry concentration has the potential to impact our overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively, in that our customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic, industry or other conditions. We generally require letters of credit for receivables from customers which are judged to have sub standard credit, unless the credit risk can otherwise be mitigated. 35 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Investing Transactions Cash used in investing activities increased to $8.942 billion in 2006, compared to $6.921 billion in 2005 and $3.381 billion in 2004.

In January 2006, we acquired a privately owned Oklahoma based oilfield trucking service company for $47.5 million. In February 2006, we acquired 13 drilling rigs and related assets through our wholly owned subsidiary, Nomac Drilling Corporation, from Martex Drilling Company, L.L.P., a privately owned drilling contractor with operations in East Texas and North Louisiana, for approximately $150 million. In July 2006, we acquired 15 rigs and related trucking assets from a drilling contractor in the Appalachian Basin for approximately $70 million in cash. In February 2006, we sold our investment in publicly traded Pioneer Drilling Company (Pioneer) common stock, realizing proceeds of $158.9 million and a gain of $117.4 million. We owned 17% of the common stock of Pioneer, which we began acquiring in 2003. In August 2006, we invested $254 million to acquire a 19.9% interest in a privately held provider of well stimulation and high pressure pumping services, with operations currently focused in Texas (principally in the Fort Worth Barnett Shale) and the Rocky Mountains. In September 2006, we acquired 32% of the outstanding common stock of Chaparral Energy, Inc. for $240 million in cash and 1,375,989 newly issued shares of our common stock valued at $40 million. Chaparral is a privately held independent oil and natural gas company headquartered in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Financing Transactions During 2005 and 2006, we took several steps to improve our capital structure. These transactions enabled us to extend our average maturity of long term debt to over nine years with an average interest rate of approximately 6.5%. Maintaining a debt to total capitalization ratio below 50% and reducing debt per mcfe of proved reserves remain key goals of our business strategy. 36 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements We completed the following significant financing transactions in 2006: First Quarter 2006 Amended and restated our revolving bank credit facility, increasing the commitments to $2.0 billion and extending the maturity date to February 2011. Issued an additional $500 million of our 6.5% Senior Notes due 2017 in a private placement and used the proceeds of approximately $487 million to repay outstanding borrowings under our revolving bank credit facility incurred primarily to fund our recent acquisitions. Second Quarter 2006 Exchanged 83,245 shares of our 4.125% cumulative convertible preferred stock, representing 96.4% or $83.2 million of the aggregate liquidation value of the shares outstanding, for 5.2 million shares of our common stock pursuant to a tender offer. Exchanged 804,048 shares of our 5.0% (Series 2003) cumulative convertible preferred stock, representing 95.4% or $80.4 million of the aggregate liquidation value of the shares outstanding, for 5.0 million shares of our common stock pursuant to a tender offer. Completed public offerings of $500 million of 7.625% Senior Notes due 2013, 2.0 million shares of 6.25% mandatory convertible preferred stock having a liquidation preference of $250 per share, and 25 million shares of common stock at $29.05 per share. Net proceeds of approximately $1.666 billion were used to fund acquisitions, to repay borrowings under our revolving bank credit facility and for general corporate purposes. Third Quarter 2006 Increased the commitments under our revolving bank credit facility to $2.5 billion. Issued 3.75 million shares of common stock at $29.05 per share and 300,000 shares of our 6.25% mandatory convertible preferred stock having a liquidation preference of $250 per share upon the exercise of the underwriters options to purchase the additional shares pursuant to the June 2006 public offerings of our common stock and 6.25% preferred stock. Net proceeds of approximately $177.6 million were used to repay borrowings under our revolving bank credit facility. Fourth Quarter 2006 Completed a public offering on December 5, 2006 of 600 million of 6.25% Euro denominated Senior Notes due 2017 ($799.5 million based on the dollar/euro exchange rate of $1.3325 to 1.00). Net proceeds of approximately 589.6 million (or approximately $785.7 million) were used to repay outstanding borrowings under our revolving bank credit facility. Completed a public offering of 30 million shares of common stock at $32.15 per share. Net proceeds of approximately $955.3 million were used to repay outstanding borrowings under our revolving bank credit facility. Contractual Obligations We currently have a $2.5 billion syndicated revolving bank credit facility which matures in February 2011. Commitments under the credit facility were increased from $1.25 billion to $2.0 billion in February 2006 and to $2.5 billion in September 2006. As of December 31, 2006, we had $178.0 million in outstanding borrowings under this facility and had utilized $6.2 million of the facility for various letters of credit. Borrowings under the facility are collateralized by certain producing oil and natural gas properties and bear interest at either (i) the greater of the reference rate of Union Bank of California, N.A., or the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50% or 37 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements (ii) London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), at our option, plus a margin that varies from 0.875% to 1.50% per annum according to our senior unsecured long term debt ratings. The collateral value and borrowing base are redetermined periodically. The unused portion of the facility is subject to a commitment fee that also varies according to our senior unsecured long term debt ratings, from 0.125% to 0.30% per annum. Currently the commitment fee is 0.25% per annum. Interest is payable quarterly or, if LIBOR applies, it may be payable at more frequent intervals. The credit facility agreement contains various covenants and restrictive provisions which limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness, make investments or loans and create liens. The credit facility agreement requires us to maintain an indebtedness to total capitalization ratio (as defined) not to exceed 0.65 to 1 and an indebtedness to EBITDA ratio (as defined) not to exceed 3.5 to 1. As defined by the credit facility, our indebtedness to total capitalization ratio was 0.40 to 1 and our indebtedness to EBITDA ratio was 1.64 to 1 at December 31, 2006. If we should fail to perform our obligations under these and other covenants, the revolving credit commitment could be terminated and any outstanding borrowings under the facility could be declared immediately due and payable. Such acceleration, if involving a principal amount of $10 million ($50 million in the case of our senior notes issued after 2004), would constitute an event of default under our senior note indentures which could in turn result in the acceleration of a significant portion of our senior note indebtedness. The credit facility agreement also has cross default provisions that apply to other indebtedness we may have with an outstanding principal amount in excess of $75 million. We have three secured hedging facilities maturing in 2011, each of which permits us to enter into cash settled natural gas and oil commodity transactions, valued by the counterparty, for up to a maximum value. Outstanding transactions under each facility are collateralized by certain of our oil and natural gas properties that do not secure any of our other obligations. The hedging facilities are subject to a 1% per annum exposure fee, which is assessed quarterly on the average of the daily negative fair market value amounts, if any, during the quarter. The hedging facilities contain the standard representations and default provisions that are typical of such agreements. The agreements also contain various restrictive provisions which govern the aggregate oil and natural gas production volumes that we are permitted to hedge under all of our agreements at any one time. The maximum permitted value of transactions under each facility and the fair market values of outstanding transactions are shown below. Secured Hedging Facilities #1 #2 #3 ($ in thousands) Maximum permitted value of transactions under facility $ 750,000 $ 500,000 $ 500,000 Fair market value of outstanding transactions, as of December 31, 2006 $ 34,403 $ 59,639 $ Fair market value of outstanding transactions, as of February 23, 2007 $ 26,063 $ 16,027 $ 29,243 Two of our subsidiaries, Chesapeake Exploration Limited Partnership and Chesapeake Appalachia, L.L.C., are the borrowers under our revolving bank credit facility and Chesapeake Exploration Limited Partnership is the named party to our hedging facilities. The facilities are guaranteed by Chesapeake and all its other wholly owned subsidiaries except minor subsidiaries. Our revolving bank credit facility and secured hedging facilities do not contain material adverse change or adequate assurance covenants. Although the applicable interest rates and commitment fees in our bank credit facility fluctuate slightly based on our long term senior unsecured credit ratings, the bank facility and the secured hedging facilities do not contain provisions which would trigger an acceleration of amounts due under the facilities or a requirement to post additional collateral in the event of a downgrade of our credit ratings. 38 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements In addition to outstanding revolving bank credit facility borrowings discussed above, as of December 31, 2006, senior notes represented approximately $7.2 billion of our long term debt and consisted of the following ($ in thousands): 7.5% Senior Notes due 2013 $ 363,823 7.625% Senior Notes due 2013 500,000 7.0% Senior Notes due 2014 300,000 7.5% Senior Notes due 2014 300,000 7.75% Senior Notes due 2015 300,408 6.375% Senior Notes due 2015 600,000 6.625% Senior Notes due 2016 600,000 6.875% Senior Notes due 2016 670,437 6.5% Senior Notes due 2017 1,100,000 6.25% Euro denominated Senior Notes due 2017 (a) 791,820 6.25% Senior Notes due 2018 600,000 6.875% Senior Notes due 2020 500,000 2.75% Contingent Convertible Senior Notes due 2035 690,000 Discount on senior notes (101,935 ) Discount for interest rate derivatives (17,005 ) $ 7,197,548 (a) The principal amount shown is based on the dollar/euro exchange rate of $1.3197 to 1.00 as of December 31, 2006. See Note 10 of our financial statements for information on our related cross currency swap. No scheduled principal payments are required under our senior notes until 2013, when $863.8 million is due. The holders of the 2.75% Contingent Convertible Senior Notes due 2035 may require us to repurchase all or a portion of these notes on November 15, 2015, 2020, 2025 and 2030 at 100% of the principal amount of these notes. As of December 31, 2006 and currently, debt ratings for the senior notes are Ba2 by Moodys Investor Service (stable outlook), BB by Standard & Poors Ratings Services (positive outlook) and BB by Fitch Ratings (stable outlook). Our senior notes are unsecured senior obligations of Chesapeake and rank equally in right of payment with all of our other existing and future senior indebtedness and rank senior in right of payment with all of our future subordinated indebtedness. All of our wholly owned subsidiaries, except minor subsidiaries, fully and unconditionally guarantee the notes jointly and severally on an unsecured basis. Senior notes issued before July 2005 are governed by indentures containing covenants that limit our ability and our restricted subsidiaries ability to incur additional indebtedness; pay dividends on our capital stock or redeem, repurchase or retire our capital stock or subordinated indebtedness; make investments and other restricted payments; incur liens; enter into sale leaseback transactions; create restrictions on the payment of dividends or other amounts to us from our restricted subsidiaries; engage in transactions with affiliates; sell assets; and consolidate, merge or transfer assets. Senior notes issued after June 2005 are governed by indentures containing covenants that limit our ability and our restricted subsidiaries ability to incur certain secured indebtedness; enter into sale leaseback transactions; and consolidate, merge or transfer assets. The debt incurrence covenants do not presently restrict our ability to borrow under or expand our secured credit facility. As of December 31, 2006, we estimate that secured commercial bank indebtedness of approximately $3.3 billion could have been incurred under the most restrictive indenture covenant. 39 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The table below summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2006 ($ in thousands): Payments Due By Period Contractual Obligations Total Less than 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years More than 5 years Long term debt obligations $ 7,494,488 $ $ $ 178,000 $ 7,316,488 Capital lease obligations 5,834 2,491 2,905 438 Operating lease obligations 281,974 40,033 77,013 69,665 95,263 Purchase obligations (a) 1,068,387 470,182 308,822 68,922 220,461 Standby letters of credit 6,889 6,889 Total contractual cash obligations $ 8,857,572 $ 519,595 $ 388,740 $ 317,025 $ 7,632,212 (a) See Note 4 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for a description of transportation and drilling contract commitments. Hedging Activities Oil and Natural Gas Hedging Activities Our results of operations and operating cash flows are impacted by changes in market prices for oil and natural gas. To mitigate a portion of the exposure to adverse market changes, we have entered into various derivative instruments. Executive management is involved in all risk management activities and the Board of Directors reviews the companys hedging program at every Board meeting. We believe we have sufficient internal controls to prevent unauthorized hedging. As of December 31, 2006, our oil and natural gas derivative instruments were comprised of swaps, cap swaps, basis protection swaps, call options and collars. Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk contains a description of each of these instruments. Although derivatives often fail to achieve 100% effectiveness for accounting purposes, we believe our derivative instruments continue to be highly effective in achieving the risk management objectives for which they were intended. Hedging allows us to predict with greater certainty the effective prices we will receive for our hedged oil and natural gas production. We closely monitor the fair value of our hedging contracts and may elect to settle a contract prior to its scheduled maturity date in order to lock in a gain or loss. Commodity markets are volatile and Chesapeakes hedging activities are dynamic. Mark to market positions under oil and natural gas hedging contracts fluctuate with commodity prices. As described above under Contractual Obligations, we may be required to deliver cash collateral or other assurances of performance if our payment obligations to our hedging counterparties exceed levels stated in our contracts. Realized gains and losses from our oil and natural gas derivatives resulted in a net increase in oil and natural gas sales of $1.254 billion, or $2.17, per mcfe in 2006, a net decrease of $401.7 million, or $0.86, per mcfe in 2005 and a net decrease of $154.9 million, or $0.43, per mcfe in 2004. Oil and natural gas sales also include changes in the fair value of oil and natural gas derivatives that do not qualify as cash flow hedges under SFAS 133, as well as gains (losses) on ineffectiveness of instruments designated as cash flow hedges. Unrealized gains (losses) included in oil and natural gas sales in 2006, 2005 and 2004 were $495.5 million, $41.1 million and $40.9 million, respectively. Included in these unrealized gains (losses) are gains (losses) on ineffectiveness of cash flow hedges of $311.1 million in 2006, ($76.3) million in 2005 and ($8.2) million in 2004. Changes in the fair value of oil and natural gas derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, to the extent effective in offsetting cash flows attributable to the hedged commodities, and locked in gains and losses of derivative contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and are transferred to earnings in the month of related production. These unrealized gains (losses), net of related tax effects, totaled $545.9 million, 40 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements ($270.7) million and ($4.4) million as of December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Based upon the market prices at December 31, 2006, we expect to transfer to earnings approximately $282.5 million of the net gain included in the balance of accumulated other comprehensive income during the next 12 months. A detailed explanation of accounting for oil and natural gas derivatives under SFAS 133 appears under Application of Critical Accounting Policies Hedging elsewhere in this Item 7. The estimated fair values of our oil and natural gas derivative instruments as of December 31, 2006 and 2005 are provided below. The associated carrying values of these instruments are equal to the estimated fair values. December 31, 2006 2005 ($ in thousands) Derivative assets (liabilities): Fixed price natural gas swaps $ 1,075 $ (1,081,323 ) Natural gas basis protection swaps 186,970 307,308 Fixed price natural gas cap swaps 121,866 (161,056 ) Fixed price natural gas counter swaps (5,455 ) 37,785 Natural gas call options (a) (4,873 ) (21,461 ) Fixed price natural gas collars (6,922 ) (9,374 ) Floating price natural gas swaps 2,607 Fixed price oil swaps 28,149 (16,936 ) Fixed price oil cap swaps 24,057 (3,364 ) Estimated fair value $ 344,867 $ (945,814 ) (a) After adjusting for $15.4 million and $23.0 million of unrealized premiums, the cumulative unrealized gain related to these call options as of December 31, 2006 and 2005 was $10.5 million and $1.6 million, respectively. Additional information concerning the fair value of our oil and natural gas derivative instruments, including CNR derivatives assumed, is as follows: December 31, 2006 2005 2004 ($ in thousands) Fair value of contracts outstanding, as of January 1 $ (945,814 ) $ 38,350 $ (44,988 ) Change in fair value of contracts during the period 3,423,099 (771,076 ) (69,927 ) Fair value of contracts when entered into during the period (32,300 ) (614,772 ) (5,369 ) Contracts realized or otherwise settled during the period (1,253,653 ) 401,684 154,901 Fair value of contracts when closed during the period (846,465 ) 3,733 Fair value of contracts outstanding, as of December 31 $ 344,867 $ (945,814 ) $ 38,350 Interest Rate Derivatives We use interest rate derivatives to mitigate our exposure to the volatility in interest rates. For interest rate derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges (in accordance with SFAS 133), changes in fair value are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as assets (liabilities), and the debts carrying value amount is adjusted by the change in the fair value of the debt subsequent to the initiation of the derivative. Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments not qualifying as fair value hedges are recorded currently as adjustments to interest expense. 41 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Gains or losses from derivative transactions are reflected as adjustments to interest expense on the consolidated statements of operations. Realized gains (losses) included in interest expense were ($1.9) million, $4.9 million and $0.8 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Pursuant to SFAS 133, certain derivatives do not qualify for designation as fair value hedges. Changes in the fair value of these non qualifying derivatives that occur prior to their maturity (i.e., temporary fluctuations in value) are reported currently in the consolidated statements of operations as unrealized gains (losses) within interest expense. Unrealized gains (losses) included in interest expense were $1.6 million, $1.6 million and ($5.3) million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. A detailed explanation of accounting for interest rate derivatives under SFAS 133 appears under Application of Critical Accounting Policies Hedging elsewhere in this Item 7. Foreign Currency Derivatives On December 5, 2006, we issued 600 million of 6.25% Euro denominated Senior Notes due 2017. Concurrent with the issuance of the Euro denominated senior notes, we entered into a cross currency swap to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in the euro relative to the dollar over the term of the notes. A detailed explanation of accounting for foreign currency derivatives under SFAS 133 appears under Application of Critical Accounting Policies Hedging elsewhere in this Item 7. Results of Operations General. For the year ended December 31, 2006, Chesapeake had net income of $2.003 billion, or $4.35 per diluted common share, on total revenues of $7.326 billion. This compares to net income of $948.3 million, or $2.51 per diluted common share, on total revenues of $4.665 billion during the year ended December 31, 2005, and net income of $515.2 million, or $1.53 per diluted common share, on total revenues of $2.709 billion during the year ended December 31, 2004. Oil and Natural Gas Sales. During 2006, oil and natural gas sales were $5.619 billion compared to $3.273 billion in 2005 and $1.936 billion in 2004. In 2006, Chesapeake produced and sold 578.4 bcfe at a weighted average price of $8.86 per mcfe, compared to 468.6 bcfe in 2005 at a weighted average price of $6.90 per mcfe, and 362.6 bcfe in 2004 at a weighted average price of $5.23 per mcfe (weighted average prices for all years discussed exclude the effect of unrealized gains or (losses) on derivatives of $495.5 million, $41.1 million and $40.9 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively). The increase in prices in 2006 resulted in an increase in revenue of $1.135 billion and increased production resulted in a $757.2 million increase, for a total increase in revenues of $1.892 billion (excluding unrealized gains or losses on oil and natural gas derivatives). The increase in production from period to period was due to the combination of production growth from drilling as well as acquisitions completed during those periods. For 2006, we realized an average price per barrel of oil of $59.14, compared to $47.77 in 2005 and $28.33 in 2004 (weighted average prices for all years discussed exclude the effect of unrealized gains or losses on derivatives). Natural gas prices realized per mcf (excluding unrealized gains or losses on derivatives) were $8.76, $6.78 and $5.29 in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Realized gains or losses from our oil and natural gas derivatives resulted in a net increase in oil and natural gas revenues of $1.254 billion or $2.17 per mcfe in 2006, a net decrease of $401.7 million or $0.86 per mcfe in 2005 and a net decrease of $154.9 million or $0.43 per mcfe in 2004. A change in oil and natural gas prices has a significant impact on our oil and natural gas revenues and cash flows. Assuming 2006 production levels, a change of $0.10 per mcf of natural gas sold would result in an increase or decrease in revenues and cash flow of approximately $52.6 million and $50.1 million, respectively, and a change of $1.00 per barrel of oil sold would result in an increase or decrease in revenues and cash flow of approximately $8.7 million and $8.2 million, respectively, without considering the effect of hedging activities. 42 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The following table shows our production by region for 2006, 2005 and 2004: Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Mmcfe Percent Mmcfe Percent Mmcfe Percent Mid Continent 315,173 55 % 297,773 64 % 268,459 74 % Fort Worth Barnett Shale 44,482 7 17,409 4 Appalachian Basin 45,031 8 5,878 1 Permian and Delaware Basins 48,510 8 42,958 9 32,067 9 Ark La Tex 46,009 8 40,707 9 19,640 5 South Texas and Texas Gulf Coast 79,178 14 63,852 13 42,427 12 Total Production 578,383 100 % 468,577 100 % 362,593 100 % Natural gas production represented approximately 91% of our total production volume on an equivalent basis in 2006, compared to 90% in 2005 and 89% in 2004. Oil and Natural Gas Marketing Sales and Operating Expenses. Oil and natural gas marketing activities are substantially for third parties who are owners in Chesapeake operated wells. Chesapeake realized $1.576 billion in oil and natural gas marketing sales to third parties in 2006, with corresponding oil and natural gas marketing expenses of $1.522 billion, for a net margin before depreciation of $54 million. This compares to sales of $1.393 billion and $773 million, expenses of $1.358 billion and $755 million, and margins before depreciation of $35 million and $18 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively. In 2006 and 2005, Chesapeake realized an increase in volumes and prices related to oil and natural gas marketing sales as compared to the previous year. Service Operations Revenue and Operating Expenses. Service operations consist of third party revenue and operating expenses related to our company owned drilling and oilfield trucking operations. These operations have grown as a result of assets and businesses we acquired in 2006. Chesapeake recognized $130.3 million in service operations revenue in 2006 with corresponding service operations expenses of $67.9 million, for a net margin before depreciation of $62.4 million. During 2005 and 2004, service operations revenues and expenses for third parties were insignificant. Production Expenses. Production expenses, which include lifting costs and ad valorem taxes, were $489.5 million in 2006, compared to $317.0 million and $204.8 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively. On a unit of production basis, production expenses were $0.85 per mcfe in 2006 compared to $0.68 and $0.56 per mcfe in 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in 2006 was primarily due to higher third party field service costs, fuel costs, ad valorem tax increases and personnel costs. We expect that production expenses per mcfe produced for 2007 will range from $0.90 to $1.00. Production Taxes. Production taxes were $176.4 million in 2006 compared to $207.9 million in 2005 and $103.9 million in 2004. On a unit of production basis, production taxes were $0.31 per mcfe in 2006 compared to $0.44 per mcfe and $0.29 per mcfe in 2005 and 2004, respectively. The $31.5 million decrease in production taxes in 2006 is due primarily to a price decrease of approximately $1.06 per mcfe (excluding gains or losses on derivatives) which more than offset the 109.8 bcfe of increased production. In 2006, an accrual of $11.6 million for certain severance tax claims was reversed as the result of the dismissal of such claims. The $11.6 million accrual consisted of $2.1 million in accruals made during 2006 and $9.5 million in accruals made during 2005. Excluding these items, production taxes were $0.32 per mcfe in 2006 and $0.42 per mcfe in 2005. Included in 2004 is a credit of $6.8 million, or $0.02 per mcfe, related to certain Oklahoma severance tax abatements for the period July 2003 through December 2003. In April 2004, the Oklahoma Tax Commission concluded that a pre determined oil and natural gas price cap for 2003 sales had not been exceeded (on a statewide basis) and notified the company that it was eligible to receive certain severance tax abatements for the period from July 1, 2003 through June 30, 2004. The company had previously estimated that the average oil and natural gas sales 43 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements prices in Oklahoma (on a statewide basis) could exceed the price cap, and did not reflect the benefit from these potential severance tax abatements until the first quarter of 2004. In general, production taxes are calculated using value based formulas that produce higher per unit costs when oil and natural gas prices are higher. We expect production taxes per mcfe to range from $0.41 to $0.46 during 2007 based on NYMEX prices of $56.09 per barrel of oil and natural gas wellhead prices ranging from $7.50 to $8.50 per mcfe. General and Administrative Expense. General and administrative expenses, including stock based compensation but excluding internal costs capitalized to our oil and natural gas properties (see Note 11 of notes to consolidated financial statements), were $139.2 million in 2006, $64.3 million in 2005 and $37.0 million in 2004. General and administrative expenses were $0.24, $0.14 and $0.10 per mcfe for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in 2006 and 2005 was the result of the companys overall growth as well as cost and wage inflation. Included in general and administrative expenses is stock based compensation of $26.7 million in 2006, $15.3 million in 2005 and $4.8 million in 2004. Of this increase, $1.1 million was due to stock option expense, $10.2 million was due to a higher number of unvested restricted shares outstanding during 2006 compared to 2005 and $0.1 million was due to stock granted to a new director. We anticipate that general and administrative expenses for 2007 will be between $0.28 and $0.35 per mcfe produced, including stock based compensation ranging from $0.08 and $0.10 per mcfe produced. Our stock based compensation for employees and non employee directors is in the form of restricted stock. We have awarded shares of restricted stock to employees since January 2004 and to non employee directors since July 2005. Previously stock based compensation awards were in the form of stock options. Employee stock based compensation awards vest over a period of four years. Our non employee director awards vest over a period of three years. Until December 31, 2005, as permitted under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, as amended, we accounted for our stock options under the recognition and measurement provisions of APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related interpretations. Generally, we recognized no compensation cost on grants of employee and non employee director stock options because the exercise price was equal to the market price of our common stock on the date of grant. Effective January 1, 2006, we implemented the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123(R), Share Based Payment, using the modified prospective transition method. For all unvested options outstanding as of January 1, 2006, the previously measured but unrecognized compensation expense, based on the fair value at the original grant date, will be recognized in our financial statements over the remaining vesting period. For equity based compensation awards granted or modified subsequent to January 1, 2006, compensation expense based on the fair value on the date of grant or modification will be recognized in our financial statements over the vesting period. In addition, in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Staff Position No. FAS 123(R) 3, Transition Election Related to Accounting for the Tax Effects of Share Based Payment Awards, we elected to use the short cut method to calculate the historical pool of windfall tax benefits. Results for prior periods have not been restated. The discussion of stock based compensation in Note 1 and Note 9 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report provides additional detail on the accounting for and reporting of our stock options and restricted stock, as well as the effects of our adoption of SFAS 123(R). Chesapeake follows the full cost method of accounting under which all costs associated with property acquisition, exploration and development activities are capitalized. We capitalize internal costs that can be directly identified with our acquisition, exploration and development activities and do not include any costs related to production, general corporate overhead or similar activities. We capitalized $160.6 million, $102.2 million and $51.7 million of internal costs in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, directly related to our oil and natural gas property acquisition, exploration and development efforts. 44 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Oil and Natural Gas Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization. Depreciation, depletion and amortization of oil and natural gas properties was $1.359 billion, $894.0 million and $582.1 million during 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The average DD&A rate per mcfe, which is a function of capitalized costs, future development costs, and the related underlying reserves in the periods presented, was $2.35, $1.91 and $1.61 in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in the average rate from $1.91 in 2005 to $2.35 in 2006 is primarily the result of higher drilling costs, higher costs associated with acquisitions and the recognition of the tax effect of acquisition costs in excess of tax basis acquired in certain corporate acquisitions. We expect the 2007 DD&A rate to be between $2.40 and $2.60 per mcfe produced. Depreciation and Amortization of Other Assets. Depreciation and amortization of other assets was $104.2 million in 2006, compared to $51.0 million in 2005 and $29.2 million in 2004. The average D&A rate per mcfe was $0.18, $0.11 and $0.08 in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in 2006 and 2005 was primarily the result of higher depreciation costs resulting from the acquisition of various gathering facilities, compression equipment and drilling rig equipment, the construction of new buildings at our corporate headquarters complex and at various field office locations and the purchase of additional information technology equipment and software in 2006 and 2005. Property and equipment costs are depreciated on a straight line basis. Buildings are depreciated over 15 to 39 years, gathering facilities are depreciated over seven to 20 years, drilling rigs are depreciated over 15 years and all other property and equipment are depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from two to seven years. To the extent company owned drilling rigs are used to drill our wells, a substantial portion of the depreciation is capitalized in oil and natural gas properties as exploration or development costs. We expect 2007 depreciation and amortization of other assets to be between $0.24 and $0.28 per mcfe produced. Employee Retirement Expense. Our President and Chief Operating Officer, Tom L. Ward, resigned as a director, officer and employee of the company effective February 10, 2006. Mr. Wards Resignation Agreement provided for the immediate vesting of all of his unvested equity awards, which consisted of options to purchase 724,615 shares of Chesapeakes common stock at an average exercise price of $8.01 per share and 1,291,875 shares of restricted common stock. As a result of this vesting, we incurred an expense of $54.8 million in 2006. Provision for Legal Settlements. In 2004, we recorded a provision for legal settlement of $4.5 million related to various litigation incidental to our business operations. Interest and Other Income. Interest and other income was $25.5 million, $10.5 million and $4.5 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The 2006 income consisted of $5.2 million of interest income, $10.3 million related to equity investments, a $4.4 million gain on sale of assets and $5.6 million of miscellaneous income. The 2005 income consisted of $3.0 million of interest income, $1.8 million of income related to equity investments and $5.7 million of miscellaneous income. The 2004 income consisted of $2.1 million of interest income, $0.8 million of income related to earnings on investments, and $1.6 million of miscellaneous income. Interest Expense. Interest expense increased to $300.7 million in 2006 compared to $219.8 million in 2005 and $167.3 million in 2004 as follows: Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 ($ in millions) Interest expense on senior notes and revolving bank credit facility $ 472.2 $ 299.6 $ 194.5 Capitalized interest (179.1 ) (79.0 ) (36.2 ) Amortization of loan discount 7.3 5.7 4.5 Unrealized (gain) loss on interest rate derivatives (1.6 ) (1.6 ) 5.3 Realized (gain) loss on interest rate derivatives 1.9 (4.9 ) (0.8 ) Total interest expense $ 300.7 $ 219.8 $ 167.3 Average long term borrowings $ 6,278 $ 3,948 $ 2,428 45 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Interest expense, excluding unrealized (gains) losses on derivatives and net of amounts capitalized, was $0.52 per mcfe in 2006 compared to $0.47 per mcfe in 2005 and $0.45 per mcfe in 2004. We expect interest expense for 2007 to be between $0.60 and $0.65 per mcfe produced (before considering the effect of interest rate derivatives). Gain on Sale of Investment. In 2006, Chesapeake sold its investment in publicly traded Pioneer Drilling Company (Pioneer) common stock, realizing proceeds of $158.9 million and a gain of $117.4 million. We owned 17% of the common stock of Pioneer, which we began acquiring in 2003. Loss on Repurchases or Exchanges of Chesapeake Senior Notes. In 2005 and 2004, we repurchased or exchanged Chesapeake debt in order to re finance a portion of our long term debt at a lower rate of interest. The following table shows the losses we incurred in connection with these transactions ($ in millions): Notes Retired Loss on Repurchases/Exchanges For the Year Ended December 31, 2005: Premium Other (a) Total 8.375% Senior Notes due 2008 $ 19.0 $ 1.2 $ 0.1 $ 1.3 8.125% Senior Notes due 2011 245.4 17.3 4.4 21.7 9.0% Senior Notes due 2012 300.0 41.4 6.0 47.4 $ 564.4 $ 59.9 $ 10.5 $ 70.4 For the Year Ended December 31, 2004: 8.375% Senior Notes due 2008 $ 190.8 $ 16.1 $ 1.5 $ 17.6 8.5% Senior Notes due 2012 4.3 0.2 0.7 0.9 8.125% Senior Notes due 2011 482.8 6.0 6.0 $ 677.9 $ 16.3 $ 8.2 $ 24.5 (a) Includes write offs of discounts, deferred charges and interest rate derivatives associated with notes retired and transaction costs. Income Tax Expense. Chesapeake recorded income tax expense of $1.252 billion in 2006 compared to income tax expense of $545.1 million in 2005 and $289.8 million in 2004. Of the $706.9 million increase in 2006, $643.1 million was the result of the increase in net income before taxes and $63.8 million was the result of an increase in the effective tax rate. Our effective income tax rate was 38.5% in 2006 compared to 36.5% in 2005 and 36% in 2004. The increase in 2006 reflected the impact state income taxes and permanent differences had on our overall effective rate along with the effect of a Texas tax law change. In May 2006, Texas eliminated the existing franchise tax and replaced it with a new income based margin tax. The new tax is effective for tax returns due on or after January 1, 2008 for our 2007 business activity. We recorded a $15 million liability in 2006 to reflect the impact that this change had on our liability for additional deferred income taxes at the date of enactment. We expect our effective income tax rate to be 38% in 2007. Most of the 2006 income tax expense was deferred and we expect most of our 2007 income tax expense to be deferred. Loss on Conversion/Exchange of Preferred Stock. Loss on conversion/exchange of preferred stock was $10.6 million in 2006 compared to $26.9 million in 2005 and $36.7 million in 2004. The loss on the exchanges represented the excess of the fair value of the common stock issued over the fair value of the securities issuable pursuant to the original conversion terms. See Note 9 of notes to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further detail regarding these transactions. Application of Critical Accounting Policies Readers of this report and users of the information contained in it should be aware of how certain events may impact our financial results based on the accounting policies in place. The four policies we consider to be the most significant are discussed below. The companys management has discussed each critical accounting policy with the audit committee of the companys board of directors. 46 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The selection and application of accounting policies is an important process that changes as our business changes and as accounting rules are developed. Accounting rules generally do not involve a selection among alternatives, but involve an implementation and interpretation of existing rules and the use of judgment to the specific set of circumstances existing in our business. Hedging. Chesapeake uses commodity price and financial risk management instruments to mitigate our exposure to price fluctuations in oil and natural gas, changes in interest rates and changes in foreign exchange rates. Recognized gains and losses on derivative contracts are reported as a component of the related transaction. Results of oil and natural gas derivative transactions are reflected in oil and natural gas sales, and results of interest rate and foreign exchange rate hedging transactions are reflected in interest expense. The changes in the fair value of derivative instruments not qualifying for designation as either cash flow or fair value hedges that occur prior to maturity are reported currently in the consolidated statement of operations as unrealized gains (losses) within oil and natural gas sales or interest expense. Cash flows from derivative instruments are classified in the same category within the statement of cash flows as the items being hedged, or on a basis consistent with the nature of the instruments. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that derivative instruments (including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts) be recorded at fair value and included in the consolidated balance sheet as assets or liabilities. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation, which is established at the inception of a derivative. For derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, changes in fair value, to the extent the hedge is effective, are recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. Any change in the fair value resulting from ineffectiveness, as defined by SFAS 133, is recognized immediately in oil and natural gas sales. For derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges (in accordance with SFAS 133), changes in fair value, as well as the offsetting changes in the estimated fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, are recognized currently in earnings. Differences between the changes in the fair values of the hedged item and the derivative instrument, if any, represent gains or losses on ineffectiveness and are reflected currently in interest expense. Hedge effectiveness is measured at least quarterly based on the relative changes in fair value between the derivative contract and the hedged item over time. Changes in fair value of contracts that do not qualify as hedges or are not designated as hedges are also recognized currently in earnings. See Hedging Activities above and Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk for additional information regarding our hedging activities. One of the primary factors that can have an impact on our results of operations is the method used to value our derivatives. We have established the fair value of all derivative instruments using estimates determined by our counterparties and subsequently confirmed the fair values internally using established index prices and other sources. These values are based upon, among other things, futures prices, volatility, time to maturity and credit risk. The values we report in our financial statements change as these estimates are revised to reflect actual results, changes in market conditions or other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Another factor that can impact our results of operations each period is our ability to estimate the level of correlation between future changes in the fair value of the hedge instruments and the transactions being hedged, both at inception and on an ongoing basis. This correlation is complicated since energy commodity prices, the primary risk we hedge, have quality and location differences that can be difficult to hedge effectively. The factors underlying our estimates of fair value and our assessment of correlation of our hedging derivatives are impacted by actual results and changes in conditions that affect these factors, many of which are beyond our control. Due to the volatility of oil and natural gas prices and, to a lesser extent, interest rates and foreign exchange rates, the companys financial condition and results of operations can be significantly impacted by changes in the market value of our derivative instruments. As of December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, the net market value of our derivatives was an asset of $292.5 million, a liability of $968.3 million and an asset of $2.5 million, 47 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements respectively. The derivatives that we acquired in our CNR acquisition represented $254.4 million and $661.4 million of liability at December 31, 2006 and 2005. With respect to our derivatives held as of December 31, 2006, an increase or decrease in natural gas prices of $0.10 per mmbtu would decrease or increase the estimated fair value of our derivatives by approximately $45 million. An increase or decrease in crude oil prices of $1.00 per barrel would decrease or increase the estimated fair value of our derivatives by approximately $10 million. Oil and Natural Gas Properties. The accounting for our business is subject to special accounting rules that are unique to the oil and natural gas industry. There are two allowable methods of accounting for oil and natural gas business activities: the successful efforts method and the full cost method. Chesapeake follows the full cost method of accounting under which all costs associated with property acquisition, exploration and development activities are capitalized. We also capitalize internal costs that can be directly identified with our acquisition, exploration and development activities and do not include any costs related to production, general corporate overhead or similar activities. Under the successful efforts method, geological and geophysical costs and costs of carrying and retaining undeveloped properties are charged to expense as incurred. Costs of drilling exploratory wells that do not result in proved reserves are charged to expense. Depreciation, depletion, amortization and impairment of oil and natural gas properties are generally calculated on a well by well or lease or field basis versus the aggregated full cost pool basis. Additionally, gain or loss is generally recognized on all sales of oil and natural gas properties under the successful efforts method. As a result, our financial statements will differ from companies that apply the successful efforts method since we will generally reflect a higher level of capitalized costs as well as a higher oil and natural gas depreciation, depletion and amortization rate, and we will not have exploration expenses that successful efforts companies frequently have. Under the full cost method, capitalized costs are amortized on a composite unit of production method based on proved oil and natural gas reserves. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense is also based on the amount of estimated reserves. If we maintain the same level of production year over year, the depreciation, depletion and amortization expense may be significantly different if our estimate of remaining reserves changes significantly. Proceeds from the sale of properties are accounted for as reductions of capitalized costs unless such sales involve a significant change in the relationship between costs and the value of proved reserves or the underlying value of unproved properties, in which case a gain or loss is recognized. The costs of unproved properties are excluded from amortization until the properties are evaluated. We review all of our unevaluated properties quarterly to determine whether or not and to what extent proved reserves have been assigned to the properties, and otherwise if impairment has occurred. Unevaluated properties are grouped by major producing area where individual property costs are not significant and are assessed individually when individual costs are significant. We review the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties under the full cost accounting rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission on a quarterly basis. This quarterly review is referred to as a ceiling test. Under the ceiling test, capitalized costs, less accumulated amortization and related deferred income taxes, may not exceed an amount equal to the sum of the present value of estimated future net revenues (adjusted for cash flow hedges) less estimated future expenditures to be incurred in developing and producing the proved reserves, less any related income tax effects. In calculating future net revenues, current prices and costs used are those as of the end of the appropriate quarterly period. Such prices are utilized except where different prices are fixed and determinable from applicable contracts for the remaining term of those contracts, including the effects of derivatives qualifying as cash flow hedges. Two primary factors impacting this test are reserve levels and current prices, and their associated impact on the present value of estimated future net revenues. Revisions to estimates of natural gas and oil reserves and or an increase or decrease in prices can have a material impact on the present value of estimated future net revenues. Any excess of the net book value, less deferred income taxes, is generally written off as an expense. Under SEC regulations, the excess above the ceiling is not expensed (or is reduced) if, subsequent to the end of the period, but prior to the release of the financial statements, oil and natural gas prices increase sufficiently such that an excess above the ceiling would have been eliminated (or reduced) if the increased prices were used in the calculations. 48 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The process of estimating natural gas and oil reserves is very complex, requiring significant decisions in the evaluation of available geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data. The data for a given property may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors, including additional development activity, evolving production history and a continual reassessment of the viability of production under changing economic conditions. As a result, material revisions to existing reserve estimates occur from time to time. Although every reasonable effort is made to ensure that reserve estimates reported represent the most accurate assessments possible, the subjective decisions and variances in available data for various properties increase the likelihood of significant changes in these estimates. As of December 31, 2006, approximately 80% of our proved reserves were evaluated by independent petroleum engineers, with the balance evaluated by our internal reservoir engineers. In addition, our internal engineers review and update our reserves on a quarterly basis. All reserve estimates are prepared based upon a review of production histories and other geologic, economic, ownership and engineering data we developed. Additional information about our 2006 year end reserve evaluation is included under Oil and Natural Gas Reserves in Item 1 Business. In addition, the prices of natural gas and oil are volatile and change from period to period. Price changes directly impact the estimated revenues from our properties and the associated present value of future net revenues. Such changes also impact the economic life of our properties and thereby affect the quantity of reserves that can be assigned to a property. Income Taxes. As part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate the federal and state income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which Chesapeake operates. This process involves estimating the actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items, such as derivative instruments, depreciation, depletion and amortization, and certain accrued liabilities for tax and accounting purposes. These differences and our net operating loss carryforwards result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included in our consolidated balance sheet. We must then assess, using all available positive and negative evidence, the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income. If we believe that recovery is not likely, we must establish a valuation allowance. Generally, to the extent Chesapeake establishes a valuation allowance or increases or decreases this allowance in a period, we must include an expense or reduction of expense within the tax provisions in the consolidated statement of operations. Under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, an enterprise must use judgment in considering the relative impact of negative and positive evidence. The weight given to the potential effect of negative and positive evidence should be commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified. The more negative evidence that exists (a) the more positive evidence is necessary and (b) the more difficult it is to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed for some portion or all of the deferred tax asset. Among the more significant types of evidence that we consider are: taxable income projections in future years, whether the carryforward period is so brief that it would limit realization of tax benefits, future sales and operating cost projections that will produce more than enough taxable income to realize the deferred tax asset based on existing sales prices and cost structures, and our earnings history exclusive of the loss that created the future deductible amount coupled with evidence indicating that the loss is an aberration rather than a continuing condition. If (a) natural gas and oil prices were to decrease significantly below present levels (and if such decreases were considered other than temporary), (b) exploration, drilling and operating costs were to increase significantly beyond current levels, or (c) we were confronted with any other significantly negative evidence pertaining to our ability to realize our NOL carryforwards prior to their expiration, we may be required to provide a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. As of December 31, 2006, we had deferred tax assets of $407.0 million. 49 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Accounting for Business Combinations. Our business has grown substantially through acquisitions and our business strategy is to continue to pursue acquisitions as opportunities arise. We have accounted for all of our business combinations using the purchase method, which is the only method permitted under SFAS 141, Accounting for Business Combinations. The accounting for business combinations is complicated and involves the use of significant judgment. Under the purchase method of accounting, a business combination is accounted for at a purchase price based upon the fair value of the consideration given, whether in the form of cash, assets, stock or the assumption of liabilities. The assets and liabilities acquired are measured at their fair values, and the purchase price is allocated to the assets and liabilities based upon these fair values. The excess of the cost of an acquired entity, if any, over the net of the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill. The excess of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed over the cost of an acquired entity, if any, is allocated as a pro rata reduction of the amounts that otherwise would have been assigned to certain acquired assets. Determining the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired involves the use of judgment, since some of the assets and liabilities acquired do not have fair values that are readily determinable. Different techniques may be used to determine fair values, including market prices, where available, appraisals, comparisons to transactions for similar assets and liabilities and present value of estimated future cash flows, among others. Since these estimates involve the use of significant judgment, they can change as new information becomes available. We believe that the consideration we have paid for our oil and natural gas property acquisitions has represented the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired at the time of purchase. Consequently, we have not recognized any goodwill from any of our oil and natural gas property acquisitions, nor do we expect to recognize goodwill from similar business combinations that we may complete in the future. Disclosures About Effects of Transactions with Related Parties As of December 31, 2006, we had accrued accounts receivable from our CEO, Aubrey K. McClendon, of $11.1 million representing joint interest billings from December 2006 which were invoiced and paid in January 2007. Since Chesapeake was founded in 1989, Mr. McClendon has acquired working interests in virtually all of our oil and natural gas properties by participating in our drilling activities. Joint interest billings to him are settled in cash immediately upon delivery of a monthly joint interest billing. Under the Founder Well Participation Program, approved by our shareholders in June 2005, Mr. McClendon (and our co founder and former COO, Tom L. Ward prior to August 10, 2006) may elect to participate in all or none of the wells drilled by or on behalf of Chesapeake during a calendar year, but he is not allowed to participate only in selected wells. A participation election is required to be received by the Compensation Committee of Chesapeakes Board of Directors not less than 30 days prior to the start of each calendar year. His participation is permitted only under the terms outlined in the Founder Well Participation Program, which, among other things, limits his individual participation to a maximum working interest of 2.5% in a well and prohibits participation in situations where Chesapeakes working interest would be reduced below 12.5% as a result of his participation. In addition, the company is reimbursed for costs associated with leasehold acquired by Mr. McClendon as a result of his well participation. Mr. Wards participation in the Founder Well Participation Program terminated on August 10, 2006. As disclosed in Note 8, in 2006, Chesapeake had revenues of $867.3 million from oil and natural gas sales to Eagle Energy Partners I, L.P., an affiliated entity. Recently Issued Accounting Standards The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) recently issued the following standards which were reviewed by Chesapeake to determine the potential impact on our financial statements upon adoption. 50 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS 123(R), Share Based Payment, a revision of SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation. This statement establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services by requiring a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award. We adopted this statement effective January 1, 2006. The effect of SFAS 123(R) is more fully described in Note 1 of notes to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report. In September 2005, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) reached a consensus on Issue No. 04 13, Accounting for Purchases and Sales of Inventory with the Same Counterparty. EITF Issue No. 04 13 requires that purchases and sales of inventory with the same counterparty in the same line of business should be accounted for as a single non monetary exchange, if entered into in contemplation of one another. The consensus is effective for inventory arrangements entered into, modified or renewed in interim or annual reporting periods beginning after March 15, 2006. We adopted this issue effective April 1, 2006. The adoption of EITF Issue No. 04 13 did not have a material impact on our financial statements. In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109. FIN 48 provides guidance for recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions, as defined in SFAS 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. FIN 48 prescribes a threshold condition that a tax position must meet for any of the benefit of the uncertain tax position to be recognized in the financial statements. Guidance is also provided regarding de recognition, classification and disclosure of these uncertain tax positions. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. Based on our evaluation as of December 31, 2006, we do not expect that FIN 48 will have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In February 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 155, Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments an amendment of FASB Statements No. 133 and 140. SFAS 155 permits an entity to measure at fair value any financial instrument that contains an embedded derivative that otherwise would require bifurcation. This statement is effective for all financial instruments acquired or issued after the beginning of an entitys first fiscal year that begins after September 15, 2006. We are currently evaluating the provisions of SFAS 155 and believe that adoption will not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. This statement defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. We are currently assessing the impact SFAS 157 and believe that adoption will not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans. This statement requires an employer to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan (other than a multiemployer plan) as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through comprehensive income. This statement is effective as of the end of the fiscal year ending after December 15, 2006. SFAS 158 did not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Forward Looking Statements This report includes forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward looking statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future events. They include statements regarding oil and natural gas reserve estimates, planned capital expenditures, the drilling of oil and natural gas wells and future acquisitions, expected oil and natural gas production, cash flow and anticipated liquidity, business strategy and other plans and 51 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements objectives for future operations and expected future expenses. Statements concerning the fair values of derivative contracts and their estimated contribution to our future results of operations are based upon market information as of a specific date. These market prices are subject to significant volatility. Although we believe the expectations and forecasts reflected in these and other forward looking statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance they will prove to have been correct. They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expected results are described under Risk Factors in Item 1A of this report and include: the volatility of oil and natural gas prices, our level of indebtedness, the strength and financial resources of our competitors, the availability of capital on an economic basis to fund reserve replacement costs, our ability to replace reserves and sustain production, uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of oil and natural gas reserves and projecting future rates of production and the timing of development expenditures, uncertainties in evaluating oil and natural gas reserves of acquired properties and associated potential liabilities, inability to effectively integrate and operate acquired companies and properties, unsuccessful exploration and development drilling, declines in the value of our oil and natural gas properties resulting in ceiling test write downs, lower prices realized on oil and natural gas sales and collateral required to secure hedging liabilities resulting from our commodity price risk management activities, the negative effect lower oil and natural gas prices could have on our ability to borrow, drilling and operating risks, adverse effects of governmental and environmental regulation, and losses possible from pending or future litigation. We caution you not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this report, and we undertake no obligation to update this information. We urge you to carefully review and consider the disclosures made in this report and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission that attempt to advise interested parties of the risks and factors that may affect our business. ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Oil and Natural Gas Hedging Activities Our results of operations and operating cash flows are impacted by changes in market prices for oil and natural gas. To mitigate a portion of the exposure to adverse market changes, we have entered into various derivative instruments. As of December 31, 2006, our oil and natural gas derivative instruments were comprised of swaps, cap swaps, basis protection swaps, call options and collars. These instruments allow us to predict with greater certainty the effective oil and natural gas prices to be received for our hedged production. Although derivatives often fail to achieve 100% effectiveness for accounting purposes, we believe our derivative instruments continue to be highly effective in achieving the risk management objectives for which they were intended. For swap instruments, Chesapeake receives a fixed price for the hedged commodity and pays a floating market price to the counterparty. The fixed price payment and the floating price payment are netted, resulting in a net amount due to or from the counterparty. 52 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements For cap swaps, Chesapeake receives a fixed price and pays a floating market price. The fixed price received by Chesapeake includes a premium in exchange for a cap limiting the counterpartys exposure. In other words, there is no limit to Chesapeakes exposure but there is a limit to the downside exposure of the counterparty. Basis protection swaps are arrangements that guarantee a price differential for oil or natural gas from a specified delivery point. For Mid Continent natural gas basis protection swaps, which have negative differentials to NYMEX, Chesapeake receives a payment from the counterparty if the price differential is greater than the stated terms of the contract and pays the counterparty if the price differential is less than the stated terms of the contract. For Appalachian Basin basis natural gas protection swaps, which have positive differentials to NYMEX, Chesapeake receives a payment from the counterparty if the price differential is less than the stated terms of the contract and pays the counterparty if the price differential is greater than the stated terms of the contract. For call options, Chesapeake receives a cash premium from the counterparty in exchange for the sale of a call option. If the market price exceeds the fixed price of the call option, Chesapeake pays the counterparty such excess. If the market price settles below the fixed price of the call option, no payment is due from Chesapeake. Collars contain a fixed floor price (put) and ceiling price (call). If the market price exceeds the call strike price or falls below the put strike price, Chesapeake receives the fixed price and pays the market price. If the market price is between the call and the put strike price, no payments are due from either party. Chesapeake enters into counter swaps from time to time for the purpose of locking in the value of a swap. Under the counter swap, Chesapeake receives a floating price for the hedged commodity and pays a fixed price to the counterparty. The counter swap is 100% effective in locking in the value of a swap since subsequent changes in the market value of the swap are entirely offset by subsequent changes in the market value of the counter swap. We refer to this locked in value as a locked swap. Generally, at the time Chesapeake enters into a counter swap, Chesapeake removes the original swaps designation as a cash flow hedge and classifies the original swap as a non qualifying hedge under SFAS 133. The reason for this new designation is that collectively the swap and the counter swap no longer hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows. Instead, the swap and counter swap effectively lock in a specific gain (or loss) that will be unaffected by subsequent variability in oil and natural gas prices. Any locked in gain or loss is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and reclassified to oil and natural gas sales in the month of related production. With respect to counter swaps that are designed to lock in the value of cap swaps, the counter swap is effective in locking in the value of the cap swap until the floating price reaches the cap (or floor) stipulated in the cap swap agreement. The value of the counter swap will increase (or decrease), but in the opposite direction, as the value of the cap swap decreases (or increases) until the floating price reaches the pre determined cap (or floor) stipulated in the cap swap agreement. However, because of the written put option embedded in the cap swap, the changes in value of the cap swap are not completely effective in offsetting changes in value of the corresponding counter swap. Changes in the value of cap swaps and counter swaps are recorded as adjustments to oil and natural gas sales. In accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 39, to the extent that a legal right of setoff exists, Chesapeake nets the value of its derivative arrangements with the same counterparty in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Gains or losses from derivative transactions are reflected as adjustments to oil and natural gas sales in the consolidated statements of operations. Realized gains (losses) included in oil and natural gas sales were $1.254 billion, ($401.7) million and ($154.9) million in the 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Pursuant to SFAS 133, certain derivatives do not qualify for designation as cash flow hedges. Changes in the fair value of these non qualifying derivatives that occur prior to their maturity (i.e., temporary fluctuations in value) are reported 53 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements currently in the consolidated statements of operations as unrealized gains (losses) within oil and natural gas sales. Unrealized gains (losses) included in oil and natural gas sales were $495.5 million, $41.1 million and $40.9 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Following provisions of SFAS 133, changes in the fair value of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, to the extent they are effective in offsetting cash flows attributable to the hedged risk, are recorded in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. Any change in fair value resulting from ineffectiveness is recognized currently in oil and natural gas sales as unrealized gains (losses). We recorded an unrealized gain (loss) on ineffectiveness of $311.1 million, ($76.3) million and ($8.2) million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

In accordance with SFAS 141, these derivative positions were recorded at fair value in the purchase price allocation as a liability of $592 million. The recognition of the derivative liability and other assumed liabilities resulted in an increase in the total purchase price which was allocated to the assets acquired. Because of this accounting treatment, only cash settlements for changes in fair value subsequent to the acquisition date for the derivative positions assumed result in adjustments to our oil and natural gas revenues upon settlement. For example, if the fair value of the derivative positions assumed do not change, then upon the sale of the underlying production and corresponding settlement of the derivative positions, cash would be paid to the counterparties and there would be no adjustment to oil and natural gas revenues related to the derivative positions. If, however, the actual sales price is different from the price assumed in the original fair value calculation, the difference would be reflected as either a decrease or increase in oil and natural gas revenues, depending upon whether the sales price was higher or lower, respectively, than the prices assumed in the original fair value calculation. For accounting purposes, the net effect of these acquired hedges is that we hedged the production volumes at market prices on the date of our acquisition of CNR. Pursuant to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 149, Amendment of SFAS 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, the derivative instruments assumed in connection with the CNR acquisition 55 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements are deemed to contain a significant financing element and all cash flows associated with these positions are reported as financing activity in the statement of cash flows for the periods in which settlement occurs.

The actual contribution to our future results of operations will be based on the market prices at the time of settlement and may be more or less than the fair value estimates used at December 31, 2006. Based upon the market prices at December 31, 2006, we expect to transfer approximately $282.5 million (net of income taxes) of the gain included in the balance in accumulated other comprehensive income to earnings during the next 12 months in the related month of production. All transactions hedged as of December 31, 2006 are expected to mature by December 31, 2009. 56 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Additional information concerning the fair value of our oil and natural gas derivative instruments, including CNR derivatives assumed, is as follows: December 31, 2006 2005 2004 ($ in thousands) Fair value of contracts outstanding, as of January 1 $ (945,814 ) $ 38,350 $ (44,988 ) Change in fair value of contracts during the period 3,423,099 (771,076 ) (69,927 ) Fair value of contracts when entered into during the period (32,300 ) (614,772 ) (5,369 ) Contracts realized or otherwise settled during the period (1,253,653 ) 401,684 154,901 Fair value of contracts when closed during the period (846,465 ) 3,733 Fair value of contracts outstanding, as of December 31 $ 344,867 $ (945,814 ) $ 38,350 The change in the fair value of our derivative instruments since January 1, 2006 resulted from the settlement of derivatives for a realized gain, as well as a decrease in natural gas prices. Derivative instruments reflected as current in the consolidated balance sheet represent the estimated fair value of derivative instrument settlements scheduled to occur over the subsequent twelve month period based on market prices for oil and natural gas as of the consolidated balance sheet date. The derivative settlement amounts are not due and payable until the month in which the related underlying hedged transaction occurs. In 2006, Chesapeake lifted a portion of its 2007, 2008 and 2009 hedges and as a result received $744.1 million in cash from its hedging counterparties. The gain has been recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and in oil and natural gas sales based on the designation of the hedges. For amounts initially recorded in other comprehensive income, the gain will be recognized in oil and natural gas sales in the month of the hedged production. Interest Rate Risk The table below presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates. As of December 31, 2006, the fair value of the fixed rate long term debt has been estimated based on quoted market prices. Years of Maturity 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Total Fair Value ($ in billions) Liabilities: Long term debt fixed rate (a) $ $ $ $ $ $ 7.316 $ 7.316 $ 7.336 Average interest rate 6.5 % 6.5 % 6.5 % Long term debt variable rate $ $ $ $ $ 0.178 $ $ 0.178 $ 0.178 Average interest rate 8.25 % 8.25 % 8.25 % (a) This amount does not include the discount included in long term debt of ($101.9) million and the discount for interest rate swaps of ($17.0) million. Changes in interest rates affect the amount of interest we earn on our cash, cash equivalents and short term investments and the interest rate we pay on borrowings under our revolving bank credit facility. All of our other long term indebtedness is fixed rate and, therefore, does not expose us to the risk of earnings or cash flow loss due to changes in market interest rates. However, changes in interest rates do affect the fair value of our debt. 57 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Interest Rate Derivatives We use interest rate derivatives to mitigate our exposure to the volatility in interest rates. For interest rate derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges (in accordance with SFAS 133), changes in fair value are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as assets (liabilities), and the debts carrying value amount is adjusted by the change in the fair value of the debt subsequent to the initiation of the derivative. Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments not qualifying as fair value hedges are recorded currently as adjustments to interest expense. Gains or losses from derivative transactions are reflected as adjustments to interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations. Realized gains (losses) included in interest expense were ($1.9) million, $4.9 million and $0.8 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Pursuant to SFAS 133, certain derivatives do not qualify for designation as fair value hedges. Changes in the fair value of these non qualifying derivatives that occur prior to their maturity (i.e., temporary fluctuations in value) are reported currently in the consolidated statements of operations as unrealized gains (losses) within interest expense. Unrealized gains (losses) included in interest expense were $1.6 million, $1.6 million and ($5.3) million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. As of December 31, 2006, the following interest rate swaps used to convert a portion of our long term fixed rate debt to floating rate debt were outstanding: Term Notional Amount Fixed Rate Floating Rate Fair Value ($ in thousands) September 2004 August 2012 $ 75,000,000 9.000 % 6 month LIBOR plus 452 basis points $(2,695) July 2005 January 2015 $ 150,000,000 7.750 % 6 month LIBOR plus 289 basis points (5,866) July 2005 June 2014 $ 150,000,000 7.500 % 6 month LIBOR plus 282 basis points (6,133) September 2005 August 2014 $ 250,000,000 7.000 % 6 month LIBOR plus 205.5 basis points (6,807) October 2005 June 2015 $ 200,000,000 6.375 % 6 month LIBOR plus 112 basis points (2,860) October 2005 January 2018 $ 250,000,000 6.250 % 6 month LIBOR plus 99 basis points (6,334) December 2006 July 2013 $ 250,000,000 7.625 % 6 month LIBOR plus 266.5 basis points (2,755) $(33,450) In 2006, we closed six interest rate swaps for gains totaling $5.7 million. These interest rate swaps were designated as fair value hedges, and the settlement amounts received will be amortized as a reduction to realized interest expense over the remaining terms of the related senior notes. Subsequent to December 31, 2006, we closed one interest rate swap for a gain of $1.0 million. Subsequent to December 31, 2006, we entered into the following interest rate swaps (which qualify as fair value hedges) to convert a portion of our long term fixed rate debt to floating rate debt: Term Notional Amount Fixed Rate Floating Rate January 2007 July 2013 $ 250,000,000 7.625 % 6 month LIBOR plus 251 basis points January 2007 August 2017 $ 250,000,000 6.500 % 6 month LIBOR plus 124.5 basis points Additionally, subsequent to December 31, 2006, we sold call options to a counterparty with respect to these two interest rate swaps and received $3.7 million in premiums. If exercised, the call option on the 7.625% interest rate swap gives the counterparty the right to terminate the interest rate swap on July 12, 2007 for a payment to Chesapeake of $2.0 million. The call option on the 6.50% interest rate swap gives the counterparty the right to terminate the interest rate swap on August 15, 2007 for a payment of $2.0 million to Chesapeake. Foreign Currency Derivatives On December 5, 2006, we issued 600 million of 6.25% Euro denominated Senior Notes due 2017. Concurrent with the issuance of the Euro denominated senior notes, we entered into a cross currency swap 58 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in the euro relative to the dollar over the term of the notes. Under the terms of the cross currency swap, on each semi annual interest payment date, the counterparties will pay Chesapeake 18.75 million and Chesapeake will pay the counterparties $29.95 million, which will yield an annual dollar equivalent interest rate of 7.491%. Upon maturity of the notes, the counterparties will pay Chesapeake 600 million and Chesapeake will pay the counterparties $799.5 million. The terms of the cross currency swap were based on the dollar/euro exchange rate on the issuance date of $1.3325 to 1.00. Through the cross currency swap, we have eliminated any potential variability in Chesapeakes expected cash flows related to changes in foreign exchange rates and therefore the swap qualifies as a cash flow hedge under SFAS 133. The euro denominated debt is recorded in notes payable ($791.8 million at December 31, 2006) using an exchange rate of $1.3197 to 1.00. The cross currency swap is recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at a fair value of ($18.9) million at December 31, 2006. The translation adjustment to notes payable is completely offset by the fair value of the cross currency swap and therefore there is no impact to the consolidated statement of operations. The remaining value of the cross currency swap related to future interest payments is reported in other comprehensive income. 59 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements
