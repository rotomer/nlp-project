We manage our business as three separate operational segments: exploration and production; marketing; and service operations, which is comprised of our wholly owned drilling and trucking operations. We refer you to Note 8 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements appearing in Item 8 of this report, which summarizes by segment our net income and capital expenditures for 2007, 2006 and 2005 and our assets as of December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005. Executive Summary We are the third largest producer of natural gas in the United States (first among independents). We own interests in approximately 38,500 producing oil and natural gas wells that are currently producing approximately 2.2 bcfe per day, 92% of which is natural gas. Our strategy is focused on discovering, acquiring and developing conventional and unconventional natural gas reserves onshore in the U.S., east of the Rocky Mountains. Our most important operating area has historically been in various conventional plays in the Mid Continent region of Oklahoma, Arkansas, southwestern Kansas and the Texas Panhandle. At December 31, 2007, 47% of our estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves were located in the Mid Continent region. During the past five years, we have also built significant positions in various conventional and unconventional plays in the Fort Worth Basin in north central Texas; the Appalachian Basin, principally in West Virginia, eastern Kentucky, eastern Ohio, Pennsylvania and southern New York; the Permian and Delaware Basins of West Texas and eastern New Mexico; the Ark La Tex area of East Texas and northern Louisiana; and the South Texas and Texas Gulf Coast regions. We have established a top three position in nearly every major unconventional play onshore in the U.S. east of the Rockies, including the Barnett Shale, the Arkansas Fayetteville Shale, the Appalachian Basin Devonian and Marcellus Shales, the Arkoma and Ardmore Basins Woodford Shale in Oklahoma, the Delaware Basin Barnett and Woodford Shales in West Texas, and the Alabama Conasauga and Chattanooga Shales. Oil and natural gas production for 2007 was 714.3 bcfe, an increase of 135.9 bcfe, or 23% over the 578.4 bcfe produced in 2006. We have increased our production for 18 consecutive years and 26 consecutive quarters. During these 26 quarters, Chesapeakes U.S. production has increased 467% for an average compound quarterly growth rate of 7% and an average compound annual growth rate of 30%. During 2007, Chesapeake continued the industrys most active drilling program and drilled 1,992 gross (1,695 net) operated wells and participated in another 1,679 gross (224 net) wells operated by other companies. The companys drilling success rate was 99% for company operated wells and 97% for non operated wells. Also during 2007, we invested $4.3 billion in operated wells (using an average of 140 operated rigs) and $708 million in non operated wells (using an average of 105 non operated rigs). Total costs incurred in oil and natural gas acquisition, exploration and development activities during 2007, including seismic, unproved properties, leasehold, capitalized interest and internal costs, non cash tax basis step up and asset retirement obligations, were $7.6 billion. Chesapeake began 2007 with estimated proved reserves of 8.956 tcfe and ended the year with 10.879 tcfe, an increase of 1.923 tcfe, or 21%. During 2007, we replaced 714 bcfe of production with an internally estimated 2.637 tcfe of new proved reserves, for a reserve replacement rate of 369%. Reserve replacement through the drillbit was 2.468 tcfe, or 346% of production and 94% of the total increase (including 1.248 tcfe of positive performance revisions and 97 bcfe of positive revisions resulting from oil and natural gas price increases between December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2007). Reserve replacement through the acquisition of proved reserves was 377 bcfe, or 53% of production and 14% of the total increase. During 2007, we divested 208 bcfe of proved 32 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements reserves. Our annual decline rate on producing properties is projected to be 28% from 2008 to 2009, 18% from 2009 to 2010, 14% from 2010 to 2011, 12% from 2011 to 2012 and 10% from 2012 to 2013. Our percentage of proved undeveloped reserve additions to total proved reserve additions was approximately 29% in 2007, 38% in 2006 and 36% in 2005. Based on our current drilling schedule and budget, we expect that virtually all of the proved undeveloped reserves added in 2007 will begin producing within the next three to five years. Generally, proved developed reserves are producing at the time they are added or will begin producing within one year. Since 2000, Chesapeake has invested $9.4 billion in new leasehold and 3 D seismic acquisitions and now owns what we believe are the largest combined inventories of onshore leasehold (13 million net acres) and 3 D seismic (19 million acres) in the U.S. On this leasehold, the company has approximately 36,300 net drillsites representing more than a 10 year inventory of drilling projects. As of December 31, 2007, the companys debt as a percentage of total capitalization (total capitalization is the sum of debt and stockholders equity) was 47% compared to 40% as of December 31, 2006. The average maturity of our long term debt is almost nine years with an average interest rate of approximately 5.8%. Liquidity and Capital Resources 2008 2009 Financial Plan In early September 2007, we announced an enhanced financial plan designed to monetize unrecognized balance sheet value and to fully fund our planned capital expenditures through 2009 without accessing public capital markets. Since then, we have successfully implemented multiple aspects of the plan and anticipate further progress during 2008 and 2009. We believe our planned transactions described below will allow us to monetize approximately $3 billion of assets by the end of 2009. Sale/Leasebacks. During 2007, we entered into sale/leaseback transactions involving 54 drilling rigs for net proceeds of approximately $369 million. We now operate a total of 78 rigs under sale/leaseback arrangements and anticipate similar transactions on our remaining 3 rigs during 2008, thereby completing the sale/leaseback of our entire fleet of 81 drilling rigs. Also during 2007, we completed a sale/leaseback facility for our natural gas compression assets. We received approximately $188 million for the sale/leaseback of our existing natural gas compression assets, and we will finance up to $175 million of future natural gas compression assets under the same facility. Producing Property Sales. In December 2007, we monetized a portion of our proved reserves and production in certain Chesapeake operated producing assets in Kentucky and West Virginia. In this transaction, we sold a volumetric production payment (VPP) to affiliates of UBS AG and DB Energy Trading LLC (a subsidiary of Deutsche Bank AG) for proceeds of approximately $1.1 billion. The VPP entitles the purchaser to receive scheduled quantities of natural gas from Chesapeakes interests in over 4,000 producing wells, free of all production costs and production taxes, over a 15 year period. The transaction included approximately 208 bcfe of proved reserves and 55 mmcfe per day of net production, or approximately 2% of our proved reserves and net production as of December 31, 2007. We have retained drilling rights on the properties below currently producing intervals and outside of existing producing wellbores. In addition, we plan to pursue monetizations of similarly mature properties in 2008 and 2009 for estimated proceeds of approximately $2.0 billion. In the first quarter of 2008, we sold non core oil and natural gas assets in the Rocky Mountains and in the Arkoma Basin Woodford Shale play for proceeds of approximately $250 million. Midstream Partnership. We are currently in the process of forming a private partnership to own a non operating interest in our midstream natural gas assets outside of Appalachia, which consist primarily of natural gas gathering systems and treating assets. We anticipate raising $1 billion in the first half of 2008 by selling a minority interest in the partnership. 33 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Sources and Uses of Funds Cash flow from operations is our primary source of liquidity to meet operating expenses and fund capital expenditures (other than for acquisitions outside our budgeted leasehold and property acquisitions). Cash provided by operating activities was $4.932 billion in 2007, compared to $4.843 billion in 2006 and $2.407 billion in 2005. The $89 million increase from 2006 to 2007 was primarily due to higher volumes of oil and natural gas production. The $2.436 billion increase from 2005 to 2006 was primarily due to higher realized prices and higher volumes of oil and natural gas production. Changes in cash flow from operations are largely due to the same factors that affect our net income, excluding non cash items, such as depreciation, depletion and amortization, deferred income taxes and unrealized gains and (losses) on derivatives. Net income decreased to $1.451 billion in 2007 from $2.003 billion in 2006 compared to $948 million in 2005 and is discussed below under Results of Operations. Changes in market prices for oil and natural gas directly impact the level of our cash flow from operations. While a decline in oil or natural gas prices would affect the amount of cash flow that would be generated from operations, we currently (as of February 21, 2008) have oil hedges in place covering 94% of our expected oil production in 2008 and 87% of our expected natural gas production in 2008, thereby providing price certainty for a substantial portion of our future cash flow. Our oil and natural gas hedges as of December 31, 2007 are detailed in Item 7A of Part II of this report. We have arrangements with our hedging counterparties that allow us to minimize the potential liquidity impact of significant mark to market fluctuations in the value of our oil and natural gas hedges by making collateral allocations from our bank credit facility or directly pledging oil and natural gas properties, rather than posting cash or letters of credit with the counterparties. Depending on changes in oil and natural gas futures markets and managements view of underlying oil and natural gas supply and demand trends, we may increase or decrease our current hedging positions. Our bank credit facility is another source of liquidity. On November 2, 2007, we amended and restated our syndicated revolving bank credit facility to increase the borrowing base to $3.5 billion (with commitments of $3.0 billion) and extended the maturity to November 2012. We subsequently increased the commitments under the credit facility to $3.5 billion. The amendment reflects the increased scale and scope of our operations and will help accommodate timing differences between cash flow from operations, asset monetizations and planned capital expenditures. At February 26, 2008, there was $596 million of borrowing capacity available under the revolving bank credit facility. We use the facility to fund daily operating activities and acquisitions as needed. We borrowed $7.9 billion and repaid $6.2 billion in 2007, we borrowed $8.4 billion and repaid $8.3 billion in 2006, and we borrowed $5.7 billion and repaid $5.7 billion in 2005 under the bank credit facility. In 2007, we completed two public offerings of our 2.5% Contingent Convertible Senior Notes due 2037. In the first offering, in May 2007, we issued $1.150 billion of notes and in the second offering, in August 2007, we issued $500 million of notes. Net proceeds of approximately $1.124 billion and $483 million, respectively, were used to repay outstanding borrowings under our revolving bank credit facility. The following table reflects the proceeds from sales of securities we issued in 2007, 2006 and 2005, ($ in millions): 2007 2006 2005 TotalProceeds NetProceeds TotalProceeds NetProceeds TotalProceeds NetProceeds Unsecured senior notes $ $ $ 1,799 $ 1,755 $ 2,300 $ 2,252 Contingent convertible unsecured senior notes 1,650 1,607 690 673 Convertible preferred stock 575 558 1,380 1,341 Common stock 1,800 1,759 1,025 986 Total $ 1,650 $ 1,607 $ 4,174 $ 4,072 $ 5,395 $ 5,252 In December 2007, we sold a portion of our proved reserves and production in certain Chesapeake operated producing assets in Kentucky and West Virginia. In this transaction, we sold a volumetric production payment (VPP) for proceeds of $1.1 billion, net of transaction costs. 34 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements We believe our cash flow from operations, in combination with the proceeds expected from our planned producing property monetizations and other asset sales and the $1 billion increase in capacity under our bank credit facility will provide us with sufficient liquidity to execute our business strategy without accessing the public capital markets for the foreseeable future. We intend to use any cash in excess of our operating and capital expenditure needs to pay down indebtedness under our revolving bank credit facility. Our primary use of funds is on capital expenditures for exploration, development and acquisition of oil and natural gas properties. We refer you to the table under Investing Transactions below, which sets forth the components of our oil and natural gas investing activities for 2007, 2006 and 2005. Our drilling, land and seismic capital expenditures are currently budgeted at $5.9 billion to $6.5 billion in 2008. We believe this level of exploration and development will enable us to increase our proved oil and natural gas reserves by more than 14% in 2008 and increase our total production by 19% to 21% in 2008 (inclusive of acquisitions completed or scheduled to close in 2008 through the filing date of this report but without regard to any additional acquisitions that may be completed in 2008). We retain a significant degree of control over the timing of our capital expenditures which permits us to defer or accelerate certain capital expenditures if necessary to address any potential liquidity issues. In addition, higher drilling and field operating costs, drilling results that alter planned development schedules, acquisitions or other factors could cause us to revise our drilling program, which is largely discretionary. We paid dividends on our common stock of $115 million, $87 million and $60 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend on common stock from $0.06 to $0.0675 per share beginning with the dividend paid in July 2007. We paid dividends on our preferred stock of $95 million, $88 million and $31 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. In 2007, holders of our 5.0% (Series 2005) cumulative convertible preferred stock and 6.25% mandatory convertible preferred stock exchanged 4,535,880 shares and 2,156,184 shares for 19,038,891 and 17,367,823 shares of common stock, respectively, in public exchange offers. The exchange resulted in a loss on conversion of $128 million. We received $15 million, $73 million and $21 million from the exercise of employee and director stock options in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. We paid $86 million and $4 million to purchase treasury stock in 2006 and 2005, respectively. Of these amounts, $11 million and $4 million were used to fund our matching contribution to our 401(k) plans in 2006 and 2005, respectively. The remaining $75 million in 2006 was used to purchase shares of common stock to be used upon the exercise of stock options under certain stock option plans. There were no treasury stock purchases made in 2007. In 2007, 2006 and 2005, we paid $91 million, $87 million and $12 million, respectively, to settle a portion of the derivative liabilities assumed in our 2005 acquisition of Columbia Natural Resources, LLC. On January 1, 2006, we adopted SFAS 123(R), which requires tax benefits resulting from stock based compensation deductions in excess of amounts reported for financial reporting purposes to be reported as cash flows from financing activities. In 2007 and 2006, we reported a tax benefit from stock based compensation of $20 million and $88 million, respectively. Outstanding payments from certain disbursement accounts in excess of funded cash balances where no legal right of set off exists decreased by $98 million, increased by $70 million and increased by $61 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. All disbursements are funded on the day they are presented to our bank using available cash on hand or draws on our revolving bank credit facility. 35 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Historically, we have used significant funds to redeem or purchase and retire outstanding senior notes issued by Chesapeake, although we had no such transactions in 2007 and 2006. The following table shows our redemption, purchases and exchanges of senior notes for 2005 ($ in millions): Senior Notes Activity For the Year Ended December 31, 2005: Retired Premium Other (a) Issued Cash Paid 8.375% Senior Notes due 2008 $ 19 $ 1 $ $ $ 20 8.125% Senior Notes due 2011 245 17 1 263 9.0% Senior Notes due 2012 300 42 1 343 $ 564 $ 60 $ 2 $ $ 626 (a) Includes adjustments to accrued interest and discount associated with notes retired and new notes issued, cash in lieu of fractional notes, transaction costs and fair value hedging adjustments. Our accounts receivable are primarily from purchasers of oil and natural gas ($798 million at December 31, 2007) and exploration and production companies which own interests in properties we operate ($175 million at December 31, 2007). This industry concentration has the potential to impact our overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively, in that our customers and joint working interest owners may be similarly affected by changes in economic, industry or other conditions. We generally require letters of credit for receivables from parties which are judged to have sub standard credit, unless the credit risk can otherwise be mitigated. Investing Transactions Cash used in investing activities decreased to $7.922 billion in 2007, compared to $8.942 billion in 2006 and $6.921 billion in 2005. Over the past year, we have accelerated our drilling program and shifted our acquisition strategy from significant stock and asset acquisitions to targeted leasehold and property acquisitions needed for planned oil and natural gas development. Our investing activities during 2007 reflected our increasing focus on converting our resource inventory into production as well as elements of our new financial plan. The following table shows our cash used in (provided by) investing activities during 2007, 2006 and 2005 ($ in millions): Oil and Natural Gas Investing Activities: 2007 2006 2005 Acquisitions of oil and natural gas companies and proved properties, net ofcash acquired $ 520 $ 1,104 $ 2,759 Acquisition of leasehold and unproved properties 2,187 3,301 1,591 Exploration and development of oil and natural gas properties 4,962 3,009 1,793 Geological and geophysical costs 343 154 71 Interest on leasehold and unproved properties 254 172 76 Proceeds from sale of volumetric production payment (1,089 ) Deposits for acquisitions 15 21 35 Other oil and natural gas activities (2 ) Total oil and natural gas investing activities 7,192 7,761 6,323 Other Investing Activities: Additions to other property and equipment 1,310 594 417 Additions to drilling rig equipment 129 393 67 Proceeds from sale of drilling rigs and equipment (369 ) (244 ) Proceeds from sale of compressors (188 ) Additions to investments 8 554 135 Proceeds from sale of investments (124 ) (159 ) Acquisition of trucking company, net of cash acquired 45 Sale of non oil and natural gas assets (36 ) (2 ) (21 ) Other Total other investing activities 730 1,181 598 Total cash used in investing activities $ 7,922 $ 8,942 $ 6,921 36 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Bank Credit and Hedging Facilities On November 2, 2007, we amended and restated our syndicated revolving bank credit facility to increase the borrowing base to $3.5 billion (with commitments of $3.0 billion) and extended the maturity to November 2012. We subsequently increased the commitments under the credit facility to $3.5 billion. As of December 31, 2007, we had $1.950 billion in outstanding borrowings under this facility and had utilized approximately $5 million of the facility for various letters of credit. Borrowings under the facility are secured by certain producing oil and natural gas properties and bear interest at our option of either (i) the greater of the reference rate of Union Bank of California, N.A., or the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50% or (ii) London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), plus a margin that varies from 0.75% to 1.50% per annum according to our senior unsecured long term debt ratings. The collateral value and borrowing base are redetermined periodically. The unused portion of the facility is subject to a commitment fee that also varies according to our senior unsecured long term debt ratings, from 0.125% to 0.30% per annum. Currently the commitment fee is 0.20% per annum. Interest is payable quarterly or, if LIBOR applies, it may be payable at more frequent intervals. Our subsidiaries, Chesapeake Exploration, L.L.C. and Chesapeake Appalachia, L.L.C., are the borrowers under our revolving bank credit facility and Chesapeake and all its other wholly owned subsidiaries except minor subsidiaries are guarantors. The credit facility agreement contains various covenants and restrictive provisions which limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness, make investments or loans and create liens. The credit facility agreement requires us to maintain an indebtedness to total capitalization ratio (as defined) not to exceed 0.70 to 1 and an indebtedness to EBITDA ratio (as defined) not to exceed 3.75 to 1. As defined by the credit facility agreement, our indebtedness to total capitalization ratio was 0.48 to 1 and our indebtedness to EBITDA ratio was 2.16 to 1 at December 31, 2007. If we should fail to perform our obligations under these and other covenants, the revolving credit commitment could be terminated and any outstanding borrowings under the facility could be declared immediately due and payable. Such acceleration, if involving a principal amount of $10 million ($50 million in the case of our senior notes issued after 2004), would constitute an event of default under our senior note indentures which could in turn result in the acceleration of a significant portion of our senior note indebtedness. The credit facility agreement also has cross default provisions that apply to other indebtedness we may have with an outstanding principal amount in excess of $75 million. We have six secured hedging facilities, each of which permits us to enter into cash settled oil and natural gas commodity transactions, valued by the counterparty, for up to a maximum value. Outstanding transactions under each facility are collateralized by certain of our oil and natural gas properties that do not secure any of our other obligations. The hedging facilities are subject to an annual exposure fee, which is assessed quarterly based on the average of the daily negative fair value amounts of the hedges, if any, during the quarter. The hedging facilities contain the standard representations and default provisions that are typical of such agreements. The agreements also contain various restrictive provisions which govern the aggregate oil and natural gas production volumes that we are permitted to hedge under all of our agreements at any one time. The maximum permitted value of transactions under each facility and the fair value of outstanding transactions are shown below.

Although the applicable interest rates and commitment fees in our bank credit facility fluctuate slightly based on our long term senior unsecured credit ratings, the bank facility and the secured hedging facilities do not contain provisions which would trigger an acceleration of amounts due under the facilities or a requirement to post additional collateral in the event of a downgrade of our credit ratings. Senior Note Obligations In addition to outstanding revolving bank credit facility borrowings discussed above, as of December 31, 2007, senior notes represented approximately $9.0 billion of our long term debt and consisted of the following ($ in millions): 7.5% Senior Notes due 2013 $ 364 7.625% Senior Notes due 2013 500 7.0% Senior Notes due 2014 300 7.5% Senior Notes due 2014 300 7.75% Senior Notes due 2015 300 6.375% Senior Notes due 2015 600 6.625% Senior Notes due 2016 600 6.875% Senior Notes due 2016 670 6.5% Senior Notes due 2017 1,100 6.25% Euro denominated Senior Notes due 2017 (a) 876 6.25% Senior Notes due 2018 600 6.875% Senior Notes due 2020 500 2.75% Contingent Convertible Senior Notes due 2035 690 2.5% Contingent Convertible Senior Notes due 2037 1,650 Discount on senior notes (105 ) Premium for interest rate derivatives 55 $ 9,000 (a) The principal amount shown is based on the dollar/euro exchange rate of $1.4603 to 1.00 as of December 31, 2007. See Note 10 of our accompanying consolidated financial statements for information on our related cross currency swap. No scheduled principal payments are required under our senior notes until 2013, when $864 million is due. The holders of the 2.75% Contingent Convertible Senior Notes due 2035 may require us to repurchase, in cash, all or a portion of these notes on November 15, 2015, 2020, 2025 and 2030 at 100% of the principal amount of the notes. The holders of the 2.5% Contingent Convertible Senior Notes due 2037 may require us to repurchase, in cash, all or a portion of these notes on May 15, 2017, 2022, 2027 and 2032 at 100% of the principal amount of the notes. As of December 31, 2007 and currently, debt ratings for the senior notes are Ba3 by Moodys Investor Service (negative outlook), BB by Standard & Poors Ratings Services (positive outlook) and BB by Fitch Ratings (negative outlook). Our senior notes are unsecured senior obligations of Chesapeake and rank equally in right of payment with all of our other existing and future senior indebtedness and rank senior in right of payment to all of our future subordinated indebtedness. All of our wholly owned subsidiaries, except minor subsidiaries, fully and unconditionally guarantee the notes jointly and severally on an unsecured basis. Senior notes issued before July 2005 are governed by indentures containing covenants that limit our ability and our restricted subsidiaries ability to incur additional indebtedness; pay dividends on our capital stock or redeem, repurchase or retire our capital 38 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements stock or subordinated indebtedness; make investments and other restricted payments; incur liens; enter into sale/leaseback transactions; create restrictions on the payment of dividends or other amounts to us from our restricted subsidiaries; engage in transactions with affiliates; sell assets; and consolidate, merge or transfer assets. Senior notes issued after June 2005 are governed by indentures containing covenants that limit our ability and our restricted subsidiaries ability to incur certain secured indebtedness; enter into sale leaseback transactions; and consolidate, merge or transfer assets. The debt incurrence covenants do not presently restrict our ability to borrow under or expand our secured credit facility. As of December 31, 2007, we estimate that secured commercial bank indebtedness of approximately $4.9 billion could have been incurred under the most restrictive indenture covenant.

(c) See Note 5 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for a description of unrecognized tax benefits. Chesapeake has commitments to purchase the production associated with the December 31, 2007 sale of a volumetric production payment that extends over a 15 year term at market prices at the time of production and the purchased gas will be resold. The obligations are as follows: Mmcfe 2008 19,858 2009 18,601 2010 18,043 2011 16,251 2012 15,322 After 2012 119,949 Total 208,024 39 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Hedging Activities Oil and Natural Gas Hedging Activities Our results of operations and operating cash flows are impacted by changes in market prices for oil and natural gas. To mitigate a portion of the exposure to adverse market changes, we have entered into various derivative instruments. Executive management is involved in all risk management activities and the Board of Directors reviews the companys hedging program at its quarterly Board meetings. We believe we have sufficient internal controls to prevent unauthorized hedging. As of December 31, 2007, our oil and natural gas derivative instruments were comprised of swaps, basis protection swaps, knockout swaps, cap swaps, call options and collars. Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk contains a description of each of these instruments. Although derivatives often fail to achieve 100% effectiveness for accounting purposes, we believe our derivative instruments continue to be highly effective in achieving the risk management objectives for which they were intended. Hedging allows us to predict with greater certainty the effective prices we will receive for our hedged oil and natural gas production. We closely monitor the fair value of our hedging contracts and may elect to settle a contract prior to its scheduled maturity date in order to lock in a gain or loss. Commodity markets are volatile and Chesapeakes hedging activities are dynamic. Mark to market positions under oil and natural gas hedging contracts fluctuate with commodity prices. As described above under Bank Credit and Hedging Facilities, we may be required to deliver cash collateral or other assurances of performance if our payment obligations to our hedging counterparties exceed levels stated in our contracts. Our realized and unrealized gains and losses on oil and natural gas derivatives during 2007, 2006 and 2005 were as follows: Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 ($ in millions) Oil and natural gas sales $ 4,795 $ 3,870 $ 3,633 Realized gains on oil and natural gas derivatives 1,203 1,254 (401 ) Unrealized gains (losses) on non qualifying oil and natural gas derivatives (252 ) 184 117 Unrealized gains (losses) on ineffectiveness of cash flow hedges (122 ) 311 (76 ) Total oil and natural gas sales $ 5,624 $ 5,619 $ 3,273 Changes in the fair value of oil and natural gas derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, to the extent effective in offsetting cash flows attributable to the hedged commodities, and locked in gains and losses of derivative contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and are transferred to earnings in the month of related production. These unrealized gains (losses), net of related tax effects, totaled $53 million, $546 million and ($271) million as of December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Based upon the market prices at December 31, 2007, we expect to transfer to earnings approximately $127 million of the net gain included in the balance of accumulated other comprehensive income during the next 12 months. A detailed explanation of accounting for oil and natural gas derivatives under SFAS 133 appears under Application of Critical Accounting Policies Hedging elsewhere in this Item 7. 40 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The estimated fair values of our oil and natural gas derivative instruments as of December 31, 2007 and 2006 are provided below. The associated carrying values of these instruments are equal to the estimated fair values.

(c) After adjusting for $29 million of unrealized premiums, the cumulative unrealized loss related to these call options as of December 31, 2007 was $67 million. Additional information concerning the fair value of our oil and natural gas derivative instruments, including CNR derivatives assumed, is as follows: December 31, 2007 2006 2005 ($ in millions) Fair value of contracts outstanding, as of January 1 $ 345 $ (946 ) $ 38 Change in fair value of contracts 972 3,423 (771 ) Fair value of contracts when entered into (295 ) (32 ) (614 ) Contracts realized or otherwise settled (1,203 ) (1,254 ) 401 Fair value of contracts when closed (188 ) (846 ) Fair value of contracts outstanding, as of December 31 $ (369 ) $ 345 $ (946 ) Interest Rate Derivatives We use interest rate derivatives to mitigate our exposure to the volatility in interest rates. For interest rate derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges (in accordance with SFAS 133), changes in fair value are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as assets (liabilities), and the debts carrying value amount is adjusted by the change in the fair value of the debt subsequent to the initiation of the derivative. Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments not qualifying as fair value hedges are recorded currently as adjustments to interest expense. Gains or losses from derivative transactions are reflected as adjustments to interest expense on the consolidated statements of operations. Realized gains (losses) included in interest expense were ($1) million, ($2) million and $5 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Pursuant to SFAS 133, certain derivatives do not 41 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements qualify for designation as fair value hedges. Changes in the fair value of these non qualifying derivatives that occur prior to their maturity (i.e., temporary fluctuations in value) are reported currently in the consolidated statements of operations as unrealized gains (losses) within interest expense. Unrealized gains (losses) included in interest expense were ($40) million, $2 million and $2 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. A detailed explanation of accounting for interest rate derivatives under SFAS 133 appears under Application of Critical Accounting Policies Hedging elsewhere in this Item 7. Foreign Currency Derivatives On December 6, 2006, we issued 600 million of 6.25% Euro denominated Senior Notes due 2017. Concurrent with the issuance of the Euro denominated senior notes, we entered into a cross currency swap to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in the euro relative to the dollar over the term of the notes. A detailed explanation of accounting for foreign currency derivatives under SFAS 133 appears under Application of Critical Accounting Policies Hedging elsewhere in this Item 7. Results of Operations General. For the year ended December 31, 2007, Chesapeake had net income of $1.451 billion, or $2.62 per diluted common share, on total revenues of $7.800 billion. This compares to net income of $2.003 billion, or $4.35 per diluted common share, on total revenues of $7.326 billion during the year ended December 31, 2006, and net income of $948 million, or $2.51 per diluted common share, on total revenues of $4.665 billion during the year ended December 31, 2005. Oil and Natural Gas Sales. During 2007, oil and natural gas sales were $5.624 billion compared to $5.619 billion in 2006 and $3.273 billion in 2005. In 2007, Chesapeake produced and sold 714.3 bcfe of oil and natural gas at a weighted average price of $8.40 per mcfe, compared to 578.4 bcfe in 2006 at a weighted average price of $8.86 per mcfe, and 468.6 bcfe in 2005 at a weighted average price of $6.90 per mcfe (weighted average prices for all years discussed exclude the effect of unrealized gains or (losses) on derivatives of ($374) million, $495 million and $41 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively). The decrease in prices in 2007 resulted in a decrease in revenue of $329 million and increased production resulted in a $1.203 billion increase, for a total increase in revenues of $874 million (excluding unrealized gains or losses on oil and natural gas derivatives). The increase in production from period to period was primarily generated from the drillbit. For 2007, we realized an average price per barrel of oil of $67.50, compared to $59.14 in 2006 and $47.77 in 2005 (weighted average prices for all years discussed exclude the effect of unrealized gains or losses on derivatives). Natural gas prices realized per mcf (excluding unrealized gains or losses on derivatives) were $8.14, $8.76 and $6.78 in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Realized gains or losses from our oil and natural gas derivatives resulted in a net increase in oil and natural gas revenues of $1.203 billion or $1.68 per mcfe in 2007, a net increase of $1.254 billion or $2.17 per mcfe in 2006 and a net decrease of $401 million or $0.86 per mcfe in 2005. A change in oil and natural gas prices has a significant impact on our oil and natural gas revenues and cash flows. Assuming 2007 production levels, a change of $0.10 per mcf of natural gas sold would result in an increase or decrease in revenues and cash flow of approximately $65 million and $63 million, respectively, and a change of $1.00 per barrel of oil sold would result in an increase or decrease in revenues and cash flow of approximately $10 million and $9 million, respectively, without considering the effect of hedging activities. 42 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The following table shows our production by region for 2007, 2006 and 2005: Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Mmcfe Percent Mmcfe Percent Mmcfe Percent Mid Continent 373,941 52 % 315,173 55 % 297,773 64 % Barnett Shale 93,463 13 44,482 7 17,409 4 Appalachian Basin 47,922 7 45,031 8 5,878 1 Permian and Delaware Basins 64,897 9 48,510 8 42,958 9 Ark La Tex 55,811 8 46,009 8 40,707 9 South Texas and Texas Gulf Coast 78,228 11 79,178 14 63,852 13 Total Production 714,262 100 % 578,383 100 % 468,577 100 % Natural gas production represented approximately 92% of our total production volume on an equivalent basis in 2007, compared to 91% in 2006 and 90% in 2005. Oil and Natural Gas Marketing Sales and Operating Expenses. Oil and natural gas marketing activities are substantially for third parties who are owners in Chesapeake operated wells. Chesapeake realized $2.040 billion in oil and natural gas marketing sales to third parties in 2007, with corresponding oil and natural gas marketing expenses of $1.969 billion, for a net margin before depreciation of $71 million. This compares to sales of $1.577 billion and $1.392 billion, expenses of $1.522 billion and $1.358 billion, and margins before depreciation of $55 million and $35 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively. The net margin increase in 2007 and 2006 is primarily due to an increase in volumes and prices related to oil and natural gas marketing sales. Service Operations Revenue and Operating Expenses. Service operations consist of third party revenue and operating expenses related to our leased or owned drilling and oilfield trucking operations. These operations have grown as a result of assets and businesses we acquired in 2006 and 2007. Chesapeake recognized $136 million in service operations revenue in 2007 with corresponding service operations expenses of $94 million, for a net margin before depreciation of $42 million. This compares to revenue of $130 million, expenses of $68 million and a net margin before depreciation of $62 million in 2006. During 2005, service operations revenues and expenses for third parties were insignificant. Production Expenses. Production expenses, which include lifting costs and ad valorem taxes, were $640 million in 2007, compared to $490 million and $317 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively. On a unit of production basis, production expenses were $0.90 per mcfe in 2007 compared to $0.85 and $0.68 per mcfe in 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in 2007 was primarily due to higher third party field service costs, fuel costs and personnel costs. We expect that production expenses per mcfe produced for 2008 will range from $0.90 to $1.00. Production Taxes. Production taxes were $216 million in 2007 compared to $176 million in 2006 and $208 million in 2005. On a unit of production basis, production taxes were $0.30 per mcfe in 2007 compared to $0.31 per mcfe in 2006 and $0.44 per mcfe in 2005. In 2006, $2 million was accrued for certain severance tax claims and was then offset by a subsequent reversal of the cumulative $12 million accrual for such severance tax claims as a result of their dismissal. After adjusting for these items, there was an increase of $30 million in production taxes from 2006 to 2007. The $30 million increase is mostly due to an increase in production of 136 bcfe. In general, production taxes are calculated using value based formulas that produce higher per unit costs when oil and natural gas prices are higher. We expect production taxes for 2008 to range from $0.32 to $0.37 per mcfe produced based on a NYMEX price of $76.49 per barrel of oil and natural gas wellhead prices ranging from $7.40 to $8.40 per mcf. 43 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements General and Administrative Expense. General and administrative expenses, including stock based compensation but excluding internal costs capitalized to our oil and natural gas properties (see Note 11 of notes to consolidated financial statements), were $243 million in 2007, $139 million in 2006 and $64 million in 2005. General and administrative expenses were $0.34, $0.24 and $0.14 per mcfe for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in 2007, 2006 and 2005 was the result of the companys overall growth as well as cost and wage inflation. Included in general and administrative expenses is stock based compensation of $58 million in 2007, $27 million in 2006 and $15 million in 2005. The increase was mainly due to a higher number of unvested restricted shares outstanding during 2007 compared to 2006 and 2005. We anticipate that general and administrative expenses for 2008 will be between $0.33 and $0.37 per mcfe produced, including stock based compensation ranging from $0.10 to $0.12 per mcfe produced. Our stock based compensation for employees and non employee directors is in the form of restricted stock. Prior to 2004, stock based compensation awards were only in the form of stock options. Employee stock based compensation awards generally vest over a period of four or five years. Our non employee director awards vest over a period of three years. Until December 31, 2005, as permitted under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, as amended, we accounted for our stock options under the recognition and measurement provisions of APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related interpretations. Generally, we recognized no compensation cost on grants of employee and non employee director stock options because the exercise price was equal to the market price of our common stock on the date of grant. Effective January 1, 2006, we implemented the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123(R), Share Based Payment, using the modified prospective transition method. For all unvested options outstanding as of January 1, 2006, the previously measured but unrecognized compensation expense, based on the fair value at the original grant date, was recognized in our financial statements over the remaining vesting period. For equity based compensation awards granted or modified subsequent to January 1, 2006, compensation expense based on the fair value on the date of grant or modification is recognized in our financial statements over the vesting period. In addition, in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Staff Position No. FAS 123(R) 3, Transition Election Related to Accounting for the Tax Effects of Share Based Payment Awards, we elected to use the short cut method to calculate the historical pool of windfall tax benefits. Results for prior periods have not been restated. The discussion of stock based compensation in Note 1 and Note 9 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report provides additional detail on the accounting for and reporting of our stock options and restricted stock, as well as the effects of our adoption of SFAS 123(R). Chesapeake follows the full cost method of accounting under which all costs associated with property acquisition, exploration and development activities are capitalized. We capitalize internal costs that can be directly identified with our acquisition, exploration and development activities and do not include any costs related to production, general corporate overhead or similar activities. We capitalized $262 million, $161 million and $102 million of internal costs in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, directly related to our oil and natural gas property acquisition, exploration and development efforts. Oil and Natural Gas Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization. Depreciation, depletion and amortization of oil and natural gas properties was $1.835 billion, $1.359 billion and $894 million during 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The average DD&A rate per mcfe, which is a function of capitalized costs, future development costs, and the related underlying reserves in the periods presented, was $2.57, $2.35 and $1.91 in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in the average rate from $2.35 in 2006 to $2.57 in 2007 is primarily the result of higher drilling costs, higher costs associated with acquisitions and the recognition of the tax effect of acquisition costs in excess of tax basis acquired in certain corporate acquisitions. We expect the 2008 DD&A rate to be between $2.50 and $2.70 per mcfe produced. 44 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Depreciation and Amortization of Other Assets. Depreciation and amortization of other assets was $154 million in 2007, compared to $104 million in 2006 and $51 million in 2005. The average D&A rate per mcfe was $0.22, $0.18 and $0.11 in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increases in 2007 and 2006 were primarily the result of higher depreciation costs resulting from the acquisition of various gathering facilities, the construction of new buildings at our corporate headquarters complex and at various field office locations and additional information technology equipment and software. In 2006, increases were also attributed to the acquisition of compression equipment and drilling rigs. The overall increase in 2007 was partially mitigated by various sale/leaseback transactions throughout 2007 related to certain of our compressors and drilling rigs. Property and equipment costs are depreciated on a straight line basis. Buildings are depreciated over 15 to 39 years, gathering facilities are depreciated over 20 years, drilling rigs are depreciated over 15 years and all other property and equipment are depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from two to seven years. To the extent company owned drilling rigs were used to drill our wells in 2005 and 2006, a substantial portion of the rig depreciation was capitalized in oil and natural gas properties as exploration or development costs. As a result of the sale/leaseback of our company owned rigs, we did not recognize rig depreciation in 2007. We expect 2008 depreciation and amortization of other assets to be between $0.20 and $0.24 per mcfe produced. Employee Retirement Expense. Our President and Chief Operating Officer, Tom L. Ward, resigned as a director, officer and employee of the company effective February 10, 2006. Mr. Wards Resignation Agreement provided for the immediate vesting of all of his unvested equity awards, which consisted of options to purchase 724,615 shares of Chesapeakes common stock at an average exercise price of $8.01 per share and 1,291,875 shares of restricted common stock. As a result of this vesting, we incurred an expense of $55 million in 2006. Interest and Other Income. Interest and other income was $15 million, $26 million and $10 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The 2007 income consisted of $8 million of interest income and $7 million of miscellaneous income. Income related to equity investments was not significant in 2007. The 2006 income consisted of $5 million of interest income, $10 million of income related to equity investments, a $5 million gain on sale of assets and $6 million of miscellaneous income. The 2005 income consisted of $3 million of interest income, $2 million of income related to equity investment, and $5 million of miscellaneous income. Interest Expense. Interest expense increased to $406 million in 2007 compared to $301 million in 2006 and $220 million in 2005 as follows: Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 ($ in millions) Interest expense on senior notes and revolving bank credit facility $ 616 $ 472 $ 300 Capitalized interest (269 ) (179 ) (79 ) Amortization of loan discount and other 17 7 6 Unrealized (gain) loss on interest rate derivatives 41 (1 ) (2 ) Realized (gain) loss on interest rate derivatives 1 2 (5 ) Total interest expense $ 406 $ 301 $ 220 Average long term borrowings $ 8,224 $ 6,278 $ 3,948 Interest expense, excluding unrealized (gains) losses on derivatives and net of amounts capitalized, was $0.51 per mcfe in 2007 compared to $0.52 per mcfe in 2006 and $0.47 per mcfe in 2005. We expect interest expense for 2008 to be between $0.50 and $0.55 per mcfe produced (before considering the effect of interest rate derivatives). Gain on Sale of Investments. In 2007, we sold our 33% limited partnership interest in Eagle Energy Partners I, L.P., which we first acquired in 2003, for proceeds of $124 million and a gain of $83 million. In 2006, Chesapeake sold its investment in publicly traded Pioneer Drilling Company common stock, realizing proceeds 45 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements of $159 million and a gain of $117 million. We owned 17% of the common stock of Pioneer, which we began acquiring in 2003. Loss on Repurchases or Exchanges of Chesapeake Senior Notes. In 2005, we repurchased or exchanged $564 million of Chesapeake debt in order to re finance a portion of our long term debt at a lower rate of interest and recognized a loss of $70 million. No such purchases or exchanges were completed in 2007 or 2006. Income Tax Expense. Chesapeake recorded income tax expense of $890 million in 2007 compared to income tax expense of $1.252 billion in 2006 and $545 million in 2005. Of the $362 million decrease in 2007, $347 million was the result of the decrease in net income before taxes and $15 million was the result of a decrease in the effective tax rate. Our effective income tax rate was 38% in 2007 compared to 38.5% in 2006 and 36.5% in 2005. Our effective tax rate fluctuates as a result of the impact of state income taxes and permanent differences between our accounting for certain revenue or expense items and their corresponding treatment for income tax purposes. We expect our effective income tax rate to be 38.5% in 2008. Most of the 2007 income tax expense was deferred and we expect most of our 2008 income tax expense to be deferred. Loss on Conversion/Exchange of Preferred Stock. Loss on conversion/exchange of preferred stock was $128 million in 2007 compared to $10 million in 2006 and $26 million in 2005. The loss on the exchanges represented the excess of the fair value of the common stock issued over the fair value of the securities issuable pursuant to the original conversion terms. See Note 9 of notes to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further detail regarding these transactions. Application of Critical Accounting Policies Readers of this report and users of the information contained in it should be aware of how certain events may impact our financial results based on the accounting policies in place. The four policies we consider to be the most significant are discussed below. The companys management has discussed each critical accounting policy with the Audit Committee of the companys Board of Directors. The selection and application of accounting policies is an important process that changes as our business changes and as accounting rules are developed. Accounting rules generally do not involve a selection among alternatives, but involve an implementation and interpretation of existing rules and the use of judgment to the specific set of circumstances existing in our business. Hedging. Chesapeake uses commodity price and financial risk management instruments to mitigate our exposure to price fluctuations in oil and natural gas, changes in interest rates and changes in foreign exchange rates. Recognized gains and losses on derivative contracts are reported as a component of the related transaction. Results of oil and natural gas derivative transactions are reflected in oil and natural gas sales, and results of interest rate and foreign exchange rate hedging transactions are reflected in interest expense. The changes in the fair value of derivative instruments not qualifying for designation as either cash flow or fair value hedges that occur prior to maturity are reported currently in the consolidated statement of operations as unrealized gains (losses) within oil and natural gas sales or interest expense. Cash flows from derivative instruments are classified in the same category within the statement of cash flows as the items being hedged, or on a basis consistent with the nature of the instruments. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that derivative instruments (including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts) be recorded at fair value and included in the consolidated balance sheet as assets or liabilities. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation, which is established at the inception of a derivative. For derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, changes in fair value, to the extent the hedge is effective, are recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. Any change in the fair value resulting from ineffectiveness, as defined by SFAS 133, is recognized immediately 46 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements in oil and natural gas sales. For derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges (in accordance with SFAS 133), changes in fair value, as well as the offsetting changes in the estimated fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, are recognized currently in earnings. Differences between the changes in the fair values of the hedged item and the derivative instrument, if any, represent gains or losses on ineffectiveness and are reflected currently in interest expense. Hedge effectiveness is measured at least quarterly based on the relative changes in fair value between the derivative contract and the hedged item over time. Changes in fair value of contracts that do not qualify as hedges or are not designated as hedges are also recognized currently in earnings. See Hedging Activities above and Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk for additional information regarding our hedging activities. One of the primary factors that can have an impact on our results of operations is the method used to value our derivatives. We have established the fair value of all derivative instruments using estimates determined by our counterparties and subsequently confirmed the fair values internally using established index prices and other sources. These values are based upon, among other things, futures prices, volatility, time to maturity and credit risk. The values we report in our financial statements change as these estimates are revised to reflect actual results, changes in market conditions or other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Another factor that can impact our results of operations each period is our ability to estimate the level of correlation between future changes in the fair value of the hedge instruments and the transactions being hedged, both at inception and on an ongoing basis. This correlation is complicated since energy commodity prices, the primary risk we hedge, have quality and location differences that can be difficult to hedge effectively. The factors underlying our estimates of fair value and our assessment of correlation of our hedging derivatives are impacted by actual results and changes in conditions that affect these factors, many of which are beyond our control. Due to the volatility of oil and natural gas prices and, to a lesser extent, interest rates and foreign exchange rates, the companys financial condition and results of operations can be significantly impacted by changes in the market value of our derivative instruments. As of December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, the net market value of our derivatives was a liability of $375 million, an asset of $293 million and a liability of $968 million, respectively. The derivatives that we acquired in our CNR acquisition represented $184 million, $254 million and $661 million of liability at December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005. Oil and Natural Gas Properties. The accounting for our business is subject to special accounting rules that are unique to the oil and natural gas industry. There are two allowable methods of accounting for oil and natural gas business activities: the successful efforts method and the full cost method. Chesapeake follows the full cost method of accounting under which all costs associated with property acquisition, exploration and development activities are capitalized. We also capitalize internal costs that can be directly identified with our acquisition, exploration and development activities and do not include any costs related to production, general corporate overhead or similar activities. Under the successful efforts method, geological and geophysical costs and costs of carrying and retaining undeveloped properties are charged to expense as incurred. Costs of drilling exploratory wells that do not result in proved reserves are charged to expense. Depreciation, depletion, amortization and impairment of oil and natural gas properties are generally calculated on a well by well or lease or field basis versus the aggregated full cost pool basis. Additionally, gain or loss is generally recognized on all sales of oil and natural gas properties under the successful efforts method. As a result, our financial statements will differ from companies that apply the successful efforts method since we will generally reflect a higher level of capitalized costs as well as a higher oil and natural gas depreciation, depletion and amortization rate, and we will not have exploration expenses that successful efforts companies frequently have. Under the full cost method, capitalized costs are amortized on a composite unit of production method based on proved oil and natural gas reserves. If we maintain the same level of production year over year, the 47 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements depreciation, depletion and amortization expense may be significantly different if our estimate of remaining reserves changes significantly. Proceeds from the sale of properties are accounted for as reductions of capitalized costs unless such sales involve a significant change in the relationship between costs and the value of proved reserves or the underlying value of unproved properties, in which case a gain or loss is recognized. The costs of unproved properties are excluded from amortization until the properties are evaluated. We review all of our unevaluated properties quarterly to determine whether or not and to what extent proved reserves have been assigned to the properties, and otherwise if impairment has occurred. Unevaluated properties are grouped by major producing area where individual property costs are not significant and are assessed individually when individual costs are significant. We review the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties under the full cost accounting rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission on a quarterly basis. This quarterly review is referred to as a ceiling test. Under the ceiling test, capitalized costs, less accumulated amortization and related deferred income taxes, may not exceed an amount equal to the sum of the present value of estimated future net revenues (adjusted for cash flow hedges) less estimated future expenditures to be incurred in developing and producing the proved reserves, less any related income tax effects. In calculating future net revenues, current prices and costs used are those as of the end of the appropriate quarterly period. Such prices are utilized except where different prices are fixed and determinable from applicable contracts for the remaining term of those contracts, including the effects of derivatives qualifying as cash flow hedges. Two primary factors impacting this test are reserve levels and current prices, and their associated impact on the present value of estimated future net revenues. Revisions to estimates of natural gas and oil reserves and or an increase or decrease in prices can have a material impact on the present value of estimated future net revenues. Any excess of the net book value, less deferred income taxes, is generally written off as an expense. Under SEC regulations, the excess above the ceiling is not expensed (or is reduced) if, subsequent to the end of the period, but prior to the release of the financial statements, oil and natural gas prices increase sufficiently such that an excess above the ceiling would have been eliminated (or reduced) if the increased prices were used in the calculations. The process of estimating natural gas and oil reserves is very complex, requiring significant decisions in the evaluation of available geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data. The data for a given property may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors, including additional development activity, evolving production history and a continual reassessment of the viability of production under changing economic conditions. As a result, material revisions to existing reserve estimates occur from time to time. Although every reasonable effort is made to ensure that reserve estimates reported represent the most accurate assessments possible, the subjective decisions and variances in available data for various properties increase the likelihood of significant changes in these estimates. As of December 31, 2007, approximately 79% of our proved reserves were evaluated by independent petroleum engineers, with the balance evaluated by our internal reservoir engineers. In addition, our internal engineers review and update our reserves on a quarterly basis. All reserve estimates are prepared based upon a review of production histories and other geologic, economic, ownership and engineering data we developed. Additional information about our 2007 year end reserve evaluation is included under Oil and Natural Gas Reserves in Item 1 Business. In addition, the prices of natural gas and oil are volatile and change from period to period. Price changes directly impact the estimated revenues from our properties and the associated present value of future net revenues. Such changes also impact the economic life of our properties and thereby affect the quantity of reserves that can be assigned to a property. Income Taxes. As part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate the federal and state income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which Chesapeake operates. This process involves estimating the actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items, such as derivative instruments, depreciation, depletion and 48 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements amortization, and certain accrued liabilities for tax and accounting purposes. These differences and our net operating loss carryforwards result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included in our consolidated balance sheet. We must then assess, using all available positive and negative evidence, the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income. If we believe that recovery is not likely, we must establish a valuation allowance. Generally, to the extent Chesapeake establishes a valuation allowance or increases or decreases this allowance in a period, we must include an expense or reduction of expense within the tax provisions in the consolidated statement of operations. Under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, an enterprise must use judgment in considering the relative impact of negative and positive evidence. The weight given to the potential effect of negative and positive evidence should be commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified. The more negative evidence that exists (a) the more positive evidence is necessary and (b) the more difficult it is to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed for some portion or all of the deferred tax asset. Among the more significant types of evidence that we consider are: taxable income projections in future years, whether the carryforward period is so brief that it would limit realization of tax benefits, future sales and operating cost projections that will produce more than enough taxable income to realize the deferred tax asset based on existing sales prices and cost structures, and our earnings history exclusive of the loss that created the future deductible amount coupled with evidence indicating that the loss is an aberration rather than a continuing condition. If (a) natural gas and oil prices were to decrease significantly below present levels (and if such decreases were considered other than temporary), (b) exploration, drilling and operating costs were to increase significantly beyond current levels, or (c) we were confronted with any other significantly negative evidence pertaining to our ability to realize our NOL carryforwards prior to their expiration, we may be required to provide a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. As of December 31, 2007, we had deferred tax assets of $409 million. FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, provides guidance for recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions, as defined in SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. FIN 48 prescribes a threshold condition that a tax position must meet for any of the benefit of the uncertain tax position to be recognized in the financial statements. Guidance is also provided regarding de recognition, classification and disclosure of these uncertain tax positions. Based on this guidance, we regularly analyze tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return based on the threshold condition prescribed under FIN 48. Tax positions that do not meet or exceed this threshold condition are considered uncertain tax positions. We accrue interest related to these uncertain tax positions which is recognized in interest expense. Penalties, if any, related to uncertain tax positions would be recorded in other expenses. Additional information about uncertain tax positions appears in Income Taxes Item 1 Business. Accounting for Business Combinations. Our business has grown substantially through acquisitions and our business strategy is to continue to pursue acquisitions as opportunities arise. We have accounted for all of our business combinations using the purchase method, which is the only method permitted under SFAS 141, Accounting for Business Combinations. The accounting for business combinations is complicated and involves the use of significant judgment. Under the purchase method of accounting, a business combination is accounted for at its purchase price based upon the fair value of the consideration given, whether in the form of cash, assets, stock or the assumption of liabilities. The assets and liabilities acquired are measured at their fair values, and the purchase price is allocated to the assets and liabilities based upon these fair values. The excess of the cost of an acquired entity, if any, over the net of the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill. 49 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The excess of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed over the cost of an acquired entity, if any, is allocated as a pro rata reduction of the amounts that otherwise would have been assigned to certain acquired assets. Determining the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired involves the use of judgment, since some of the assets and liabilities acquired do not have fair values that are readily determinable. Different techniques may be used to determine fair values, including market prices, where available, appraisals, comparisons to transactions for similar assets and liabilities and present value of estimated future cash flows, among others. Since these estimates involve the use of significant judgment, they can change as new information becomes available. We believe that the consideration we have paid for our oil and natural gas property acquisitions has represented the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired at the time of purchase. Consequently, we have not recognized any goodwill from any of our oil and natural gas property acquisitions, nor do we expect to recognize goodwill from similar business combinations that we may complete in the future. Disclosures About Effects of Transactions with Related Parties As of December 31, 2007, we had accrued accounts receivable from our CEO, Aubrey K. McClendon, of $18 million representing joint interest billings from December 2007 which were invoiced and timely paid in January 2008. Since Chesapeake was founded in 1989, Mr. McClendon has acquired working interests in virtually all of our oil and natural gas properties by participating in our drilling activities under the terms of the Founder Well Participation Program (FWPP) described below. Joint interest billings to him are settled in cash immediately upon delivery of a monthly joint interest billing. Under the FWPP, approved by our shareholders in June 2005, Mr. McClendon (and our co founder and former COO, Tom L. Ward, prior to August 10, 2006) may elect to participate in all or none of the wells drilled by or on behalf of Chesapeake during a calendar year, but he is not allowed to participate only in selected wells. A participation election is required to be received by the Compensation Committee of Chesapeakes Board of Directors not less than 30 days prior to the start of each calendar year. His participation is permitted only under the terms outlined in the Founder Well Participation Program, which, among other things, limits his individual participation to a maximum working interest of 2.5% in a well and prohibits participation in situations where Chesapeakes working interest would be reduced below 12.5% as a result of his participation. In addition, the company is reimbursed for costs associated with leasehold acquired by Mr. McClendon as a result of his well participation. Mr. Wards participation in the Founder Well Participation Program terminated on August 10, 2006. As disclosed in Note 8, in 2007, Chesapeake had revenues of $1.1 billion from oil and natural gas sales to Eagle Energy Partners I, L.P., a former affiliated entity. We sold our 33% limited partnership interest in Eagle Energy in June 2007. Recently Issued Accounting Standards The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) recently issued the following standards which were reviewed by Chesapeake to determine the potential impact on our financial statements upon adoption. In February 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 155, Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments an amendment of FASB Statements No. 133 and 140. SFAS 155 permits an entity to measure at fair value any financial instrument that contains an embedded derivative that otherwise would require bifurcation. This statement is effective for all financial instruments we acquire or issue after December 31, 2006. Adoption of SFAS 155 did not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 50 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. This statement defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. However, on February 12, 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. FAS 157 2, Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157 which delays the effective date of SFAS 157 for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). This FSP partially defers the effective date of SFAS 157 to fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years for items within the scope of the FSP. We are currently assessing the impact, if any, the adoption of this statement will have on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. This statement permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. This statement expands the use of fair value measurement and applies to entities that elect the fair value option. The fair value option established by this statement permits all entities to choose to measure eligible items at fair value at specified election dates. This statement is effective as of the beginning of the first fiscal year that begins after November 15, 2007. We are currently assessing the impact, if any, the adoption of this statement will have on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In November 2007, the FASB issued its preliminary views on financial instruments with characteristics of equity as a step preceding the development of a proposed Statement of Financial Accounting Standards. Such a standard would affect accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion, including partial cash settlements. This accounting could increase the amount of interest expense required to be recognized with respect to such instruments and, thus, lower reported net income and net income per share of issuers of such instruments. Issuers would have to account for the liability and equity components of the instrument separately and in a manner that reflects interest expense at the interest rate of similar nonconvertible debt. We have two debt series that would be affected by such a standard, our 2.75% Contingent Convertible Senior Notes due 2035 and our 2.5% Contingent Convertible Senior Notes due 2037. If the FASB adopts the statement, it is expected to be effective for fiscal years starting after December 15, 2007. Companies would have to apply the statement retrospectively to both existing and new instruments that fall within the scope of the guidance. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51. This statement requires an entity to separately disclose non controlling interests as a separate component of equity in the balance sheet and clearly identify on the face of the income statement net income related to non controlling interests. This statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. We are currently assessing the impact, if any, the adoption of this statement will have on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R), Business Combinations. This statement requires assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be measured at fair value as of the acquisition date, acquisition related costs incurred prior to the acquisition to be expensed and contractual contingencies to be recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date. This statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. We are currently assessing the impact, if any, the adoption of this statement will have on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Forward Looking Statements This report includes forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward looking statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future events. They include statements regarding oil and natural gas reserve 51 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements estimates, planned capital expenditures, the drilling of oil and natural gas wells and future acquisitions, expected oil and natural gas production, cash flow and anticipated liquidity, business strategy and other plans and objectives for future operations and expected future expenses. Statements concerning the fair values of derivative contracts and their estimated contribution to our future results of operations are based upon market information as of a specific date. These market prices are subject to significant volatility. Although we believe the expectations and forecasts reflected in these and other forward looking statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance they will prove to have been correct. They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expected results are described under Risk Factors in Item 1A of this report and include: the volatility of oil and natural gas prices, our level of indebtedness, the strength and financial resources of our competitors, the availability of capital on an economic basis to fund reserve replacement costs, our ability to replace reserves and sustain production, uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of oil and natural gas reserves and projecting future rates of production and the timing of development expenditures, uncertainties in evaluating oil and natural gas reserves of acquired properties and associated potential liabilities, inability to effectively integrate and operate acquired companies and properties, unsuccessful exploration and development drilling, declines in the value of our oil and natural gas properties resulting in ceiling test write downs, lower prices realized on oil and natural gas sales and collateral required to secure hedging liabilities resulting from our commodity price risk management activities, the negative effect lower oil and natural gas prices could have on our ability to borrow, drilling and operating risks, adverse effects of governmental and environmental regulation, and losses possible from pending or future litigation. We caution you not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this report, and we undertake no obligation to update this information. We urge you to carefully review and consider the disclosures made in this report and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission that attempt to advise interested parties of the risks and factors that may affect our business. ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Oil and Natural Gas Hedging Activities Our results of operations and operating cash flows are impacted by changes in market prices for oil and natural gas. To mitigate a portion of the exposure to adverse market changes, we have entered into various derivative instruments. As of December 31, 2007, our oil and natural gas derivative instruments were comprised of swaps, basis protection swaps, knockout swaps, cap swaps, call options and collars. These instruments allow us to predict with greater certainty the effective oil and natural gas prices to be received for our hedged production. Although derivatives often fail to achieve 100% effectiveness for accounting purposes, we believe 52 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements our derivative instruments continue to be highly effective in achieving the risk management objectives for which they were intended. For swap instruments, Chesapeake receives a fixed price for the hedged commodity and pays a floating market price to the counterparty. The fixed price payment and the floating price payment are netted, resulting in a net amount due to or from the counterparty. Basis protection swaps are arrangements that guarantee a price differential for oil or natural gas from a specified delivery point. For Mid Continent basis protection swaps, which have negative differentials to NYMEX, Chesapeake receives a payment from the counterparty if the price differential is greater than the stated terms of the contract and pays the counterparty if the price differential is less than the stated terms of the contract. For Appalachian Basin basis protection swaps, which have positive differentials to NYMEX, Chesapeake receives a payment from the counterparty if the price differential is less than the stated terms of the contract and pays the counterparty if the price differential is greater than the stated terms of the contract. For knockout swaps, Chesapeake receives a fixed price and pays a floating market price. The fixed price received by Chesapeake includes a premium in exchange for the possibility to reduce the counterpartys exposure to zero, in any given month, if the floating market price is lower than certain pre determined knockout prices. For cap swaps, Chesapeake receives a fixed price and pays a floating market price. The fixed price received by Chesapeake includes a premium in exchange for a cap limiting the counterpartys exposure. In other words, there is no limit to Chesapeakes exposure but there is a limit to the downside exposure of the counterparty. For call options, Chesapeake receives a premium from the counterparty in exchange for the sale of a call option. If the market price exceeds the fixed price of the call option, Chesapeake pays the counterparty such excess. If the market price settles below the fixed price of the call option, no payment is due from Chesapeake. Collars contain a fixed floor price (put) and ceiling price (call). If the market price exceeds the call strike price or falls below the put strike price, Chesapeake receives the fixed price and pays the market price. If the market price is between the call and the put strike price, no payments are due from either party. Chesapeake enters into counter swaps from time to time for the purpose of locking in the value of a swap. Under the counter swap, Chesapeake receives a floating price for the hedged commodity and pays a fixed price to the counterparty. The counter swap is 100% effective in locking in the value of a swap since subsequent changes in the market value of the swap are entirely offset by subsequent changes in the market value of the counter swap. We refer to this locked in value as a locked swap. Generally, at the time Chesapeake enters into a counter swap, Chesapeake removes the original swaps designation as a cash flow hedge and classifies the original swap as a non qualifying hedge under SFAS 133. The reason for this new designation is that collectively the swap and the counter swap no longer hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows. Instead, the swap and counter swap effectively lock in a specific gain (or loss) that will be unaffected by subsequent variability in oil and natural gas prices. Any locked in gain or loss is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and reclassified to oil and natural gas sales in the month of related production. With respect to counter swaps that are designed to lock in the value of cap swaps, the counter swap is effective in locking in the value of the cap swap until the floating price reaches the cap (or floor) stipulated in the cap swap agreement. The value of the counter swap will increase (or decrease), but in the opposite direction, as the value of the cap swap decreases (or increases) until the floating price reaches the pre determined cap (or floor) stipulated in the cap swap agreement. However, because of the written put option embedded in the cap swap, the changes in value of the cap swap are not completely effective in offsetting changes in value of the corresponding counter swap. Changes in the value of cap swaps and counter swaps are recorded as adjustments to oil and natural gas sales. 53 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements In accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 39, to the extent that a legal right of set off exists, Chesapeake nets the value of its derivative arrangements with the same counterparty in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Gains or losses from certain derivative transactions are reflected as adjustments to oil and natural gas sales on the consolidated statements of operations. Realized gains (losses) are included in oil and natural gas sales in the month of related production. Pursuant to SFAS 133, certain derivatives do not qualify for designation as cash flow hedges. Changes in the fair value of these non qualifying derivatives that occur prior to their maturity (i.e., temporary fluctuations in value) are reported currently in the consolidated statements of operations as unrealized gains (losses) within oil and natural gas sales. Following provisions of SFAS 133, changes in the fair value of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, to the extent they are effective in offsetting cash flows attributable to the hedged risk, are recorded in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings.

The options are callable by the counterparty in March 2009 and March 2010. In 2006 and 2007, Chesapeake lifted or assigned a portion of its 2008 through 2022 hedges and has approximately $215 million of deferred hedging gains as of December 31, 2007. These gains have been recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or as an unrealized gain in oil and natural gas sales. For amounts originally recorded in other comprehensive income, the gain will be recognized in oil and natural gas sales in the month of the hedged production. We assumed certain liabilities related to open derivative positions in connection with our acquisition of Columbia Natural Resources, LLC in November 2005. In accordance with SFAS 141, these derivative positions were recorded at fair value in the purchase price allocation as a liability of $592 million. The recognition of the derivative liability and other assumed liabilities resulted in an increase in the total purchase price which was allocated to the assets acquired. Because of this accounting treatment, only cash settlements for changes in fair value subsequent to the acquisition date for the derivative positions assumed result in adjustments to our oil and natural gas revenues upon settlement. For example, if the fair value of the derivative positions assumed does not change, then upon the sale of the underlying production and corresponding settlement of the derivative positions, cash would be paid to the counterparties and there would be no adjustment to oil and natural gas revenues related to the derivative positions. If, however, the actual sales price is different from the price assumed in the original fair value calculation, the difference would be reflected as either a decrease or increase in oil and natural gas revenues, depending upon whether the sales price was higher or lower, respectively, than the prices assumed in the original fair value calculation. For accounting purposes, the net effect of these acquired hedges is that we hedged the production volumes at market prices on the date of our acquisition of CNR. 56 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Pursuant to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 149, Amendment of SFAS 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, the derivative instruments assumed in connection with the CNR acquisition are deemed to contain a significant financing element and all cash flows associated with these positions are reported as financing activity in the statement of cash flows for the periods in which settlement occurs.

The actual contribution to our future results of operations will be based on the market prices at the time of settlement and may be more or less than the fair value estimates used at December 31, 2007. Based upon the market prices at December 31, 2007, we expect to transfer approximately $127 million (net of income taxes) of the gain included in the balance in accumulated other comprehensive income to earnings during the next 12 months in the related month of production. All transactions hedged as of December 31, 2007 are expected to mature by December 31, 2022. Additional information concerning the fair value of our oil and natural gas derivative instruments, including CNR derivatives assumed, is as follows: December 31, 2007 2006 2005 ($ in millions) Fair value of contracts outstanding, as of January 1 $ 345 $ (946 ) $ 38 Change in fair value of contracts 972 3,423 (771 ) Fair value of contracts when entered into (295 ) (32 ) (614 ) Contracts realized or otherwise settled (1,203 ) (1,254 ) 401 Fair value of contracts when closed (188 ) (846 ) Fair value of contracts outstanding, as of December 31 $ (369 ) $ 345 $ (946 ) The change in the fair value of our derivative instruments since January 1, 2007 resulted from new contracts entered into, the settlement of derivatives for a realized gain, as well as an increase in natural gas prices. Derivative instruments reflected as current in the consolidated balance sheet represent the estimated fair value of derivative instrument settlements scheduled to occur over the subsequent twelve month period based on market prices for oil and natural gas as of the consolidated balance sheet date. The derivative settlement amounts are not due and payable until the month in which the related underlying hedged transaction occurs. 57 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Interest Rate Risk The table below presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates. As of December 31, 2007, the fair value of the fixed rate long term debt has been estimated based on quoted market prices. Years of Maturity 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Total Fair Value ($ in billions) Liabilities: Long term debt fixed rate (a) $ $ $ $ $ $ 9.050 $ 9.050 $ 9.179 Average interest rate 5.8 % 5.8 % 5.8 % Long term debt variable rate $ $ $ $ $ 1.950 $ $ 1.950 $ 1.950 Average interest rate 5.8 % 5.8 % 5.8 % (a) This amount does not include the discount included in long term debt of ($105) million and the impact of interest rate derivatives of $55 million. Changes in interest rates affect the amount of interest we earn on our cash, cash equivalents and short term investments and the interest rate we pay on borrowings under our revolving bank credit facility. All of our other long term indebtedness is fixed rate and, therefore, does not expose us to the risk of earnings or cash flow loss due to changes in market interest rates. However, changes in interest rates do affect the fair value of our debt. Interest Rate Derivatives We use interest rate derivatives to mitigate our exposure to the volatility in interest rates. For interest rate derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges (in accordance with SFAS 133), changes in fair value are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as assets (liabilities), and the debts carrying value amount is adjusted by the change in the fair value of the debt subsequent to the initiation of the derivative. Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments not qualifying as fair value hedges are recorded currently as adjustments to interest expense. Gains or losses from derivative transactions are reflected as adjustments to interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations. Realized gains (losses) included in interest expense were ($1) million, ($2) million and $5 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Pursuant to SFAS 133, certain derivatives do not qualify for designation as fair value hedges. Changes in the fair value of these non qualifying derivatives that occur prior to their maturity (i.e., temporary fluctuations in value) are reported currently in the consolidated statements of operations as unrealized gains (losses) within interest expense. Unrealized gains (losses) included in interest expense were ($40) million, $2 million and $2 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. 58 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements As of December 31, 2007, the following derivatives were outstanding: NotionalAmount($ in millions) WeightedAverageFixedRate WeightedAverageFloatingRate WeightedAverageCap/FloorRate FairValueHedge NetPremiums($ in millions) FairValue($ in millions) Fixed to Floating Swaps: July 2005 January 2018 $ 1,500 6.750 % 6 month LIBORplus 164 basis points Yes $ $ 28 September 2004 July 2013 $ 325 7.942 % 6 month LIBORplus 297 basis points No 9 Floating to Fixed Swaps: August 2007 July 2010 $ 750 4.803 % 3 month LIBOR No (14 ) Call Options: August 2007 February 2008 $ 750 6.875 % No 6 (32 ) Collars: August 2007 August 2010 $ 1,075 5.37% 4.32% No (20 ) $ 6 $ (29 ) In 2007, we sold call options on six of our interest rate swaps and received $11 million in premiums. Two of the options expired unexercised in 2007. In 2007, we closed ten interest rate swaps for a gain totaling $18 million. These interest rate swaps were designated as fair value hedges, and the settlement amounts received will be amortized as a reduction to realized interest expense over the remaining term of the related senior notes. Foreign Currency Derivatives On December 6, 2006, we issued 600 million of 6.25% Euro denominated Senior Notes due 2017. Concurrent with the issuance of the Euro denominated senior notes, we entered into a cross currency swap to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in the euro relative to the dollar over the term of the notes. Under the terms of the cross currency swap, on each semi annual interest payment date, the counterparties will pay Chesapeake 19 million and Chesapeake will pay the counterparties $30 million, which will yield an annual dollar equivalent interest rate of 7.491%. Upon maturity of the notes, the counterparties will pay Chesapeake 600 million and Chesapeake will pay the counterparties $800 million. The terms of the cross currency swap were based on the dollar/euro exchange rate on the issuance date of $1.3325 to 1.00. Through the cross currency swap, we have eliminated any potential variability in Chesapeakes expected cash flows related to changes in foreign exchange rates and therefore the swap qualifies as a cash flow hedge under SFAS 133. The euro denominated debt is recorded in notes payable ($876 million at December 31, 2007) using an exchange rate of $1.4603 to 1.00. The fair value of the cross currency swap is recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as an asset of $23 million at December 31, 2007. The translation adjustment to notes payable is completely offset by the fair value of the cross currency swap and therefore there is no impact to the consolidated statement of operations. The remaining value of the cross currency swap related to future interest payments is reported in other comprehensive income. 59 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements
