We refer you to Note 14 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements appearing in Item 8 of this report, which summarizes by segment our net income and capital expenditures for 2008, 2007 and 2006 and our assets as of December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006. Executive Summary We are the largest independent producer of natural gas in the United States. We own interests in approximately 41,200 producing oil and natural gas wells that are currently producing approximately 2.3 bcfe per day, 92% of which is natural gas. Our strategy is focused on discovering, acquiring and developing conventional and unconventional natural gas reserves onshore in the U.S., primarily in the Big 4 natural gas shale plays: the Barnett Shale in the Fort Worth Basin of north central Texas, the Haynesville Shale in the Ark La Tex area of northwestern Louisiana and East Texas, the Fayetteville Shale in the Arkoma Basin of central Arkansas and the Marcellus Shale in the northern Appalachian Basin of West Virginia, Pennsylvania and New York. We also have substantial operations in various other plays, both conventional and unconventional, in the Mid Continent, Appalachian Basin, Permian Basin, Delaware Basin, South Texas, Texas Gulf Coast and Ark La Tex regions of the United States. During 2008, Chesapeake continued the industrys most active drilling program drilling 1,819 gross (1,491 net) operated wells and participating in another 1,857 gross (242 net) wells operated by other companies. The companys drilling success rate was 99% for company operated wells and 98% for non operated wells. Also during 2008, we invested $5.043 billion in operated wells (using an average of 145 operated rigs) and $754 million in non operated wells (using an average of 110 non operated rigs) for total drilling, completing and equipping costs of $5.797 billion. Chesapeake began 2008 with estimated proved reserves of 10.879 tcfe and ended the year with 12.051 tcfe, an increase of 1.172 tcfe, or 11%. During 2008, we replaced 843 bcfe of production with an internally estimated 2.015 tcfe of new proved reserves, for a reserve replacement rate of 239%. Reserve replacement through the drillbit was 2.545 tcfe, or 302% of production, including 1.248 tcfe of positive performance revisions and 298 bcfe of negative revisions resulting from natural gas and oil price decreases between December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2008. Reserve replacement through the acquisition of proved reserves was 172 bcfe. During 2008, we divested 702 bcfe of estimated proved reserves. Our annual decline rate on producing properties is projected to be 29% from 2009 to 2010, 18% from 2010 to 2011, 14% from 2011 to 2012, 11% from 2012 to 2013 and 9% from 2013 to 2014. Our percentage of proved undeveloped reserve additions to total proved reserve additions was approximately 2% in 2008, 29% in 2007 and 38% in 2006. Based on our current drilling schedule and budget, we expect that virtually all of the proved undeveloped reserves added in 2008 will begin producing within the next three to five years. Generally, proved developed reserves are producing at the time they are added or will begin producing within one year. Since 2000, Chesapeake has invested $12.6 billion in new leasehold (net of divestitures) and 3 D seismic acquisitions and now owns the largest combined inventories of onshore leasehold (15 million net acres) and 3 D seismic (22 million acres) in the U.S. On this leasehold, the company has approximately 36,000 net drillsites representing more than a 10 year inventory of drilling projects. Business Strategy Our exploration, development and acquisition activities require us to make substantial operating and capital expenditures. Through the middle of 2008, we increased our capital expenditure budget for 2008 and 2009 several times in response to higher leasehold acquisition costs and in order to accelerate leasehold acquisition and drilling in the Haynesville Shale and other plays. During the second half of 2008, in response to a significant decrease in natural gas prices, deteriorating global economic conditions and outlook and concerns about a 35 Table of Contents potential oversupply of natural gas in the U.S. market, we significantly reduced our planned capital expenditures through year end 2010 in order to bring our planned operating and capital expenditures within our anticipated internally generated cash flow. Our current budgeted capital expenditures for drilling, leasehold and producing property acquisitions, geophysical costs, and additions to midstream, compression and other property and equipment are $4.150 billion to $4.675 billion in 2009 and $4.550 billion to $5.175 billion in 2010. Cash flow from operations is our primary source of liquidity used to fund operating expenses and capital expenditures. Our $3.5 billion revolving bank credit facility and our $460 million midstream revolving bank credit facility, discussed more fully below, provide us with additional liquidity. In response to the difficulties faced by several financial institutions and to ensure we had ample liquidity available, we borrowed the remaining capacity under our revolving bank credit facility at the end of the third quarter of 2008. As a result, we had borrowings of $3.474 billion and letters of credit of $15 million outstanding under that facility as of December 31, 2008. As of December 31, 2008, we had borrowings of $460 million under the midstream credit facility. During 2008, we relied on capital markets financings and asset monetization transactions, such as sales of producing properties, undeveloped acreage and non strategic assets, joint venture arrangements and volumetric production payment, or VPP, transactions to provide us with additional capital. Since March 31, 2008, these types of transactions have provided approximately $12.1 billion of new capital, and up to $4.6 billion of our future drilling and completion costs in the Haynesville, Fayetteville and Marcellus Shales will be funded by our joint venture partners. These transactions are summarized below: From April through July of 2008, we issued 51.75 million shares of our common stock, $800 million of our 7.25% Senior Notes due 2018 and $1.380 billion of our 2.25% Contingent Convertible Senior Notes due 2038, resulting in aggregate net proceeds to us of $4.734 billion. The availability of any additional capital from the public or private markets is uncertain at this time. In May, August and December of 2008, we completed three separate VPP transactions involving approximately 285 bcfe of proved reserves and net production (at the time of sale) of 153 mmcfe per day from wells in Texas, Oklahoma and Kansas, resulting in aggregate net proceeds to us of $1.6 billion. In July of 2008, we entered into a joint venture with Plains Exploration & Production Company to develop our Haynesville Shale leasehold, under the terms of which (1) Plains acquired a 20% interest in our approximately 550,000 net acres of Haynesville Shale leasehold for $1.65 billion in cash, (2) Plains agreed to fund 50% of our 80% share of the costs associated with drilling and completing future Haynesville Shale joint venture wells over a multi year period, up to an additional $1.65 billion and (3) Plains will have the right to a 20% participation in any additional leasehold we acquire in the Haynesville Shale. Subsequently, in February 2009, we amended the joint venture to provide Plains a one time option in June 2010 to reduce its obligation to fund our drilling and completion costs by $800 million in exchange for assigning us 50% of its interest in the Haynesville joint venture properties. In August of 2008, we sold 90,000 net acres of leasehold and producing natural gas properties with net production (at the time of sale) of 50 mmcfe per day in the Arkoma Basin Woodford Shale play in Oklahoma to BP America Inc. for $1.7 billion in cash. In September of 2008, we entered into a joint venture with BP America Inc. to develop our Fayetteville Shale leasehold, under the terms of which (1) BP acquired a 25% interest in our approximately 540,000 net acres of Fayetteville Shale leasehold for $1.1 billion in cash, (2) BP agreed to fund 100% of our 75% share of the costs associated with drilling and completing future Fayetteville Shale joint venture wells over a multi year period, up to an additional $800 million and (3) BP will have the right to a 25% participation in any additional leasehold we acquire in the Fayetteville Shale. In November of 2008, we entered into a joint venture with a U.S. subsidiary of StatoilHydro ASA, under the terms of which StatoilHydro acquired a 32.5% interest in our approximately 1.8 million net acres of Marcellus Shale leasehold for $1.25 billion in cash, (2) StatoilHydro agreed to fund 75% of 36 Table of Contents our 67.5% share of the costs associated with drilling and completing future Marcellus Shale joint venture wells over a multi year period, up to an additional $2.125 billion and (3) StatoilHydro will have the right to a 32.5% participation in any additional leasehold we acquire in the Marcellus Shale. Additionally, Chesapeake and StatoilHydro are evaluating opportunities for an international strategic alliance to jointly explore unconventional natural gas opportunities worldwide. During the fourth quarter of 2008, we privately exchanged $765 million in aggregate principal amount of our 2.75% Contingent Convertible Senior Notes due 2035, our 2.50% Contingent Convertible Senior Notes due 2037 and our 2.25% Contingent Convertible Senior Notes due 2038 for an aggregate of 23,913,203 shares of our common stock. Our net debt as a percentage of total capitalization (total capitalization is the sum of net debt less cash on hand and stockholders equity) was 43% as of December 31, 2008 and 47% as of December 31, 2007. The average maturity of our long term debt as of December 31, 2008 was over eight years with an average interest rate of approximately 5.6%. No scheduled principal payments are required under our senior notes until 2013 when $864 million is due. We plan to continue to evaluate asset monetization transactions in order to create additional value from our proved and unproved properties and to increase our financial flexibility. Management believes that our leasehold and development joint ventures and various asset monetization programs benefit the company by improving our asset base, reducing our financial risk, decreasing our DD&A rate and increasing our profitability per unit of production, thereby increasing our returns on capital and advancing future value creation. We may also consider alternative sources of public or private investment in the company or its subsidiaries. While we believe that our anticipated internally generated cash flow, cash resources and other sources of liquidity will allow us to fully fund our 2009 and 2010 operating and capital expenditure requirements, further deterioration of the economy and other factors could require us to fund these expenditures from monetization transactions or further curtail our spending. Liquidity and Capital Resources Sources and Uses of Funds Cash flow from operations is a significant source of liquidity used to fund operating expenses and capital expenditures. Cash provided by operating activities was $5.236 billion in 2008, compared to $4.932 billion in 2007 and $4.843 billion in 2006. The $304 million increase from 2007 to 2008 was primarily due to higher volumes of natural gas and oil production. The $89 million increase from 2006 to 2007 was primarily due to higher volumes of natural gas and oil production. Changes in cash flow from operations are largely due to the same factors that affect our net income, excluding non cash items, such as depreciation, depletion and amortization, deferred income taxes and unrealized gains and (losses) on derivatives. See the discussion below under Results of Operations. Changes in market prices for natural gas and oil directly impact the level of our cash flow from operations. To mitigate the risk of declines in natural gas or oil prices and to provide more predictable future cash flow from operations, we currently have hedged through swaps and collars 78% of our expected remaining natural gas and oil production in 2009 and 48% of our expected natural gas and oil production in 2010 at average prices of $7.71 and $9.02 per mcfe, respectively. Our natural gas and oil hedges as of December 31, 2008 are detailed in Item 7A of this report. Depending on changes in natural gas and oil futures markets and managements view of underlying natural gas and oil supply and demand trends, we may increase or decrease our current hedging positions. As of December 31, 2008, we had a net natural gas and oil derivative asset of $1.305 billion. We have arrangements with our hedging counterparties that allow us to minimize the potential liquidity impact of significant mark to market fluctuations in the value of our natural gas and oil hedges by making collateral allocations from our bank credit facility or directly pledging natural gas and oil properties, rather than posting cash or letters of credit with the counterparties. 37 Table of Contents Our $3.5 billion bank credit facility, our $460 million midstream bank credit facility and cash and cash equivalents are other sources of liquidity. Following the February 2009 issuance of $1.425 billion of 9.5% Senior Notes due 2015, there was as of February 26, 2009 $1.864 billion of borrowing capacity available under the revolving bank credit facility and $36 million of borrowing capacity under the midstream credit facility. We use the facilities and cash on hand to fund daily operating activities and acquisitions as needed. We borrowed $13.3 billion and repaid $11.3 billion in 2008, we borrowed $7.9 billion and repaid $6.2 billion in 2007, and we borrowed $8.4 billion and repaid $8.3 billion in 2006 under our bank credit facilities. A substantial portion of our natural gas and oil properties are not currently pledged under debt or hedging arrangements and therefore are available to be pledged as additional collateral under our revolving bank credit facility if needed based on our periodic borrowing base and collateral redeterminations. Accordingly, we believe our borrowing capacity will not be reduced associated with such periodic redeterminations. On April 2, 2008, we issued 23 million shares of our common stock in a public offering at a price of $45.75 per share, and on July 15, 2008, we issued 28.75 million shares of common stock in a public offering at a price of $57.25 per share. On May 20, 2008 we completed public offerings of $800 million of our 7.25% Senior Notes due 2018 and $1.380 billion of our 2.25% Contingent Convertible Senior Notes due 2038. These four offerings resulted in aggregate net proceeds to us of approximately $4.734 billion, which we used to fund the redemption of our 7.75% Senior Notes due 2015 and to temporarily repay indebtedness outstanding under our revolving bank credit facility. The following table reflects the proceeds from sales of securities we issued in 2008, 2007 and 2006 (in millions): 2008 2007 2006 TotalProceeds NetProceeds TotalProceeds NetProceeds TotalProceeds NetProceeds Common stock $ 2,698 $ 2,598 $ $ $ 1,800 $ 1,759 Contingent convertible senior notes 1,380 1,349 1,650 1,607 Senior notes 800 787 1,799 1,755 Convertible preferred stock 575 558 Total $ 4,878 $ 4,734 $ 1,650 $ 1,607 $ 4,174 $ 4,072 In May 2008, we sold a portion of our proved reserves in certain producing assets in Texas, Oklahoma and Kansas in a VPP transaction for proceeds of approximately $616 million, net of transaction costs. We completed another VPP transaction in August 2008, when we sold a portion of our proved reserves in certain producing assets in the Anadarko Basin of Oklahoma for proceeds of approximately $594 million, net of transaction costs. Also, in December 2008, we sold certain long lived producing assets in the Anadarko and Arkoma Basins in a VPP transaction for proceeds of approximately $412 million, net of transaction costs. Approximately, $43 million of the proceeds are being held in escrow until post closing adjustments have been finalized. In August 2008, we sold leasehold and producing natural gas properties in the Arkoma Basin Woodford Shale play in Oklahoma for $1.7 billion in cash. In the second half of 2008, the company entered into three joint venture arrangements covering three of the companys Big 4 shale plays. In the joint ventures, the company has collaborated with other leading energy companies to accelerate the development of the companys properties in the Haynesville Shale, the Fayetteville Shale and the Marcellus Shale. In total, we sold leasehold and producing property assets in which we had a cost basis of approximately $1.2 billion to these three joint venture partners for total cash consideration of $4.0 billion and up to $4.6 billion of future drilling cost carries while we retained a majority interest in each joint venture. The drilling cost carries of up to approximately $4.2 billion that remain unused as of December 31, 2008 will be extremely valuable in the years ahead by enabling the company to develop reserves in these joint venture shale plays at greatly reduced costs. We are also considering opportunities for other joint venture transactions to develop our properties. Our primary use of funds is for capital expenditures related to exploration, development and acquisition of natural gas and oil properties. We refer you to the table under Investing Activities below, which sets forth the components of our natural gas and oil investing activities and other investing activities for 2008, 2007 and 2006. 38 Table of Contents We retain a significant degree of control over the timing of our capital expenditures which permits us to defer or accelerate certain capital expenditures if necessary to address any potential liquidity issues. In addition, higher drilling and field operating costs, drilling results that alter planned development schedules, acquisitions or other factors could cause us to revise our drilling program, which is largely discretionary. We paid dividends on our common stock of $148 million, $115 million and $87 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend on common stock from $0.0675 to $0.075 per share beginning with the dividend paid in July 2008. Dividends paid on our preferred stock decreased to $35 million in 2008 from $95 million in 2007 and $88 million in 2006 as a result of conversions and exchanges of preferred stock into common stock during 2008 and 2007. In 2008, holders of our 4.5% cumulative convertible preferred stock and our 5.0% (Series 2005B) cumulative preferred stock exchanged 891,100 shares and 3,654,385 shares for 2,227,750 shares and 10,443,642 shares of common stock, respectively, in privately negotiated exchanges. The exchanges resulted in a loss of $67 million. In 2007, holders of our 5.0% (Series 2005) cumulative convertible preferred stock and 6.25% mandatory convertible preferred stock exchanged 4,535,880 shares and 2,156,184 shares for 19,038,891 and 17,367,823 shares of common stock, respectively, in public exchange offers. The exchanges resulted in a loss $128 million. We received $9 million, $15 million and $73 million from the exercise of employee and director stock options in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. We paid $5 million, $0 and $86 million to purchase treasury stock in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Of these amounts, $5 million and $11 million were used to fund our matching contribution to our 401(k) and deferred compensation plans in 2008 and 2006, respectively. The remaining $75 million in 2006 was used to purchase shares of common stock to be used upon the exercise of stock options under certain stock option plans. In 2008, 2007 and 2006, we paid $167 million, $91 million and $87 million, respectively, to settle a portion of the derivative liabilities assumed in our 2005 acquisition of Columbia Natural Resources, LLC. SFAS 123(R) requires tax benefits resulting from stock based compensation deductions in excess of amounts reported for financial reporting purposes to be reported as cash flows from financing activities. In 2008, 2007 and 2006, we reported a tax benefit from stock based compensation of $43 million, $20 million and $88 million, respectively. Outstanding payments from certain disbursement accounts in excess of funded cash balances where no legal right of set off exists increased by $330 million, decreased by $98 million and increased by $70 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. All disbursements are funded on the day they are presented to our bank using available cash on hand or draws on our revolving bank credit facility. Credit Risk A significant portion of our liquidity is concentrated in both cash and cash equivalents and derivative instruments. On December 31, 2008, our cash and cash equivalents were invested in money market funds with investment grade ratings. A significant portion of these funds was invested at the close of business on September 19, 2008, and is protected under the U.S. Treasury Departments Temporary Guarantee Program. The remaining funds were spread among several counterparties to mitigate risk. Derivative instruments enable us to hedge a portion of our exposure to natural gas and oil prices and interest rate volatility. These arrangements expose us to credit risk from our counterparties. To mitigate this risk, we enter into derivative contracts only with investment grade rated counterparties deemed by management to be competent and competitive market makers and spread our instruments among multiple counterparties such that no single counterparty represents a material credit risk to the company. Recently there have been concerns about the ability of certain counterparties to continue to meet their financial obligations. We monitor the creditworthiness of all our counterparties and do not believe a failure by a counterparty would have a material negative impact on our liquidity. 39 Table of Contents Our accounts receivable are primarily from purchasers of natural gas and oil ($738 million at December 31, 2008) and exploration and production companies which own interests in properties we operate ($424 million at December 31, 2008). This industry concentration has the potential to impact our overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively, in that our customers and joint working interest owners may be similarly affected by changes in economic, industry or other conditions. We generally require letters of credit or parental guarantees for receivables from parties which are judged to have sub standard credit, unless the credit risk can otherwise be mitigated. Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities increased to $9.844 billion in 2008, compared to $7.922 billion in 2007 and $8.942 billion in 2006. We have continued our active drilling program and our acquisitions are focused on leasehold and property acquisitions needed for planned natural gas and oil development. Our investing activities during the past two years reflect our increasing focus on acquiring unproved leasehold and converting our resource inventory into production, redeploying our capital by selling natural gas and oil properties with lower rates of return and increasing our investment in properties with higher return potential, and investing in drilling rigs, midstream systems, compressors and other property and equipment to support our natural gas and oil exploration, development and production activities. The following table shows our cash used in (provided by) investing activities during 2008, 2007 and 2006 (in millions): Natural Gas and Oil Investing Activities: 2008 2007 2006 Acquisitions of natural gas and oil companies and proved properties, net of cash acquired $ 372 $ 520 $ 1,104 Acquisition of leasehold and unproved properties 7,660 2,187 3,301 Exploration and development of natural gas and oil properties 5,789 4,962 3,009 Geological and geophysical costs 315 343 154 Interest capitalized on unproved properties 440 254 172 Proceeds from sale of volumetric production payments (1,579 ) (1,089 ) Deposits for acquisitions 12 15 21 Divestitures of proved and unproved properties and leasehold (6,091 ) Total natural gas and oil investing activities 6,918 7,192 7,761 Other Investing Activities: Additions to other property and equipment 3,073 1,439 987 Proceeds from sale of drilling rigs and equipment (64 ) (369 ) (244 ) Proceeds from sale of compressors (114 ) (188 ) Additions to investments 74 8 554 Proceeds from sale of investments (2 ) (124 ) (159 ) Acquisition of trucking company, net of cash acquired 45 Sale of other assets (41 ) (36 ) (2 ) Total other investing activities 2,926 730 1,181 Total cash used in investing activities $ 9,844 $ 7,922 $ 8,942 Due to the current financial crisis, decreases in natural gas prices and concerns about an oversupply of natural gas in the U.S. market, we and other exploration and production companies have significantly decreased budgets for natural gas and oil investing activities in 2009. In connection with our reduced budget for acquisitions, we are using our common stock for some or all of the consideration for certain transactions. In December 2008, we registered 25 million shares of common stock that we may offer and issue to acquire assets (including mineral interests), businesses or securities of other companies. As of February 26, 2009, we had issued approximately 16 million shares of common stock for leasehold acquisitions and anticipate we may issue the remaining shares over the course of 2009. 40 Table of Contents Bank Credit Facilities We have a $3.5 billion syndicated revolving bank credit facility that matures in November 2012. As of December 31, 2008, we had $3.474 billion in outstanding borrowings under this facility and had utilized approximately $15 million of the facility for various letters of credit. To ensure that our revolving credit facility could be fully utilized in these turbulent economic times, we borrowed the remaining capacity under our facility at the end of the third quarter and invested the cash proceeds in short term highly liquid securities. As a result, on December 31, 2008, we had cash and cash equivalents on hand of approximately $1.749 billion. All 36 lenders that participate in our revolving credit facility fully funded their commitment, with the exception of Lehman Brothers Commercial Bank, a subsidiary of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., which has filed for bankruptcy protection. Lehman Brothers Commercial Bank did not fund its $11 million share of the advance. Borrowings under the facility are secured by certain producing natural gas and oil properties and bear interest at our option at either (i) the greater of the reference rate of Union Bank of California, N.A., or the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50% or (ii) London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), plus a margin that varies from 0.75% to 1.50% per annum according to our senior unsecured long term debt ratings. The collateral value and borrowing base are redetermined periodically. The unused portion of the facility is subject to a commitment fee that also varies according to our senior unsecured long term debt ratings, from 0.125% to 0.30% per annum. Currently the commitment fee is 0.20% per annum. Interest is payable quarterly or, if LIBOR applies, it may be payable at more frequent intervals. Our subsidiaries, Chesapeake Exploration, L.L.C. and Chesapeake Appalachia, L.L.C., are the borrowers under our revolving bank credit facility and Chesapeake and all its other wholly owned restricted subsidiaries are guarantors. The credit facility agreement contains various covenants and restrictive provisions which limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness, make investments or loans and create liens. The credit facility agreement requires us to maintain an indebtedness to total capitalization ratio (as defined) not to exceed 0.70 to 1 and an indebtedness to EBITDA ratio (as defined) not to exceed 3.75 to 1. As defined by the credit facility agreement, our indebtedness to total capitalization ratio was 0.43 to 1 and our indebtedness to EBITDA ratio was 2.43 to 1 at December 31, 2008. If we should fail to perform our obligations under these and other covenants, the revolving credit commitment could be terminated and any outstanding borrowings under the facility could be declared immediately due and payable. Such acceleration, if involving a principal amount of $10 million ($50 million in the case of our senior notes issued after 2004), would constitute an event of default under our senior note indentures, which could in turn result in the acceleration of a significant portion of our senior note indebtedness. The credit facility agreement also has cross default provisions that apply to other indebtedness of the company and its restricted subsidiaries that we may have with an outstanding principal amount in excess of $75 million. On October 16, 2008, we closed a new secured revolving bank credit facility for our non Appalachian midstream operations, which have recently been restructured under a new unrestricted subsidiary, Chesapeake Midstream Partners, L.P. (CMP) and its operating subsidiary, Chesapeake Midstream Operating, L.L.C. (CMO). Twelve financial institutions are in the facility bank group. The facility matures in October 2013, has initial availability of $460 million and may be expanded up to $750 million at CMOs option, subject to additional bank participation. CMO is utilizing the facility to fund capital expenditures associated with building additional natural gas gathering and other systems associated with our drilling program and for general corporate purposes related to our midstream operations. As of December 31, 2008, we had $460 million in outstanding borrowings under the midstream credit facility. The midstream credit facility agreement contains various covenants and restrictive provisions which limit the ability of CMP and its subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness, make investments or loans and create liens. The credit facility agreement requires maintenance of an indebtedness to EBITDA ratio (as defined) not to exceed 3.50 to 1, and an EBITDA (as defined) to interest expense coverage ratio of not less than 2.50 to 1. As defined by the credit facility agreement, our indebtedness to EBITDA ratio was 2.59 to 1 and our EBITDA to interest expense coverage ratio was 9.36 to 1 at December 31, 2008. If CMP or its subsidiaries should fail to perform their obligations under these and other covenants, the revolving credit commitment could be terminated 41 Table of Contents and any outstanding borrowings under the midstream facility could be declared immediately due and payable. The midstream credit facility agreement also has cross default provisions that apply to other indebtedness CMP and its subsidiaries may have with an outstanding principal amount in excess of $15 million. Hedging Facilities We have six secured hedging facilities, each of which permits us to enter into cash settled natural gas and oil commodity transactions, valued by the counterparty, for up to a stated maximum value. Outstanding transactions under each facility are collateralized by certain of our natural gas and oil properties that do not secure any of our other obligations. The value of reserve collateral pledged to each facility is required to be at least 1.3 or 1.5 times the fair value of transactions outstanding under each facility. In addition, we may pledge collateral from our revolving bank credit facility, from time to time, to these facilities to meet any additional collateral coverage requirements. The hedging facilities are subject to an annual exposure fee, which is assessed quarterly based on the average of the daily negative fair value amounts of the hedges, if any, during the quarter. The hedging facilities contain the standard representations and default provisions that are typical of such agreements. The agreements also contain various restrictive provisions which govern the aggregate natural gas and oil production volumes that we are permitted to hedge under all of our agreements at any one time. The fair value of outstanding transactions, per annum exposure fees and the scheduled maturity dates are shown below. Secured Hedging Facilities (a) #1 #2 #3 #4 #5 #6 ($ in millions) Fair value of outstanding transactions, as of December 31, 2008 $ 116 $ 369 $ 37 $ 9 $ 245 $ 94 Per annum exposure fee 1 % 1 % 0.8 % 0.8 % 0.8 % 0.8 % Scheduled maturity date 2010 2013 2020 2012 2012 2012 (a) Chesapeake Exploration, L.L.C. is the named party to the facilities numbered 1 3 and Chesapeake Energy Corporation is the named party to the facilities numbered 4 6. Our revolving bank credit facility, the midstream credit facility and the secured hedging facilities do not contain material adverse change or adequate assurance covenants. Although the applicable interest rates and commitment fees in our revolving bank credit facility fluctuate slightly based on our long term senior unsecured credit ratings, neither of our credit facilities nor the secured hedging facilities contain provisions which would trigger an acceleration of amounts due under the facilities or a requirement to post additional collateral in the event of a downgrade of our credit ratings. 42 Table of Contents Senior Note Obligations In addition to outstanding revolving bank credit facility borrowings discussed above, as of December 31, 2008, senior notes represented approximately $10.3 billion of our long term debt and consisted of the following ($ in millions): 7.5% Senior Notes due 2013 $ 364 7.625% Senior Notes due 2013 500 7.0% Senior Notes due 2014 300 7.5% Senior Notes due 2014 300 7.75% Senior Notes due 2015 (a) 6.375% Senior Notes due 2015 600 6.625% Senior Notes due 2016 600 6.875% Senior Notes due 2016 670 6.25% Euro denominated Senior Notes due 2017 (b) 835 6.5% Senior Notes due 2017 (b) 1,100 7.25% Senior Notes due 2018 800 6.25% Senior Notes due 2018 600 6.875% Senior Notes due 2020 500 2.75% Contingent Convertible Senior Notes due 2035 (c) 451 2.5% Contingent Convertible Senior Notes due 2037 (c) 1,378 2.25% Contingent Convertible Senior Notes due 2038 (c) 1,126 Discount on senior notes (85 ) Interest rate derivatives (d) 211 $ 10,250 (a) The 7.75% Senior Notes due 2015 were redeemed on July 7, 2008. In connection with the transaction we recorded a $31 million loss (which consisted of a $12 million premium and the write off of $19 million in various charges associated with the notes). (b) The principal amount shown is based on the dollar/euro exchange rate of $1.3919 to 1.00 as of December 31, 2008. See Note 10 for information on our related cross currency swap. (c) The holders of our contingent convertible senior notes may require us to repurchase, in cash, all or a portion of their notes at 100% of the principal amount of the notes on any of four dates that are five, ten, fifteen and twenty years before the maturity date. The notes are convertible, at the holders option, prior to maturity under certain circumstances into cash and, if applicable, shares of our common stock using a net share settlement process. One such triggering circumstance is when the price of our common stock exceeds a threshold amount during a specified period in a fiscal quarter. Convertibility based on common stock price is measured quarter by quarter. In the fourth quarter of 2008, the price of our common stock was below the threshold level for each series of the contingent convertible senior notes during the specified period and, as a result, the holders do not have the option to convert their notes into cash and common stock in the first quarter of 2009 under this provision. The notes are also convertible, at the holders option, during specified five day periods if the trading price of the notes is below certain levels determined by reference to the trading price of our common stock. In general, upon conversion of a contingent convertible senior note, the holder will receive cash equal to the principal amount of the note and common stock for the notes conversion value in excess of such principal amount. We will pay contingent interest on the convertible senior notes after they have been outstanding at least ten years, under certain conditions. We may redeem the convertible senior notes once they have been outstanding for ten years at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount of the notes, payable in cash. The optional repurchase dates, the common stock price conversion threshold amounts and the ending date of the first six month period contingent interest may be payable for the contingent convertible senior notes are as follows: Contingent Convertible Senior Notes Repurchase Dates Common StockPrice ConversionThresholds Contingent Interest First Payable (if applicable) 2.75% due 2035 November 15, 2015, 2020, 2025, 2030 $ 48.81 May 14, 2016 2.5% due 2037 May 15, 2017, 2022, 2027, 2032 $ 64.47 November 14, 2017 2.25% due 2038 December 15, 2018, 2023, 2028, 2033 $ 107.36 June 14, 2019 (d) See Note 9 for further discussion related to these instruments. 43 Table of Contents No scheduled principal payments are required under our senior notes until 2013, when $864 million is due. As of December 31, 2008 and currently, debt ratings for the senior notes are Ba3 by Moodys Investor Service (stable outlook), BB by Standard & Poors Ratings Services (stable outlook) and BB by Fitch Ratings (negative outlook). Our senior notes are unsecured senior obligations of Chesapeake and rank equally in right of payment with all of our other existing and future senior indebtedness and rank senior in right of payment to all of our future subordinated indebtedness. We may redeem the senior notes, other than the contingent convertible senior notes, at any time at specified make whole redemption prices. Senior notes issued before July 2005 are governed by indentures containing covenants that limit our ability and our restricted subsidiaries ability to incur additional indebtedness; pay dividends on our capital stock or redeem, repurchase or retire our capital stock or subordinated indebtedness; make investments and other restricted payments; incur liens; enter into sale/leaseback transactions; create restrictions on the payment of dividends or other amounts to us from our restricted subsidiaries; engage in transactions with affiliates; sell assets; and consolidate, merge or transfer assets. Senior notes issued after June 2005 are governed by indentures containing covenants that limit our ability and our restricted subsidiaries ability to incur certain secured indebtedness; enter into sale/leaseback transactions; and consolidate, merge or transfer assets. The debt incurrence covenants do not presently restrict our ability to borrow under or expand our secured credit facility. As of December 31, 2008, we estimate that secured commercial bank indebtedness of approximately $5.8 billion could have been incurred under the most restrictive indenture covenant. Chesapeake Energy Corporation is a holding company and owns no operating assets and has no significant operations independent of its subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2007, our obligations under our outstanding senior notes and contingent convertible notes were fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, by all of our wholly owned subsidiaries, other than minor subsidiaries, on a senior unsecured basis. Since October 2008, following the restructuring of our non Appalachian midstream operations, certain of our subsidiaries having significant assets and operations have not guaranteed our outstanding senior notes and contingent convertible notes. Condensed consolidating financial information for Chesapeake and its combined guarantor and combined non guarantor subsidiaries as of and for the year ended December 31, 2008 is provided in Note 16 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.

(c) See Note 5 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for a description of unrecognized tax benefits. 44 Table of Contents Chesapeake has commitments to purchase natural gas and oil associated with volumetric production payment transactions that extend over terms ranging from 11 to 15 years based on market prices at the time of production and the purchased gas will be resold. The obligations are as follows: Mmcfe 2009 68,238 2010 60,723 2011 53,694 2012 48,069 2013 43,477 After 2013 181,574 Total 455,775 Other Commitments We own a 49% interest in Mountain Drilling Company, a company that specializes in hydraulic drilling rigs which are designed for drilling in urban areas. Chesapeake has an agreement to lend Mountain Drilling Company up to $32 million through December 31, 2009. At December 31, 2008, Mountain Drilling owed Chesapeake $19 million under this agreement. We invested in Ventura Refining and Transmission LLC in early 2007 and today own a 25% interest. There were no refineries in western Oklahoma until Ventura opened its refinery in 2006. We have agreed to guarantee various commitments for Ventura, up to $70 million, to support their operating activities. As of December 31, 2008, we had $7 million of outstanding performance guarantees. Hedging Activities Natural Gas and Oil Hedging Activities Our results of operations and operating cash flows are impacted by changes in market prices for natural gas and oil. To mitigate a portion of the exposure to adverse market changes, we have entered into various derivative instruments. Executive management is involved in all risk management activities and the Board of Directors reviews the companys hedging program at its quarterly Board meetings. We believe we have sufficient internal controls to prevent unauthorized hedging. As of December 31, 2008, our natural gas and oil derivative instruments were comprised of swaps, basis protection swaps, knockout swaps, cap swaps, call options, put options and collars. Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk contains a description of each of these instruments. Although derivatives often fail to achieve 100% effectiveness for accounting purposes, we believe our derivative instruments continue to be highly effective in achieving the risk management objectives for which they were intended. Hedging allows us to predict with greater certainty the effective prices we will receive for our hedged natural gas and oil production. We closely monitor the fair value of our hedging contracts and may elect to settle a contract prior to its scheduled maturity date in order to lock in a gain or loss. Commodity markets are volatile and Chesapeakes hedging activities are dynamic. 45 Table of Contents Mark to market positions under natural gas and oil hedging contracts fluctuate with commodity prices. As described above under Bank Credit Facilities and Hedging Facilities, we may be required to deliver collateral or other assurances of performance if our payment obligations to our hedging counterparties exceed levels stated in our contracts. Our realized and unrealized gains and losses on natural gas and oil derivatives during 2008, 2007 and 2006 were as follows: Years Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 ($ in millions) Natural gas and oil sales $ 7,069 $ 4,795 $ 3,870 Realized gains (losses) on natural gas and oil derivatives (8 ) 1,203 1,254 Unrealized gains (losses) on non qualifying natural gas and oil derivatives 887 (252 ) 184 Unrealized gains (losses) on ineffectiveness of cash flow hedges (90 ) (122 ) 311 Total natural gas and oil sales $ 7,858 $ 5,624 $ 5,619 Changes in the fair value of natural gas and oil derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, to the extent effective in offsetting cash flows attributable to the hedged commodities, and locked in gains and losses of derivative contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and are transferred to earnings in the month of related production. These unrealized gains (losses), net of related tax effects, totaled $386 million, $53 million and $546 million as of December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Based upon the market prices at December 31, 2008, we expect to transfer to earnings approximately $345 million of the net gain included in the balance of accumulated other comprehensive income during the next 12 months. A detailed explanation of accounting for natural gas and oil derivatives under SFAS 133 appears under Application of Critical Accounting Policies Hedging elsewhere in this Item 7. The estimated fair values of our natural gas and oil derivative instruments as of December 31, 2008 and 2007 are provided below. The associated carrying values of these instruments are equal to the estimated fair values.

For interest rate derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges (in accordance with SFAS 133), changes in fair value are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as assets (liabilities), and the debts carrying value amount is adjusted by the change in the fair value of the debt subsequent to the initiation of the derivative. Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments not qualifying as fair value hedges are recorded currently as adjustments to interest expense. Gains or losses from derivative transactions are reflected as adjustments to interest expense on the consolidated statements of operations. Realized gains (losses) included in interest expense were $6 million, ($1) million and ($2) million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Pursuant to SFAS 133, certain derivatives do not qualify for designation as fair value hedges. Changes in the fair value of these non qualifying derivatives that occur prior to their maturity (i.e., temporary fluctuations in value) are reported currently in the consolidated statements of operations as unrealized gains (losses) within interest expense. Unrealized gains (losses) included in interest expense were ($85) million, ($40) million and $2 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. A detailed explanation of accounting for interest rate derivatives under SFAS 133 appears under Application of Critical Accounting Policies Hedging elsewhere in this Item 7. Foreign Currency Derivatives On December 6, 2006, we issued 600 million of 6.25% Euro denominated Senior Notes due 2017. Concurrent with the issuance of the Euro denominated senior notes, we entered into a cross currency swap to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in the euro relative to the dollar over the term of the notes. A detailed explanation of accounting for foreign currency derivatives under SFAS 133 appears under Application of Critical Accounting Policies Hedging elsewhere in this Item 7. Results of Operations General. For the year ended December 31, 2008, Chesapeake had net income of $723 million, or $1.14 per diluted common share, on total revenues of $11.629 billion. This compares to net income of $1.451 billion, or $2.62 per diluted common share, on total revenues of $7.800 billion during the year ended December 31, 2007, and net income of $2.003 billion, or $4.35 per diluted common share, on total revenues of $7.326 billion during the year ended December 31, 2006. Natural Gas and Oil Sales. During 2008, natural gas and oil sales were $7.858 billion compared to $5.624 billion in 2007 and $5.619 billion in 2006. In 2008, Chesapeake produced and sold 842.7 bcfe of natural gas and oil at a weighted average price of $8.38 per mcfe, compared to 714.3 bcfe in 2007 at a weighted average price of $8.40 per mcfe, and 578.4 bcfe in 2006 at a weighted average price of $8.86 per mcfe (weighted average prices 47 Table of Contents for all years discussed exclude the effect of unrealized gains or (losses) on derivatives of $797 million, ($374) million and $495 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively). The decrease in prices in 2008 resulted in a decrease in revenue of $17 million and increased production resulted in a $1.079 billion increase, for a total increase in revenues of $1.062 billion (excluding unrealized gains or losses on natural gas and oil derivatives). The increase in production from period to period was primarily generated from the drillbit. For 2008, we realized an average price per mcf of natural gas of $8.09, compared to $8.14 in 2007 and $8.76 in 2006 (weighted average prices for all years discussed exclude the effect of unrealized gains or losses on derivatives). Oil prices realized per barrel (excluding unrealized gains or losses on derivatives) were $70.48, $67.50 and $59.14 in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Realized gains or losses from our natural gas and oil derivatives resulted in a net decrease in natural gas and oil revenues of ($9) million or ($0.01) per mcfe in 2008, a net increase of $1.203 billion or $1.68 per mcfe in 2007 and a net increase of $1.254 billion or $2.17 per mcfe in 2006. A change in natural gas and oil prices has a significant impact on our natural gas and oil revenues and cash flows. Assuming 2008 production levels, a change of $0.10 per mcf of natural gas sold would result in an increase or decrease in 2008 revenues and cash flows of approximately $78 million and $75 million, respectively, and a change of $1.00 per barrel of oil sold would result in an increase or decrease in 2008 revenues and cash flows of approximately $11 million without considering the effect of hedging activities. The following table shows our production by region for 2008, 2007 and 2006: Years Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Mmcfe Percent Mmcfe Percent Mmcfe Percent Mid Continent (a) (b) 412,825 49 % 373,941 52 % 315,173 55 % Barnett Shale 181,523 22 93,463 13 44,482 7 Permian and Delaware Basins 79,645 10 64,897 9 48,510 8 South Texas and Texas Gulf Coast 70,903 8 78,228 11 79,178 14 Ark La Tex 61,543 7 55,811 8 46,009 8 Appalachian Basin (c) 36,305 4 47,922 7 45,031 8 Total Production 842,744 100 % 714,262 100 % 578,383 100 % (a) 2008 was impacted by the sale of 11.1 bcf and 6.9 bcf of production in VPP transactions that closed on May 1, 2008 and August 1, 2008, respectively. (b) 2008 was impacted by the sale of 7.6 bcf and 4.7 bcf of production from Arkoma and Fayetteville properties, respectively. (c) 2008 was impacted by the sale of 18.3 bcf of production in a VPP transaction that closed on December 31, 2007. Natural gas production represented approximately 92% of our total production volume on a natural gas equivalent basis in 2008, compared to 92% in 2007 and 91% in 2006. Natural Gas and Oil Marketing Sales and Operating Expenses. Natural gas and oil marketing activities are substantially for third parties who are owners in Chesapeake operated wells. Chesapeake realized $3.598 billion in natural gas and oil marketing sales to third parties in 2008, with corresponding natural gas and oil marketing expenses of $3.505 billion, for a net margin before depreciation of $93 million. This compares to sales of $2.040 billion and $1.577 billion, expenses of $1.969 billion and $1.522 billion, and margins before depreciation of $71 million and $55 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively. The net margin increase in 2008 and 2007 is primarily due to an increase in volumes related to natural gas and oil marketing sales. Service Operations Revenue and Operating Expenses. Service operations consist of third party revenue and operating expenses related to our drilling and oilfield trucking operations. Chesapeake recognized $173 million in service operations revenue in 2008 with corresponding service operations expenses of $143 million, 48 Table of Contents for a net margin before depreciation of $30 million. This compares to revenue of $136 million and $130 million, expenses of $94 million and $68 million and a net margin before depreciation of $42 million and $62 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively. These operations have grown as a result of assets and businesses we acquired and leased as seen in the growth in revenues. However, the net margins have decreased each of the previous three years. This is the result of increased expenses associated with the leasing cost of the numerous rigs we have sold and leased back in the previous three years. Production Expenses. Production expenses, which include lifting costs and ad valorem taxes, were $889 million in 2008, compared to $640 million and $490 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively. On a unit of production basis, production expenses were $1.05 per mcfe in 2008 compared to $0.90 and $0.85 per mcfe in 2007 and 2006, respectively. The expense increase in 2008 was primarily due to higher third party field service costs, energy costs, fuel costs, ad valorem taxes and personnel costs. Our per unit increase in 2008 was also affected by the loss of production related to the sale of the volumetric production payments. We expect that production expenses per mcfe produced for 2009 will range from $1.10 to $1.20. Production Taxes. Production taxes were $284 million in 2008 compared to $216 million in 2007 and $176 million in 2006. On a unit of production basis, production taxes were $0.34 per mcfe in 2008 compared to $0.30 per mcfe in 2007 and $0.31 per mcfe in 2006. The $68 million increase in production taxes from 2007 to 2008 is due to an increase in production of 128 bcfe and an increase in the realized average sales price of natural gas and oil of $1.68 per mcfe (excluding gains or losses on derivatives). In general, production taxes are calculated using value based formulas that produce higher per unit costs when natural gas and oil prices are higher. We expect production taxes for 2009 to range from $0.25 to $0.35 per mcfe based on estimated NYMEX prices ranging from $6.00 to $7.50 per mcf of natural gas and an oil price of $47.66 per barrel. General and Administrative Expense. General and administrative expenses, including stock based compensation but excluding internal costs capitalized to our natural gas and oil properties (see Note 10 of notes to consolidated financial statements), were $377 million in 2008, $243 million in 2007 and $139 million in 2006. General and administrative expenses were $0.45, $0.34 and $0.24 per mcfe for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The increase in 2008, 2007 and 2006 was the result of increasing labor costs due to the companys continued growth as well as increased media and advocacy expenditures. Included in general and administrative expenses is stock based compensation of $85 million in 2008, $58 million in 2007 and $27 million in 2006. The increase was mainly due to an increase in the number of unvested restricted shares outstanding during 2008 compared to 2007 and 2006 as a result of growth in our employment. We anticipate that general and administrative expenses for 2009 will be between $0.33 and $0.37 per mcfe produced, including stock based compensation ranging from $0.10 to $0.12 per mcfe produced. Our stock based compensation for employees and non employee directors is in the form of restricted stock. Employee restricted stock awards generally vest over a period of four or five years. Our non employee director awards vest over a period of three years. The discussion of stock based compensation in Note 1 and Note 8 of notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report provides additional detail on the accounting for and reporting of our stock based compensation. Chesapeake follows the full cost method of accounting under which all costs associated with natural gas and oil property acquisition, exploration and development activities are capitalized. We capitalize internal costs that can be directly identified with our acquisition, exploration and development activities and do not include any costs related to production, general corporate overhead or similar activities. We capitalized $352 million, $262 million and $161 million of internal costs in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, directly related to our natural gas and oil property acquisition, exploration and development efforts. Natural Gas and Oil Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization. Depreciation, depletion and amortization of natural gas and oil properties was $1.970 billion, $1.835 billion and $1.359 billion during 2008, 2007 and 49 Table of Contents 2006, respectively. The average DD&A rate per mcfe, which is a function of capitalized costs, future development costs, and the related underlying reserves in the periods presented, was $2.34, $2.57 and $2.35 in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The decrease in the average rate from $2.57 in 2007 to $2.34 in 2008 is due primarily to the reduction of our natural gas and oil full cost pool resulting from our divestitures in 2008 and the addition of reserves through our exploration activities. We expect the 2009 DD&A rate to be between $1.90 and $2.00 per mcfe produced. Depreciation and Amortization of Other Assets. Depreciation and amortization of other assets was $177 million in 2008, compared to $154 million in 2007 and $104 million in 2006. The average D&A rate per mcfe was $0.21, $0.22 and $0.18 in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Property and equipment costs are depreciated on a straight line basis. Buildings are depreciated over 15 to 39 years, gathering facilities are depreciated over 20 years, drilling rigs are depreciated over 15 years and all other property and equipment are depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from two to ten years. To the extent company owned drilling rigs are used to drill our wells, a substantial portion of the depreciation is capitalized in natural gas and oil properties as exploration or development costs. We expect 2009 depreciation and amortization of other assets to be between $0.24 and $0.28 per mcfe produced. Impairment of Natural Gas and Oil Properties and Other Fixed Assets. Due to lower commodity prices at December 31, 2008, we reported a non cash impairment charge of $2.8 billion for 2008. We account for our natural gas and oil properties using the full cost method of accounting, which limits the amount of costs we can capitalize and requires us to write off these costs if the carrying value of natural gas and oil assets in the evaluated portion of our full cost pool exceeds the sum of the present value of expected future net cash flows of proved reserves using a 10% pre tax discount rate based on constant pricing and cost assumptions and the present value of certain natural gas and oil hedges. Additionally in 2008, we recorded an impairment of $30 million associated with certain of our midstream assets. Employee Retirement Expense. Our President and Chief Operating Officer, Tom L. Ward, resigned as a director, officer and employee of the company effective February 10, 2006. Mr. Wards Resignation Agreement provided for the immediate vesting of all of his unvested equity awards, which consisted of options to purchase 724,615 shares of Chesapeakes common stock at an average exercise price of $8.01 per share and 1,291,875 shares of restricted common stock. As a result of this vesting, we incurred an expense of $55 million in 2006. Interest and Other Income. Interest and other income was ($11) million, $15 million and $26 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The 2008 loss consisted of $22 million of interest income, a $38 million loss related to our equity in the net losses of certain investments, a $4 million gain on sale of assets, $10 million of expense related to consent solicitation fees and $11 million of miscellaneous income. The 2007 income consisted of $8 million of interest income and $7 million of miscellaneous income. Income related to equity investments was not significant in 2007. The 2006 income consisted of $5 million of interest income, $10 million of income related to equity investments, a $5 million gain on sale of assets and $6 million of miscellaneous income. Interest Expense. Interest expense decreased to $314 million in 2008 compared to $406 million in 2007 and $301 million in 2006 as follows: Years Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 ($ in millions) Interest expense on senior notes and revolving bank credit facility $ 687 $ 616 $ 472 Capitalized interest (464 ) (269 ) (179 ) Amortization of loan discount and other 12 17 7 Unrealized (gain) loss on interest rate derivatives 85 41 (1 ) Realized (gain) loss on interest rate derivatives (6 ) 1 2 Total interest expense $ 314 $ 406 $ 301 Average long term borrowings $ 10,044 $ 8,224 $ 6,278 50 Table of Contents Interest expense, excluding unrealized (gains) losses on interest rate derivatives was $0.27 per mcfe in 2008 compared to $0.51 per mcfe in 2007 and $0.52 per mcfe in 2006. The decrease in interest expense per mcfe for 2008 is due to increased production volumes and an increase in capitalized interest. Capitalized interest increased in 2008 and 2007 as a result of a significant increase in unevaluated properties, the base on which interest is capitalized. We expect interest expense for 2009 to be between $0.30 and $0.35 per mcfe produced (before considering the effect of interest rate derivatives). Gain on Exchanges or Repurchases of Chesapeake Debt. In 2008, we redeemed $300 million of our 7.75% Senior Notes due 2015 with proceeds from the issuance of new senior notes with a lower rate of interest. In connection with the redemption, we recorded a $31 million loss (which consisted of a $12 million premium and the write off of $19 million in various charges associated with the notes). Also in 2008, we privately exchanged approximately $765 million in aggregate principal amount of our 2.75% Contingent Convertible Senior Notes due 2035, our 2.50% Contingent Convertible Senior Notes due 2037 and our 2.25% Contingent Convertible Senior Notes due 2038 for an aggregate of 23,913,203 shares of our common stock. The difference between the face value of the notes that were exchanged and the fair value of the common stock issued resulted in a gain of $268 million on the cancellation of indebtedness. Impairment of Investments. In 2008, we recorded a $180 million impairment of certain investments. Each of our investees has been impacted by the dramatic slowing of the worldwide economy and the freezing of the credit markets in the fourth quarter of 2008 and into 2009. The economic weakness has resulted in significantly reduced natural gas and oil prices leading to a meaningful decline in the overall level of activity in the markets served by our investees. Associated with the weakness in performance of certain of the investees, as well as an evaluation of their financial condition and near term prospects, we recognized that an other than temporary impairment had occurred on the following investments: Chaparral Energy, Inc., $100 million; DHS Drilling Company, $20 million; Mountain Drilling Company, $10 million; and Ventura Refining and Transmission LLC, Inc., $50 million. Gain on Sale of Investments. In 2007, we sold our 33% limited partnership interest in Eagle Energy Partners I, L.P., which we first acquired in 2003, for proceeds of $124 million and a gain of $83 million. In 2006, Chesapeake sold its investment in publicly traded Pioneer Drilling Company common stock, realizing proceeds of $159 million and a gain of $117 million. At the time of sale, we owned 17% of the common stock of Pioneer, which we began acquiring in 2003. Income Tax Expense. Chesapeake recorded income tax expense of $463 million in 2008 compared to income tax expense of $890 million in 2007 and $1.252 billion in 2006. Of the income tax expense recorded in 2008, $423 million is reflected as current income tax expense and $40 million is reflected as deferred income tax expense. The divestitures that closed during 2008 are projected to generate sufficient taxable income for the year to exhaust all our non limited NOLs and result in a current tax liability for the tax year ended December 31, 2008. Of the $427 million decrease in 2008, $439 million was the result of the decrease in net income before taxes which was offset by $12 million as the result of an increase in the effective tax rate. Our effective income tax rate was 39% in 2008 compared to 38% in 2007 and 38.5% in 2006. Our effective tax rate fluctuates as a result of the impact of state income taxes and permanent differences. We expect our effective income tax rate to be 39% in 2009. Loss on Conversion/Exchange of Preferred Stock. Loss on conversion/exchange of preferred stock was $67 million, $128 million and $10 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The loss on the exchanges represented the excess of the fair value of the common stock issued over the fair value of the securities issuable pursuant to the original conversion terms. See Note 8 of notes to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further detail regarding these transactions. Application of Critical Accounting Policies Readers of this report and users of the information contained in it should be aware of how certain events may impact our financial results based on the accounting policies in place. The four policies we consider to be 51 Table of Contents the most significant are discussed below. The companys management has discussed each critical accounting policy with the Audit Committee of the companys Board of Directors. The selection and application of accounting policies are an important process that changes as our business changes and as accounting rules are developed. Accounting rules generally do not involve a selection among alternatives, but involve an implementation and interpretation of existing rules and the use of judgment to the specific set of circumstances existing in our business. Hedging. Chesapeake uses commodity price and financial risk management instruments to mitigate our exposure to price fluctuations in natural gas and oil, changes in interest rates and changes in foreign exchange rates. Recognized gains and losses on derivative contracts are reported as a component of the related transaction. Results of natural gas and oil derivative transactions are reflected in natural gas and oil sales, and results of interest rate and foreign exchange rate hedging transactions are reflected in interest expense. The changes in the fair value of derivative instruments not qualifying for designation as either cash flow or fair value hedges that occur prior to maturity are reported currently in the consolidated statement of operations as unrealized gains (losses) within natural gas and oil sales or interest expense. Cash flows from derivative instruments are classified in the same category within the statement of cash flows as the items being hedged, or on a basis consistent with the nature of the instruments. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that derivative instruments (including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts) be recorded at fair value and included in the consolidated balance sheet as assets or liabilities. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation, which is established at the inception of a derivative. For derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, changes in fair value, to the extent the hedge is effective, are recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. Any change in the fair value resulting from ineffectiveness, as defined by SFAS 133, is recognized immediately in natural gas and oil sales. For derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges (in accordance with SFAS 133), changes in fair value, as well as the offsetting changes in the estimated fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, are recognized currently in earnings. Differences between the changes in the fair values of the hedged item and the derivative instrument, if any, represent gains or losses on ineffectiveness and are reflected currently in interest expense. Hedge effectiveness is measured at least quarterly based on the relative changes in fair value between the derivative contract and the hedged item over time. Changes in fair value of contracts that do not qualify as hedges or are not designated as hedges are also recognized currently in earnings. See Hedging Activities above and Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk for additional information regarding our hedging activities. One of the primary factors that can have an impact on our results of operations is the method used to value our derivatives. We have established the fair value of our derivative instruments utilizing established index prices, volatility curves and discount factors. These estimates are compared to our counterparty values for reasonableness. Derivative transactions are also subject to the risk that counterparties will be unable to meet their obligations. Such non performance risk is considered in the valuation of our derivative instruments, but to date has not had a material impact on the values of our derivatives. The values we report in our financial statements are as of a point in time and subsequently change as these estimates are revised to reflect actual results, changes in market conditions and other factors. Another factor that can impact our results of operations each period is our ability to estimate the level of correlation between future changes in the fair value of the hedge instruments and the transactions being hedged, both at inception and on an ongoing basis. This correlation is complicated since energy commodity prices, the primary risk we hedge, have quality and location differences that can be difficult to hedge effectively. The factors underlying our estimates of fair value and our assessment of correlation of our hedging derivatives are impacted by actual results and changes in conditions that affect these factors, many of which are beyond our control. 52 Table of Contents Due to the volatility of natural gas and oil prices and, to a lesser extent, interest rates and foreign exchange rates, the companys financial condition and results of operations can be significantly impacted by changes in the market value of our derivative instruments. As of December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, the net market value of our derivatives was an asset of $1.305 billion, a liability of $375 million and an asset of $293 million, respectively. The derivatives that we acquired in our CNR acquisition represented $17 million, $184 million and $254 million of liability at December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006. Natural Gas and Oil Properties. The accounting for our business is subject to special accounting rules that are unique to the natural gas and oil industry. There are two allowable methods of accounting for natural gas and oil business activities: the successful efforts method and the full cost method. Chesapeake follows the full cost method of accounting under which all costs associated with property acquisition, exploration and development activities are capitalized. We also capitalize internal costs that can be directly identified with our acquisition, exploration and development activities and do not include any costs related to production, general corporate overhead or similar activities. Under the successful efforts method, geological and geophysical costs and costs of carrying and retaining undeveloped properties are charged to expense as incurred. Costs of drilling exploratory wells that do not result in proved reserves are charged to expense. Depreciation, depletion, amortization and impairment of natural gas and oil properties are generally calculated on a well by well or lease or field basis versus the aggregated full cost pool basis. Additionally, gain or loss is generally recognized on all sales of natural gas and oil properties under the successful efforts method. As a result, our financial statements will differ from companies that apply the successful efforts method since we will generally reflect a higher level of capitalized costs as well as a higher natural gas and oil depreciation, depletion and amortization rate, and we will not have exploration expenses that successful efforts companies frequently have. Under the full cost method, capitalized costs are amortized on a composite unit of production method based on proved natural gas and oil reserves. If we maintain the same level of production year over year, the depreciation, depletion and amortization expense may be significantly different if our estimate of remaining reserves changes significantly. Proceeds from the sale of properties are accounted for as reductions of capitalized costs unless such sales involve a significant change in the relationship between costs and proved reserves, in which case a gain or loss is recognized. The costs of unproved properties are excluded from amortization until the properties are evaluated. We review all of our unevaluated properties quarterly to determine whether or not and to what extent proved reserves have been assigned to the properties, and otherwise if impairment has occurred. Unevaluated properties are grouped by major producing area where individual property costs are not significant and are assessed individually when individual costs are significant. We review the carrying value of our natural gas and oil properties under the full cost accounting rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission on a quarterly basis. This quarterly review is referred to as a ceiling test. Under the ceiling test, capitalized costs, less accumulated amortization and related deferred income taxes, may not exceed an amount equal to the sum of the present value of estimated future net revenues (adjusted for cash flow hedges) less estimated future expenditures to be incurred in developing and producing the proved reserves, less any related income tax effects. As of December 31, 2008, capitalized costs of natural gas and oil properties exceeded the estimated present value of future net revenues from our proved reserves, net of related income tax considerations, resulting in a write down in the carrying value of natural gas and oil properties of $2.8 billion. In calculating future net revenues, current prices and costs used are those as of the end of the appropriate quarterly period. Such prices are utilized except where different prices are fixed and determinable from applicable contracts for the remaining term of those contracts, including the effects of derivatives qualifying as cash flow hedges. Based on spot prices for natural gas and oil as of December 31, 2008, these cash flow hedges increased the full cost ceiling by $1.024 billion, thereby reducing the ceiling test write down by the same amount. Two primary factors impacting this test are reserve levels and current prices, and their associated impact on the present value of estimated future net revenues. Revisions to estimates of natural gas and oil reserves and or an increase or decrease in prices can have a material impact on the present value of estimated future net revenues. 53 Table of Contents Any excess of the net book value, less deferred income taxes, is generally written off as an expense. Under SEC regulations, the excess above the ceiling is not expensed (or is reduced) if, subsequent to the end of the period, but prior to the release of the financial statements, natural gas and oil prices increase sufficiently such that an excess above the ceiling would have been eliminated (or reduced) if the increased prices were used in the calculations. The process of estimating natural gas and oil reserves is very complex, requiring significant decisions in the evaluation of available geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data. The data for a given property may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors, including additional development activity, evolving production history and a continual reassessment of the viability of production under changing economic conditions. As a result, material revisions to existing reserve estimates occur from time to time. Although every reasonable effort is made to ensure that reserve estimates reported represent the most accurate assessments possible, the subjective decisions and variances in available data for various properties increase the likelihood of significant changes in these estimates. Our internal petroleum reservoir engineers evaluated and estimated all of our proved reserves as of December 31, 2008, and independent petroleum engineers audited approximately 76% of our estimated proved reserves (by volume). In addition, our internal engineers review and update our reserves on a quarterly basis. All reserve estimates are prepared based upon a review of production histories and other geologic, economic, ownership and engineering data we developed. Additional information about our 2008 year end reserve evaluation is included under Natural Gas and Oil Reserves in Item 1 Business. Income Taxes. As part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate the federal and state income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which Chesapeake operates. This process involves estimating the actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items, such as derivative instruments, depreciation, depletion and amortization, and certain accrued liabilities for tax and accounting purposes. These differences and our net operating loss carryforwards result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included in our consolidated balance sheet. We must then assess, using all available positive and negative evidence, the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income. If we believe that recovery is not likely, we must establish a valuation allowance. Generally, to the extent Chesapeake establishes a valuation allowance or increases or decreases this allowance in a period, we must include an expense or reduction of expense within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of operations. Under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, an enterprise must use judgment in considering the relative impact of negative and positive evidence. The weight given to the potential effect of negative and positive evidence should be commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified. The more negative evidence that exists (a) the more positive evidence is necessary and (b) the more difficult it is to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed for some portion or all of the deferred tax asset. Among the more significant types of evidence that we consider are: taxable income projections in future years, whether the carryforward period is so brief that it would limit realization of tax benefits, future sales and operating cost projections that will produce more than enough taxable income to realize the deferred tax asset based on existing sales prices and cost structures, and our earnings history exclusive of the loss that created the future deductible amount coupled with evidence indicating that the loss is an aberration rather than a continuing condition. If (a) natural gas and oil prices were to decrease significantly below present levels (and if such decreases were considered other than temporary), (b) exploration, drilling and operating costs were to increase significantly beyond current levels, or (c) we were confronted with any other significantly negative evidence pertaining to our 54 Table of Contents ability to realize our NOL carryforwards prior to their expiration, we may be required to provide a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. As of December 31, 2008, we had deferred tax assets of $347 million. FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, provides guidance for recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions, as defined in SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. FIN 48 prescribes a threshold condition that a tax position must meet for any of the benefit of the uncertain tax position to be recognized in the financial statements. Guidance is also provided regarding de recognition, classification and disclosure of these uncertain tax positions. Based on this guidance, we regularly analyze tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return based on the threshold condition prescribed under FIN 48. Tax positions that do not meet or exceed this threshold condition are considered uncertain tax positions. We accrue interest related to these uncertain tax positions which is recognized in interest expense. Penalties, if any, related to uncertain tax positions would be recorded in other expenses. Additional information about uncertain tax positions appears in Income Taxes in Item 1 Business. Accounting for Business Combinations. Our business has grown substantially through acquisitions and our business strategy is to continue to pursue acquisitions as opportunities arise. We have accounted for all of our business combinations using the purchase method, which is the only method permitted under SFAS 141, Accounting for Business Combinations. The accounting for business combinations is complicated and involves the use of significant judgment. Under the purchase method of accounting, a business combination is accounted for at its purchase price based upon the fair value of the consideration given, whether in the form of cash, assets, stock or the assumption of liabilities. The assets and liabilities acquired are measured at their fair values, and the purchase price is allocated to the assets and liabilities based upon these fair values. The excess of the cost of an acquired entity, if any, over the net of the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill. The excess of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed over the cost of an acquired entity, if any, is allocated as a pro rata reduction of the amounts that otherwise would have been assigned to certain acquired assets. Determining the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired involves the use of judgment, since some of the assets and liabilities acquired do not have fair values that are readily determinable. Different techniques may be used to determine fair values, including market prices, where available, appraisals, comparisons to transactions for similar assets and liabilities and present value of estimated future cash flows, among others. Since these estimates involve the use of significant judgment, they can change as new information becomes available. We believe that the consideration we have paid for our natural gas and oil property acquisitions has represented the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired at the time of purchase. Consequently, we have not recognized any goodwill from any of our natural gas and oil property acquisitions, nor do we expect to recognize goodwill from similar business combinations that we may complete in the future. Disclosures About Effects of Transactions with Related Parties Since Chesapeake was founded in 1989, our CEO, Aubrey K. McClendon, has acquired working interests in virtually all of our natural gas and oil properties by participating in our drilling activities under the terms of the Founder Well Participation Program (FWPP) and predecessor participation arrangements provided for in Mr. McClendons employment agreements. Under the FWPP, approved by our shareholders in June 2005, Mr. McClendon may elect to participate in all or none of the wells drilled by or on behalf of Chesapeake during a calendar year, but he is not allowed to participate only in selected wells. A participation election is required to be received by the Compensation Committee of Chesapeakes Board of Directors not less than 30 days prior to the start of each calendar year. His participation is permitted only under the terms outlined in the FWPP, which, among other things, limits his individual participation to a maximum working interest of 2.5% in a well and prohibits participation in situations where Chesapeakes working interest would be reduced below 12.5% as a result of his participation. In addition, the company is reimbursed for costs associated with leasehold acquired by Mr. McClendon as a result of his well participation. 55 Table of Contents On December 31, 2008, we entered into a new five year employment agreement with Mr. McClendon that contained a one time well cost incentive award to him. The total cost of the award to Chesapeake was $75 million plus employment taxes in the amount of approximately $1 million. We will recognize the incentive award as general and administrative expense over the five year vesting period for the clawback described below, resulting in an expense of approximately $15 million per year beginning in 2009. In addition to state and federal income tax withholding, similar employment taxes were imposed on Mr. McClendon and withheld from the award. The net incentive award of approximately $44 million can only be applied against costs attributable to interests in company wells acquired by Mr. McClendon or his affiliates under the FWPP. The incentive award is subject to a clawback if, during the initial five year term of the employment agreement, Mr. McClendon resigns from the company or is terminated for cause by the company. Upon receipt of the companys monthly invoice for joint interest billings in mid January 2009, Mr. McClendon elected to apply approximately $19 million of the drilling credit against his December 2008 FWPP joint interest billings, leaving $25 million available as a credit against future billings. Based on our current development plans and Mr. McClendons election under the FWPP to participate with a 2.5% working interest during 2009, the well costs under the FWPP are expected to exceed the amount of the entire FWPP credit in early 2009. We refer you to the discussion of the FWPP and Mr. McClendons employment agreement contained in our proxy statement for our 2009 annual meeting of shareholders, which discussion is incorporated by reference in Part III of this report. As disclosed in Note 14, in 2008, Chesapeake had revenues of $1.3 billion from natural gas and oil sales to Eagle Energy Partners I, L.P., a former affiliated entity. We sold our 33% limited partnership interest in Eagle Energy in June 2007. Recently Issued Accounting Standards The FASB recently issued the following standards which were reviewed by Chesapeake to determine the potential impact on our financial statements upon adoption. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements an amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51. This statement requires an entity to separately disclose non controlling interests as a separate component of equity in the balance sheet and clearly identify on the face of the income statement net income related to non controlling interests. This statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. The adoption of this statement will not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (R), Business Combinations. This statement requires assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be measured at fair value as of the acquisition date, acquisition related costs incurred prior to the acquisition to be expensed and contractual contingencies to be recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date. This statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. We will comply with this statement prospectively in accounting for future business combinations. In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133. This statement changes the disclosure requirements for derivative instruments and hedging activities. The statement requires that objectives for using derivative instruments be disclosed in terms of underlying risk and accounting designation. This statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008. This statement will not have a material impact on our financial disclosures. In May 2008, the FASB issued FSP APB 14 1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash Upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement). FSP APB 14 1 clarifies that convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon either mandatory or optional conversion (including partial cash settlement) are not addressed by paragraph 12 of APB Opinion No. 14, Accounting for Convertible Debt and Debt Issued with Stock Purchase Warrants. The accounting prescribed by FSP APB 14 1 increases the amount of 56 Table of Contents interest expense required to be recognized with respect to such instruments and, thus, lowers reported net income and net income per share of issuers of such instruments. Issuers must account for the liability and equity components of the instrument separately and in a manner that reflects interest expense at the interest rate of similar nonconvertible debt. We have three debt series that will be affected by the guidance, our 2.75% Contingent Convertible Senior Notes due 2035, our 2.5% Contingent Convertible Senior Notes due 2037 and our 2.25% Contingent Convertible Senior Notes due 2038. This staff position is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2008 and must be applied on a retrospective basis. The initial adoption of FSP APB 14 1 is expected to decrease the carrying value of our Contingent Convertible Senior Notes by approximately $1 billion, increase shareholders equity by approximately $600 million and increase deferred tax liabilities by approximately $400 million. In addition, we currently estimate that we will record additional non cash interest expense, which will reduce our pre tax income by approximately $80 million and reduce net income by approximately $50 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. In June 2008, the FASB issued FSP Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) No. 03 6 1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities. FSP EITF 03 6 1 addresses whether instruments granted in share based payments transactions are participating securities prior to vesting and therefore need to be included in the earnings allocation in calculating earnings per share under the two class method described in SFAS No. 128, Earnings per Share. FSP EITF No. 03 6 1 requires companies to treat unvested share based payment awards that have non forfeitable rights to dividend or dividend equivalents as a separate class of securities in calculating earnings per share. FSP EITF No. 03 6 1 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008; earlier application is not permitted. FSP EITF No. 03 6 1 could be applicable to us but we have no current transactions that would be affected. In October 2008, the FASB issued FSP FAS 157 3, Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset When the Market for That Asset Is Not Active. FSP FAS 157 3 clarifies the application of FASB statement No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, in a market that is not active and provides an example to illustrate key considerations in determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that financial asset is not active. This FSP could be applicable to us but we currently have no financial assets of this type. On December 31, 2008, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) adopted major revisions to its rules governing oil and gas company reporting requirements. These include provisions that permit the use of new technologies to determine proved reserves and that allow companies to disclose their probable and possible reserves to investors. The current rules limit disclosure to only proved reserves. The new disclosure requirements also require companies to report the independence and qualifications of the person primarily responsible for the preparation or audit of reserve estimates, and to file reports when a third party is relied upon to prepare or audit reserves estimates. The new rules also require that oil and gas reserves be reported and the full cost ceiling value calculated using an average price based upon the prior 12 month period. The new oil and gas reporting requirements are effective for annual reports on Form 10 K for fiscal years ending on or after December 31, 2009, with early adoption not permitted. We are in the process of assessing the impact of these new requirements on our financial position, results of operations and financial disclosures. Forward Looking Statements This report includes forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward looking statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future events. They include estimates of natural gas and oil reserves, expected natural gas and oil production and future expenses, assumptions regarding future natural gas and oil prices, planned capital expenditures, and anticipated asset acquisitions and sales, as well as statements concerning anticipated cash flow and liquidity, business strategy and other plans and objectives for future operations. Disclosures concerning the fair values of derivative contracts and their estimated contribution to our future results of operations are based upon market information as of a specific date. These market prices are subject to significant volatility. 57 Table of Contents Although we believe the expectations and forecasts reflected in these and other forward looking statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance they will prove to have been correct. They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expected results are described under Risk Factors in Item 1A of this report and include: the volatility of natural gas and oil prices, the limitations our level of indebtedness may have on our financial flexibility, impacts the current financial crisis may have on our business and financial condition, declines in the values of our natural gas and oil properties resulting in ceiling test write downs, the availability of capital on an economic basis, including planned asset monetization transactions, to fund reserve replacement costs, our ability to replace reserves and sustain production, uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of natural gas and oil reserves and projecting future rates of production and the timing of development expenditures, exploration and development drilling that does not result in commercially productive reserves, leasehold terms expiring before production can be established, hedging activities resulting in lower prices realized on natural gas and oil sales and the need to secure hedging liabilities, uncertainties in evaluating natural gas and oil reserves of acquired properties and potential liabilities, the negative effect lower natural gas and oil prices could have on our ability to borrow, drilling and operating risks, including potential environmental liabilities, transportation capacity constraints and interruptions that could adversely affect our cash flow, adverse effects of governmental and environmental regulation, and losses possible from pending or future litigation. We caution you not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this report, and we undertake no obligation to update this information. We urge you to carefully review and consider the disclosures made in this report and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission that attempt to advise interested parties of the risks and factors that may affect our business. ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Natural Gas and Oil Hedging Activities Our results of operations and operating cash flows are impacted by changes in market prices for natural gas and oil. To mitigate a portion of the exposure to adverse market changes, we have entered into various derivative instruments. As of December 31, 2008, our natural gas and oil derivative instruments were comprised of swaps, basis protection swaps, knockout swaps, cap swaps, call options, put options and collars. These instruments allow us to predict with greater certainty the effective natural gas and oil prices to be received for our hedged production. Although derivatives often fail to achieve 100% effectiveness for accounting purposes, we believe our derivative instruments continue to be highly effective in achieving the risk management objectives for which they were intended. For swap instruments, Chesapeake receives a fixed price for the hedged commodity and pays a floating market price to the counterparty. The fixed price payment and the floating price payment are netted, resulting in a net amount due to or from the counterparty. 58 Table of Contents Basis protection swaps are arrangements that guarantee a price differential for natural gas or oil from a specified delivery point. For Mid Continent basis protection swaps, which typically have negative differentials to NYMEX, Chesapeake receives a payment from the counterparty if the price differential is greater than the stated terms of the contract and pays the counterparty if the price differential is less than the stated terms of the contract. For Appalachian Basin basis protection swaps, which typically have positive differentials to NYMEX, Chesapeake receives a payment from the counterparty if the price differential is less than the stated terms of the contract and pays the counterparty if the price differential is greater than the stated terms of the contract. For knockout swaps, Chesapeake receives a fixed price and pays a floating market price. The fixed price received by Chesapeake includes a premium in exchange for the possibility to reduce the counterpartys exposure to zero, in any given month, if the floating market price is lower than certain pre determined knockout prices. For cap swaps, Chesapeake receives a fixed price and pays a floating market price. The fixed price received by Chesapeake includes a premium in exchange for a cap limiting the counterpartys exposure. In other words, there is no limit to Chesapeakes exposure but there is a limit to the downside exposure of the counterparty. For call options, Chesapeake receives a premium from the counterparty in exchange for the sale of a call option. If the market price exceeds the fixed price of the call option, Chesapeake pays the counterparty such excess. If the market price settles below the fixed price of the call option, no payment is due from Chesapeake. For put options, Chesapeake receives a premium from the counterparty in exchange for the sale of a put option. If the market price falls below the fixed price of the put option, Chesapeake pays the counterparty such shortfall. If the market price settles above the fixed price of the put option, no payment is due from Chesapeake. Collars contain a fixed floor price (put) and ceiling price (call). If the market price exceeds the call strike price or falls below the put strike price, Chesapeake receives the fixed price and pays the market price. If the market price is between the call and the put strike price, no payments are due from either party. Chesapeake enters into counter swaps from time to time for the purpose of locking in the value of a swap. Under the counter swap, Chesapeake receives a floating price for the hedged commodity and pays a fixed price to the counterparty. The counter swap is 100% effective in locking in the value of a swap since subsequent changes in the market value of the swap are entirely offset by subsequent changes in the market value of the counter swap. We refer to this locked in value as a locked swap. Generally, at the time Chesapeake enters into a counter swap, Chesapeake removes the original swaps designation as a cash flow hedge and classifies the original swap as a non qualifying hedge under SFAS 133. The reason for this new designation is that collectively the swap and the counter swap no longer hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows. Instead, the swap and counter swap effectively lock in a specific gain or loss that will be unaffected by subsequent variability in natural gas and oil prices. Any locked in gain or loss is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and reclassified to natural gas and oil sales in the month of related production. In accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 39, to the extent that a legal right of set off exists, Chesapeake nets the value of its derivative arrangements with the same counterparty in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Gains or losses from certain derivative transactions are reflected as adjustments to natural gas and oil sales on the consolidated statements of operations. Realized gains (losses) are included in natural gas and oil sales in the month of related production. Pursuant to SFAS 133, certain derivatives do not qualify for designation as cash flow hedges. Changes in the fair value of these non qualifying derivatives that occur prior to their maturity (i.e., temporary fluctuations in value) are reported currently in the consolidated statements of operations as unrealized gains (losses) within natural gas and oil sales. Following provisions of SFAS 133, changes in the fair value of 59 Table of Contents derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, to the extent they are effective in offsetting cash flows attributable to the hedged risk, are recorded in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. Any change in fair value resulting from ineffectiveness is recognized currently in natural gas and oil sales as unrealized gains (losses).

The options are callable by the counterparty in March 2009 and March 2010 and 40,000 mmbtu/day at $11.35/mmbtu, callable by the counterparty in December 2009. (b) We assumed certain liabilities related to open derivative positions in connection with our acquisition of Columbia Natural Resources, LLC in November 2005. In accordance with SFAS 141, these derivative positions were recorded at fair value in the purchase price 61 Table of Contents allocation as a liability of $592 million ($45 million liability remaining as of December 31, 2008). The recognition of the derivative liability and other assumed liabilities resulted in an increase in the total purchase price which was allocated to the assets acquired. Because of this accounting treatment, only cash settlements for changes in fair value subsequent to the acquisition date for the derivative positions assumed result in adjustments to our natural gas and oil revenues upon settlement. For example, if the fair value of the derivative positions assumed does not change, then upon the sale of the underlying production and corresponding settlement of the derivative positions, cash would be paid to the counterparties and there would be no adjustment to natural gas and oil revenues related to the derivative positions. If, however, the actual sales price is different from the price assumed in the original fair value calculation, the difference would be reflected as either a decrease or increase in natural gas and oil revenues, depending upon whether the sales price was higher or lower, respectively, than the prices assumed in the original fair value calculation. For accounting purposes, the net effect of these acquired hedges is that we hedged the production volumes at market prices on the date of our acquisition of CNR. Pursuant to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 149, Amendment of SFAS 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, the derivative instruments assumed in connection with the CNR acquisition are deemed to contain a significant financing element and all cash flows associated with these positions are reported as financing activity in the statement of cash flows for the periods in which settlement occurs. We have established the fair value of our derivative instruments utilizing established index prices, volatility curves and discount factors. These estimates are compared to our counterparty values for reasonableness. Derivative transactions are also subject to the risk that counterparties will be unable to meet their obligations. Such non performance risk is considered in the valuation of our derivative instruments, but to date has not had a material impact on the values of our derivatives. The values we report in our financial statements are as of a point in time and subsequently change as these estimates are revised to reflect actual results, changes in market conditions and other factors. Based upon the market prices at December 31, 2008, we expect to transfer approximately $345 million (net of income taxes) of the gain included in the balance in accumulated other comprehensive income to earnings during the next twelve months in the related month of production. All transactions hedged as of December 31, 2008 are expected to mature by December 31, 2022. Additional information concerning the fair value of our natural gas and oil derivative instruments is as follows: 2008 2007 2006 ($ in millions) Fair value of contracts outstanding, as of January 1 $ (369 ) $ 345 $ (946 ) Change in fair value of contracts 1,880 972 3,423 Fair value of contracts when entered into (569 ) (295 ) (32 ) Contracts realized or otherwise settled 9 (1,203 ) (1,254 ) Fair value of contracts when closed 354 (188 ) (846 ) Fair value of contracts outstanding, as of December 31 $ 1,305 $ (369 ) $ 345 The change in the fair value of our derivative instruments since January 1, 2008 resulted from new contracts entered into, the settlement of derivatives for a realized gain, as well as a decrease in natural gas and oil prices. Derivative instruments reflected as current in the consolidated balance sheet represent the estimated fair value of derivative instrument settlements scheduled to occur over the subsequent twelve month period based on market prices for natural gas and oil as of the consolidated balance sheet date. The derivative settlement amounts are not due and payable until the month in which the related underlying hedged transaction occurs. 62 Table of Contents Interest Rate Risk The table below presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates. As of December 31, 2008, the fair value of the fixed rate long term debt has been estimated based on quoted market prices. Years of Maturity 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Total ($ in millions) Liabilities: Long term debt fixed rate (a) $ $ $ $ $ 864 $ 9,260 $ 10,124 Average interest rate 7.6 5.4 5.6 Long term debt variable rate $ $ $ $ 3,474 $ 460 $ $ 3,934 Average interest rate 1.8 3.0 2.0 (a) This amount does not include the discount included in long term debt of ($85) million and interest rate derivatives of $211 million. Changes in interest rates affect the amount of interest we earn on our cash, cash equivalents and short term investments and the interest rate we pay on borrowings under our revolving bank credit facility. All of our other long term indebtedness is fixed rate and, therefore, does not expose us to the risk of earnings or cash flow loss due to changes in market interest rates. However, changes in interest rates do affect the fair value of our debt. Interest Rate Derivatives We use interest rate derivatives to mitigate our exposure to the volatility in interest rates. For interest rate derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges (in accordance with SFAS 133), changes in fair value are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as assets (liabilities), and the debts carrying value amount is adjusted by the change in the fair value of the debt subsequent to the initiation of the derivative. Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments not qualifying as fair value hedges are recorded currently as adjustments to interest expense. Gains or losses from interest rate derivative transactions are reflected as adjustments to interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations. Realized gains (losses) included in interest expense were $6 million, ($1) million and ($2) million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Pursuant to SFAS 133, certain derivatives do not qualify for designation as fair value hedges. Changes in the fair value of these non qualifying derivatives that occur prior to their maturity (i.e., temporary fluctuations in value) are reported currently in the consolidated statements of operations as unrealized gains (losses) within interest expense. Unrealized gains (losses) included in interest expense were ($85) million, ($40) million and $2 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. 63 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2008, the following interest rate derivatives were outstanding: NotionalAmount($ inmillions) WeightedAverageFixedRate WeightedAverageFloatingRate (b) FairValueHedge NetPremiums($ inmillions) FairValue($ inmillions) Fixed to Floating Interest Rate: Swaps January 2008 November 2020 $ 750 6.75 % 6 mL plus 224 bp Yes $ $ 115 Call Options February 2009 May 2009 $ 750 6.75 % 6 mL plus 224 bp No 11 (105 ) Swaption January 2009 $ 250 6.50 % 6 mL plus 200 bp No 3 Floating to Fixed Interest Rate: Swaps August 2007 August 2010 $ 825 4.74 % 1 3 mL No (27 ) Collars (a) August 2007 August 2010 $ 800 4.52 % 6 mL No (35 ) Swaption August 2009 $ 500 2.56 % 1 mL No 5 (10 ) $ 19 $ (62 ) (a) The collars have ceiling and floor fixed interest rates of 5.37% and 4.52%, respectively. (b) Month LIBOR has been abbreviated mL and basis points has been abbreviated bp. In 2008, we closed interest rate derivatives for gains totaling $110 million of which $30 million was recognized in interest expense. The remaining $80 million was from interest rate derivatives designated as fair value hedges and the settlement amounts received will be amortized as a reduction to interest expense over the remaining term of the related senior notes ranging from five to twelve years. Foreign Currency Derivatives On December 6, 2006, we issued 600 million of 6.25% Euro denominated Senior Notes due 2017. Concurrent with the issuance of the Euro denominated senior notes, we entered into a cross currency swap to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in the euro relative to the dollar over the term of the notes. Under the terms of the cross currency swap, on each semi annual interest payment date, the counterparties will pay Chesapeake 19 million and Chesapeake will pay the counterparties $30 million, which will yield an annual dollar equivalent interest rate of 7.491%. Upon maturity of the notes, the counterparties will pay Chesapeake 600 million and Chesapeake will pay the counterparties $800 million. The terms of the cross currency swap were based on the dollar/euro exchange rate on the issuance date of $1.3325 to 1.00. Through the cross currency swap, we have eliminated any potential variability in Chesapeakes expected cash flows related to changes in foreign exchange rates and therefore the swap qualifies as a cash flow hedge under SFAS 133. The euro denominated debt is recorded in notes payable ($835 million at December 31, 2008) using an exchange rate of $1.3919 to 1.00. The fair value of the cross currency swap is recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as a liability of $77 million at December 31, 2008. 64 Table of Contents
