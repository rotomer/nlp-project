We manage our business as three separate operational segments: exploration and production; marketing, gathering and compression (midstream); and service operations, which is comprised of our wholly owned drilling and trucking operations. We refer you to Note 17 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements appearing in Item 8 of this report, which summarizes by segment our net income and capital expenditures for 2009, 2008 and 2007 and our assets as of December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007. Executive Summary We are the second largest producer of natural gas in the United States. We own interests in approximately 44,100 producing oil and natural gas wells that are currently producing approximately 2.4 bcfe per day, 93% of which is natural gas. Our strategy is focused on discovering, acquiring and developing conventional and unconventional natural gas reserves onshore in the U.S., primarily in our Big 6 natural gas shale plays: the Barnett Shale in the Fort Worth Basin of north central Texas, the Haynesville and Bossier Shales in the Ark La Tex area of northwestern Louisiana and East Texas, the Fayetteville Shale in the Arkoma Basin of central Arkansas, the Marcellus Shale in the northern Appalachian Basin of West Virginia, Pennsylvania and New York and the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas. We also have substantial operations in the Granite Wash Plays of western Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle regions as well as various other plays, both conventional and unconventional, in the Mid Continent, Appalachian Basin, Permian Basin, Delaware Basin, South Texas, Texas Gulf Coast and Ark La Tex regions of the U.S. We have recently announced that we are extending our strategy to apply the horizontal drilling expertise we have gained in our natural gas shale plays to unconventional oil reservoirs. We expect to begin increasing our production of oil and natural gas liquids in 2010 in new developing unconventional oil plays, particularly in the Granite Wash and Eagle Ford. Chesapeake began 2009 with estimated proved reserves of 12.051 tcfe and ended the year with 14.254 tcfe, an increase of 2.203 tcfe, or 18%. During 2009, we replaced 906 bcfe of production with an estimated 3.019 tcfe of new proved reserves, for a reserve replacement rate of 343%. Reserve replacement through the drillbit was 3.296 tcfe, or 364% of production, including 445 bcfe of downward revisions resulting from changes to previous estimates and 952 bcfe of downward revisions resulting from lower natural gas prices using the average 12 month price in 2009 compared to the spot price as of December 31, 2008. During 2009, we acquired 33 bcfe of estimate proved reserves and divested 220 bcfe of estimated proved reserves. Chesapeake continued the industrys most active drilling program in 2009 and drilled 1,212 gross (885 net) operated wells and participated in another 994 gross (118 net) wells operated by other companies. The companys drilling success rate was 99% for company operated wells and 98% for non operated wells. Also during 2009, we invested $2.941 billion in operated wells (using an average of 104 operated rigs) and $439 million in non operated wells (using an average of 60 non operated rigs) for total drilling, completing and equipping costs of $3.380 billion. Since 2000, Chesapeake has built the largest combined inventories of onshore leasehold (13.2 million net acres) and 3 D seismic (23.6 million acres) in the U.S. We are currently using 118 operated rigs and 70 non operated rigs to further develop our inventory of approximately 35,750 net drillsites, which represents more than a 10 year inventory of drilling projects. 41 Table of Contents Business Strategy Our exploration, acquisition and development activities require us to make substantial operating and capital expenditures. Our current budgeted drilling capital expenditures, net of drilling carries, are $4.100 billion to $4.400 billion in 2010 and $4.300 billion to $4.600 billion in 2011. We anticipate directing approximately 75% of the drilling capital expenditure (before drilling carries) during 2010 and 2011 to our Big 6 shale plays. During 2009, our exploration and development costs were significantly lower than 2008 costs as a result of a significant decrease in drilling activity and the benefit of approximately $1.2 billion of joint venture drilling carries in four of our Big 6 shale plays. We expect exploration and development costs to generally increase in 2010, partially offset by the use of a portion of our remaining $3.4 billion of drilling carries associated with our joint ventures in the Barnett and Marcellus Shales. These drilling carries create a significant cost advantage for us that will allow us to continue to drive down finding costs. The following table provides information about the joint ventures ($ in millions): Shale Play Joint VenturePartner(a) Joint Venture Date ProceedsReceivedat Closing TotalDrillingCarries DrillingCarriesRemaining Haynesville and Bossier PXP July 2008 $ 1,650 $ 1,508 (b) $ Fayetteville BP September 2008 1,100 800 Marcellus STO November 2008 1,250 2,125 1,963 (c) Barnett TOT January 2010 800 1,450 1,450 (d) $ 4,800 $ 5,883 $ 3,413 (a) Joint venture partners include Plains Exploration & Production Company (PXP), BP America (BP), Statoil (STO) and Total S.A. (TOT). (b) In August 2009, we amended our Haynesville Shale joint venture agreement with Plains Exploration & Production Company (PXP). As part of the amendment, PXP accelerated the payment of its remaining joint venture drilling carries as of September 30, 2009 in exchange for an approximate 12% reduction in the total amount of drilling carry obligations due to Chesapeake. As a result, on September 29, 2009, Chesapeake received $1.1 billion in cash from PXP and beginning in the 2009 fourth quarter Chesapeake and PXP each began paying their proportionate working interest costs on drilling. (c) As of December 31, 2009 (d) As of January 26, 2010 Collectively, in these four joint ventures, we received upfront cash payments of $4.8 billion and future drilling cost carries of up to $5.9 billion for total consideration of up to $10.7 billion against a cost basis of approximately $2.7 billion in the property interests we sold. Moreover, Chesapeake retained an 80% interest in the Haynesville and Bossier Shale properties, a 75% interest in the Fayetteville Shale properties, a 67.5% interest in the Marcellus Shale properties and a 75% interest in the Barnett Shale properties. The joint ventures in our Big 6 shale plays are a complementary part of our business strategy to maximize the value of our leasehold inventory and minimize our investment risk. There are other new plays we are identifying and developing which may become additional joint venture opportunities. Our 50/50 joint venture with Global Infrastructure Partners in 2009 is another example of our joining with a strong partner to develop key assets, in this case, our midstream assets in the Barnett Shale and other midstream assets in the Mid Continent. At the closing of this transaction, we received proceeds of $588 million. During 2009, we sold non core natural gas and oil assets for proceeds of $418 million. Over the next two years, we expect to be a net seller of leasehold and producing properties. 42 Table of Contents Apart from asset monetizations, cash flow from operations is our primary source of liquidity used to fund operating expenses and capital expenditures. Our $3.5 billion corporate revolving bank credit facility, our $250 million midstream revolving bank credit facility and the companys $500 million midstream joint venture revolving bank credit facility, discussed more fully in Liquidity and Capital Resources, provide us with additional liquidity. In February 2009, we issued $1.425 billion principal amount of our 9.5% senior notes due 2015. Net proceeds of $1.346 billion were used to repay outstanding indebtedness under our revolving bank credit facility, which we reborrow from time to time to fund drilling and leasehold acquisition initiatives and for general corporate purposes. At December 31, 2009, we had borrowings of $1.936 billion and letters of credit of $41 million outstanding under our credit facilities. We plan to continue to evaluate asset monetization transactions in order to create additional value from our proved and unproved properties and to increase our financial flexibility. Management believes that our leasehold and development joint ventures and various asset monetization programs benefit the company by improving our asset base, reducing our financial risk, decreasing our DD&A rate and increasing our profitability per unit of production, thereby increasing our returns on capital and advancing future value creation. We may also consider alternative sources of public or private investment in the company or its subsidiaries. While we believe that our anticipated internally generated cash flow, cash resources and other sources of liquidity will allow us to fully fund our 2010 operating and capital expenditure requirements, further deterioration of the economy and other factors could require us to fund these expenditures from monetization transactions or further curtail our spending. Liquidity and Capital Resources Sources and Uses of Funds Cash flow from operations is a significant source of liquidity used to fund operating expenses and capital expenditures. Cash provided by operating activities was $4.356 billion in 2009, compared to $5.357 billion in 2008 and $4.974 billion in 2007. The $1.001 billion decrease from 2008 to 2009 was primarily due to lower natural gas and oil prices. The $383 million increase from 2007 to 2008 was primarily due to higher natural gas volumes and higher oil prices. Changes in cash flow from operations are largely due to the same factors that affect our net income, excluding non cash items such as depreciation, depletion and amortization, deferred income taxes and unrealized gains and (losses) on derivatives. See the discussion below under Results of Operations. Changes in market prices for natural gas and oil directly impact the level of our cash flow from operations. To mitigate the risk of declines in natural gas or oil prices and to provide more predictable future cash flow from operations, as of February 17, 2010, we have hedged through swaps and collars approximately 60% of our expected natural gas and oil production in 2010 at average prices of $8.16 per mcfe. Our natural gas and oil hedges as of December 31, 2009 are detailed in Item 7A of this report. Depending on changes in natural gas and oil futures markets and managements view of underlying natural gas and oil supply and demand trends, we may increase or decrease our current hedging positions. Our $3.5 billion corporate revolving bank credit facility, our $250 million midstream revolving bank credit facility, our $500 million midstream joint venture revolving bank credit facility and cash and cash equivalents are other sources of liquidity. Following the January 2010 closing of our Barnett Shale joint venture with Total for $800 million in cash and the February 2010 closing of our sixth VPP transaction for $180 million in cash, as of February 26, 2010, there was $2.245 billion of borrowing capacity under the corporate credit facility, $237 million of borrowing capacity under the midstream credit facility and $482 million under the midstream joint venture credit facility. We use the facilities and cash on hand to fund daily operating activities and acquisitions as needed. We borrowed $7.8 billion and repaid $9.8 43 Table of Contents billion in 2009, we borrowed $13.3 billion and repaid $11.3 billion in 2008 and we borrowed $7.9 billion and repaid $6.2 billion in 2007 under our bank credit facilities. A substantial portion of our natural gas and oil properties is currently unencumbered and therefore available to be pledged as additional collateral under our corporate revolving bank credit facility if needed based on our periodic borrowing base and collateral redeterminations. Accordingly, we believe our borrowing capacity under this facility will not be reduced as a result of any such future periodic redeterminations. Our two midstream facilities are secured by substantially all of our midstream assets and are not subject to periodic borrowing base redeterminations. The following table reflects the proceeds from sales of securities we issued in 2009, 2008 and 2007 ($ in millions): 2009 2008 2007 TotalProceeds NetProceeds TotalProceeds NetProceeds TotalProceeds NetProceeds Senior notes $ 1,425 $ 1,346 $ 800 $ 787 $ $ Contingent convertible senior notes 1,380 1,349 1,650 1,607 Common stock 2,698 2,598 Total $ 1,425 $ 1,346 $ 4,878 $ 4,734 $ 1,650 $ 1,607 The following table reflects proceeds we received from our major natural gas and oil asset monetizations in 2009, 2008 and 2007 ($ in millions). 2009 2008 2007 Natural gas and oil property monetizations: STO (Marcellus) joint venture(a) $ 162 $ 1,250 $ PXP (Haynesville) joint venture(b) 1,490 1,722 BP (Fayetteville) joint venture(c) 601 1,299 BP (Mid Continent) divestiture 1,688 Volumetric production payments 408 1,579 1,089 Other divestitures 418 403 Total $ 3,079 $ 7,941 $ 1,089 (a) 2009 proceeds were in the form of drilling carries. As of December 31, 2009, $2.0 billion of drilling carry obligations remained outstanding. (b) 2009 and 2008 included $390 million and $72 million of drilling carries, respectively. 2009 also included a $1.1 billion acceleration of future drilling carries. (c) 2009 and 2008 included $601 million and $199 million of drilling carries, respectively. In September 2009, we formed a joint venture with Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), a New York based private equity fund, to own and operate natural gas midstream assets. As part of the transaction, we contributed certain natural gas gathering and processing assets into a new entity, Chesapeake Midstream Partners, L.L.C. (CMP), and GIP purchased a 50% interest in CMP for $588 million in cash. In June 2009, we received net proceeds of $54 million from the mortgage financing of our regional Barnett Shale headquarters building in Fort Worth, Texas. The interest only loan has a five year term at a floating rate of prime plus 275 basis points. At our option, we may prepay the loan in full without penalty beginning in year four. In April 2009, we financed 113 real estate surface assets in the Barnett Shale area in and around Fort Worth, Texas for net proceeds of approximately $145 million and entered into a master lease 44 Table of Contents agreement under which we agreed to lease the assets for 40 years for approximately $15 million to $27 million annually. This lease transaction was recorded as a financing lease. Our primary use of funds is for capital expenditures related to exploration, development and acquisition of natural gas and oil properties. We refer you to the table under Investing Activities below, which sets forth the components of our natural gas and oil investing activities and other investing activities for 2009, 2008 and 2007. We retain a significant degree of control over the timing of our capital expenditures which permits us to defer or accelerate certain capital expenditures if necessary to address any potential liquidity issues. In addition, higher drilling and field operating costs, drilling results that alter planned development schedules, acquisitions or other factors could cause us to revise our drilling program, which is largely discretionary. We paid dividends on our common stock of $181 million, $148 million and $115 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend of common stock from $0.0675 to $0.075 per share beginning with the dividend paid in July 2008. Dividends paid on our preferred stock decreased to $23 million in 2009 from $35 million in 2008 and $95 million in 2007 as a result of conversions and exchanges of preferred stock into common stock during 2007, 2008 and 2009. In 2009, 2008 and 2007, we received $24 million, and paid $167 million and $91 million, respectively, to settle a portion of the derivative liabilities assumed in our 2005 acquisition of Columbia Natural Resources, LLC. Additionally in 2009, we received $85 million for settlements of derivatives which were classified as financing derivatives. Credit Risk A significant portion of our liquidity is concentrated in derivative instruments that enable us to hedge a portion of our exposure to natural gas and oil prices and interest rate volatility. These arrangements expose us to credit risk from our counterparties. To mitigate this risk, we enter into derivative contracts only with investment grade rated counterparties deemed by management to be competent and competitive market makers, and we attempt to limit our exposure to non performance by any single counterparty. During the more than 15 years we have engaged in hedging activities, we have experienced a counterparty default only once (Lehman Brothers in September 2008), and the total loss recorded in that instance was immaterial. On December 31, 2009, our commodity and interest rate derivative instruments were spread among 14 counterparties. Additionally, our multi counterparty secured hedging facility requires our counterparties to secure their natural gas and oil hedging obligations in excess of defined thresholds. Our accounts receivable are primarily from purchasers of natural gas and oil ($743 million at December 31, 2009) and exploration and production companies which own interests in properties we operate ($394 million at December 31, 2009). This industry concentration has the potential to impact our overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively, in that our customers and joint working interest owners may be similarly affected by changes in economic, industry or other conditions. We generally require letters of credit or parent guarantees for receivables from parties which are judged to have sub standard credit, unless the credit risk can otherwise be mitigated. During 2009, we recognized $12 million of bad debt expense related to potentially uncollectible receivables. 45 Table of Contents Investing Activities While we continue to maintain an active drilling program and acquire leasehold and unproved property needed for planned natural gas and oil development, cash used in investing activities declined significantly in 2009. Cash used in investing activities decreased to $5.462 billion in 2009, compared to $9.965 billion in 2008 and $7.964 billion in 2007. Our investing activities in 2007 and 2008 reflected our increasing focus on acquiring unproved leasehold, converting our resource inventory into production, redeploying our capital by selling natural gas and oil properties with lower rates of return and increasing our investment in properties with higher return potential. We also invested in drilling rigs, gathering systems, compressors, and other property and equipment to support our natural gas and oil exploration, development and production activities. These activities continued in 2009, but at a reduced rate in response to a low natural gas price environment, lower demand and the benefit of our joint venture carries. The following table details our cash used in (provided by) investing activities during 2009, 2008 and 2007 ($ in millions): 2009 2008 2007 Natural Gas and Oil Investing Activities: Acquisitions of natural gas and oil companies and proved properties, net of cash acquired $ 5 $ 372 $ 520 Acquisition of leasehold and unproved properties 1,666 7,660 2,187 Exploration and development of natural gas and oil properties 3,410 5,789 4,962 Geological and geophysical costs(a) 162 315 343 Interest capitalized on unproved properties 598 561 296 Proceeds from sale of volumetric production payments (408 ) (1,579 ) (1,089 ) Deposits for acquisitions 12 15 Divestitures of proved and unproved properties and leasehold (1,518 ) (6,091 ) Total natural gas and oil investing activities 3,915 7,039 7,234 Other Investing Activities: Additions to other property and equipment 1,683 3,073 1,439 Proceeds from sale of drilling rigs and equipment (64 ) (369 ) Proceeds from sale of compressors (68 ) (114 ) (188 ) Additions to investments 40 74 8 Proceeds from sale of investments (2 ) (124 ) Sale of other assets (108 ) (41 ) (36 ) Total other investing activities 1,547 2,926 730 Total cash used in investing activities $ 5,462 $ 9,965 $ 7,964 (a) Including related capitalized interest. In connection with our reduced budget for acquisitions, we used 24,822,832 and 1,677,000 shares of our common stock to acquire leasehold and mineral interests in 2009 and 2008, respectively, pursuant to an acquisition shelf registration statement. 46 Table of Contents Bank Credit Facilities We utilize three revolving bank credit facilities, described below, as sources of liquidity.

Although the applicable interest rates under our corporate credit facility fluctuate slightly based on our long term senior unsecured credit ratings, none of our credit facilities contains provisions which would trigger an acceleration of amounts due under the facilities or a requirement to post additional collateral in the event of a downgrade of our credit ratings. Corporate Credit Facility Our $3.5 billion syndicated revolving bank credit facility is used for general corporate purposes. Borrowings under the facility are secured by certain producing natural gas and oil properties and bear interest at our option at either (i) the greater of the reference rate of Union Bank, N.A., or the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50%, both of which are subject to a margin that varies from 0.00% to 0.75% per annum according to our senior unsecured long term debt ratings, or (ii) the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), plus a margin that varies from 1.50% to 2.25% per annum according to our senior unsecured long term debt ratings. The collateral value and borrowing base are redetermined periodically. The unused portion of the facility is subject to a commitment fee of 0.50%. Interest is payable quarterly or, if LIBOR applies, it may be payable at more frequent intervals. The credit facility agreement contains various covenants and restrictive provisions which, among other things, limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness, make investments or loans and create liens. The credit facility agreement requires us to maintain an indebtedness (excluding discount on senior notes) to total capitalization ratio (as defined) not to exceed 0.70 to 1 and an indebtedness to EBITDA ratio (as defined) not to exceed 3.75 to 1. As defined by the credit facility agreement, our indebtedness to total capitalization ratio was 0.44 to 1 and our indebtedness to EBITDA ratio was 3.18 to 1 at December 31, 2009. If we should fail to perform our obligations under these and other covenants, the revolving credit commitment could be terminated and any outstanding borrowings under the facility could be declared immediately due and payable. Such acceleration, if involving a principal amount of $10 million ($50 million in the case of our senior notes issued after 2004), would constitute an event of default under our senior note indentures, which could in turn result in the acceleration of a significant portion of our senior note indebtedness. The credit facility agreement also has cross default provisions that apply to other indebtedness of Chesapeake and its restricted subsidiaries with an outstanding principal amount in excess of $75 million. 47 Table of Contents The facility is fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a joint and several basis, by Chesapeake and all of our other wholly owned restricted subsidiaries other than minor subsidiaries. Midstream Credit Facility Our midstream $250 million syndicated revolving bank credit facility is used to fund capital expenditures to build natural gas gathering and other systems to support our drilling program and for general corporate purposes associated with our midstream operations. Borrowings under the midstream credit facility are secured by all of the assets of the wholly owned subsidiaries (the restricted subsidiaries) of Chesapeake Midstream Development, L.P. (CMD), itself a wholly owned subsidiary of Chesapeake, and bear interest at our option at either (i) the greater of the reference rate of Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50%, and the one month LIBOR plus 1.00%, all of which are subject to a margin that varies from 2.00% to 2.75% per annum according to the most recent indebtedness to EBITDA ratio (as defined) or (ii) the LIBOR plus a margin that varies from 3.00% to 3.75% per annum according to the most recent indebtedness to EBITDA ratio (as defined). The unused portion of the facility is subject to a commitment fee of 0.50% per annum according to the most recent indebtedness to EBITDA ratio (as defined). Interest is payable quarterly or, if LIBOR applies, it may be paid at more frequent intervals. The midstream credit facility agreement contains various covenants and restrictive provisions which, among other things, limit the ability of CMD and its restricted subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness, make investments or loans, create liens and pay dividends or distributions to Chesapeake. The credit facility agreement requires maintenance of an indebtedness to EBITDA ratio (as defined) not to exceed 3.50 to 1, and an EBITDA (as defined) to interest expense coverage ratio of not less than 3.00 to 1. As defined by the credit facility agreement, our indebtedness to EBITDA ratio was 0.01 to 1 and our EBITDA to interest expense coverage ratio was 6.87 to 1 at December 31, 2009. If CMD or its restricted subsidiaries should fail to perform their obligations under these and other covenants, the revolving credit commitment could be terminated and any outstanding borrowings under the midstream facility could be declared immediately due and payable. The midstream credit facility agreement also has cross default provisions that apply to other indebtedness CMD and its subsidiaries may have with an outstanding principal amount in excess of $15 million. Midstream Joint Venture Credit Facility Our midstream joint venture $500 million syndicated revolving bank credit facility was established concurrent with the midstream joint venture we formed on September 30, 2009 (see Note 11 for discussion regarding the midstream joint venture). As a result of that transaction, our existing midstream credit facility was amended and restated as described above. Borrowings under the midstream joint venture credit facility are secured by all of the assets of the midstream companies organized under the joint venture, which is 50% owned by Chesapeake and 50% owned by our joint venture partner Global Infrastructure Partners, and bear interest at our option at either (i) the greater of the reference rate of Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50%, and the one month LIBOR plus 1.00%, all of which are subject to a margin that varies from 2.00% to 2.75% per annum according to the most recent indebtedness to EBITDA ratio (as defined) or (ii) the LIBOR plus a margin that varies from 3.00% to 3.75% per annum according to the most recent indebtedness to EBITDA ratio (as defined). The unused portion of the facility is subject to a commitment fee of 0.50% per annum according to the most recent indebtedness to EBITDA ratio (as defined). Interest is payable quarterly or, if LIBOR applies, it may be paid at more frequent intervals. The midstream joint venture credit facility agreement contains various covenants and restrictive provisions which, among other things, limit the ability of the joint venture and its subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness, make investments or loans, create liens and pay dividends or distributions to 48 Table of Contents Chesapeake. The credit facility agreement requires maintenance of an indebtedness to EBITDA ratio (as defined) not to exceed 3.50 to 1, and an EBITDA (as defined) to interest expense coverage ratio of not less than 3.00 to 1. As defined by the credit facility agreement, our indebtedness to EBITDA ratio was 0.19 to 1 and our EBITDA to interest expense coverage ratio was 21.75 to 1 at December 31, 2009. If CMP or its subsidiaries should fail to perform their obligations under these and other covenants, the revolving credit commitment could be terminated and any outstanding borrowings under the midstream joint venture facility could be declared immediately due and payable. The midstream joint venture credit facility agreement also has cross default provisions that apply to other indebtedness CMP and its subsidiaries may have with an outstanding principal amount in excess of $15 million. Hedging Facilities We began 2009 with six secured hedging facilities, each of which permitted us to enter into cash settled natural gas and oil commodity transactions, valued by the counterparty, for up to a stated maximum value. Outstanding transactions under each of the facilities were collateralized by certain of our natural gas and oil properties that did not secure any of our other obligations. On June 11, 2009, we entered into a multi counterparty hedge facility with 13 counterparties that have committed to provide approximately 3.9 tcfe of trading capacity and an aggregate mark to market capacity of $10.4 billion under the terms of the facility. The new multi counterparty facility has consolidated and replaced the six secured hedge facilities. All prior trades with these counterparties have been novated and pledged collateral transferred to the multi counterparty facility, which had a total of 1.7 tcfe hedged and collateral value of approximately $5.3 billion as of December 31, 2009. Trades from the original six secured hedging facilities will continue to be subject to pre existing exposure fees, but we are not required to pay an exposure fee for any new trades in the multi counterparty facility. The multi counterparty facility allows us to enter into cash settled natural gas and oil price and basis hedges with the counterparties. Our obligations under the multi counterparty facility are secured by natural gas and oil proved reserves, the value of which must cover the fair value of the transactions outstanding under the facility by at least 1.65 times, and guarantees by certain subsidiaries that also guarantee our corporate revolving bank credit facility and indentures. The counterparties obligations under the facility must be secured by cash or short term U.S. Treasury instruments to the extent that any mark to market amounts they owe to Chesapeake exceed defined thresholds. The maximum volume based trading capacity under the facility is governed by the expected production of the pledged reserve collateral, and volume based trading limits are applied separately to price and basis hedges. In addition, there are volume based sub limits for natural gas and oil hedges. Chesapeake has significant flexibility with regard to releases and or substitutions of pledged reserves, provided that certain collateral coverage and other requirements are met. The facility does not have a maturity date. Counterparties to the agreement have the right to cease trading with the company on a prospective basis as long as obligations associated with any existing trades in the facility continue to be satisfied in accordance with the terms of the agreement. 49 Table of Contents Senior Note Obligations In addition to outstanding revolving bank credit facility borrowings discussed above, as of December 31, 2009, senior notes represented approximately $10.4 billion of our long term debt and consisted of the following ($ in millions): 7.5% senior notes due 2013 $ 364 7.625% senior notes due 2013 500 7.0% senior notes due 2014 300 7.5% senior notes due 2014 300 6.375% senior notes due 2015 600 9.5% senior notes due 2015 1,425 6.625% senior notes due 2016 600 6.875% senior notes due 2016 670 6.25% Euro denominated senior notes due 2017(a) 860 6.5% senior notes due 2017 1,100 6.25% senior notes due 2018 600 7.25% senior notes due 2018 800 6.875% senior notes due 2020 500 2.75% contingent convertible senior notes due 2035(b) 451 2.5% contingent convertible senior notes due 2037(b) 1,378 2.25% contingent convertible senior notes due 2038(b) 763 Discount on senior notes(c) (921 ) Interest rate derivatives(d) 69 $ 10,359 (a) The principal amount shown is based on the dollar/euro exchange rate of $1.4332 to 1.00 as of December 31, 2009. See Note 9 for information on our related cross currency swap. (b) The holders of our contingent convertible senior notes may require us to repurchase, in cash, all or a portion of their notes at 100% of the principal amount of the notes on any of four dates that are five, ten, fifteen and twenty years before the maturity date. The notes are convertible, at the holders option, prior to maturity under certain circumstances into cash and, if applicable, shares of our common stock using a net share settlement process. One such triggering circumstance is when the price of our common stock exceeds a threshold amount during a specified period in a fiscal quarter. Convertibility based on common stock price is measured quarter by quarter. In the fourth quarter of 2009, the price of our common stock was below the threshold level for each series of the contingent convertible senior notes during the specified period and, as a result, the holders do not have the option to convert their notes into cash and common stock in the first quarter of 2010 under this provision. The notes are also convertible, at the holders option, during specified five day periods if the trading price of the notes is below certain levels determined by reference to the trading price of our common stock. In general, upon conversion of a contingent convertible senior note, the holder will receive cash equal to the principal amount of the note and common stock for the notes conversion value in excess of such principal amount. We will pay contingent interest on the convertible senior notes after they have been outstanding at least ten years, under certain conditions. We may redeem the convertible senior notes once they have been outstanding for ten years at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount of the notes, payable in cash. The optional repurchase dates, the common stock price conversion threshold amounts and the ending date of the first six month period contingent interest may be payable for the contingent convertible senior notes are as follows: ContingentConvertibleSenior Notes Repurchase Dates Common StockPriceConversionThresholds ContingentInterestFirst Payable(if applicable) 2.75% due 2035 November 15, 2015, 2020, 2025, 2030 $ 48.71 May 14, 2016 2.5% due 2037 May 15, 2017, 2022, 2027, 2032 $ 64.36 November 14, 2017 2.25% due 2038 December 15, 2018, 2023, 2028, 2033 $ 107.36 June 14, 2019 50 Table of Contents (c) Included in this discount is $794 million associated with the equity component of our contingent convertible senior notes. See Note 3 of our consolidated financial statements for a description of the accounting treatment applied to these notes. (d) See Note 9 of our consolidated financial statements included in this report for further discussion related to these instruments. No scheduled principal payments are required under our senior notes until 2013 when $864 million is due. As of December 31, 2009 and currently, debt ratings for the senior notes are Ba3 by Moodys Investor Service (stable outlook), BB by Standard & Poors Ratings Services (stable outlook) and BB by Fitch Ratings (negative outlook). Our senior notes are unsecured senior obligations of Chesapeake and rank equally in right of payment with all of our other existing and future senior indebtedness and rank senior in right of payment to all of our future subordinated indebtedness. Chesapeake Energy Corporation is a holding company and owns no operating assets and has no significant operations independent of its subsidiaries. Our senior note obligations are guaranteed by certain of our wholly owned subsidiaries. See Note 18 of the financial statements included in this report for condensed consolidating financial information regarding guarantor and non guarantor subsidiaries. We may redeem the senior notes, other than the contingent convertible senior notes, at any time at specified redemption or make whole prices. Senior notes issued before July 2005 are governed by indentures containing covenants that limit our ability and our restricted subsidiaries ability to incur additional indebtedness; pay dividends on our capital stock or redeem, repurchase or retire our capital stock or subordinated indebtedness; make investments and other restricted payments; incur liens; enter into sale/leaseback transactions; create restrictions on the payment of dividends or other amounts to us from our restricted subsidiaries; engage in transactions with affiliates; sell assets; and consolidate, merge or transfer assets. Senior notes issued after June 2005 are governed by indentures containing covenants that limit our ability and our restricted subsidiaries ability to incur certain secured indebtedness; enter into sale/leaseback transactions; and consolidate, merge or transfer assets. The debt incurrence covenants do not presently restrict our ability to borrow under or expand our corporate revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2009, we estimate that corporate commercial bank indebtedness of approximately $4.4 billion could have been incurred under the most restrictive indenture covenant. Conversions and Exchanges of Contingent Convertible Senior Notes and Preferred Stock In 2009 and 2008, holders of certain of our contingent convertible senior notes exchanged or converted their senior notes for shares of common stock in privately negotiated exchanges as summarized below ($ in millions): Year Contingent ConvertibleSenior Notes Principal Amount Number of Common Shares 2009 2.25% due 2038 $ 364 10,210,169 2008 2.75% due 2035 $ 239 8,841,526 2008 2.50% due 2037 272 8,416,865 2008 2.25% due 2038 254 6,654,821 $ 765 23,913,212 51 Table of Contents In 2009, 2008 and 2007, shares of our cumulative convertible preferred stock were exchanged for or converted into shares of common stock as summarized below: Year of Exchange/ Conversion Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock NumberofPreferred Shares NumberofCommon Shares TypeofTransaction 2009 6.25% 143,768 1,239,538 Conversion 4.125% 3,033 182,887 Conversion 1,422,425 2008 5.0% (series 2005B) 3,654,385 10,443,642 Exchange 4.5% 891,100 2,227,750 Exchange 4.125% 29 1,743 Conversion 12,673,135 2007 5.0% (series 2005) 4,595,000 19,283,311 Exchange 6.25% 2,156,184 17,367,823 Exchange 6.25% 48 344 Conversion 4.125% 3 180 Conversion 36,651,658 Contractual Obligations The table below summarizes our cash contractual obligations as of December 31, 2009 ($ in millions): Payments Due By Period Total Less than1 Year 1 3Years 3 5Years More than5 Years Long term debt: Principal $ 13,147 $ $ 1,936 $ 1,464 $ 9,747 Interest 5,780 694 1,387 1,276 2,423 Financing lease obligations and other 930 20 38 92 780 Operating lease obligations 882 147 290 278 167 Asset retirement obligations(a) 282 35 29 8 210 Purchase obligations(b) 3,082 482 674 538 1,388 Unrecognized tax benefits(c) 231 196 35 Standby letters of credit 41 41 Total contractual cash obligations $ 24,375 $ 1,419 $ 4,550 $ 3,691 $ 14,715 (a) Asset retirement obligations represent estimated discounted costs for future dismantlement and abandonment costs.

(c) See Note 5 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for a description of unrecognized tax benefits. Chesapeake has commitments to purchase any natural gas and oil associated with certain volumetric production payment transactions based on market prices at the time of production and the purchased gas will be resold. 52 Table of Contents Under minimum volume throughput agreements, Chesapeake has agreed to move fixed volumes of natural gas over certain time periods, usually multiple years, through certain midstream systems. At the end of the term or annually, Chesapeake will be invoiced for any shortfalls in such volume commitments. Hedging Activities Natural Gas and Oil Hedging Activities Our results of operations and cash flows are impacted by changes in market prices for natural gas and oil. To mitigate a portion of the exposure to adverse market changes, we have entered into various derivative instruments. Executive management is involved in all risk management activities and the Board of Directors reviews the companys hedging program at its quarterly Board meetings. We believe we have sufficient internal controls to prevent unauthorized hedging. As of December 31, 2009, our natural gas and oil derivative instruments were comprised of swaps, collars, call options, put options, knockout swaps and basis protection swaps. Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk contains a description of each of these instruments. Although derivatives often fail to achieve 100% effectiveness for accounting purposes, we believe our derivative instruments continue to be highly effective in achieving the risk management objectives for which they were intended. Hedging allows us to predict with greater certainty the effective prices we will receive for our hedged natural gas and oil production. We closely monitor the fair value of our hedging contracts and may elect to settle a contract prior to its scheduled maturity date in order to lock in a gain or loss. Commodity markets are volatile and Chesapeakes hedging activities are dynamic. Mark to market positions under natural gas and oil hedging contracts fluctuate with commodity prices. As described above under Hedging Facilities, our secured multi counterparty hedging facility allows us to minimize the potential liquidity impact of significant mark to market fluctuations in the value of our natural gas and oil hedges by pledging natural gas and oil properties. Our realized and unrealized gains and losses on natural gas and oil derivatives during 2009, 2008 and 2007 were as follows: Years Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 ($ in millions) Natural gas and oil sales $ 3,291 $ 7,069 $ 4,795 Realized gains (losses) on natural gas and oil derivatives 2,346 (8 ) 1,203 Unrealized gains (losses) on non qualifying natural gas and oil derivatives (624 ) 887 (252 ) Unrealized gains (losses) on ineffectiveness of cash flow hedges 36 (90 ) (122 ) Total natural gas and oil sales $ 5,049 $ 7,858 $ 5,624 Changes in the fair value of natural gas and oil derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, to the extent effective in offsetting cash flows attributable to the hedged commodities, and locked in gains and losses of derivative contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and are transferred to earnings in the month of related production. These unrealized gains (losses), net of related tax effects, totaled $94 million, $386 million and $53 million as of December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Based upon the market prices at December 31, 2009, we expect to transfer to earnings approximately $202 million of the net gain included in the balance of accumulated other comprehensive income during the next 12 months. A detailed explanation of accounting for natural gas and oil derivatives appears under Application of Critical Accounting Policies Hedging elsewhere in this Item 7. 53 Table of Contents The estimated fair values of our natural gas and oil derivative instruments as of December 31, 2009 and 2008 are provided below. The associated carrying values of these instruments are equal to the estimated fair values.

For interest rate derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, changes in fair value are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as assets (liabilities), and the debts carrying value amount is adjusted by the change in the fair value of the debt subsequent to the initiation of the derivative. Changes in the fair value of non qualifying derivatives that occur prior to their maturity (i.e., temporary fluctuations in value) are reported currently in the consolidated statements of operations as unrealized (gains) losses within interest expense. 54 Table of Contents Gains or losses from interest rate derivative transactions are reflected as adjustments to interest expense on the consolidated statements of operations.

Foreign Currency Derivatives On December 6, 2006, we issued 600 million of 6.25% Euro denominated Senior Notes due 2017. Concurrent with the issuance of the Euro denominated senior notes, we entered into a cross currency swap to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in the euro relative to the dollar over the term of the notes. A detailed explanation of accounting for foreign currency derivatives appears under Application of Critical Accounting Policies Hedging elsewhere in this Item 7. Results of Operations General. For the year ended December 31, 2009, Chesapeake had a net loss of $5.830 billion, or a loss of $9.57 per diluted common share, on total revenues of $7.702 billion. This compares to net income of $604 million, or $0.93 per diluted common share, on total revenues of $11.629 billion during the year ended December 31, 2008, and net income of $1.455 billion, or $2.63 per diluted common share, on total revenues of $7.800 billion during the year ended December 31, 2007. Natural Gas and Oil Sales. During 2009, natural gas and oil sales were $5.049 billion compared to $7.858 billion in 2008 and $5.624 billion in 2007. In 2009, Chesapeake produced and sold 905.5 bcfe of natural gas and oil at a weighted average price of $6.22 per mcfe, compared to 842.7 bcfe in 2008 at a weighted average price of $8.38 per mcfe, and 714.3 bcfe in 2007 at a weighted average price of $8.40 per mcfe (weighted average prices for all years discussed exclude the effect of unrealized gains or (losses) on derivatives of ($588) million, $797 million and ($374) million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively). The decrease in prices in 2009 resulted in a decrease in revenue of $1.950 billion and increased production resulted in a $526 million increase, for a total decrease in revenues of $1.424 billion (excluding unrealized gains or losses on natural gas and oil derivatives). The increase in production from period to period was primarily generated from the drillbit. For 2009, we realized an average price per mcf of natural gas of $5.93, compared to $8.09 in 2008 and $8.14 in 2007 (weighted average prices for all years discussed exclude the effect of unrealized gains or losses on derivatives). Oil prices realized per barrel (excluding unrealized gains or losses on derivatives) were $58.38, $70.48 and $67.50 in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Realized gains or losses from our natural gas and oil derivatives resulted in a net increase in natural gas and oil revenues of $2.346 billion or $2.59 per mcfe in 2009, a net decrease of ($8) million or ($0.01) per mcfe in 2008 and a net increase of $1.203 billion or $1.68 per mcfe in 2007. 55 Table of Contents A change in natural gas and oil prices has a significant impact on our natural gas and oil revenues and cash flows. Assuming 2009 production levels, a change of $0.10 per mcf of natural gas sold would result in an increase or decrease in 2009 revenues and cash flows of approximately $91 million and $88 million, respectively, and a change of $1.00 per barrel of oil sold would result in an increase or decrease in 2009 revenues and cash flows of approximately $12 million and $11 million, without considering the effect of hedging activities.

(b) 2009 and 2008 were impacted by the sale of 10.1 bcfe and 6.6 bcfe of production, respectively, related to the BP Arkoma divestiture that closed in August 2008. (c) 2009 and 2008 were impacted by the sale of 30.3 bcfe and 5.2 bcfe of production, respectively, related to the BP Fayetteville joint venture that closed in September 2008. (d) 2009 and 2008 were impacted by the sale of 5.4 bcfe and 0.1 bcfe of production, respectively, related to the STO Marcellus joint venture that closed in November 2008. (e) 2009 and 2008 were impacted by the sale of 49.6 bcfe and 18.2 bcfe of production, respectively, related to various VPP transactions that closed in 2008. (f) 2009 was impacted by the sale of 7.8 bcfe of production related to a VPP transaction that closed in 2009. (g) 2009 and 2008 were impacted by the sale of 17.0 bcfe and 18.3 bcfe of production, respectively, related to a VPP transaction that closed in 2007. Natural gas production represented approximately 92% of our total production volume on a natural gas equivalent basis in 2009, 2008 and 2007. Marketing, Gathering and Compression. Marketing, gathering and compression activities are substantially for third parties who are owners in Chesapeake operated wells. Chesapeake realized $2.463 billion in marketing, gathering and compression sales in 2009, with corresponding marketing, gathering and compression expenses of $2.316 billion, for a net margin before depreciation of $147 million. This compares to sales of $3.598 billion and $2.040 billion, expenses of $3.505 billion and $1.969 billion, and margins before depreciation of $93 million and $71 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively. In 2009 and 2008, Chesapeake realized an increase in marketing, gathering and compression net margin primarily due to an increase in third party marketing volumes. Service Operations Revenue and Operating Expenses. Service operations consist of third party revenue and operating expenses related to our drilling and oilfield trucking operations. Chesapeake recognized $190 million in service operations revenue in 2009 with corresponding service operations expenses of $182 million, for a net margin before depreciation of $8 million. This compares to revenue of $173 million and $136 million, expenses of $143 million and $94 million and a net margin before depreciation of $30 million and $42 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively. These operations have grown as a result of assets and businesses we acquired and leased as seen in the growth in revenues. However, the net margins have decreased each of the previous three years. This is the result of increased expenses associated with the leasing cost of the numerous rigs we have sold and leased back in the previous three years. 57 Table of Contents Production Expenses. Production expenses, which include lifting costs and ad valorem taxes, were $876 million in 2009, compared to $889 million and $640 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively. On a unit of production basis, production expenses were $0.97 per mcfe in 2009 compared to $1.05 and $0.90 per mcfe in 2008 and 2007, respectively. The expense decrease in 2009 was primarily due to lower service costs in the field as a result of the economic downturn. Our per unit decrease in 2009 was also affected by the increase in production. We expect that production expenses per mcfe produced for 2010 will range from $0.85 to $0.95. The following table shows our production expenses by region and our ad valorem tax expenses for 2009, 2008 and 2007 ($ in millions, except per unit): 2009 2008 2007 ProductionExpenses $/mcfe ProductionExpenses $/mcfe ProductionExpenses $/mcfe Big 6 Shales: Barnett Shale $ 158 $ 0.66 $ 128 $ 0.71 $ 58 $ 0.62 Fayetteville Shale 23 0.25 13 0.24 7 0.41 Haynesville Shale 33 0.39 37 1.33 Marcellus Shale 24 1.67 4 1.63 Bossier Shale Eagle Ford Shale Other: Mid Continent 300 0.98 362 1.01 285 0.80 Permian and Delaware Basins 114 1.52 134 1.67 104 1.60 South Texas/Gulf Coast/Ark La Tex 68 1.02 95 0.91 120 0.89 Appalachian Basin 76 2.50 42 1.24 27 0.56 Ad valorem tax 80 0.09 74 0.09 39 0.05 Total $ 876 $ 0.97 $ 889 $ 1.05 $ 640 $ 0.90 Production Taxes. Production taxes were $107 million in 2009 compared to $284 million in 2008 and $216 million in 2007. On a unit of production basis, production taxes were $0.12 per mcfe in 2009 compared to $0.34 per mcfe in 2008 and $0.30 per mcfe in 2007. The $177 million decrease in production taxes from 2008 to 2009 is due to a decrease in the realized average sales price of natural gas and oil of $4.76 per mcfe (excluding gains or losses on derivatives), which more than offset the production increase of 63 bcfe. In general, production taxes are calculated using value based formulas that produce higher per unit costs when natural gas and oil prices are higher. We expect production taxes for 2010 to range from $0.25 to $0.30 per mcfe based on estimated NYMEX prices ranging from $5.25 to $6.75 per mcf of natural gas and an oil price of $80.00 per barrel. General and Administrative Expense. General and administrative expenses, including stock based compensation but excluding internal costs capitalized to our natural gas and oil properties (see Note 10 of notes to consolidated financial statements), were $349 million in 2009, $377 million in 2008 and $243 million in 2007. General and administrative expenses were $0.38, $0.45 and $0.34 per mcfe for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The decrease in 2009 was primarily the result of decreased spending related to media relations. Included in general and administrative expenses is stock based compensation of $83 million in 2009, $85 million in 2008 and $58 million in 2007. Restricted stock grants are expensed at the price of our common stock on the date of grant. The increase in 2008 was the result of a larger number of unvested shares being expensed during 2008 compared to 2007. We anticipate that general and administrative expenses for 2010 will be between $0.39 and $0.46 per mcfe produced, including stock based compensation ranging from $0.09 to $0.11 per mcfe produced. 58 Table of Contents Our stock based compensation for employees and non employee directors is in the form of restricted stock. Employee restricted stock awards generally vest over a period of four or five years. Our non employee director awards vest over a period of three years. The discussion of stock based compensation in Note 1 and Note 8 of notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report provides additional detail on the accounting for and reporting of our stock based compensation. Chesapeake follows the full cost method of accounting under which all costs associated with natural gas and oil property acquisition, exploration and development activities are capitalized. We capitalize internal costs that can be directly identified with our acquisition, exploration and development activities and do not include any costs related to production, general corporate overhead or similar activities. We capitalized $354 million, $352 million and $262 million of internal costs in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, directly related to our natural gas and oil property acquisition, exploration and development efforts. Natural Gas and Oil Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization. Depreciation, depletion and amortization of natural gas and oil properties was $1.371 billion, $1.970 billion and $1.835 billion during 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The average DD&A rate per mcfe, which is a function of capitalized costs, future development costs, and the related underlying reserves in the periods presented, was $1.51, $2.34 and $2.57 in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The decrease in the average rate from $2.57 in 2007 to $1.51 in 2009 is due primarily to reductions of our natural gas and oil full cost pool resulting from our divestitures in 2008 and 2009 and impairments of our full cost pool in 2008 and 2009 as well as the addition of reserves through our drilling activities. We expect the 2010 DD&A rate to be between $1.35 and $1.55 per mcfe produced. Depreciation and Amortization of Other Assets. Depreciation and amortization of other assets was $244 million in 2009, compared to $174 million in 2008 and $153 million in 2007. The average DD&A rate per mcfe was $0.27, $0.21 and $0.21 in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The increase from 2008 to 2009 was mainly due to the significant increase in our investment in gathering systems, compressors, buildings and drilling rigs. Property and equipment costs are depreciated on a straight line basis. Buildings are depreciated over 10 to 39 years, gathering facilities are depreciated over 20 years, drilling rigs are depreciated over 15 years and all other property and equipment are depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from two to twenty years. To the extent company owned drilling rigs are used to drill our wells, a substantial portion of the depreciation is capitalized in natural gas and oil properties as exploration or development costs. We expect 2010 depreciation and amortization of other assets to be between $0.20 and $0.25 per mcfe produced. Impairment of Natural Gas and Oil Properties and Other Assets. Due to lower commodity prices in the second half of 2008 and throughout 2009, we reported a non cash impairment charge on our natural gas and oil properties of $11.0 billion in 2009 and $2.8 billion in 2008. We account for our natural gas and oil properties using the full cost method of accounting, which limits the amount of costs we can capitalize and requires us to write off these costs if the carrying value of natural gas and oil assets in the evaluated portion of our full cost pool exceeds the sum of the present value of expected future net cash flows of proved reserves using a 10% pre tax discount rate based on pricing and cost assumptions and the present value of certain natural gas and oil hedges. Additionally, in 2009, we recorded an impairment of $90 million associated with certain of our midstream assets and $27 million associated with certain of our service operations assets. Other Income (Expense). Other income (expense) was ($28) million, ($11) million and $15 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The 2009 loss consisted of $8 million of interest income, a $39 million loss related to our equity in the net losses of certain investments, a $1 million gain on sale of assets and $2 million of miscellaneous income. The 2008 loss consisted of $22 million of interest 59 Table of Contents income, a $38 million loss related to our equity in the net losses of certain investments, a $4 million gain on sale of assets, $10 million of expense related to consent solicitation fees and $11 million of miscellaneous income. The 2007 income consisted of $8 million of interest income and $7 million of miscellaneous income. Income related to equity investments was not significant in 2007. Interest Expense. Interest expense decreased to $113 million in 2009 compared to $271 million in 2008 and $401 million in 2007 as follows: Years Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 ($ in millions) Interest expense on senior notes $ 765 $ 637 $ 538 Interest expense on credit facilities 60 117 113 Capitalized interest (633 ) (585 ) (311 ) Realized (gain) loss on interest rate derivatives (23 ) (6 ) 1 Unrealized (gain) loss on interest rate derivatives (91 ) 85 40 Amortization of loan discount and other 35 23 20 Total interest expense $ 113 $ 271 $ 401 Average long term borrowings $ 11,167 $ 10,044 $ 8,224 Interest expense, excluding unrealized (gains) losses on interest rate derivatives was $0.22 per mcfe in 2009 compared to $0.22 per mcfe in 2008 and $0.50 per mcfe in 2007. The decrease in interest expense per mcfe for 2009 and 2008 is due to increased production volumes and an increase in capitalized interest. Capitalized interest increased in 2009 and 2008 as a result of a significant increase in unevaluated properties, the base on which interest is capitalized. We expect interest expense for 2010 to be between $0.30 and $0.35 per mcfe produced (before considering the effect of interest rate derivatives). Impairment of Investments. We recorded a $162 million and $180 million impairment of certain investments in 2009 and 2008, respectively. Each of our investees has been impacted by the dramatic slowing of the worldwide economy and the freezing of the credit markets in the fourth quarter of 2008 and into 2009. The economic weakness has resulted in significantly reduced natural gas and oil prices leading to a meaningful decline in the overall level of activity in the markets served by our investees. Associated with the weakness in performance of certain of the investees, as well as an evaluation of their financial condition and near term prospects, we recognized that an other than temporary impairment had occurred on the following investments in 2009: Gastar Exploration, Ltd., $70 million; Chaparral Energy, Inc., $51 million; DHS Drilling Company, $19 million; Ventura Refining, Transmission LLC, Inc., $13 million; and Mountain Drilling Company, $9 million. We recognized that an other than temporary impairment had occurred on the following investments in 2008: Chaparral Energy, Inc., $100 million; DHS Drilling Company, $20 million; Mountain Drilling Company, $10 million; and Ventura Refining and Transmission LLC, Inc., $50 million. Loss on Exchanges or Repurchases of Chesapeake Debt. During 2009, we privately exchanged approximately $364 million in aggregate principal amount of our 2.25% Contingent Convertible Senior Notes due 2038 for an aggregate of 10,210,169 shares of our common stock valued at approximately $262 million. Through these transactions, we were able to redeem this debt for common stock valued at less than 75% of the face value of the notes. Associated with these exchanges, we recorded a loss of $40 million. In connection with accounting guidance for debt with conversion and other options, we are required to account for the liability and equity components of our convertible debt instruments separately. Of the $364 million principal amount of convertible notes exchanged in 2009, $227 million was allocated to the debt component and the remaining $137 million was allocated to the equity 60 Table of Contents conversion feature and was recorded as an adjustment to paid in capital. The difference between the debt component and the value of the common stock exchanged in these transactions resulted in a $35 million loss. In addition, we expensed $5 million in deferred charges associated with these exchanges. During 2008, we exchanged approximately $254 million, $272 million and $239 million in aggregate principal amount of our 2.25% Contingent Convertible Senior Notes due 2038, 2.50% Contingent Convertible Senior Notes due 2037, and 2.75% Contingent Convertible Senior Notes due 2035, respectively, for an aggregate of 23,913,212 shares of our common stock valued at approximately $480 million. Through these transactions, we were able to redeem this debt for common stock valued at less than 65% of the face value of the notes. Associated with these exchanges, we recorded a gain of $27 million. Of the combined $765 million principal amount of convertible notes exchanged in 2008, $515 million was allocated to the debt component and the remaining $250 million was allocated to the equity conversion feature and was recorded as an adjustment to paid in capital. The difference between the debt component and the value of the common stock exchanged in these transactions resulted in a $35 million gain. This gain was partially offset by the write off of $8 million in deferred charges associated with these exchanges. Also during 2008, we repurchased $300 million of our 7.75% Senior Notes due 2015 in order to re finance a portion of our long term debt at a lower rate of interest. In connection with the transaction, we recorded a $31 million loss, which consisted of a $12 million premium and $19 million of discounts, interest rate derivatives and deferred charges associated with the notes. Gain on Sale of Investments. In 2007, we sold our 33% limited partnership interest in Eagle Energy Partners I, L.P., which we first acquired in 2003, for proceeds of $124 million and a gain of $83 million. Income Tax Expense (Benefit). Chesapeake recorded an income tax benefit of $3.483 billion in 2009 compared to income tax expense of $387 million in 2008 and $892 million in 2007. Of the income tax benefit recorded in 2009, $4 million is reflected as current income tax expense and $3.487 billion is reflected as a deferred income tax benefit. Of the $3.870 billion decrease in 2009, $4.009 billion was the result of the decrease in net income before taxes which was offset by $139 million as the result of a decrease in the effective tax rate. Our effective income tax rate was 37.5% in 2009 compared to 39% in 2008 and 38% in 2007. Our effective tax rate fluctuates as a result of the impact of state income taxes and permanent differences. We expect our effective income tax rate to be 38.5% in 2010. Loss on Conversion/Exchange of Preferred Stock. Loss on conversion/exchange of preferred stock was $0, $67 million and $128 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The loss on the exchanges represented the excess of the fair value of the common stock issued over the fair value of the securities issuable pursuant to the original conversion terms. See Note 8 of notes to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further detail regarding these transactions. Application of Critical Accounting Policies Readers of this report and users of the information contained in it should be aware of how certain events may impact our financial results based on the accounting policies in place. The three policies we consider to be the most significant are discussed below. The companys management has discussed each critical accounting policy with the Audit Committee of the companys Board of Directors. The selection and application of accounting policies are an important process that changes as our business changes and as accounting rules are developed. Accounting rules generally do not involve a selection among alternatives, but involve an implementation and interpretation of existing rules and the use of judgment to the specific set of circumstances existing in our business. 61 Table of Contents Hedging. Chesapeake uses commodity price and financial risk management instruments to mitigate our exposure to price fluctuations in natural gas and oil, changes in interest rates and changes in foreign exchange rates. Recognized gains and losses on derivative contracts are reported as a component of the related transaction. Results of natural gas and oil derivative transactions are reflected in natural gas and oil sales, and results of interest rate and foreign exchange rate hedging transactions are reflected in interest expense. The changes in the fair value of derivative instruments not qualifying for designation as either cash flow or fair value hedges that occur prior to maturity are reported currently in the consolidated statement of operations as unrealized gains (losses) within natural gas and oil sales or interest expense. Cash flows from derivative instruments are classified in the same category within the statement of cash flows as the items being hedged, or on a basis consistent with the nature of the instruments. Accounting guidance for derivatives and hedging establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that derivative instruments (including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts) be recorded at fair value and included in the consolidated balance sheet as assets or liabilities. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation, which is established at the inception of a derivative. For derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, changes in fair value, to the extent the hedge is effective, are recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. Any change in the fair value resulting from ineffectiveness is recognized immediately in natural gas and oil sales. For derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, changes in fair value, as well as the offsetting changes in the estimated fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, are recognized currently in earnings. Differences between the changes in the fair values of the hedged item and the derivative instrument, if any, represent gains or losses on ineffectiveness and are reflected currently in interest expense. Hedge effectiveness is measured at least quarterly based on the relative changes in fair value between the derivative contract and the hedged item over time. Changes in fair value of contracts that do not qualify as hedges or are not designated as hedges are also recognized currently in earnings. See Hedging Activities above and Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk for additional information regarding our hedging activities. One of the primary factors that can have an impact on our results of operations is the method used to value our derivatives. We have established the fair value of our derivative instruments utilizing established index prices, volatility curves and discount factors. These estimates are compared to our counterparty values for reasonableness. Derivative transactions are also subject to the risk that counterparties will be unable to meet their obligations. Such non performance risk is considered in the valuation of our derivative instruments, but to date has not had a material impact on the values of our derivatives. The values we report in our financial statements are as of a point in time and subsequently change as these estimates are revised to reflect actual results, changes in market conditions and other factors. Another factor that can impact our results of operations each period is our ability to estimate the level of correlation between future changes in the fair value of the hedge instruments and the transactions being hedged, both at inception and on an ongoing basis. This correlation is complicated since energy commodity prices, the primary risk we hedge, have quality and location differences that can be difficult to hedge effectively. The factors underlying our estimates of fair value and our assessment of correlation of our hedging derivatives are impacted by actual results and changes in conditions that affect these factors, many of which are beyond our control. Due to the volatility of natural gas and oil prices and, to a lesser extent, interest rates and foreign exchange rates, the companys financial condition and results of operations can be significantly impacted by changes in the market value of our derivative instruments. As of December 31, 2009, 62 Table of Contents 2008 and 2007, the fair value of our derivatives was a liability of $63 million, an asset of $1.166 billion and a liability of $375 million, respectively. The derivatives that we acquired in our CNR acquisition represented $17 million and $184 million of liability at December 31, 2008 and 2007. Natural Gas and Oil Properties. The accounting for our business is subject to special accounting rules that are unique to the natural gas and oil industry. There are two allowable methods of accounting for natural gas and oil business activities: the successful efforts method and the full cost method. Chesapeake follows the full cost method of accounting under which all costs associated with property acquisition, exploration and development activities are capitalized. We also capitalize internal costs that can be directly identified with our acquisition, exploration and development activities and do not include any costs related to production, general corporate overhead or similar activities. Under the successful efforts method, geological and geophysical costs and costs of carrying and retaining undeveloped properties are charged to expense as incurred. Costs of drilling exploratory wells that do not result in proved reserves are charged to expense. Depreciation, depletion, amortization and impairment of natural gas and oil properties are generally calculated on a well by well or lease or field basis versus the aggregated full cost pool basis. Additionally, gain or loss is generally recognized on all sales of natural gas and oil properties under the successful efforts method. As a result, our financial statements will differ from companies that apply the successful efforts method since we will generally reflect a higher level of capitalized costs as well as a higher natural gas and oil depreciation, depletion and amortization rate, and we will not have exploration expenses that successful efforts companies frequently have. Under the full cost method, capitalized costs are amortized on a composite unit of production method based on proved natural gas and oil reserves. If we maintain the same level of production year over year, the depreciation, depletion and amortization expense may be significantly different if our estimate of remaining reserves or future development costs changes significantly. Proceeds from the sale of properties are accounted for as reductions of capitalized costs unless such sales involve a significant change in the relationship between costs and proved reserves, in which case a gain or loss is recognized. The costs of unproved properties are excluded from amortization until the properties are evaluated. We review all of our unevaluated properties quarterly to determine whether or not and to what extent proved reserves have been assigned to the properties, and otherwise if impairment has occurred. Unevaluated properties are grouped by major producing area where individual property costs are not significant and are assessed individually when individual costs are significant. We review the carrying value of our natural gas and oil properties under the full cost accounting rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission on a quarterly basis. This quarterly review is referred to as a ceiling test. Under the ceiling test, capitalized costs, less accumulated amortization and related deferred income taxes, may not exceed an amount equal to the sum of the present value of estimated future net revenues (adjusted for cash flow hedges) less estimated future expenditures to be incurred in developing and producing the proved reserves, less any related income tax effects. For 2009, capitalized costs of natural gas and oil properties exceeded the estimated present value of future net revenues from our proved reserves, net of related income tax considerations, resulting in a write down in the carrying value of natural gas and oil properties of $6.9 billion, net of tax. In calculating future net revenues, effective December 31, 2009, current prices are calculated as the average natural gas and oil prices during the preceding 12 month period prior to the end of the current reporting period, determined as the unweighted arithmetical average of prices on the first day of each month within the 12 month period and costs used are those as of the end of the appropriate quarterly period. Such prices are utilized except where different prices are fixed and determinable from applicable contracts for the remaining term of those contracts, including the effects of derivatives qualifying as cash flow hedges. Based on the average prices for natural gas and oil during the 12 months of 2009, these cash flow hedges increased the full cost ceiling by $1.1 billion, thereby reducing the ceiling test write down by the same amount. 63 Table of Contents Two primary factors impacting this test are reserve levels and natural gas and oil prices, and their associated impact on the present value of estimated future net revenues. Revisions to estimates of natural gas and oil reserves and or an increase or decrease in prices can have a material impact on the present value of estimated future net revenues. Any excess of the net book value, less deferred income taxes, is generally written off as an expense. In December 2008, the SEC issued its final rule for Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting. Pursuant to this rule the SEC adopted revisions to its oil and gas reporting disclosures effective for annual reports on Form 10 K for fiscal years ending on or after December 31, 2009. The revisions are intended to provide investors with a more meaningful and comprehensive understanding of oil and gas reserves, which should help investors evaluate the relative value of oil and gas companies. In the three decades that have passed since the original adoption of oil and gas disclosure items, there have been significant changes in the oil and gas industry. These revisions are designed to modernize and update the oil and gas disclosure requirements to align them with current practices and changes in technology. The new rules include provisions that permit the use of new technologies to determine proved reserves. The requirements also require companies to report the independence and qualifications of the technical person(s) primarily responsible for the preparation or audit of reserve estimations and to file reports when a third party is relied upon to prepare or audit reserve estimates. In addition, the new rules require that oil and gas reserves be reported and the full cost ceiling value calculated using average first of the month natural gas and oil prices during the 12 month period ending in the reporting period, compared to prices at period end under prior SEC rules. It is not practicable for Chesapeake to estimate the effect of adopting the new reserve rules; however, these revisions and requirements affect the comparability between reporting periods for reserve volume and value estimates, full cost pool write down calculations and the calculation of depreciation, depletion and amortization of oil and gas assets. The process of estimating natural gas and oil reserves is complex, requiring significant decisions in the evaluation of available geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data. The data for a given property may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors, including additional development activity, evolving production history and a continual reassessment of the viability of production under changing economic conditions. As a result, material revisions to existing reserve estimates occur from time to time. Although every reasonable effort is made to ensure that reserve estimates reported represent the most accurate assessments possible, the subjective decisions and variances in available data for various properties increase the likelihood of significant changes in these estimates. As of December 31, 2008, Chesapeake had proved reserves of 12.051 tcfe at NYMEX spot prices of $5.71 per mcf and $44.61 per barrel before price differential adjustments. As of December 31, 2009, we had proved reserves of 14.254 tcfe at 2009 12 month average prices of $3.87 per mcf and $61.14 per barrel before price differential adjustments. The increase in proved reserves is, in part, due to the new reserve rules in effect for this filing. Our December 31, 2008 proved undeveloped (PUD) reserve volume was 3.960 tcfe and our December 31, 2009 PUD reserve volume was 5.923 tcfe. This increase is partially attributable to the modernized rules, which allow for the reporting of PUD reserves more than one direct spacing area offsetting producing wells if reasonable certainty can be shown using reliable technology. Chesapeake has utilized and developed reliable geologic and engineering technology to book PUD reserves more than one location offsetting production in the Barnett Shale and Fayetteville Shale. Within the Barnett and Fayetteville Shale plays, we used both public and proprietary geologic data to establish continuity of the formation and its producing properties. This included seismic data and interpretations (2 D, 3 D and micro seismic); open hole log information (both vertical and horizontally collected) and petrophysical analysis of the log data; mud logs; gas sample analysis; drill cutting samples; measurements of total organic content; thermal maturity; sidewall cores; whole cores and 64 Table of Contents data measured from internal core analysis facility. Once the continuous geologic area was established, statistical analysis of established producing wells was used to generate reasonable certainty (defined as 90% probability aggregated to the field level). The analysis required a statistically significant number of producing wells within the defined geologic area and then tested for confidence by insuring the variance in results over time, area and distance was evaluated. Proper development spacing was also statistically analyzed. Income Taxes. As part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate the federal and state income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which Chesapeake operates. This process involves estimating the actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items, such as derivative instruments, depreciation, depletion and amortization, and certain accrued liabilities for tax and accounting purposes. These differences and our net operating loss carryforwards result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included in our consolidated balance sheet. We must then assess, using all available positive and negative evidence, the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income. If we believe that recovery is not likely, we must establish a valuation allowance. Generally, to the extent Chesapeake establishes a valuation allowance or increases or decreases this allowance in a period, we must include an expense or reduction of expense within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of operations. Under accounting guidance for income taxes, an enterprise must use judgment in considering the relative impact of negative and positive evidence. The weight given to the potential effect of negative and positive evidence should be commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified. The more negative evidence that exists (i) the more positive evidence is necessary and (ii) the more difficult it is to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed for some portion or all of the deferred tax asset. Among the more significant types of evidence that we consider are: taxable income projections in future years; whether the carryforward period is so brief that it would limit realization of tax benefit; future sales and operating cost projections that will produce more than enough taxable income to realize the deferred tax asset based on existing sales prices and cost structures; and our earnings history exclusive of the loss that created the future deductible amount coupled with evidence indicating that the loss is an aberration rather than a continuing condition. If (i) natural gas and oil prices were to decrease significantly below present levels (and if such decreases were considered other than temporary), (ii) exploration, drilling and operating costs were to increase significantly beyond current levels, or (iii) we were confronted with any other significantly negative evidence pertaining to our ability to realize our NOL carryforwards prior to their expiration, we may be required to provide a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. As of December 31, 2009, we had deferred tax assets of $934 million. Accounting guidance for recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions prescribes a threshold condition that a tax position must meet for any of the benefit of the uncertain tax position to be recognized in the financial statements. Guidance is also provided regarding de recognition, classification and disclosure of these uncertain tax positions. Based on this guidance, we regularly analyze tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return based on the threshold condition prescribed. Tax positions that do not meet or exceed this threshold condition are considered uncertain tax positions. We accrue interest related to these uncertain tax positions which is recognized in interest expense. Penalties, if any, related to uncertain tax positions would be recorded in other expenses. Additional information about uncertain tax positions appears in Note 5 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements. 65 Table of Contents Disclosures About Effects of Transactions with Related Parties Since Chesapeake was founded in 1989, our CEO, Aubrey K. McClendon, has acquired working interests in virtually all of our natural gas and oil properties by participating in our drilling activities under the terms of the Founder Well Participation Program (FWPP) and predecessor participation arrangements provided for in Mr. McClendons employment agreements. Under the FWPP, approved by our shareholders in June 2005, Mr. McClendon may elect to participate in all or none of the wells drilled by or on behalf of Chesapeake during a calendar year, but he is not allowed to participate only in selected wells. A participation election is required to be received by the Compensation Committee of Chesapeakes Board of Directors not less than 30 days prior to the start of each calendar year. His participation is permitted only under the terms outlined in the FWPP, which, among other things, limits his individual participation to a maximum working interest of 2.5% in a well and prohibits participation in situations where Chesapeakes working interest would be reduced below 12.5% as a result of his participation. In addition, the company is reimbursed for costs associated with leasehold acquired by Mr. McClendon as a result of his well participation. On December 31, 2008, we entered into a new five year employment agreement with Mr. McClendon that contained a one time well cost incentive award to him. The total cost of the award to Chesapeake was $75 million plus employment taxes in the amount of approximately $1 million. We will recognize the incentive award as general and administrative expense over the five year vesting period for the clawback described below, resulting in an expense of approximately $15 million per year that began in 2009. In addition to state and federal income tax withholding, similar employment taxes were imposed on Mr. McClendon and withheld from the award. The net incentive award of approximately $44 million was fully applied against costs attributable to interests in company wells acquired by Mr. McClendon or his affiliates under the FWPP in 2009. The incentive award is subject to a clawback if during the initial five year term of the employment agreement, Mr. McClendon resigns from the company or is terminated for cause by the company. As disclosed in Note 17, in 2007, Chesapeake had revenues of $1.1 billion from natural gas and oil sales to Eagle Energy Partners I, L.P., a former affiliated entity. We sold our 33% limited partnership interest in Eagle Energy in June 2007. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In June 2009, the FASB issued amendments to the consolidation standard applicable to variable interest entities in response to concerns about the transparency of involvement with variable interest entities. The amended standard is effective for calendar year companies beginning on January 1, 2010. Beginning January 1, 2010, we will deconsolidate our joint venture with GIP and account for the investment in the joint venture under the equity method going forward. Adoption of this guidance will result in a cumulative effect adjustment for the difference in our equity in the joint venture at January 1, 2010, which was originally recorded at carryover basis, and the fair value of our equity at the formation of the joint venture based on the then fair value. This cumulative effect adjustment will create a basis difference between our equity investment balance and the underlying equity in the net assets of the joint venture. This difference will be accreted through earnings over the expected useful life of the underlying assets held by the joint venture. In January 2010, the FASB updated its oil and gas estimation and disclosure requirements to align its requirements with the SECs modernized oil and gas reporting rules, which are described above under Application of Critical Accounting Policies. The update amends the definition of proved reserves to use the average of first day of the month prices during the 12 months preceding the end of the reporting period, adds definitions used in estimating and disclosing proved oil and natural gas quantities and expands the disclosures required for equity method investments. The update must be 66 Table of Contents applied prospectively as a change in accounting principle that is inseparable from a change in accounting estimate and is effective for entities with annual reporting periods ending on or after December 31, 2009. See Note 10 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for disclosures regarding our natural gas and oil reserves. Forward Looking Statements This report includes forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward looking statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future events. They include estimates of natural gas and oil reserves, expected natural gas and oil production and future expenses, assumptions regarding future natural gas and oil prices, planned capital expenditures, and anticipated asset acquisitions and sales, as well as statements concerning anticipated cash flow and liquidity, business strategy and other plans and objectives for future operations. Disclosures concerning the fair values of derivative contracts and their estimated contribution to our future results of operations are based upon market information as of a specific date. These market prices are subject to significant volatility. Although we believe the expectations and forecasts reflected in these and other forward looking statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance they will prove to have been correct. They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expected results are described under Risk Factors in Item 1A of this report and include: the volatility of natural gas and oil prices; the limitations our level of indebtedness may have on our financial flexibility; declines in the values of our natural gas and oil properties resulting in ceiling test write downs; the availability of capital on an economic basis, including planned asset monetization transactions, to fund reserve replacement costs; our ability to replace reserves and sustain production; uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of natural gas and oil reserves and projecting future rates of production and the timing of development expenditures; potential differences in our interpretations of new reserve disclosure rules and future SEC guidance; inability to generate profits or achieve targeted results in our development and exploratory drilling and well operations; leasehold terms expiring before production can be established; hedging activities resulting in lower prices realized on natural gas and oil sales and the need to secure hedging liabilities; a reduced ability to borrow or raise additional capital as a result of lower natural gas and oil prices; drilling and operating risks, including potential environmental liabilities; legislation and regulation adversely affecting our industry and our business; general economic conditions negatively impacting us and our business counterparties; transportation capacity constraints and interruptions that could adversely affect our cash flow; and losses possible from pending or future litigation. 67 Table of Contents We caution you not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this report, and we undertake no obligation to update this information. We urge you to carefully review and consider the disclosures made in this report and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission that attempt to advise interested parties of the risks and factors that may affect our business. ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Natural Gas and Oil Hedging Activities Our results of operations and cash flows are impacted by changes in market prices for natural gas and oil. To mitigate a portion of the exposure to adverse market changes, we have entered into various derivative instruments. These instruments allow us to predict with greater certainty the effective natural gas and oil prices to be received for our hedged production. Although derivatives often fail to achieve 100% effectiveness for accounting purposes, we believe our derivative instruments continue to be highly effective in achieving our risk management objectives. Our general strategy for attempting to mitigate exposure to adverse natural gas and oil price changes is to hedge into strengthening natural gas and oil futures markets when prices allow us to generate high cash margins and when we view prices to be in the upper range of our predicted most likely future price range. Information we consider in forming an opinion about future prices includes general economic conditions, industrial output levels and expectations, producer breakeven cost structures, liquefied natural gas import trends, natural gas and oil storage inventory levels, industry decline rates for base production and weather trends. Throughout 2008 and 2009, we restructured many of our trades that included knockout features as commodity prices decreased. The knockouts were typically restructured into straight swaps or collars based on strip prices at the time of the restructure. Additionally, in the latter half of 2009 we took advantage of attractive strip prices in 2012 through 2014 and sold natural gas and oil call options to our counterparties in exchange for 2010 and 2011 natural gas swaps with strike prices above the then current market price. This effectively allowed us to sell out year volatility through call options at terms acceptable to us in exchange for straight natural gas swaps with strike prices well in excess of the then current market price for natural gas. We use a wide range of derivative instruments to achieve our risk management objectives, including swaps, various collar arrangements and options (puts or calls). All of these are described in more detail below. We typically use swaps or collars for a large portion of the natural gas and oil volume we hedge. Swaps are used when the price level is acceptable and collars are used when the downside protection from the bought put is meaningful and the cap on upside from the sold call is at a satisfactory level. We also sell calls, taking advantage of market volatility for a portion of our projected production volumes when the strike price levels and the premiums are attractive to us. Typically, we sell call options when we would be satisfied to sell our production at the price being capped by the call strike or believe it to be more likely than not that the future natural gas or oil price will stay below the call strike price plus the premium we will receive. We determine the volume we may potentially hedge by reviewing the companys estimated future production levels, which are derived from extensive examination of existing producing reserve estimates and estimates of likely production (risked) from new drilling. Production forecasts are updated at least monthly and adjusted if necessary to actual results and activity levels. We do not hedge more volumes than we expect to produce, and if production estimates are lowered for future periods and hedges are already executed for some volume above the new production forecasts, the hedges are reversed. The actual fixed hedge price on our derivative instruments is derived from bidding and the reference NYMEX price, as reflected in current NYMEX trading. The pricing dates of 68 Table of Contents our derivative contracts follow NYMEX futures. All of our derivative instruments are net settled based on the difference between the fixed price payment and the floating price payment, resulting in a net amount due to or from the counterparty. Hedging positions, including swaps and collars, are adjusted in response to changes in prices and market conditions as part of an ongoing dynamic process. We review our hedging positions continuously and if future market conditions change and prices have fallen to levels we believe could jeopardize the effectiveness of a position, we will mitigate such risk by either doing a cash settlement with our counterparty, restructuring the position, or by entering into a new swap that effectively reverses the current position (a counter swap). The factors we consider in closing or restructuring a position before the settlement date are identical to those we reviewed when deciding to enter into the original hedge position. As of December 31, 2009, our natural gas and oil derivative instruments were comprised of the following: Swaps: Chesapeake receives a fixed price and pays a floating market price to the counterparty for the hedged commodity. Collars: These instruments contain a fixed floor price (put) and ceiling price (call). If the market price exceeds the call strike price or falls below the put strike price, Chesapeake receives the fixed price and pays the market price. If the market price is between the put and the call strike price, no payments are due from either party. Three way collars include an additional put option in exchange for a more favorable strike price on the collar. This eliminates the counterpartys downside exposure below the second put option. Call options: Chesapeake sells call options in exchange for a premium from the counterparty. At the time of settlement, if the market price exceeds the fixed price of the call option, Chesapeake pays the counterparty such excess and if the market price settles below the fixed price of the call option, no payment is due from either party. Put options: Chesapeake receives a premium from the counterparty in exchange for the sale of a put option. If the market price falls below the fixed price of the put option, Chesapeake pays the counterparty such shortfall. If the market price settles above the fixed price of the put option, no payment is due from either party. Knockout swaps: Chesapeake receives a fixed price and pays a floating market price. The fixed price received by Chesapeake includes a premium in exchange for the possibility to reduce the counterpartys exposure to zero, in any given month, if the floating market price is lower than certain pre determined knockout prices. Basis protection swaps: These instruments are arrangements that guarantee a price differential to NYMEX for natural gas from a specified delivery point. For non Appalachian Basin basis protection swaps, which typically have negative differentials to NYMEX, Chesapeake receives a payment from the counterparty if the price differential is greater than the stated terms of the contract and pays the counterparty if the price differential is less than the stated terms of the contract. For Appalachian Basin basis protection swaps, which typically have positive differentials to NYMEX, Chesapeake receives a payment from the counterparty if the price differential is less than the stated terms of the contract and pays the counterparty if the price differential is greater than the stated terms of the contract. In accordance with accounting guidance for hedging and derivatives, to the extent that a legal right of set off exists, Chesapeake nets the value of its derivative arrangements with the same counterparty in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Cash settlements of our derivative arrangements are generally classified as operating cash flows unless the derivative contains a significant financing element at contract inception, in which case, all cash settlements are classified as financing cash flows in the accompanying consolidated statement of cash flows. 69 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2009, we had the following open natural gas and oil derivative instruments designed to hedge a portion of our natural gas and oil production for periods after December 31, 2009: Volume Weighted Average Price Cash FlowHedge NetPremiums FairValue Fixed Put Call Differential (bbtu) (per mmbtu) ($ in millions) Natural Gas: Swaps: Q1 2010 63,478 $ 7.59 $ $ $ Yes $ $ 124 Q2 2010 64,781 7.27 Yes 111 Q3 2010 51,972 7.32 Yes 81 Q4 2010 53,212 7.40 Yes 62 2011 22,210 7.99 Yes 36 Other Swaps(a) : Q1 2010 33,890 7.22 No 54 Q2 2010 43,680 7.61 No 59 Q3 2010 44,160 7.69 No 57 Q4 2010 44,160 8.04 No 51 2011 70,510 9.52 No 27 Collars: Q1 2010 29,700 6.24 8.06 Yes 19 Q2 2010 7,280 7.00 8.25 Yes 11 Other Collars(b) : Q1 2010 13,500 4.29/7.05 9.49 No 19 Q2 2010 9,100 4.35/7.07 9.91 No 5 15 Q3 2010 3,680 7.60 11.75 No 4 8 Q4 2010 3,680 7.60 11.75 No 4 7 2011 7,300 7.60 11.50 No 7 13 Knockout Swaps: Q3 2010 7,360 9.79 6.32 No 4 Q4 2010 7,360 9.79 6.31 No 3 2011 23,650 9.86 6.29 No 10 Call Options: Q1 2010 18,585 10.19 No 41 Q2 2010 28,665 10.19 No 41 (1 ) Q3 2010 34,040 10.22 No 43 (3 ) Q4 2010 34,040 10.30 No 43 (6 ) 2011 20,987 10.73 No 42 (4 ) 2012 262,605 8.46 No 16 (150 ) 2013 2020 597,828 9.10 No 102 (377 ) Put Options: Q3 2010 (16,560 ) 5.73 No 6 (12 ) Q4 2010 (16,560 ) 5.73 No 6 (12 ) 2011 (36,500 ) 5.75 No 25 (26 ) Basis Protection Swaps (Non Appalachian Basin): 2011 45,090 (0.82 ) No (3 ) (22 ) 2012 2018 57,961 (0.90 ) No (3 ) (29 ) Basis Protection Swaps (Appalachian Basin): Q1 2010 2,293 0.27 No Q2 2010 2,513 0.27 No Q3 2010 2,660 0.26 No Q4 2010 2,732 0.26 No 2011 12,086 0.25 No 1 2012 2022 134 0.11 No Total Natural Gas 379 130 70 Table of Contents Volume Weighted Average Price Cash FlowHedge NetPremiums FairValue Fixed Put Call Differential (mbbls) (per bbl) ($ in millions) Oil: Swaps: Q1 2010 450 $ 85.86 $ $ $ Yes $ $ 3 Q2 2010 455 85.86 Yes 2 Q3 2010 460 85.86 Yes 1 Q4 2010 460 85.86 Yes 1 Other Swaps(c) : Q1 2010 360 91.96 No 4 Q2 2010 364 91.96 No 4 Q3 2010 368 91.96 No 3 Q4 2010 368 91.96 No 3 2011 2,190 91.76 No (18 ) Knock Out Swaps: Q1 2010 1,170 90.25 60.00 No 12 Q2 2010 1,183 90.25 60.00 No 7 Q3 2010 1,196 90.25 60.00 No 3 Q4 2010 1,196 90.25 60.00 No (1 ) 2011 1,095 104.75 60.00 No 7 2012 732 109.50 60.00 No 4 Call Options: Q1 2010 630 105.00 No (1 ) Q2 2010 637 105.00 No (1 ) (1 ) Q3 2010 644 105.00 No (1 ) (2 ) Q4 2010 644 105.00 No (1 ) (3 ) 2011 3,650 105.00 No 16 (25 ) 2012 2014 8,770 99.59 No 16 (113 ) Total Oil 28 (109 ) Total Natural Gas and Oil $ 407 $ 21 (a) Included in Other Swaps are options to extend existing swaps for an additional 12 months.

(b) Included in Other Collars for 2010 are 11,740 bbtu of three way collars which have written put options with weighted average prices of $4.31/mmbtu, which limits the counterpartys exposure. (c) Included in Other Swaps are options to extend existing swaps for an additional 12 months. The volume of such extendables in 2011 is 2,190 mbbl at a weighted average fixed price of $91.76/bbl. We have determined the fair value of our derivative instruments utilizing established index prices, volatility curves and discount factors. These estimates are compared to our counterparty values for reasonableness. Derivative transactions are also subject to the risk that counterparties will be unable to meet their obligations. Such non performance risk is considered in the valuation of our derivative instruments, but to date has not had a material impact on the values of our derivatives. Future risk related to counterparties not being able to meet their obligations has been mitigated under our new secured hedging facility which requires counterparties to post collateral if their obligations to Chesapeake are in excess of defined thresholds. The values we report in our financial statements are as of a point in time and subsequently change as these estimates are revised to reflect actual results, changes in market conditions and other factors. 71 Table of Contents The table below reconciles the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 changes in fair value of our natural gas and oil derivatives. Of the $21 million fair value asset as of December 31, 2009, $686 million relates to contracts maturing in the next 12 months, of which we expect to transfer approximately $202 million (net of income taxes) from accumulated other comprehensive income to net income (loss), and ($665) million relates to contracts maturing after 12 months. All transactions hedged as of December 31, 2009 are expected to mature by December 31, 2022. 2009 2008 2007 ($ in millions) Fair value of contracts outstanding, as of January 1 $ 1,305 $ (369 ) $ 345 Change in fair value of contracts 1,266 1,880 972 Fair value of contracts when entered into (21 ) (569 ) (295 ) Contracts realized or otherwise settled (2,102 ) 9 (1,203 ) Fair value of contracts when closed (427 ) 354 (188 ) Fair value of contracts outstanding, as of December 31 $ 21 $ 1,305 $ (369 ) The change in natural gas and oil prices during the year ended December 31, 2009 increased the value of our derivative assets by $1.3 billion. This gain is recorded in natural gas and oil sales or in accumulated other comprehensive income. We entered into new contracts which had premiums of $21 million, and a liability was recorded. We settled and closed out contracts, reducing our assets by $2.1 billion and $427 million, respectively, and the realized gain is recorded in natural gas and oil sales in the month of related production. Pursuant to accounting guidance for derivatives and hedging, certain derivatives qualify for designation as cash flow hedges. Following these provisions, changes in the fair value of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, to the extent they are effective in offsetting cash flows attributable to the hedged risk, are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings as the physical transactions being hedged occur. Any change in fair value resulting from ineffectiveness is currently recognized in natural gas and oil sales as unrealized gains (losses). Changes in the fair value of non qualifying derivatives that occur prior to their maturity (i.e., temporary fluctuations in value) are reported currently in the consolidated statements of operations as unrealized gains (losses) within natural gas and oil sales. Realized gains (losses) are included in natural gas and oil sales in the month of related production. Chesapeake enters into counter swaps from time to time for the purpose of locking in the value of a swap. Under the counter swap, Chesapeake receives a floating price for the hedged commodity and pays a fixed price to the counterparty. The counter swap is 100% effective in locking in the value of a swap since subsequent changes in the market value of the swap are entirely offset by subsequent changes in the market value of the counter swap. Generally, at the time Chesapeake enters into a counter swap, Chesapeake removes the original swaps designation as a cash flow hedge and classifies the original swap as a non qualifying hedge. The reason for this new designation is that collectively the swap and the counter swap no longer hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows. Instead, the swap and counter swap effectively lock in a specific gain or loss that will be unaffected by subsequent variability in natural gas and oil prices. Any locked in gain or loss is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and reclassified to natural gas and oil sales in the month of related production. 72 Table of Contents The components of natural gas and oil sales for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 are presented below. Years Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 ($ in millions) Natural gas and oil sales $ 3,291 $ 7,069 $ 4,795 Realized gains (losses) on natural gas and oil derivatives 2,346 (8 ) 1,203 Unrealized gains (losses) on non qualifying natural gas and oil derivatives (624 ) 887 (252 ) Unrealized gains (losses) on ineffectiveness of cash flow hedges 36 (90 ) (122 ) Total natural gas and oil sales $ 5,049 $ 7,858 $ 5,624 To mitigate our exposure to the fluctuation in price of diesel fuel which is used in our exploration and development activities, we have entered into diesel swaps from January 2010 to March 2010 for a total of 10.4 million gallons with an average fixed price of $1.58 per gallon. Chesapeake pays the fixed price and receives the floating price. The fair value of these swaps as of December 31, 2009 was an asset of $5 million. Interest Rate Risk The table below presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates. Years of Maturity 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Thereafter Total ($ in millions) Liabilities: Long term debt fixed rate(a) $ $ $ $ 864 $ 600 $ 9,747 $ 11,211 Average interest rate 7.6 % 7.3 % 6.0 % 6.2 % Long term debt variable rate $ $ $ 1,936 $ $ $ $ 1,936 Average interest rate 2.2 % 2.2 % (a) This amount does not include the discount included in long term debt of ($921) million and interest rate derivatives of $69 million. Changes in interest rates affect the amount of interest we earn on our cash, cash equivalents and short term investments and the interest rate we pay on borrowings under our revolving bank credit facilities. All of our other long term indebtedness is fixed rate and, therefore, does not expose us to the risk of fluctuations in earnings or cash flow due to changes in market interest rates. However, changes in interest rates do affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt. Interest Rate Derivatives To mitigate our exposure to volatility in interest rates related to our senior notes and credit facilities, we enter into interest rate derivatives. As of December 31, 2009, our interest rate derivative instruments were comprised of the following types of instruments: Swaps: Chesapeake enters into fixed to floating interest rate swaps (we receive a fixed interest rate and pay a floating market rate) to mitigate our exposure to changes in the fair value of our senior notes. We enter into floating to fixed interest rate swaps (we receive a floating market rate and a pay fixed interest rate) to manage our interest rate exposure related to our bank credit facility borrowings. 73 Table of Contents Collars: These instruments contain a fixed floor rate (floor) and a ceiling rate (cap). If the floating rate is above the cap, we have a net receivable from the counterparty and if the floating rate is below the floor, we have a net payable to the counterparty. If the floating rate is between the floor and the cap, there is no payment due from either party. Collars are used to manage our interest rate exposure related to our bank credit facilities borrowings. Call options: Occasionally we sell call options for a premium when we think it is more likely that the option will expire unexercised. The option allows the counterparty to terminate an open swap at a specific date. Swaptions: Occasionally we sell an option to a counterparty for a premium which allows the counterparty to enter into a swap with us on a specific date. As of December 31, 2009, the following interest rate derivatives were outstanding: NotionalAmount Weighted Average Rate Fair ValueHedge NetPremiums FairValue Fixed Floating(b) ($ in millions) ($ in millions) Fixed to Floating: Swaps Mature 2015 $ 550 9.50 % 1 3 mL plus 657 bp Yes $ $ (11 ) Mature 2013 2020 $ 1,000 7.06 % 3 6 mL plus 417 bp No 9 (61 ) Call Options Expire May 2010 $ 250 6.88 % 3 mL plus 287 bp No 4 (2 ) Swaption Expire June 2010 $ 500 6.88 % 3 mL plus 254 bp No 5 (11 ) Floating to Fixed: Swaps Mature 2010 2012 $ 1,375 3.30 % 1 6 mL No (41 ) Collars(a) Mature 2010 $ 250 4.52 % 6 mL No (6 ) $ 18 $ (132 ) (a) The collars have ceiling and floor fixed interest rates of 5.37% and 4.52%, respectively. (b) Month LIBOR has been abbreviated mL and basis points has been abbreviated bp. In 2009, we closed interest rate derivatives for gains totaling $49 million of which $23 million was recognized in interest expense. The remaining $26 million was from interest rate derivatives designated as fair value hedges which are accounted for as a reduction to our senior notes. The settlement amounts received will be amortized as a reduction to realized interest expense over the remaining term of the related senior notes ranging from four to eleven years. For interest rate derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, changes in fair value are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as assets (liabilities), and the debts carrying value amount is adjusted by the change in the fair value of the debt subsequent to the initiation of the derivative. Changes in the fair value of non qualifying derivatives that occur prior to their maturity (i.e., temporary fluctuations in value) are reported currently in the consolidated statements of operations as unrealized (gains) losses within interest expense. 74 Table of Contents Gains or losses from interest rate derivative transactions are reflected as adjustments to interest expense on the consolidated statements of operations. The components of interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 are presented below. Years Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 ($ in millions) Interest expense on senior notes $ 765 $ 637 $ 538 Interest expense on credit facilities 60 117 113 Capitalized interest (633 ) (585 ) (311 ) Realized (gains) losses on interest rate derivatives (23 ) (6 ) 1 Unrealized (gains) losses on interest rate derivatives (91 ) 85 40 Amortization of loan discount and other 35 23 20 Total interest expense $ 113 $ 271 $ 401 Foreign Currency Derivatives On December 6, 2006, we issued 600 million of 6.25% Euro denominated Senior Notes due 2017. Concurrent with the issuance of the Euro denominated senior notes, we entered into a cross currency swap to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in the euro relative to the dollar over the term of the notes. Under the terms of the cross currency swap, on each semi annual interest payment date, the counterparties pay Chesapeake 19 million and Chesapeake pays the counterparties $30 million, which yields an annual dollar equivalent interest rate of 7.491%. Upon maturity of the notes, the counterparties will pay Chesapeake 600 million and Chesapeake will pay the counterparties $800 million. The terms of the cross currency swap were based on the dollar/euro exchange rate on the issuance date of $1.3325 to 1.00. Through the cross currency swap, we have eliminated any potential variability in Chesapeakes expected cash flows related to changes in foreign exchange rates and therefore the swap qualifies as a cash flow hedge. The fair value of the cross currency swap is recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as an asset of $43 million at December 31, 2009. The euro denominated debt in notes payable has been adjusted to $860 million at December 31, 2009 using an exchange rate of $1.4332 to 1.00. 75 Table of Contents
