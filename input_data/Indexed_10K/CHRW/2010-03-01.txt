We are a global provider of multimodal transportation services and logistics solutions, operating through a network of branch offices in North America, Europe, Asia, South America, Australia, and the Middle East. We do not own the transportation equipment that is used to transport our customers freight. We work with approximately 47,000 transportation companies worldwide, and through those relationships we select and hire the appropriate transportation providers to meet our customers needs. As an integral part of our transportation services, we provide a wide range of value added logistics services, such as supply chain analysis, freight consolidation, core carrier program management, and information reporting. 21 Table of Contents In addition to multimodal transportation services, we also offer fresh produce sourcing and fee based information services. Our Sourcing business is the buying, selling, and marketing of fresh produce. We purchase fresh produce through our network of produce suppliers and sell it to retail grocers and restaurant chains, produce wholesalers and foodservice providers. In many cases, we also arrange the transportation of the produce we sell through our relationships with specialized transportation companies. Those revenues are reported as Transportation revenues. Our Information Services business is our subsidiary, T Chek, which provides a variety of management and business intelligence services to motor carrier companies and to fuel distributors. Those services include funds transfer, fuel management services, payments processing, and permit procurement. Our business model. We are a service company. We act primarily to add value and expertise in the procurement and execution of transportation and logistics, including sourcing of produce products for our customers. Our total revenues represent the total dollar value of services and goods we sell to our customers. Our net revenues are our total revenues less purchased transportation and related services, including contracted motor carrier, rail, ocean, air, and other costs, and the purchase price and services related to the products we source. Our net revenues are the primary indicator of our ability to source, add value, and sell services and products that are provided by third parties, and we consider them to be our primary performance measurement. Accordingly, the discussion of our results of operations below focuses on the changes in our net revenues. We keep our business model as variable as possible to allow us to be flexible and adapt to changing economic and industry conditions. We sell transportation services and produce to our customers with varied pricing arrangements. Some prices are committed to for a period of time, subject to certain terms and conditions, and some prices are set on a spot market basis. We buy most of our transportation capacity and produce on a spot market basis. Because of this our net revenue per transaction tends to increase in times when there is excess supply and decrease in times when demand is strong relative to supply. We also keep our personnel and other operating expenses as variable as possible. Compensation is performance oriented and, for most employees in the branch network, based on the profitability of their individual branch office. In addition, we do not have pre committed targets for headcount. Our personnel decisions are decentralized. Our branch managers determine the appropriate number of employees for their offices, within productivity guidelines, based on their branchs volume of business. This helps keep our personnel expense as variable as possible with the business. Our branch network. Our branch network is a competitive advantage. Building local customer and contract carrier relationships has been an important part of our success, and our worldwide network of offices supports our core strategy of serving customers locally, nationally, and globally. Our branch offices help us penetrate local markets, provide face to face service when needed, and recruit contract carriers. Our branch network also gives us knowledge of local market conditions, which is important in the transportation industry because it is so dynamic and market driven. Our branches work together to complete transactions and collectively meet the needs of our customers. Approximately 32 percent of our truckload shipments are shared transactions between branches. For many of our significant customer relationships, we coordinate our efforts in one branch and rely on multiple branch locations to deliver specific geographic or modal needs. In addition, our methodology of providing services is very similar across all branches. Our North American branches have a common technology platform that they use to match customer needs with supplier capabilities, to collaborate with other branch locations, and to utilize centralized support resources to complete all facets of the transaction. During 2009, we increased the size of our branch network by seven branches, to 235. We opened five new branches, combined two branches with existing branches, and added four branches through acquisition. We are planning limited branch openings during 2010. Because we usually open new offices with only two or three employees, we do not expect them to make a material contribution to our financial results in the first few years of their operation. Our people. Because we are a service company, our continued success is dependent on our ability to continue to hire and retain talented, productive people, and to properly align our headcount and personnel expense with our business. Because of the significant reduction in overall transportation demand in the marketplace, during 2009 some of our branches and corporate functions adjusted their staffing levels to better match our current level of business. Our headcount decreased by 614 employees during 2009. The majority of the headcount decrease occurred in the first quarter of 2009. We believe the personnel adjustments made during the period were appropriate to balance our current shipment volumes and workloads with our staffing levels, while leaving us with sufficient resource flexibility to continue to aggressively sell and pursue market share in all of our services. Branch employees act as a team in their sales efforts, customer service, and operations. A significant portion of our branch employees compensation is performance oriented, based on individual performance and the profitability of their branch. We believe this makes our sales employees more service oriented, focused, and creative. In 2003, we implemented a restricted stock program to better align our key employees with the interests of our shareholders, and to motivate and retain them for the long term. These restricted stock awards vest over a five year period based on the companys earnings growth, and have been awarded annually since 2003. 22 Table of Contents Our customers. In 2009, we worked with more than 35,000 customers, up from approximately 32,000 in 2008. We work with a wide variety of companies, ranging in size from Fortune 100 companies to small family businesses, in many different industries. Our customer base is very diverse. Our top 100 customers represented approximately 35 percent of our total revenues and approximately 30 percent of our net revenues. Our largest customer was approximately seven percent of our total revenues and approximately three percent of our total net revenues. Our contracted carriers. Our contracted carrier base includes motor carriers, railroads (primarily intermodal service providers), air freight, and ocean carriers. In 2009, our carrier base was approximately 47,000, down from approximately 50,000 in 2008. Motor carriers that had fewer than 100 tractors transported approximately 75 percent of our truckload shipments in 2009. In our Transportation business, no single contracted carrier represents more than approximately one percent of our contracted carrier capacity. Our goals. Since we became a publicly traded company in 1997, our long term compounded annual growth target has been 15 percent for net revenues, income from operations, and earnings per share. This goal was based on an analysis of our performance in the previous 20 years, during which our compounded annual growth rate was 15 percent, and also on the size of our markets and available market share. Although there have been periods where we have not achieved these goals, since 1997 we have exceeded this compounded growth goal in all three categories. Our expectation is that over time, we will continue to achieve our long term target of 15 percent growth, but that we will have periods in which we exceed that goal and periods in which we fall short. We expect to reach our long term growth primarily through internal growth but acquisitions that fit our growth criteria and culture may also augment our growth. A prolonged environment of weak demand is the most challenging for us. During 2009, our consolidated total revenues decreased 11.7 percent due primarily to falling transportation rates and volume declines in many of our transportation modes. Transportation rates declined primarily due to a reduction in fuel prices and decreased pricing to our customers. Our pricing, exclusive of fuel, decreased due to a significant decline in overall transportation market demand as a result of the recession. Historically, our net revenue margins have typically expanded and contracted based on fuel prices and the balance between demand and overall supply of capacity. Due to overall economic conditions and the significant decline in overall North American transportation volumes, we did not achieve our long term growth goal of 15 percent during 2009. Our net revenues grew 0.5 percent to $1.4 billion. Our income from operations increased 2.3 percent to $584.8 million and our diluted earnings per share increased 2.4 percent to $2.13. During 2009, our net revenue margins (net revenues as a percentage of total revenues) increased to 18.2 percent in 2009 from 16.0 percent in 2008. Net revenue margins increased largely due to a reduction in fuel prices and a lower cost of capacity. While our volumes increased slightly in 2009, the trends of net revenue margin compression and accelerating volume growth in our North American truckload service during the fourth quarter of 2009 have continued into January, 2010. Our volumes continue to grow; however, our net revenue margin comparisons will continue to be challenging. 2009 COMPARED TO 2008 Total revenues and direct costs. Our consolidated total revenues decreased 11.7 percent in 2009 compared to 2008. Total Transportation revenues declined 16.2 percent to $5.98 billion in 2009 from $7.13 billion in 2008. Total purchased transportation services declined 19.4 percent in 2009 to $4.77 billion from $5.92 billion in 2008. These declines were driven by falling transportation rates, due primarily to a reduction in fuel prices and underlying rates. During 2009, a significant decline in overall transportation market demand due to the economic recession impacted our volumes. Our Sourcing revenue increased 11.2 percent to $1.56 billion in 2009 from $1.40 billion in 2008. Purchased products sourced for resale increased 10.9 percent in 2009 to $1.43 billion from $1.29 billion in 2008. These increases were primarily due to volume growth, including our previously announced acquisition of Rosemont. Our Information Services revenue decreased 9.8 percent to $45.8 million in 2009 from $50.8 million in 2008. The decrease was driven by declines in transactions and declines in some fees that are impacted by fuel prices. Net revenues. Total Transportation net revenues decreased 0.4 percent to $1.208 billion in 2009 from $1.212 billion in 2008. Our Transportation net revenue margin increased to 20.2 percent from 17.0 percent in 2008 largely driven by a decline in fuel prices and a lower cost of capacity. While our different pricing arrangements with customers and contract carriers make it very difficult to measure the precise impact, we believe that fuel costs essentially act as a pass through in our business. Therefore, in times of lower fuel prices, our net revenue margin percentage increases as it did in 2009. While we cannot predict what our net revenue margins will be in the future, during the first half of 2009 our net revenue margins were at the high end of our historical range. 23 Table of Contents Truck net revenues, which consist of truckload and less than truckload (LTL) services, comprise approximately 75 percent of our total net revenues. Our truck net revenues increased 1.0 percent to $1.04 billion in 2009 from $1.03 billion in 2008. Truckload volumes decreased 0.8 percent in 2009, but year over year growth improved as the year progressed. Our truckload rates decreased approximately 16 percent. Excluding the estimated impact of the change in fuel, on average, our truckload rates decreased approximately 5 percent in 2009. Truckload net revenue margin increased in 2009 due to a reduction in fuel prices and lower cost of capacity. Consistent with past periods of falling transportation demand, our cost of capacity fell faster than our customer rates. Excluding the estimated impact of the change in fuel, our cost of truckload capacity decreased approximately 6 percent as carriers lowered their rates. During 2009, our LTL net revenues decreased slightly. The decrease was driven by price declines and lower revenue per transaction, largely offset by an increase in shipment volumes. Prices declined significantly due to the lower cost of fuel and decreased underlying rates. Our revenue per transaction also declined due to lower weight per transaction. Our LTL volumes increased approximately 27 percent compared to 2008. Our LTL net revenue margin in 2009 was relatively consistent with 2008. Our intermodal net revenue decrease of 19.2 percent to $35.2 million from $43.6 million in 2008 was driven largely by price declines and volume decreases. Net revenue margin was relatively consistent with 2008. Our ocean transportation net revenues decreased 12.7 percent to $54.2 million in 2009 due to price and volume declines. Excluding our previously disclosed acquisitions of Transera and Walker, our ocean transportation net revenues would have declined approximately 21 percent. Net revenue margin increased significantly in 2009 compared to 2008. Our air transportation net revenues decrease of 7.7 percent in 2009 was driven by volume declines and price declines. Excluding our previously disclosed acquisitions, our air transportation net revenues would have decreased approximately 15 percent. Other logistics services net revenues consist primarily of custom brokerage fees and transportation management fees. The increase of 8.2 percent to $44.8 million in 2009 was driven primarily by increases in the transportation management business and by the acquisition of ITC, offset partially by a decrease in other customs brokerage activity. Excluding the acquisition of ITC, our other logistics services net revenues increased approximately four percent in 2009. Sourcing net revenues increased 15.2 percent to $128.6 million in 2009. This increase was driven primarily by volume growth and the acquisition of Rosemont. Our net revenue margin increased to 8.3 percent in 2009 from 8.0 percent in 2008. Excluding the acquisition of Rosemont, Sourcing net revenues increased approximately nine percent in 2009. Information Services is comprised entirely of revenue generated by our subsidiary, T Chek. For 2009, Information Systems net revenues declined 9.8 percent to $45.8 million. The decrease was driven by declines in transactions and by declines in some fees that are impacted by fuel prices. Operating expenses. Operating expenses decreased 0.8 percent to $797.1 million in 2009 from $803.4 million in 2008. This was due to a decrease of 0.7 percent in personnel expenses and a decrease of 1.0 percent in other selling, general, and administrative expenses. As a percentage of net revenues, operating expenses decreased to 57.7 percent in 2009 compared to 58.4 percent in 2008. Our compensation plans are designed to keep personnel expenses variable with changes in net revenues and profitability. In addition to our variable compensation plans, our average headcount during 2009 declined approximately three percent over 2008, which contributed to the reduction in personnel expenses of 0.7 percent. Higher health insurance costs and severance pay lessened the expense reduction related to the headcount decline. Our personnel expenses as a percentage of net revenue declined slightly in 2009 to 43.2 percent from 43.8 percent in 2008. In 2009, other selling, general, and administrative expenses decreased 1.0 percent to $199.6 million in 2009 from $201.6 million in 2008. We had increases in some expenses including provisions for doubtful accounts and occupancy. Our occupancy expense increase was due primarily to the completion of our data center in Eden Prairie, Minnesota and the locations we added through acquisition. These increases were offset by reductions in travel, entertainment, and other discretionary expenses. Income from operations. Income from operations increased 2.3 percent to $584.8 million in 2009. Income from operations as a percentage of net revenues increased to 42.3 percent in 2009 from 41.6 percent in 2008. Investment and other income. Investment and other income decreased 66.9 percent to $2.3 million in 2008 compared to $6.8 million in 2008. Our investment income is down significantly compared to 2008 primarily due to the changes in the overall market yields on high quality, short term investments. 24 Table of Contents Provision for income taxes. Our effective income tax rate was 38.5 percent for 2009 and 37.9 percent for 2008. The effective income tax rate for both periods is greater than the statutory federal income tax rate primarily due to state income taxes, net of federal benefit. Net income. Net income increased 0.5 percent to $360.8 million in 2009 from $359.2 million in 2008. Basic net income per share increased 1.4 percent to $2.15. Diluted net income per share increased 2.4 percent to $2.13. 2008 COMPARED TO 2007 Total revenues and direct costs. Our consolidated total revenues for 2008 were $8.58 billion, an increase of 17.3 percent over $7.32 billion in 2007. Total transportation revenues increased 19.4 percent to $7.13 billion from $5.97 billion in 2007. Total purchased transportation services increased 21.4 percent in 2008 to $5.92 billion from $4.87 billion in 2007. These increases were driven by the increased cost of fuel and volume increases in all of our modes of transportation. Our Sourcing revenue increased 7.6 percent to $1.40 billion in 2008 from $1.30 billion in 2007. Purchased products sourced for resale increased 7.3 percent in 2008 to $1.29 billion in 2008 from $1.20 billion in 2007. These increases were primarily due to volume growth. Our Information Services revenue increased 11.5 percent to $50.8 million in 2008 from $45.5 million in 2007. The increase was driven primarily by volume growth and higher fuel prices. Net revenues. Total Transportation net revenues increased 10.4 percent to $1.21 billion in 2008 from $1.10 billion in 2007. Our Transportation net revenue margin, or net revenue as a percentage of total revenues, decreased to 17.0 percent in 2008 from 18.4 percent in 2007 primarily due to the increased cost of fuel and its impact on our truckload business. While our different pricing arrangements with customers and contracted carriers make it very difficult to measure the precise impact, we believe that fuel costs essentially act as a pass through to our business. Therefore, in times of higher fuel prices, our net revenue margin percentage declines. Truck net revenues, which consist of truckload and LTL services, comprised approximately 75 percent of our total net revenues. Our truck net revenues increased 8.5 percent to $1.03 billion in 2008. Truckload volumes increased approximately seven percent in 2008, but deteriorated as the year progressed. Including fuel, our truckload rates increased approximately nine percent; excluding the estimated impact of the change in fuel, underlying linehaul rates increased approximately one percent. Truckload net revenue margins decreased in 2008 due to the higher cost of fuel for most of 2008 compared to 2007. During 2008, our LTL volumes increased approximately 19 percent. Despite weakening demand for trucking services in the marketplace, we were able to capture additional market share and grow our volumes with existing customers and gain new customers. LTL net revenue margins for 2008 were consistent with 2007. Intermodal net revenues increased 12.8 percent to $43.6 million from $38.7 million in 2007, due to an increase in volumes offset partially by a decrease in our net revenue margins. Cross selling with existing customers and new customer growth drove our volume growth. Our ocean transportation net revenues increased 42.6 percent to $62.1 million in 2008. Our growth was driven by an increase in volumes and an increase in our net revenue margins. Our previously disclosed acquisition of Transera on August 1, 2008, contributed approximately 15.3 percent to the overall increase. Our volumes grew due to adding new customers and growth with existing customers. Net revenue margins expanded due to more widely available capacity in the marketplace. Our air transportation net revenues increased 13.0 percent to $35.4 million in 2008. The increase was driven by significant volume increases partially offset by a decline in our net revenue margins. Our acquisition of Transera contributed approximately five percent to the overall increase. Other logistics services net revenues consist primarily of customs brokerage fees and transportation management fees. The increase of 17.5 percent to $41.4 million in 2008 was driven primarily by increases in transportation management business. Sourcing net revenues increased 11.4 percent to $111.6 million in 2008. Our Sourcing business is the buying and selling of fresh fruits and vegetables. For several years, we have actively sought to expand our Sourcing customer base, focusing on large retailers, restaurant chains, and foodservice providers. As a result, we continue to see the long term trend of growth in our integrated relationships and value added products and an expansion of our services, which have resulted in increased volumes and net revenue margins in 2008. For 2008, Information Systems net revenues growth of 11.5 percent to $50.8 million was driven primarily by volume growth in local fleet card services, some of our carrier compliance services, cash advance services, maintenance fees, and merchant services. Higher fuel prices contributed to some of our growth because with certain merchants our fee is based on a percentage of the sale amount. Volumes in our over the road fuel card declined slightly due to the reduction in freight demand in marketplace, resulting in a smaller number of transactions. Operating expenses. Operating expenses increased 9.4 percent to $803.4 million in 2008 from $734.1 million in 2007. This was due to an increase of 6.0 percent in personnel expenses and an increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses 25 Table of Contents of 21.3 percent. As a percentage of net revenues, operating expenses decreased to 58.4 percent in 2008 from 59.0 percent in 2008. Personnel expenses increased 6.0 percent to $601.8 million in 2008 from $568.0 million in 2007. The increase is largely due to growth in our headcount, which increased by over 600 people, or 8.6 percent in 2008. Expenses related to our restricted stock program and various other incentive plans are variable, based on growth in our earnings. Our slower earnings growth in 2008 compared to 2007 resulted in a decrease in expense related to some of these incentive plans. This contributed to our personnel expenses growing slower than our net revenues. Personnel expenses as a percentage of net revenue declined to 43.8 percent in 2008 from 45.7 percent in 2007. Other selling, general, and administrative expenses for 2008 were $201.6 million, an increase of 21.3 percent from $166.1 million in 2007. The increase in our selling, general, and administrative expenses was driven by several expense categories, including provision for doubtful accounts, occupancy, and claims. As a percentage of net revenues, other selling, general, and administrative expenses increased to 14.6 percent in 2008 compared to 13.4 percent in 2007. Our total provision for doubtful accounts was $14.3 million for the year compared to $6.7 million in 2007. Due to economic conditions, we had a higher level of customer specific payment issues and bankruptcies than we typically experience. It is very difficult for us to predict whether other accounts will have issues in the future but believe our reserve for doubtful accounts is appropriate. Our occupancy expense increased faster than our net revenues primarily due to primarily to an increase in office space. Occupancy expense is driven primarily by contractual lease agreements of our branch locations, which are fixed in the short term and therefore difficult to reduce as our net revenue growth slows. Income from operations. Income from operations increased 12.1 percent to $571.6 million for 2008. This increase was primarily driven by the growth in our net revenues. Income from operations as a percentage of net revenues was 41.6 percent and 40.9 percent for 2008 and 2007. Investment and other income. Investment and other income decreased 50.8 percent to $6.8 million in 2008. Our investment yield declined significantly from 2007 to 2008 due to changes in the short term high quality interest rate market. During 2008, nearly all of our investments were in money market funds that generally have a lower yield. During 2007, we were invested in auction rate securities and variable rate demand notes which had a higher investment yield. Provision for income taxes. Our effective income tax rate was 37.9 percent for 2008 and 38.1 percent for 2007. The effective income tax rate for both periods is greater than the statutory federal income tax rate primarily due to state income taxes, net of federal benefit. Net income. Net income increased 10.8 percent to $359.2 million for 2008. Basic net income per share increased 11.6 percent to $2.12. Diluted income per share increased 11.8 percent to $2.08 for 2008. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES We have historically generated substantial cash from operations, which has enabled us to fund our growth while paying cash dividends and repurchasing stock. Cash and cash equivalents totaled $337.3 million and $494.7 million as of December 31, 2009 and 2008. Short and long term available for sale securities, consisting primarily of highly liquid investments, totaled $51.3 million and $2.6 million as of December 31, 2009 and 2008. Working capital at December 31, 2009 and 2008 was $575.5 million and $650.2 million. We prioritize our investments to grow the business, as we require some working capital and a relatively small amount of capital expenditures to grow. We are continually looking for acquisitions to redeploy our cash, but those acquisitions must fit our culture and enhance our growth opportunities. We continue to invest our cash with a focus on principal preservation. Our current interest bearing cash and investments are split primarily between municipal money markets and municipal bonds. Our investment income is down significantly compared to last year due to the changes in the overall market yields of high quality, short term investments. Cash flow from operating activities. We generated $372.6 million, $447.6 million, and $308.4 million of cash flow from operations in 2009, 2008, and 2007. During 2009, our cash flow from operations decreased 16.8 percent compared to a 0.5 percent increase in net income. The primary factor that caused this decrease in 2009 was the increase in our accounts receivables balance of 6.8 percent to $885.5 million in 2009 from $828.9 million in 2008, as a result of increased volumes in late 2009 compared with 2008. Cash used for investing activities. We used $123.9 million of cash in 2009, generated $31.5 million cash in 2008, and used cash of $55.7 million in 2007 for investing activities. Our investing activities consist primarily of cash paid for acquisitions, capital expenditures, and investing in securities. 26 Table of Contents We used cash of $41.1 million, $59.7 million, and $22.2 million for acquisitions in 2009, 2008, and 2007. On June 12, 2009, we acquired Walker; on July 7, 2009, we acquired ITC; and on September 15, 2009, we acquired Rosemont. The amount paid in 2008 included $50.2 million related to the closing of one acquisition and $9.5 million related to earn out payments and holdbacks from prior year acquisitions. The amount paid in 2007 included $9.8 million related to the closing of one acquisition and $12.4 million related to earn out payments and holdbacks from prior year acquisitions. We also used $34.5 million, $23.7 million, and $43.7 million of net capital expenditures in 2009, 2008, and 2007. We spent $13.9 million, $5.6 million, and $21.1 million in 2009, 2008, and 2007 on facilities on our new corporate campus in Eden Prairie, MN. The remaining capital expenditures of $20.6 million, $18.1 million, and $22.6 million in 2009, 2008, and 2007 relate primarily to annual investments in information technology equipment to support our operating systems. In 2009, we used $48.5 million in net purchases and sales/maturities of available for sale securities. During 2008, we exited nearly all of our available for sale securities and invested in cash and cash equivalents which generated $114.1 million of cash from investing activities. Cash used for financing activities. We used $402.1 million, $326.0 million, and $262.1 million of cash flow for financing activities in 2009, 2008, and 2007. This was primarily quarterly dividends and share repurchases. We used $162.9 million, $151.2 million, and $125.2 million to pay cash dividends in 2009, 2008, and 2007, with the increase in 2009 due to a 9 percent increase in our quarterly dividend rate from $0.22 per share in 2008 to $0.24 per share in 2009. We also used $266.9 million, $200.8 million, and $167.3 million on share repurchases in 2009, 2008, and 2007. The increase in 2009 was due to a 37 percent increase in the number of shares repurchased. We are currently purchasing shares under the 2007 authorization of 10,000,000 shares. As of December 31, 2009, there were approximately 1,115,000 shares remaining under the 2007 authorization. During the third quarter of 2009, the C.H. Robinson Board of Directors authorized management to repurchase an additional 10,000,000 shares. These repurchases are expected to take place over multiple years. The number of shares we repurchase, if any, during future periods will vary based on our cash position, potential uses of our cash, and market conditions. We had 3.5 million Euros available under a line of credit at an interest rate of Euribor plus 45 basis points. This discretionary line of credit was closed on November 1, 2009. Assuming no change in our current business plan, management believes that our available cash, together with expected future cash generated from operations, will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated needs for working capital, capital expenditures, and cash dividends in future periods. We also believe we could obtain funds under lines of credit on short notice, if needed. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Our consolidated financial statements include accounts of the company and all majority owned subsidiaries. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions. In certain circumstances, those estimates and assumptions can affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related footnotes. In preparing our financial statements, we have made our best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements, giving due consideration to materiality. We do not believe there is a great likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported related to the accounting policies described below. However, application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and, as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. The following is a brief discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates. Revenue recognition. Total revenues consist of the total dollar value of goods and services purchased from us by customers. Net revenues are total revenues less the direct costs of transportation, products, and handling. We act principally as the service provider for these transactions and recognize revenue as these services are rendered or goods are delivered. At that time, our obligations to the transactions are completed and collection of receivables is reasonably assured. Most transactions in our Transportation and Sourcing businesses are recorded at the gross amount we charge our customers for the service we provide and goods we sell. In these transactions, we are the primary obligor, we have all credit risk, we maintain substantially all risks and rewards, we have discretion to select the supplier, and we have latitude in pricing decisions. Additionally, in our Sourcing business, we take loss of inventory risk during shipment and have general inventory risk. Certain transactions in customs brokerage, transportation management, and all transactions in Information Services are recorded at the net amount we charge our customers for the service we provide because many of the factors stated above are not present. Valuations for accounts receivable. Our allowance for doubtful accounts is calculated based upon the aging of our receivables, our historical experience of uncollectible accounts, and any specific customer collection issues that we have 27 Table of Contents identified. The allowance of $30.7 million as of December 31, 2009 increased compared to the allowance of $29.3 million as of December 31, 2008. We believe that the recorded allowance is sufficient and appropriate based on our customer aging trends, the exposures we have identified, and our historical loss experience. Goodwill. We manage and report our operations as one operating segment. Our branches represent a series of components that are aggregated for the purpose of evaluating goodwill for impairment on an enterprise wide basis. In the case where we have an acquisition that we feel has not yet become integrated into our branch network component, we will evaluate the impairment of any goodwill related to that specific acquisition and its results. The fair value of the enterprise wide reporting unit substantially exceeds the book value; therefore we have determined that there is no indication of goodwill impairment as of December 31, 2009. Stock based compensation. The fair value of each share based payment award is established on the date of grant. For grants of restricted shares and restricted units, the fair value is established based on the market price on the date of the grant, discounted for post vesting holding restrictions. The discounts have varied from 12 to 22 percent and are calculated using the Black Scholes option pricing model. Increased stock price volatility is the primary reason for the changes in the discount. For grants of options, we use the Black Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of share based payment awards. The determination of the fair value of share based awards is affected by our stock price and a number of assumptions, including expected volatility, expected life, risk free interest rate, and expected dividends. DISCLOSURES ABOUT CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL CONTINGENCIES The following table aggregates all contractual commitments and commercial obligations that affect our financial condition and liquidity position as of December 31, 2009: Payments Due by Period (dollars in thousands) 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Thereafter Total Contractual Obligations Operating Leases(1) $ 25,786 $ 21,021 $ 16,531 $ 12,894 $ 9,161 $ 20,837 $ 106,230 Purchase Obligations(2) 6,791 2,619 1,372 10,782 Total $ 32,577 $ 23,640 $ 17,903 $ 12,894 $ 9,161 $ 20,837 $ 117,012 (1) We have certain facilities and equipment under operating leases. (2) Purchase obligations include agreements for services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms. As of December 31, 2009, such obligations include telecommunications services and maintenance contracts. We have no long term debt or capital lease obligations. Long term liabilities consist of noncurrent income taxes payable and the obligation under our non qualified deferred compensation plan. Due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2009, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority. Therefore, $10.5 million of unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion on income taxes. Our obligations for payment of contingent purchase price related to acquisitions have been excluded from the table above as the timing and exact amount of cash payment is uncertain. The obligation under our non qualified deferred compensation plan has also been excluded from the above table as the timing of cash payment is uncertain. We also enter into air and ocean freight and produce purchase contracts which are all short term in nature. These liabilities have been excluded from the table as the amount of any cash payment is uncertain. As of December 31, 2009, we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303 (a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S K. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We had $388.6 million of cash and investments on December 31, 2009, consisting of $337.3 million of cash and cash equivalents and $51.3 million of short and long term available for sale securities. Although these investments are subject to the credit risk of the issuer, we manage our investment portfolio to limit our exposure to any one issuer. Substantially all of the cash equivalents are money market securities from treasury and tax exempt money issuers. All of our available for sale securities are high quality bonds and substantially all are exempt from U.S. federal income taxes. Because of the credit risk criteria of our investment policies and practices, the primary market risks associated with these investments are interest rate and liquidity risks. A hypothetical 100 basis point change in the interest rate would not have a material effect on our earnings. We do not use derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk or to speculate on future changes in interest rates. A rise in interest rates could negatively affect the fair value of our investments. Market risk arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not material due to the size of our international operations. 28 Table of Contents
