We are a global provider of transportation services and logistics solutions, operating through a network of branch offices in North America, Europe, Asia, South America, Australia, and the Middle East. As a third party logistics provider, we cultivate contractual relationships with a wide variety of transportation companies, and utilize those relationships to efficiently and cost effectively transport our customers freight. We 24 Table of Contents have contractual relationships with approximately 53,000 transportation companies, including motor carriers, railroads (primarily intermodal service providers), air freight and ocean carriers. Depending on the needs of our customer and their supply chain requirements, we select and hire the appropriate transportation for each shipment. Our model enables us to be flexible, provide solutions that optimize service for our customers, and minimize our asset utilization risk. In addition to transportation and logistics services, we also offer fresh produce sourcing and fee based payment services. Our Sourcing business is the buying, selling, and marketing of fresh produce. We purchase fresh produce through our network of produce suppliers and sell it to retail grocers and restaurant chains, produce wholesalers and foodservice providers. In some cases, we also arrange the transportation of the produce we sell through our relationships with specialized transportation companies. Those revenues are reported as Transportation revenues. Our Payment Services business is our subsidiary, T Chek, which provides a variety of management and business intelligence services to motor carrier companies and to fuel distributors. Those services include funds transfer, fuel purchasing, and online expense management. Our business model. We are primarily a service company. We add value and expertise in the procurement and execution of transportation and logistics, including sourcing of produce products for our customers. Our total revenues represent the total dollar value of services and goods we sell to our customers. Our net revenues are our total revenues less purchased transportation and related services, including contracted motor carrier, rail, ocean, air, and other costs, and the purchase price and services related to the products we source. Our net revenues are the primary indicator of our ability to source, add value, and sell services and products that are provided by third parties, and we consider them to be our primary performance measurement. Accordingly, the discussion of our results of operations below focuses on the changes in our net revenues. We keep our business model as variable as possible to allow us to be flexible and adapt to changing economic and industry conditions. We sell transportation services and produce to our customers with varied pricing arrangements. Some prices are committed to for a period of time, subject to certain terms and conditions, and some prices are set on a spot market basis. We buy most of our truckload transportation capacity and produce on a spot market basis. Because of this our net revenue per transaction tends to increase in times when there is excess supply and decrease in times when demand is strong relative to supply. We also keep our personnel and other operating expenses as variable as possible. Compensation is performance oriented and, for most employees in the branch network, based on the profitability of their individual branch office. In addition, we do not have pre committed targets for headcount. Our personnel decisions are decentralized. Our branch managers determine the appropriate number of employees for their offices, within productivity guidelines, based on their branchs volume of business. This helps keep our personnel expense as variable as possible with the business. Our branch network. Our branch network is a competitive advantage. Building local customer and contract carrier relationships has been an important part of our success, and our worldwide network of offices supports our core strategy of serving customers locally, nationally, and globally. Our branch offices help us penetrate local markets, provide face to face service when needed, and recruit contract carriers. Our branch network also gives us knowledge of local market conditions, which is important in the transportation industry because it is market driven and very dynamic. Our branches work together to complete transactions and collectively meet the needs of our customers. For large multi location customers, we often coordinate our efforts in one branch and rely on multiple branch locations to deliver specific geographic or modal needs. As an example, approximately 40 percent of our truckload shipments are shared transactions between branches. Our methodology of providing services is very similar across all branches. The majority of our global network operates on a common technology platform that is used to match customer needs with supplier capabilities, to collaborate with other branch locations, and to utilize centralized support resources to complete all facets of the transaction. 25 Table of Contents During 2011, we increased the size of our branch network by four branches, to 235. We are planning limited branch openings during 2012. Because we usually open new offices with only two or three employees, we do not expect them to make a material contribution to our financial results in the first few years of their operation. Our people. Because we are a service company, our continued success is dependent on our ability to continue to hire and retain talented, productive people, and to properly align our headcount and personnel expense with our business. Our headcount grew by 725 employees during 2011. Branch employees act as a team in their sales efforts, customer service, and operations. A significant portion of our branch employees compensation is performance oriented, based on individual performance and the profitability of their branch. We believe this makes our employees more service oriented and focused on driving growth and maximizing office productivity. In 2003, we implemented a restricted equity program to better align our key employees with the interests of our shareholders, and to motivate and retain them for the long term. These restricted equity awards vest over a period of up to five years based on the companys earnings growth, and have been awarded annually since 2003. Our customers. In 2011, we worked with more than 37,000 active customers, up from approximately 36,000 in 2010. We work with a wide variety of companies, ranging in size from Fortune 100 companies to small family businesses, in many different industries. Our customer base is very diverse and unconcentrated. Our top 100 customers represented approximately 34 percent of our total revenues and approximately 30 percent of our net revenues. Our largest customer was 3.6 percent of our total revenues and 2.3 percent of our total net revenues. Our contracted carriers. Our contracted carrier base includes motor carriers, railroads (primarily intermodal service providers), air freight, and ocean carriers. In 2011, our carrier base was approximately 53,000, up from approximately 49,000 in 2010. Motor carriers that had fewer than 100 tractors transported approximately 82 percent of our truckload shipments in 2011. In our Transportation business, no single contracted carrier represents more than approximately two percent of our contracted carrier capacity. Our goals. Since we became a publicly traded company in 1997, our long term compounded annual growth target has been 15 percent for net revenues, income from operations, and earnings per share. Although there have been periods where we have not achieved these goals, over the period since 1997 we have exceeded this compounded growth goal in all three categories. Our expectation is that over time, we will continue to achieve our long term target of 15 percent growth, but that we will have periods in which we exceed that goal and periods in which we fall short. We expect to reach our long term growth primarily through internal growth but acquisitions that fit our growth criteria and culture may also augment our growth. During 2011, our consolidated total revenues increased 11.5 percent due primarily to volume increases in many of our modes of transportation and increasing transportation rates. Transportation rates increased primarily due to a rise in fuel prices and increased pricing to our customers. Our pricing, exclusive of fuel, increased due to an increase in overall transportation market demand. We did not achieve our long term growth goals of 15 percent during 2011. Our net revenues grew 11.2 percent to $1.6 billion. Our income from operations increased 11.2 percent to $692.7 million and our diluted earnings per share increased 12.4 percent to $2.62. During 2011, our net revenue margins (net revenues as a percentage of total revenues) remained consistent at 15.8 percent compared to 2010. 2011 COMPARED TO 2010 Total revenues and direct costs. Our consolidated total revenues increased 11.5 percent in 2011 compared to 2010. Total Transportation revenues increased 15.4 percent to $8.74 billion in 2011 from $7.58 billion in 2010. This increase was driven by higher volumes in many of our transportation modes and increased pricing to our customers, including the impacts of higher fuel costs. Total purchased transportation services increased 15.8 percent in 2011 to $7.30 billion from $6.30 billion in 2010. This increase was due to higher volumes in many of 26 Table of Contents our transportation modes and higher transportation costs, including the impacts of higher fuel costs. Our Sourcing revenue decreased 6.6 percent to $1.54 billion in 2011 from $1.64 billion in 2010. Purchased products sourced for resale decreased 6.4 percent in 2011 to $1.41 billion from $1.50 billion in 2010. These decreases were primarily due to decreased volumes with a large customer that, due to a change in their sourcing strategy, has eliminated some of our business with them. Our Payment Services revenue increased 8.7 percent to $60.3 million in 2011 from $55.5 million in 2010. The increase was primarily due to an increase in in MasterCard&reg; services, and increases in some fees that are impacted by fuel prices. Net revenues. Total Transportation net revenues increased 13.4 percent to $1.44 billion in 2011 from $1.27 billion in 2010. Our Transportation net revenue margin decreased to 16.5 percent in 2011 from 16.8 percent in 2010 largely driven by higher transportation costs and higher fuel costs, partially offset by an increase in transportation pricing to our customers. While our different pricing arrangements with customers and contract carriers make it very difficult to measure the precise impact, we believe that fuel costs essentially act as a pass through in our truckload business. Therefore, in times of higher fuel prices, our net revenue margin percentage decreases as it did in 2011. Truck net revenues, which consist of truckload and less than truckload (LTL) services, comprise approximately 76 percent of our total net revenues. Our truck net revenues increased 14.9 percent to $1.24 billion in 2011 from $1.08 billion in 2010. Truckload volumes increased approximately five percent in 2011. Truckload net revenue margin decreased in 2011 due to an increase in fuel prices and increased cost of capacity, offset partially by increased pricing to our customers. Excluding the estimated impact of the change in fuel, on average, our truckload rates increased approximately five percent in 2011. Our truckload transportation costs increased approximately four percent, excluding the estimated impacts of the change in fuel. During 2011, our LTL net revenues increased approximately 27 percent. The increase was driven primarily by an increase in shipment volumes and increased pricing to our customers. Our LTL volumes increased approximately 15 percent compared to 2010. Our intermodal net revenue increase of 12.7 percent to $41.2 million in 2011 from $36.6 million in 2010 was driven largely by volume and pricing increases, partially offset by lower margins. Our intermodal net revenue margin declined in 2011 compared to 2010 due to higher transportation costs. Our ocean transportation net revenues increased 10.1 percent to $66.9 million in 2011 from $60.8 million in 2010 due primarily to volume increases. We experienced a net revenue margin increase due to decreased cost of capacity. Our air transportation net revenues decrease of 7.0 percent in 2011 was driven by decreased volumes and decreased pricing. Our air net revenue margins decreased in 2011 due to increased cost of capacity, partially offset by increased pricing to our customers. Other logistics services net revenues consist primarily of transportation management fees and custom brokerage fees. The increase of 4.6 percent to $59.9 million in 2011 was driven primarily by increases in the transportation management business. Sourcing net revenues decreased 7.8 percent to $128.4 million in 2011. This decrease was primarily due to decreased volumes with a large customer that, due to a change in their sourcing strategy, has eliminated some of our business with them. Our net revenue margin decreased to 8.4 percent in 2011 from 8.5 percent in 2010. Payment Services is comprised entirely of revenue related to our subsidiary, T Chek. For 2011, Payment Services net revenues increased 8.7 percent to $60.3 million in 2011 from $55.5 million in 2010. The increase was primarily due to an increase in in MasterCard&reg; services, and increases in some fees that are impacted by fuel prices. 27 Table of Contents Operating expenses. Operating expenses increased 11.2 percent to $939.9 million in 2011 from $845.1 million in 2010. This was due to an increase of 10.2 percent in personnel expenses and an increase of 14.4 percent in other selling, general, and administrative expenses. As a percentage of net revenues, operating expenses remained at 57.6 percent in 2011. Our personnel expenses are driven by headcount and earnings growth. In 2011, personnel expenses increased to $696.2 million from $632.1 million in 2010. Our personnel expenses as a percentage of net revenue declined slightly in 2011 to 42.6 percent from 43.1 percent in 2010. In 2011, our average headcount increased approximately 7 percent. Personnel expenses related to our various incentive plans are designed to keep expenses variable with changes in net revenues and profitability. Other selling, general, and administrative expenses increased 14.4 percent to $243.7 million in 2011 from $213.1 million in 2010. The increase in our selling, general, and administrative expenses is primarily related to an increase in claims, travel, temporary services, and depreciation, partially offset by a reduction in the provision for doubtful accounts. Income from operations. Income from operations increased 11.2 percent to $692.7 million in 2011. Income from operations as a percentage of net revenues remained at 42.4 percent in 2011. Investment and other income. Investment and other income increased 58.9 percent to $2.0 million in 2011 compared to $1.2 million in 2010. In 2011, we received a $1.2 million distribution from a previously impaired cost method investment. Provision for income taxes. Our effective income tax rate was 37.9 percent for 2011 and 38.0 percent for 2010. The effective income tax rate for both periods is greater than the statutory federal income tax rate primarily due to state income taxes, net of federal benefit. Net income. Net income increased 11.5 percent to $431.6 million in 2011 from $387.0 million in 2010. Basic net income per share increased 11.9 percent to $2.63. Diluted net income per share increased 12.4 percent to $2.62. 2010 COMPARED TO 2009 Total revenues and direct costs. Our consolidated total revenues increased 22.4 percent in 2010 compared to 2009. Total Transportation revenues increased 26.8 percent to $7.58 billion in 2010 from $5.98 billion in 2009. This increase was driven by higher volumes in all of our transportation modes and increased pricing to our customers, including the impacts of higher fuel costs. Total purchased transportation services increased 32.2 percent in 2010 to $6.30 billion from $4.77 billion in 2009. This increase was due to higher volumes in all of our transportation modes and higher transportation costs, including the impacts of higher fuel costs. Our Sourcing revenue increased 5.7 percent to $1.64 billion in 2010 from $1.56 billion in 2009. Purchased products sourced for resale increased 5.4 percent in 2010 to $1.50 billion from $1.43 billion in 2009. These increases were primarily due to volume growth, including our previously announced acquisition of Rosemont Farms Corporation, Inc. (Rosemont). Our Payment Services revenue increased 21.1 percent to $55.5 million in 2010 from $45.8 million in 2009. The increase was primarily due to an increase in transactions and increases in some fees that are impacted by fuel prices. Net revenues. Total Transportation net revenues increased 5.4 percent to $1.27 billion in 2010 from $1.21 billion in 2009. Our Transportation net revenue margin decreased to 16.8 percent in 2010 from 20.2 percent in 2009 largely driven by higher transportation costs and higher fuel costs, partially offset by an increase in transportation pricing to our customers. While our different pricing arrangements with customers and contract carriers make it very difficult to measure the precise impact, we believe that fuel costs essentially act as a pass through in our truckload business. Therefore, in times of higher fuel prices, our net revenue margin percentage decreases as it did in 2010. 28 Table of Contents Truck net revenues, which consist of truckload and LTL services, comprise approximately 73 percent of our total net revenues. Our truck net revenues increased 3.4 percent to $1.08 billion in 2010 from $1.04 billion in 2009. Truckload volumes increased 15.6 percent in 2010. Truckload net revenue margin decreased in 2010 due to an increase in fuel prices and increased cost of capacity, offset partially by increased pricing to our customers. Excluding the estimated impact of the change in fuel, on average, our truckload rates increased approximately five percent in 2010. Consistent with past periods of rising transportation demand, our cost of capacity rose faster than our customer rates. Excluding the estimated impact of the change in fuel, our cost of truckload capacity increased approximately nine percent. During 2010, our LTL net revenues increased approximately 18 percent. The increase was driven primarily by an increase in shipment volumes, partially offset by increased cost of capacity. Our revenue per transaction decreased slightly. Our LTL volumes increased approximately 22 percent compared to 2009. Our LTL net revenue margin in 2010 was down slightly compared to 2009. Our intermodal net revenue increase of 3.7 percent to $36.6 million in 2010 from $35.2 million in 2009 was driven largely by volume and pricing increases, partially offset by lower margins. Our intermodal net revenue margin declined in 2010 compared to 2009 due to higher transportation costs. Our ocean transportation net revenues increased 12.1 percent to $60.8 million in 2010 from $54.2 million in 2009 due primarily to significant volume increases. We experienced a net revenue margin decline due to increased cost of capacity, which was partially offset by increased pricing to our customers. Excluding our previously disclosed acquisition of Walker Logistics Overseas Ltd. (Walker) on June 12, 2009, our ocean transportation net revenues would have increased approximately nine percent. Our air transportation net revenues increase of 29.6 percent in 2010 was driven by increased volumes. Our air net revenue margins decreased in 2010 due to higher transportation costs, which was partially offset by increased pricing to our customers. Excluding our previously disclosed acquisition of Walker, our air transportation net revenues would have increased approximately 28 percent. Other logistics services net revenues consist primarily of custom brokerage fees and transportation management fees. The increase of 27.8 percent to $57.3 million in 2010 was driven primarily by increases in the transportation management business. Sourcing net revenues increased 8.4 percent to $139.4 million in 2010. This increase was driven primarily by volume growth and the acquisition of Rosemont. Our net revenue margin increased to 8.5 percent in 2010 from 8.3 percent in 2009. Excluding the acquisition of Rosemont, Sourcing net revenues decreased approximately five percent in 2010. Payment Services is comprised entirely of revenue related to our subsidiary, T Chek. For 2010, Payment Systems net revenues increased 21.1 percent to $55.5 million. The increase was driven by increases in transactions and higher fuel prices, as some of our merchant fees are based on a percentage of the total sale amount. Operating expenses. Operating expenses increased 6.0 percent to $845.1 million in 2010 from $797.1 million in 2009. This was due to an increase of 5.8 percent in personnel expenses and an increase of 6.8 percent in other selling, general, and administrative expenses. As a percentage of net revenues, operating expenses decreased to 57.6 percent in 2010 compared to 57.7 percent in 2009. In 2010, our average headcount was nearly flat compared to 2009. Personnel expenses related to our restricted stock program and various other incentive plans are designed to keep expenses variable with changes in net revenues and profitability. The growth in personnel expenses is primarily related to these variable incentive plans. Stock based compensation expense increased 74.2 percent to $37.0 million in 2010 from $21.3 million in 2009. Our personnel expenses as a percentage of net revenue declined slightly in 2010 to 43.1 percent from 43.2 percent in 2009. 29 Table of Contents In 2010, other selling, general, and administrative expenses increased 6.8 percent to $213.1 million in 2010 from $199.6 million in 2009. The increase in our selling, general, and administrative expenses is primarily related to the acquisitions we completed in 2009. Income from operations. Income from operations increased 6.5 percent to $622.9 million in 2010. Income from operations as a percentage of net revenues increased to 42.4 percent in 2010 from 42.3 percent in 2009. Investment and other income. Investment and other income decreased 44.8 percent to $1.2 million in 2010 compared to $2.3 million in 2009. Our investment income is down compared to 2009 primarily due to the changes in the overall market yields on high quality, short term investments and the decrease in our average investible cash balance throughout 2010 compared to 2009. Provision for income taxes. Our effective income tax rate was 38.0 percent for 2010 and 38.5 percent for 2009. The effective income tax rate for both periods is greater than the statutory federal income tax rate primarily due to state income taxes, net of federal benefit. Net income. Net income increased 7.3 percent to $387.0 million in 2010 from $360.8 million in 2009. Basic net income per share increased 9.3 percent to $2.35. Diluted net income per share increased 9.4 percent to $2.33. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES We have historically generated substantial cash from operations, which has enabled us to fund our growth while paying cash dividends and repurchasing stock. Cash and cash equivalents totaled $373.7 million and $398.6 million as of December 31, 2011 and 2010. As of December 31, 2011, we did not have any available for sale securities. Available for sale securities, consisting primarily of highly liquid investments, totaled $9.3 million as of December 31, 2010. Working capital at December 31, 2011 and 2010 was $734.9 million and $710.2 million. We prioritize our investments to grow the business, as we require some working capital and a relatively small amount of capital expenditures to grow. We are continually looking for acquisitions to redeploy our cash, but those acquisitions must fit our culture and enhance our growth opportunities. We continue to invest our cash with a focus on principal preservation. Our current interest bearing cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of cash holdings and municipal money market funds. Our investment income related to cash and cash equivalents is down compared to last year due to the changes in the overall market yields of high quality, short term investments. Cash flow from operating activities. We generated $429.7 million, $344.8 million, and $372.6 million of cash flow from operations in 2011, 2010, and 2009. During 2011, our cash flow from operations increased 24.6 percent compared to an 11.5 percent increase in net income. Cash used for investing activities. We used $38.3 million of cash in 2011, generated $8.6 million of cash in 2010, and used $123.9 million of cash in 2009 for investing activities. Our investing activities consist primarily of capital expenditures, cash paid for acquisitions, and investing in securities. We used $52.8 million, $28.7 million, and $34.5 million of cash for capital expenditures in 2011, 2010, and 2009. We spent $39.8 million, $28.7 million, and $20.6 million in 2011, 2010, and 2009 primarily for annual investments in information technology equipment to support our operating systems, including the purchase and development of software. These information technology investments are intended to improve efficiencies and help grow the business. In 2011 we also purchased a new corporate aircraft for $7.3 million and 500 intermodal containers for $4.8 million. We spent $13.9 million in 2009 on facilities on our new corporate campus in Eden Prairie, MN. We anticipate capital expenditures in 2012 to be approximately $40 million to $45 million. 30 Table of Contents We used cash of $41.1 million for acquisitions in 2009. On June 12, 2009, we acquired Walker; on July 7, 2009, we acquired ITC; and on September 15, 2009, we acquired Rosemont. In 2011, we exited the remaining available for sale securities which generated $9.3 million of cash from investing activities. During 2010, we exited nearly all of our available for sale securities and invested in cash and cash equivalents which generated $42.4 million of cash from investing activities. In 2009, we used $48.5 million in net purchases and sales/maturities of available for sale securities. Cash used for financing activities. We used $415.1 million, $289.1 million, and $402.1 million of cash flow for financing activities in 2011, 2010, and 2009. This was primarily quarterly dividends and share repurchases. We used $194.7 million, $168.9 million, and $162.9 million to pay cash dividends in 2011, 2010, and 2009. The increase in 2011 was due to a 16 percent increase in our quarterly dividend rate to $0.29 per share from $0.25 per share in 2010. We also used $240.9 million, $151.1 million, and $266.9 million on share repurchases in 2011, 2010, and 2009. The increase in 2011 was due primarily to a 41 percent increase from the number of shares repurchased in 2010. The decrease in 2010 was due to a 51 percent decrease from the number of shares repurchased in 2009. We are currently purchasing shares under the 2009 authorization of 10,000,000 shares. As of December 31, 2011, there were 5,064,998 shares remaining under this authorization. The number of shares we repurchase, if any, during future periods will vary based on our cash position, potential uses of our cash, and market conditions. Assuming no change in our current business plan, management believes that our available cash, together with expected future cash generated from operations, will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated needs for working capital, capital expenditures, and cash dividends in future periods. We also believe we could obtain funds under lines of credit on short notice, if needed. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Our consolidated financial statements include accounts of the company and all majority owned subsidiaries. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions. In certain circumstances, those estimates and assumptions can affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related footnotes. In preparing our financial statements, we have made our best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements, giving due consideration to materiality. We do not believe there is a great likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported related to the accounting policies described below. However, application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and, as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. The following is a brief discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates. Revenue recognition. Total revenues consist of the total dollar value of goods and services purchased from us by customers. Net revenues are total revenues less the direct costs of transportation, products, and handling. We act principally as the service provider for these transactions and recognize revenue as these services are rendered or goods are delivered. At that time, our obligations to the transactions are completed and collection of receivables is reasonably assured. Most transactions in our Transportation and Sourcing businesses are recorded at the gross amount we charge our customers for the service we provide and goods we sell. In these transactions, we are the primary obligor, we have credit risk, we have discretion to select the supplier, and we have latitude in pricing decisions. 31 Table of Contents Additionally, in our Sourcing business, we take loss of inventory risk during shipment and have general inventory risk. Certain transactions in customs brokerage, transportation management, and all transactions in Payment Services are recorded at the net amount we charge our customers for the service we provide because many of the factors stated above are not present. Valuations for accounts receivable. Our allowance for doubtful accounts is calculated based upon the aging of our receivables, our historical experience of uncollectible accounts, and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified. The allowance of $31.3 million as of December 31, 2011 increased compared to the allowance of $30.9 million as of December 31, 2010. We believe that the recorded allowance is sufficient and appropriate based on our customer aging trends, the exposures we have identified, and our historical loss experience. Goodwill. We manage and report our operations as one operating segment. Our branches represent a series of components that are aggregated for the purpose of evaluating goodwill for impairment on an enterprise wide basis. In the case where we have an acquisition that we feel has not yet become integrated into our branch network component, we will evaluate the impairment of any goodwill related to that specific acquisition and its results. The fair value of the enterprise wide reporting unit substantially exceeds the book value; therefore we have determined that there is no indication of goodwill impairment as of December 31, 2011. Stock based compensation. The fair value of each share based payment award is established on the date of grant. For grants of restricted shares and restricted units, the fair value is established based on the market price on the date of the grant, discounted for post vesting holding restrictions. The discounts have varied from 12 percent to 22 percent and are calculated using the Black Scholes option pricing model. Changes in the measured stock price volatility and interest rates are the primary reason for changes in the discount. For grants of options, we use the Black Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of share based payment awards. The determination of the fair value of share based awards is affected by our stock price and a number of assumptions, including expected volatility, expected life, risk free interest rate, and expected dividends. DISCLOSURES ABOUT CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL CONTINGENCIES The following table aggregates all contractual commitments and commercial obligations, due by period, that affect our financial condition and liquidity position as of December 31, 2011 (dollars in thousands): 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Thereafter Total Contractual Obligations Operating Leases(1) $ 31,787 $ 28,755 $ 25,400 $ 20,222 $ 15,470 $ 20,913 $ 142,547 Purchase Obligations(2) 23,512 12,422 1,035 36,969 Total $ 55,299 $ 41,177 $ 26,435 $ 20,222 $ 15,470 $ 20,913 $ 179,516 (1) We have certain facilities and equipment under operating leases. (2) Purchase obligations include agreements for services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms. As of December 31, 2011, such obligations include ocean and air freight capacity, telecommunications services, maintenance contracts, and commodities seeds used in our Sourcing business. We have no long term debt or capital lease obligations. Long term liabilities consist of noncurrent income taxes payable, contingent purchase price related to acquisitions, and the obligation under our non qualified deferred compensation plan. Due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2011, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority. Therefore, $10.5 million of unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion on income taxes. Our obligations for payment of contingent purchase price 32 Table of Contents related to acquisitions have been excluded from the table above as the timing and exact amount of cash payment is uncertain. Therefore, $13.1 million of contingent purchase price related to acquisitions have been excluded from the table above. The obligation under our non qualified deferred compensation plan has also been excluded from the above table as the timing of cash payment is uncertain. As of December 31, 2011, we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303 (a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S K. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We had $373.7 million of cash and investments on December 31, 2011, consisting entirely of cash and cash equivalents. Although these investments are subject to the credit risk of the issuer, we manage our investment portfolio to limit our exposure to any one issuer. Substantially all of the cash equivalents are money market securities from treasury and tax exempt money issuers. Because of the credit risk criteria of our investment policies and practices, the primary market risks associated with these investments are interest rate and liquidity risks. A hypothetical 100 basis point change in the interest rate would not have a material effect on our earnings. We do not use derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk or to speculate on future changes in interest rates. A rise in interest rates could negatively affect the fair value of our investments. Market risk arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not material due to the size of our international operations. 33 Table of Contents
