ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Results of Operations 2001 2000 1999 Worldwide Net Sales by Business Segment and Geographic Region Oral, Personal and Household Care North America/(1)/........................................ $2,390.2 $2,310.0 $2,143.7 Latin America............................................. 2,443.3 2,507.5 2,356.7 Europe.................................................... 1,902.1 1,890.1 2,028.8 Asia/Africa............................................... 1,512.9 1,532.0 1,519.7 Total Oral, Personal and Household Care...................... 8,248.5 8,239.6 8,048.9 Total Pet Nutrition/(2)/..................................... 1,179.3 1,118.3 1,069.3 Total Net Sales........................................... $9,427.8 $9,357.9 $9,118.2 /(1)/ Net sales in the United States for Oral, Personal and Household Care were $2,097.9, $2,025.7 and $1,880.8 in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. /(2)/ Net sales in the United States for Pet Nutrition were $790.2, $736.0 and $709.2 in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Net Sales and Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT) Worldwide net sales increased 1.5%, excluding divestments, to $9,427.8 in 2001 on volume growth of 5.0%. Net sales would have grown 5.5% excluding foreign currency translation. Net sales in the Oral, Personal and Household Care segment increased 1.0%, excluding divestments, on 5.0% volume growth, while net sales and volume in Pet Nutrition increased by 5.5%. In 2000, worldwide net sales increased 2.5% to $9,357.9 on volume growth of 6.0%, reflecting the negative impact of foreign currency translation. EBIT rose from $1,740.5 in 2000 to $1,834.8 in 2001. The 5% increase reflected the Companys strong volume growth and cost control initiatives that were effective in increasing margins. EBIT increased 11% in 2000 to $1,740.5 from $1,566.2 in 1999. Gross Profit Gross profit margin increased to 55.1%, above both the 2000 level of 54.4% and the 1999 level of 53.7%. This favorable trend reflects the Companys financial strategy to improve all aspects of its supply chain through global sourcing and other cost reduction initiatives, as well as its emphasis on higher margin products. 6 (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were 34.6% in 2001, 35.3% in 2000 and 35.7% in 1999. The overall spending as a percentage of sales continued to decline as a result of the Companys ongoing focus on overhead reduction and the effect of translation on local currency costs. Media and Other Advertising Included in selling, general and administrative expenses is media spending of $509.0, $550.9 and $575.6 in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The trend in media spending reflects both lower media pricing and the negative impact of exchange. Total advertising support, including media, promotion and other consumer and trade incentives which reduce reported sales, has increased in each of the years presented. Other Expense, Net Other expense, net, consists principally of amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets, minority interest in earnings of less than 100% owned consolidated subsidiaries, earnings from equity investments, gains on sale of non core product lines, and other miscellaneous gains and losses. Other expense, net, increased in 2001 from $52.3 to $94.5 with $27.0 of the increase resulting from unrealized losses on foreign currency contracts in 2001 of $11.6 as compared with unrealized gains of $15.4 in 2000. These contracts are an economic hedge of certain foreign currency debt but do not qualify for hedge accounting. During 2000, the Company incurred charges of $92.7 ($61.2 aftertax), including a restructuring charge related to the realignment of certain manufacturing operations and the exiting of our business in Nigeria. Also included were gains of $102.0 ($60.9 aftertax) recorded on the sale of real estate and the sale of the Viva detergent brand in Mexico. 2001 2000 1999 Worldwide Earnings by Business Segment and Geographic Region Oral, Personal and Household Care North America............................................ $ 511.6 $ 482.4 $ 413.0 Latin America............................................ 668.2 603.1 535.7 Europe................................................... 342.6 320.0 342.0 Asia/Africa.............................................. 195.9 194.0 166.7 Total Oral, Personal and Household Care..................... 1,718.3 1,599.5 1,457.4 Total Pet Nutrition......................................... 282.1 243.5 219.9 Corporate Overhead and Other................................

(166.1) (173.3) (171.6) Income Before Income Taxes.................................. $1,668.7 $1,567.2 $1,394.6 Segment Results North America North America net sales grew 3.5% to $2,390.2 on volume gains of 4.5%. Volume increases were led by the strength of recently introduced products in all core categories. In the Oral Care category, recently introduced products such as Colgate Total Plus Whitening toothpaste, Colgate 2in1 toothpaste and mouthwash and Colgate Motion battery powered toothbrush contributed to increased volumes and market share. The Personal Care category experienced incremental market share driven by volume gains from recently introduced products such as the Softsoap Fruit Essentials and Softsoap Vitamins with vitamin E shower gels and liquid hand soaps, and the Mennen Speed Stick Power of Nature deodorants. The Household Care category had increased volumes from products such as Palmolive Spring Sensations dishwashing liquid and Suavitel fabric conditioner. In 2000, North America achieved overall sales growth of 8.5%, excluding divestments, to $2,310.0 on volume growth of 7.5%. 7 (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) EBIT in North America grew 6% to $511.6 as a result of volume gains and efficiencies in advertising spending. EBIT in 2000 increased 17% to $482.4. Latin America Net sales in Latin America increased slightly, excluding divestments, to $2,443.3 on 5.0% volume growth offset by foreign currency weaknesses. Mexico, Brazil, Venezuela, Ecuador and Central America achieved the strongest volume gains in the region. Recently launched products including Colgate Herbal, Colgate Fresh Confidence and Colgate Triple Action toothpastes contributed to increased volumes and market share in the Oral Care category throughout the region. Other products contributing to volume gains in the region were Lady Speed Stick Ultra Dry deodorant, Palmolive Naturals and Caprice shampoos, Axion Spring Sensations dishwashing liquid and Suavitel Fresca Primavera fabric conditioner in the Personal and Household Care categories. In 2000, Latin America net sales increased 6.5% to $2,507.5 on 5.5% volume growth. EBIT in Latin America increased 11% to $668.2 as a result of volume gains, higher gross profit margins, continued efforts to contain costs and efficiencies in advertising spending. EBIT in 2000 grew 13% to $603.1. Europe Net sales in Europe increased 1.0%, excluding divestments, to $1,902.1 as unit volume gains of 5.5% were partially offset by the weakened euro. Germany, the United Kingdom, Greece and Russia achieved the strongest volume gains in the region. Recent product launches including Colgate Herbal and Colgate Total Plus Whitening toothpastes and the Colgate Actibrush Bzzz for kids battery powered toothbrush contributed to regional volume growth in the Oral Care category. In the Personal and Household Care categories, new products such as Palmolive Aromatherapy shower gel and bath foam, Palmolive Vitamins shower gel and liquid hand soap and Ajax wipes contributed to increased volumes and market share. In 2000, Europe net sales declined 7.0% to $1,890.1, due primarily to the weakened euro, while volume grew 4.0%. EBIT in Europe increased 7% to $342.6 due to volume gains and higher gross profit margins. EBIT in 2000 declined 6% to $320.0 as a result of foreign currency weakness. Asia/Africa Net sales in Asia/Africa decreased 1.0% to $1,512.9 as volume gains of 6.0% were offset by foreign currency weakness. China, Australia, Malaysia, Thailand and South Africa achieved the strongest volume gains in the region. Recent product launches including Colgate Fresh Confidence, Colgate Herbal and Colgate Triple Action toothpastes contributed to volume gains in the Oral Care category. In the Personal and Household Care categories, recently introduced products such as the Palmolive Fruit Essentials line of bar soap, liquid hand soap and shower gels, Axion Orange Fantasy dishwashing paste and Softlan fabric conditioner helped to drive volume growth in the region. In 2000, net sales in Asia/Africa increased 1.5%, excluding divestments, to $1,532.0 as volume increased 7.5%. EBIT grew 1% in Asia/Africa to $195.9 driven by increased volumes and higher gross profit margins. EBIT in 2000 grew 16% to $194.0. Pet Nutrition Net sales for Hills Pet Nutrition increased 5.5% to $1,179.3 on 5.5% volume growth. North American sales increased due to the introduction of innovative new products including Science Diet Canine and Feline Oral Care, Science Diet Canine Small Bites and Prescription Diet Canine b/d, a clinically proven product that reduces the effects of canine brain aging. Hills also experienced strong volume growth in Europe, South Pacific and Latin America driven by new products such as Science Diet Canine and Feline Oral Care and Prescription Diet Canine and Feline z/d anti allergy formula. In 2000, net sales for the Pet Nutrition segment increased 4.5% to $1,118.3 on 5.5% volume gains. EBIT in Pet Nutrition grew 16% to $282.1 driven by increased volumes, higher gross profit margins and the continued focus on reducing overhead. EBIT in 2000 increased 11% to $243.5. 8 (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Interest Expense, Net Interest expense, net, was $166.1 compared with $173.3 in 2000 and $171.6 in 1999. The decrease in net interest expense in 2001 reflected lower interest rates partially offset by increased average debt levels related to share repurchases during the year. Income Taxes The effective tax rate on income was 31.3% in 2001 versus 32.1% in 2000 and 32.8% in 1999. Global tax planning strategies, including the realization of foreign tax credits and incentives, benefited the effective tax rate in all three years presented. Net Income Net income was $1,146.6 in 2001 or $1.89 per share on a diluted basis compared with $1,063.8 in 2000 or $1.70 per share and $937.3 in 1999 or $1.47 per share. 2001 2000 1999 Identifiable Assets Oral, Personal and Household Care North America....................... $2,063.6 $2,122.8 $2,076.5 Latin America....................... 1,979.9 2,091.3 2,151.4 Europe.............................. 1,263.6 1,369.4 1,469.1 Asia/Africa......................... 942.7 1,013.0 1,061.3 Total Oral, Personal and Household Care 6,249.8 6,596.5 6,758.3 Total Pet Nutrition.................... 497.6 478.5 476.1 Total Corporate........................ 237.4 177.3 188.7 Total Identifiable Assets/(1)/......... $6,984.8 $7,252.3 $7,423.1 /(1)/ Long lived assets in the United States, primarily property, plant and equipment and goodwill and other intangibles, represented approximately one third of total long lived assets of $4,667.1, $4,813.3 and $4,952.3 in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. 9 (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Liquidity and Capital Resources Net cash provided by operations increased 4% to $1,599.6 compared with $1,536.2 in 2000 and $1,292.7 in 1999. The increase reflects the Companys improved profitability and working capital management partially offset by higher cash taxes. In prior years, cash taxes were reduced by certain tax credits that have been fully utilized. Cash generated from operations was used to fund capital spending, increase dividends and repurchase common shares. 2001 2000 1999 Capital Expenditures North America............................... $ 69.5 $ 91.8 $ 97.6 Latin America............................... 116.6 121.3 118.2 Europe...................................... 33.3 41.7 60.8 Asia/Africa................................. 36.5 45.8 57.0 Total Oral, Personal and Household Care........ 255.9 300.6 333.6 Total Pet Nutrition............................ 37.0 29.2 21.1 Total Corporate................................ 47.3 36.8 18.1 Total Capital Expenditures.............. $340.2 $366.6 $372.8 Depreciation and Amortization North America............................... $101.1 $ 99.3 $ 97.4 Latin America............................... 71.0 74.9 69.0 Europe...................................... 64.9 67.8 75.9 Asia/Africa................................. 47.8 47.0 46.6 Total Oral, Personal and Household Care........ 284.8 289.0 288.9 Total Pet Nutrition............................ 28.1 30.6 32.5 Total Corporate................................ 23.3 18.2 18.8 Total Depreciation and Amortization..... $336.2 $337.8 $340.2 Capital expenditures were 4% of net sales for 2001, 2000 and 1999. Capital spending continues to be focused primarily on projects that yield high aftertax returns. Capital expenditures for 2002 are expected to continue at the current rate of approximately 4% of net sales. Other investing activities in 2001, 2000 and 1999 included strategic acquisitions and divestitures around the world. There were no significant acquisitions in 2001. The aggregate purchase price of all 2000 and 1999 acquisitions was $64.9 and $46.4, respectively. Certain detergent product lines in Central America were sold in 2001, the Mexico Viva detergent brand was sold in 2000 and the U.S. Baby Magic brand was sold in 1999. The aggregate sale price of all 2001, 2000 and 1999 sales of brands was $12.5, $102.5 and $94.7, respectively. During 2001, long term debt increased to $3,137.5 from $2,857.1 and total debt increased to $3,239.1 from $2,978.2 primarily due to increased share repurchases. The Companys long term debt rating was upgraded in 2001 to AA by Standard & Poors and Aa3 by Moodys. As of December 31, 2001 and 2000, $605.8 and $436.1, respectively, of domestic and foreign commercial paper was outstanding. These borrowings carry a Standard & Poors rating of A1+ and a Moodys rating of P1. The commercial paper is classified as long term debt at December 31, 2001, as it is the Companys intent and ability to refinance such obligations on a long term basis. 10 (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) In 1993, the Company formed a financing subsidiary with outside equity investors that purchases the Companys receivables. The Company consolidates this entity, including such receivables, and reports the amounts invested by outside investors as a minority interest. The purpose of this arrangement is to provide the Company access to low cost sources of capital. During 2000 this subsidiary ceased operations resulting in a cash payment of $113.9 to the outside investors. In the fourth quarter of 2001, the subsidiary resumed operations with funding of $89.7 from outside investors. The Company repurchases common shares in open market and private transactions for employee benefit plans and to maintain its targeted capital structure. Aggregate repurchases for 2001 were 21.7 million shares, with a total purchase price of $1,230.2. In 2000, 19.1 million shares were repurchased, with a total purchase price of $1,040.6. Dividend payments were $396.7, up from $382.4 in 2000 and $366.0 in 1999. Common stock dividend payments increased to $.68 per share in 2001 from $.63 per share in 2000 and $.59 per share in 1999. The Series B Preference Stock dividend payments were increased to $5.40 per share in 2001 from $5.04 per share in 2000 and $4.96 in 1999. Internally generated cash flows are adequate to support currently planned business operations, acquisitions and capital expenditures. Free cash flow (defined as cash generated by the business after capital expenditures and dividend payments but before acquisitions, divestitures and share repurchases) was $862.7 and $787.2 in 2001 and 2000, respectively, and provides the Company with flexibility for further investments and or financing. The Company has additional sources of liquidity available in the form of lines of credit maintained with various banks and access to financial markets worldwide. At December 31, 2001, unused lines of credit amounted to $1,370.5 and the Company had $1,351.4 available under a shelf registration filed in 2001. Significant acquisitions would require external financing. The following represents the scheduled maturities of the Companys long term contractual obligations as of December 31, 2001. Payments Due by Period Less than After 5 Total 1 Year 1 3 Years 4 5 Years Years Long term debt including current portion $3,137.5 $ 931.3/(1)/ $ 919.9 $338.2 $ 948.1 Operating leases........................ 407.8 71.9 115.5 94.5 125.9 Unconditional purchase obligations...... 156.4 96.4 33.0 27.0 Total................................ $3,701.7 $1,099.6 $1,068.4 $459.7 $1,074.0 /(1)/ Long term debt due within 1 year includes $605.8 of commercial paper that has been classified as long term debt as of December 31, 2001, as the Company has the intent and ability to refinance such obligations on a long term basis. The Company does not have any off balance sheet financing or unconsolidated special purpose entities. The Companys treasury and risk management policies prohibit the use of leveraged derivatives or derivatives for trading purposes. The valuation of financial instruments that are marked to market are based upon independent third party sources including quoted market prices. The Company is a party to various superfund and other environmental matters and is contingently liable with respect to lawsuits, taxes and other matters arising out of the normal course of business as more fully discussed in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Management proactively reviews and manages its exposure to, and the impact of, environmental matters. While it is possible that the Companys cash flows and results of operations in a particular quarter or year could be affected by the one time impacts of the resolution of 11 (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) such contingencies, it is the opinion of management that the ultimate disposition of these matters, to the extent not previously provided for, will not have a material impact on the Companys financial position or ongoing cash flows and results of operations. Restructuring Reserves In December 2000, the Company recorded a charge of $63.9 ($42.5 aftertax) associated with the realignment of three manufacturing locations in Latin America and the exiting of our business in Nigeria. The charge recorded included $14.2 for termination costs and $49.7 for exiting of manufacturing operations. The restructuring was completed in 2001 with a final payment of $7.2 representing termination costs for 979 employees. Managing Foreign Currency, Interest Rate and Commodity Price Exposure The Company is exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity price fluctuations. The Company manages the volatility relating to these exposures on a consolidated basis by utilizing a number of techniques, including working capital management, selective borrowings in local currencies and entering into certain derivative instrument transactions in accordance with the Companys treasury and risk management policies. The Company operates in over 200 countries and territories and is exposed to currency fluctuation related to manufacturing and selling its products in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The major foreign currency exposures involve the markets in the European Union, Mexico and Brazil, although all regions of the world are subject to foreign currency changes versus the U.S. dollar. The Company actively monitors its foreign currency exposures in these markets and has been able to substantially offset the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements through a combination of cost containment measures, foreign currency hedging activities and selling price increases. The Company primarily utilizes forward exchange and currency swap contracts to hedge portions of its exposures relating to foreign currency purchases and assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business. From time to time, the Company hedges certain of its forecasted foreign currency purchases using foreign currency forward contracts with durations no greater than 18 months. The Company utilizes interest rate swaps and debt issuances to manage its targeted mix of fixed and floating rate debt and to minimize significant fluctuations in earnings and cash flows that may result from interest rate volatility. The Company is exposed to price volatility related to raw materials used in production. The Company uses futures and option contracts on a limited basis to manage volatility related to anticipated raw material inventory purchases. The results of the Companys commodity hedging activity is not material. The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to the financial instrument contracts held by the Company; however, nonperformance by these counterparties is considered remote as it is the Companys policy to contract with diversified counterparties that have a long term debt rating of A or higher. In addition, if all these counterparties did not perform, the Companys risk of credit loss would not be material. Value at Risk The Companys risk management procedures include the monitoring of interest rate and foreign exchange exposures and the Companys offsetting hedge positions utilizing statistical analyses of cash flows, market value, sensitivity analysis and value at risk estimations. However, the use of these techniques to quantify the market risk of such instruments should not be construed as an endorsement of their accuracy or the accuracy of the related assumptions. The Company utilizes a Value at Risk (VAR) model and an Earnings at Risk (EAR) model that are intended to measure the maximum potential loss in its interest rate and foreign exchange financial instruments assuming adverse market conditions occur, given a 95% confidence level. The models utilize a variance/covariance modeling technique. Historical interest rates and foreign exchange rates from the preceding year are used to estimate the volatility and correlation of future rates. 12 (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) The estimated maximum potential one day loss in fair value of interest rate or foreign exchange rate instruments, calculated using the VAR model, is not material to the consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows of the Company. The estimated maximum yearly loss in earnings due to interest rate or foreign exchange rate instruments, calculated utilizing the EAR model, is not material to the Companys results of operations. Actual results in the future may differ materially from these projected results due to actual developments in the global financial markets. For information regarding the Companys accounting policies for financial instruments and a description of financial instrument activities, refer to Note 2 and Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Accounting Changes The Financial Accounting Standards Boards (FASB) Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) recently reached consensus on topics relating to the classification of various types of sales incentives and promotional expenses. The Company will adopt the new accounting requirements effective January 1, 2002. The impact of the new accounting will result in the reclassification of certain sales incentives and promotional expenses from selling, general and administrative expenses to either a reduction of net sales or an increase of cost of sales, but will have no impact on the Companys financial position or net income. Based on historical information, annual net sales as currently reported for 2001 and 2000 will be reduced by approximately 4% with a corresponding reduction in selling, general and administrative expenses. The impact on annual cost of sales as currently reported is not material. In our 2002 Consolidated Financial Statements, all comparative periods will be reclassified to conform to the new requirements. In July 2001, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 141, "Business Combinations" and SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." In addition to requiring the use of the purchase method for all future business combinations, SFAS 141 broadens the criteria for recording intangible assets separate from goodwill. SFAS 142 addresses accounting and reporting standards for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets. Under the new standards, goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets, such as the Companys global brands, are no longer amortized but will be subject to annual impairment tests. Finite life intangible assets such as non compete agreements will continue to be amortized over their useful lives. The Company will adopt these statements effective January 1, 2002. As a result, the Company will cease amortization of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets, which is expected to increase income before income taxes by approximately $50.0 and net income by approximately $40.0. Annual amortization expense related to goodwill and other intangible assets was $68.0, $72.1 and $75.6 for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. During 2002, the Company will perform the required transitional impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets. It is managements preliminary assessment that a transitional impairment charge, if any, will not be material. Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to use judgment and make estimates. The level of uncertainty in estimates and assumptions increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions are completed. As such, the most significant uncertainty in the Companys assumptions and estimates involved in preparing the financial statements include pension and health care cost assumptions and legal and tax contingency reserves. Actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates. In certain instances, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States allow for the selection of alternative accounting methods. The Companys more significant policies where alternative methods are available include the accounting for stock options (refer to Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information) and inventories (LIFO/FIFO). For more information on the Companys accounting policies, refer to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 13 (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Outlook Looking forward into 2002, the Company is well positioned for continued growth in most of its markets. However, the Company operates in a highly competitive global marketplace that is experiencing increased trade concentration. In addition, movements in foreign currency exchange rates can impact future operating results as measured in U.S. dollars. In particular, economic uncertainty in some countries in Latin America and changes in the value of the euro may impact the overall results of Latin America and Europe. The Company expects the continued success of Colgate toothpaste, using patented and proprietary technology, to bolster worldwide Oral Care leadership and expects new products in Oral Care and other categories to add potential for further growth. Overall, subject to global economic conditions, the Company does not expect the 2002 market conditions to be materially different from those experienced in 2001 and the Company expects its positive momentum to continue. Historically, the consumer products industry has been less susceptible to changes in economic growth than many other industries, and therefore the Company constantly evaluates projects that will focus operations on opportunities for enhanced growth potential. Over the long term, Colgates continued focus on its consumer products business and the strength of its global brand names, its broad international presence in both developed and developing markets, and its strong capital base all position the Company to take advantage of growth opportunities and to continue to increase profitability and shareholder value. Cautionary Statement on Forward Looking Statements From time to time, the Company may make statements which constitute or contain "forward looking" information as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 or by the Securities and Exchange Commission in its rules, regulations and releases. Such statements may relate, for example, to sales or volume growth, earnings growth, financial goals, cost reduction plans and new product introductions among other matters. The Company cautions investors that any such forward looking statements made by the Company are not guarantees of future performance and that actual results may differ materially from anticipated results or expectations expressed in the Companys forward looking statements. The following are some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from forward looking statements: (1) Global Economic Conditions. The Company operates on a global basis, with approximately 70% of its net sales coming from operations outside the U.S. The Company is subject to the full range of economic risks, including those associated with international operations, such as economic recession, inflation, access to capital markets and related costs, movements in currency exchange rates and interest rates, trade restrictions, tax law changes, political and legal instability, the imposition of trade restrictions and similar factors beyond the control of the Company. (2) Competition. The Company faces vigorous competition from multinational consumer product companies throughout the world with the same or greater resources than the Company. Such competition is based on pricing of products, promotional activities, advertising, new product introductions, electronic commerce initiatives and other activities of competitors, the timing and scale of which cannot be foreseen by the Company. The Companys ability to compete also depends on the strength of its brands, its ability to attract and retain key talent and its ability to protect its patent, trademark and trade dress rights and to defend against related challenges brought by competitors. (3) Retail Trade. The Company can be negatively affected by changes in the policies of its retail trade customers, such as inventory de stocking, limitations on access to shelf space, electronic data transmission requirements and other conditions. With the growing trend towards retail trade consolidation, especially in developed markets such as the United States and Europe, the Company is increasingly dependent on key retailers, and these retailers have increasingly greater bargaining strength. In addition, private label brands sold by retail trade chains are becoming a source of competition for the Company. 14 (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) (4) Products. The Companys growth depends on the successful development and introduction of new products and line extensions, which face the uncertainty of retail and consumer acceptance and reaction from competitors, as well as the continued success of existing products. In addition, the Companys ability to create new products and line extensions and to sustain existing products is affected by its ability to develop technological innovations, to receive and maintain necessary patent and trademark protection and regulatory approvals and to anticipate successfully consumer needs and preferences. (5) Cost Pressures. The Companys ability to manage its cost structure can be adversely affected by movements in raw material prices and by unanticipated delays or difficulties in achieving cost efficiencies in manufacturing and distribution. In addition, the Companys move to global suppliers, to achieve cost reductions and simplify its business, has resulted in an increasing dependence on key suppliers. (6) Manufacturing. As a company engaged in manufacturing on a global scale, the Company is subject to the risks inherent in such activities, including industrial accidents, environmental events, strikes and other labor disputes, loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites, product quality and safety issues, natural disasters and other external factors over which the Company has no control.
