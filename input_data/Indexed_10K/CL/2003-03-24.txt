ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) The Company manufactures and markets its products in over 200 countries and territories throughout the world in two distinct business segments: Oral, Personal, Household Surface and Fabric Care; and Pet Nutrition. Segment performance is evaluated based on several factors, including operating profit. The Company uses operating profit as a measure of the basic health of the operating segments because it excludes the impact of corporate driven decisions related to interest expense and income taxes. Prior years segment information has been revised for new accounting requirements and certain reclassifications. Net sales were revised for the impact of the new accounting for sales incentives described in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, with no effect on operating profit or net income. As is also described in Note 2, the Company changed its accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets in 2002. In accordance with the new standard, prior periods were not restated. Amounts for certain businesses in the Caribbean, which were previously reported in Latin America, have been reclassified to North America to conform with current year presentation and change in management responsibilities. Results of Operations 2002 2001 2000 Worldwide Net Sales by Business Segment and Geographic Region Oral, Personal, Household Surface and Fabric Care North America(1) $ 2,374.1 $ 2,299.9 $ 2,216.5 Latin America 2,206.8 2,356.0 2,406.6 Europe 1,984.3 1,835.0 1,825.8 Asia/Africa 1,542.0 1,484.3 1,496.6 Total Oral, Personal, Household Surface and Fabric Care 8,107.2 7,975.2 7,945.5 Total Pet Nutrition(2) 1,187.1 1,109.1 1,058.9 Net Sales $ 9,294.3 $ 9,084.3 $ 9,004.4 (1) Net sales in the U.S. for Oral, Personal, Household Surface and Fabric Care were $2,030.4, $1,976.7 and $1,896.7 in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. (2) Net sales in the U.S. for Pet Nutrition were $714.5, $661.5 and $633.9 in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. 7 (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Net Sales Worldwide net sales increased 2.5% to $9,294.3 in 2002 on volume growth of 4.5%. Net sales would have grown 5.0% excluding foreign currency translation. Net sales in the Oral, Personal, Household Surface and Fabric Care segment increased 2.0%, excluding divestitures, on 4.5% volume growth; while net sales in Pet Nutrition increased by 7.0% on 5.5% volume growth. In 2001, worldwide net sales, excluding divestitures, increased 2.0% to $9,084.3 on volume growth of 5.0%, reflecting the negative impact of foreign currency translation. Gross Profit Gross profit margin increased to 54.6%, above both the 2001 level of 53.4% and the 2000 level of 52.7%. This favorable trend reflects the Companys strategy to improve all aspects of its supply chain through global sourcing, regionalization of manufacturing facilities and other cost reduction initiatives, as well as its emphasis on higher margin products. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were 32.6% in 2002, 32.1% in 2001 and 32.8% in 2000. The increase in 2002 was primarily driven by pension and other employee benefit costs that were partially offset by the benefit of ongoing cost savings initiatives. In 2001, the overall spending as a percentage of sales decreased as a result of the Companys ongoing focus on overhead reduction and the effect of translation on local currency costs. Total advertising support behind Colgate brands, including media, promotion and other consumer and trade incentives, some of which reduce reported sales, has increased by 8%, 1% and 3% in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Included in selling, general and administrative expenses is media spending of $486.6, $509.0 and $550.9 in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The trend in media spending reflects lower media pricing, the negative impact of foreign exchange and a slight shift in investment to other forms of total advertising support. Other Expense, Net Other expense, net, consists principally of minority interest in earnings of less than 100% owned consolidated subsidiaries, amortization of intangible assets, earnings from equity investments, gains and losses on interest rate and foreign currency hedge contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting, and other miscellaneous gains and losses. During 2002, other expense, net, decreased from $94.5 to $23.0 resulting from the benefit of the change in accounting for goodwill and intangible assets and changes in the fair value of foreign currency contracts. These contracts are an economic hedge of certain foreign currency debt but do not qualify for hedge accounting. During 2001, other expense, net, increased from $52.3 to $94.5 primarily due to changes in the fair value of foreign currency contracts. During 2000, the Company recorded charges of $92.7 ($61.2 aftertax) in other expense, net, including a restructuring charge related to the realignment of certain manufacturing operations and the exiting of its business in Nigeria. Also included were gains of $102.0 ($60.9 aftertax) recorded on the sale of real estate and the sale of the Viva detergent brand in Mexico. Operating Profit Operating profit rose 10% to $2,013.1 in 2002 from $1,834.8 in 2001, which had reflected a 5% increase from 2000 operating profit of $1,740.5. The continued increase resulted from strong volume growth and cost saving initiatives. If prior year results were adjusted for the impact of the change in accounting for goodwill and intangible assets, operating profit would have been $1,889.1 and $1,800.2 for 2001 and 2000, respectively. Interest Expense, Net Interest expense, net, was $142.8 compared with $166.1 in 2001 and $173.3 in 2000. This decreasing trend is the result of lower interest rates partially offset by increased average debt levels related to share repurchases during the year. 8 (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Income Taxes The effective tax rate on income was 31.1% in 2002 versus 31.3% in 2001 and 32.1% in 2000. If 2001 and 2000 had been adjusted for the impact of the change in accounting for goodwill and intangible assets, the respective tax rates would have been 30.9% and 31.7%. Global tax planning strategies, including the realization of tax credits and incentives, reduced the effective tax rate in all three years presented. Net Income Net income was $1,288.3 in 2002 or $2.19 per share on a diluted basis compared with $1,146.6 in 2001 or $1.89 per share and $1,063.8 in 2000 or $1.70 per share. If results for 2001 and 2000 were adjusted for the impact of the change in accounting for goodwill and intangible assets, net income and diluted earnings per share would have been $1,190.4 and $1.96, respectively, for 2001 and $1,111.6 and $1.77, respectively, for 2000. Segment Results 2002 2001 2000 Worldwide Operating Profit by Business Segment andGeographic Region Oral, Personal, Household Surface and Fabric Care North America $ 578.7 $ 516.6 $ 487.9 Latin America 647.4 663.2 597.6 Europe 409.0 342.6 320.0 Asia/Africa 232.6 195.9 194.0 Total Oral, Personal, Household Surface and Fabric Care 1,867.7 1,718.3 1,599.5 Total Pet Nutrition 318.3 282.1 243.5 Total Corporate (172.9 ) (165.6 ) (102.5 ) Operating Profit $ 2,013.1 $ 1,834.8 $ 1,740.5 North America North America net sales grew 3.0% to $2,374.1 on volume gains of 6.0%. Volume increases were led by the strength of recently introduced products in all core categories. In the Oral Care category, innovative products such as Colgate Simply White at home tooth whitening gel, Colgate Total Plus Whitening toothpaste, Colgate 2 in 1 toothpaste and mouthwash and the Colgate Motion battery powered toothbrush contributed to increased volume and market share. The Personal Care category experienced incremental market share driven by volume gains from recently introduced products such as Softsoap Aromatherapy body wash and liquid hand soap, Irish Spring Vitamins deodorant bar soap and Mennen Speed Stick Power of Nature deodorant. The Household Surface Care category had increased volumes from products such as Palmolive Aromatherapy hand dishwashing liquid. In 2001, North America achieved overall sales growth of 4.0% to $2,299.9 on volume growth of 4.5%. Operating profit in North America grew 12% to $578.7 as a result of volume gains, emphasis on higher margin products, and cost savings initiatives improving gross profit margin. The impact of the discontinuation of amortization of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets in 2002 was largely offset by increased pension and benefit costs. Operating profit in 2001 increased 6% to $516.6, reflecting volume growth and efficiencies in advertising spending. 9 (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Latin America Net sales in Latin America declined 5.5%, excluding divestitures, to $2,206.8 on 2.5% volume growth offset by the negative effect of foreign currency primarily in Venezuela, Argentina and Brazil. The strongest volume gains in the region were achieved in Mexico, Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela and the Dominican Republic. Recently launched products including Colgate Fresh Confidence Xtreme Red Gel, Colgate Total Plus Whitening, Colgate Triple Action, Sorriso Jua + Propolis toothpastes, and Colgate Premier Ultra and Colgate Active Flexible manual toothbrushes contributed to increased volume and market share in the Oral Care category throughout the region. Other products contributing to volume gains in the region were Palmolive Naturals bar soaps, Palmolive Naturals and Caprice hair care lines, Mennen Speed Stick Power of Nature deodorant and Fabuloso Vibrante Naturaleza liquid cleaners in the Personal and Household Surface Care categories. In 2001, Latin America net sales declined 2.0% to $2,356.0 as volume gains of 5.0% were negatively impacted by foreign exchange. Operating profit in Latin America decreased 2% to $647.4 as the negative effect of foreign currency offset volume growth, cost control initiatives, and the discontinuation of amortization of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets in 2002. Operating profit in 2001 increased 11% to $663.2 as a result of volume gains, higher gross profit margins, ongoing cost containment and efficiencies in advertising spending. Europe Net sales in Europe increased 8.0% to $1,984.3 on unit volume gains of 5.0% and the impact of the stronger Euro. The United Kingdom, Russia, Turkey, France and Greece achieved the strongest volume increases in the region. New products including Colgate Total Plus Whitening toothpaste and Colgate 2 in 1 toothpaste and mouthwash contributed to regional volume growth in the Oral Care category. In the Personal, Household Surface and Fabric Care categories, new products such as Palmolive Aromatherapy shower gel, foam bath and liquid hand soap, Palmolive Soft & Gentle deodorant, Soupline Lily of the Valley fabric conditioner and Ajax Wipes contributed to increased volumes and market share. In 2001, Europe net sales increased 1.0%, excluding divestitures, to $1,835.0, on volume growth of 5.5%, partially offset by the weakened Euro. Operating profit in Europe increased 19% to $409.0 as a result of volume growth, gross margin improvement, the impact of the stronger Euro, and the discontinuation of amortization of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets. Operating profit in 2001 increased 7%, excluding divestitures, to $342.6 due to volume gains and higher gross profit margins. Asia/Africa Net sales in Asia/Africa increased 4.0% to $1,542.0 on volume gains of 4.5% offset by the impact of foreign currencies. The Philippines, China, South Africa and Australia achieved the strongest volume gains in the region. New products including Colgate Herbal and Colgate Triple Action toothpastes, and Colgate Active Flexible and Colgate Extra Clean manual toothbrushes contributed to volume gains in the Oral Care category. In the Personal and Household Surface Care categories, recently introduced products such as Protex Herbal antibacterial bar soap and talc, Palmolive Naturals shampoo and Ajax F&ecirc;tes des Fleurs liquid cleaner helped to drive volume growth in the region. In 2001, net sales in Asia/Africa declined 1.0% to $1,484.3 as volume gains of 6.0% were offset by foreign currency weakness. Operating profit grew 19% in Asia/Africa to $232.6 in 2002 and 1% to $195.9 in 2001, driven by volume gains and higher gross profit margins benefiting from regionalization of manufacturing facilities. Pet Nutrition Net sales for Hills Pet Nutrition increased 7.0% to $1,187.1 on 5.5% volume growth. North American sales increased due to the introduction of innovative new products including Science Diet Natures Best, a line of 10 (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) natural cat and dog food. Hills also experienced strong volume growth in Europe, South Pacific and Asia driven by new products such as Prescription Diet Canine b/d, a clinically proven product that reduces the signs of canine brain aging. In 2001, net sales for the Pet Nutrition segment increased 4.5% to $1,109.1 on 5.5% volume gains. Operating profit in Pet Nutrition grew 13% to $318.3 in 2002 and 16% to $282.1 in 2001 as a result of strong volume gains and higher gross profit margins, as well as ongoing cost savings initiatives. Liquidity and Capital Resources Net cash provided by operations increased 7% to $1,611.2 compared with $1,503.9 in 2001 and $1,536.2 in 2000. The increase reflects the Companys improved profitability and working capital management partially offset by higher cash taxes, a portion of which related to a deferral of 2001 taxes into 2002 under a government relief program as a result of the events of September 11, 2001. The decrease in 2001 reflected voluntary contributions to employee benefit plans and higher cash taxes. Cash taxes in 2000 were reduced by certain tax credits that have been fully utilized. Cash generated from operations was used to fund capital spending, pay increased dividends and repurchase common shares. Voluntary contributions to benefit plans made in 2001 were reclassified in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows from investing activities to operating activities consistent with current year presentation. Capital expenditures were 4% of net sales for 2002, 2001 and 2000. Capital spending continues to be focused primarily on projects that yield high aftertax returns. Capital expenditures for 2003 are expected to continue at the current rate of approximately 4% of net sales. In 2000, other investing activities included acquisitions with an aggregate purchase price of $64.9. There were no significant acquisitions in 2002 or 2001. Certain detergent product lines in Central America were sold in 2001 and the Mexico Viva detergent brand was sold in 2000. The aggregate sale price of all 2001 and 2000 sales of brands was $12.5 and $102.5, respectively. There were no significant divestitures in 2002. During 2002, long term debt increased to $3,509.3 from $3,137.5 and total debt increased to $3,603.9 from $3,239.1, primarily due to continued share repurchases and the impact of translating debt denominated in Euros. The Companys long term debt rating was upgraded in 2001 to AA by Standard & Poors and Aa3 by Moodys. Domestic and foreign commercial paper outstanding was $391.4 and $605.8, as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. These borrowings carry a Standard & Poors rating of A1+ and a Moodys rating of P1. The commercial paper and certain current maturities of notes payable are classified as long term debt at December 31, 2002, as the Company has the intent and ability to refinance such obligations on a long term basis. Certain of the Companys financing arrangements require the maintenance of a minimum ratio of operating cash flow to debt. The ESOP notes guaranteed by the Company and certain amounts payable to banks contain cross default provisions. Noncompliance with these requirements could ultimately result in the acceleration of amounts owed. The Company is in full compliance with all such requirements and believes the likelihood of noncompliance is remote. In 1993, the Company formed a financing subsidiary with outside equity investors that purchases some of the Companys receivables. The Company consolidates this entity, including such receivables, and reports the amounts invested by outside investors as a minority interest. The purpose of this arrangement is to provide the Company access to low cost sources of capital. During 2000, this subsidiary ceased operations resulting in a cash payment of $113.9 to the outside investors. In 2001, the subsidiary resumed operations with funding of $89.7 from outside investors. The Company repurchases common shares in the open market and in private transactions for employee benefit plans and to maintain its targeted capital structure. Aggregate repurchases for 2002 were 20.0 million 11 (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) shares, with a total purchase price of $1,082.9. In 2001 and 2000, 21.7 million and 19.1 million shares were repurchased, respectively, with total purchase prices of $1,230.2 and $1,040.6, respectively. Dividend payments were $413.4, up from $396.7 in 2001 and $382.4 in 2000. Common stock dividend payments increased to $.72 per share in 2002 from $.68 per share in 2001 and $.63 per share in 2000. The Series B Preference Stock dividend payments were increased to $5.76 per share in 2002 from $5.40 per share in 2001 and $5.04 in 2000. The Company recently increased the annualized common stock dividend to $.96 per share and the annualized Series B Preference Stock dividend to $7.68 per share effective in the second quarter of 2003. Internally generated cash flows are adequate to support currently planned business operations and capital expenditures. Free cash flow (defined as cash generated by the business after capital expenditures and dividend payments but before acquisitions, divestitures and share repurchases) was $854.1, $767.0 and $787.2 in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, and provides the Company with flexibility for further investments and or financing. The Company has additional sources of liquidity available in the form of lines of credit maintained with various banks and access to financial markets worldwide. At December 31, 2002, the Company had access to unused lines of credit of $2,082.6 and also had $586.8 available under medium term notes. The following represents the scheduled maturities of the Companys long term contractual obligations as of December 31, 2002. Payments Due by Period Total 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 Thereafter Long term debt including current portion $ 3,459.1 $ 1,109.1 (1) $ 308.2 $ 400.4 $ 266.3 $ 247.7 $ 1,127.4 Capitalized leases 50.2 4.9 5.1 5.4 5.6 5.8 23.4 Operating leases 387.6 72.3 62.7 55.8 49.7 48.8 98.3 Unconditional purchaseobligations 108.2 71.5 35.5 1.2 Total $ 4,005.1 $ 1,257.8 $ 411.5 $ 462.8 $ 321.6 $ 302.3 $ 1,249.1 (1) Long term debt due in 2003 includes $815.5 of commercial paper and certain current maturities of notes payable that have been classified as long term debt as of December 31, 2002, as the Company has the intent and ability to refinance such obligations on a long term basis under its unused lines of credit which expire in 2007. The Company does not have off balance sheet financing or unconsolidated special purpose entities. The Companys treasury and risk management policies prohibit the use of leveraged derivatives or derivatives for trading purposes. The valuations of financial instruments that are marked to market are based upon independent third party sources including quoted market prices. As more fully described in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company is party to various superfund and other environmental matters in connection with prior acquisitions. Substantially all of these liabilities have been acknowledged in writing as being covered by investment grade insurance carriers that are presently making all their required payments directly to the cleanup efforts and are expected to do so in the future. The Company is also contingently liable with respect to lawsuits, taxes and other matters arising out of the normal course of business. It is the opinion of management that the ultimate disposition of these matters, to the extent not previously provided for, will not have a material impact on the financial position, results of operations or ongoing cash flows of the Company. 12 (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Restructuring Reserves In December 2000, the Company recorded a charge of $63.9 ($42.5 aftertax) associated with the realignment of three manufacturing locations in Latin America and the exiting of its business in Nigeria. The charge recorded included $14.2 for termination costs and $49.7 for exiting of manufacturing operations. The restructuring was completed in 2001. Managing Foreign Currency, Interest Rate and Commodity Price Exposure The Company is exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity price fluctuations. Volatility relating to these exposures is managed on a consolidated basis by utilizing a number of techniques, including working capital management, selective borrowings in local currencies and entering into certain derivative instrument transactions in accordance with the Companys treasury and risk management policies. The Companys treasury and risk management policies prohibit the use of leveraged derivatives or derivatives for trading purposes. With operations in over 200 countries and territories, the Company is exposed to currency fluctuation related to manufacturing and selling its products in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. The major foreign currency exposures involve the markets in the European Union and certain Latin American countries, although all regions of the world are subject to foreign currency changes versus the U.S. Dollar. The Company actively monitors its foreign currency exposures in these markets and has been able to substantially offset the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements through a combination of cost containment measures, foreign currency hedging activities and selling price increases. The Company primarily utilizes currency forward and swap contracts to hedge portions of its exposures relating to foreign currency purchases and assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business. From time to time, the Company hedges certain of its forecasted foreign currency purchases using forward contracts with durations no greater than 18 months. Interest rate swaps and debt issuances are utilized to manage the Companys targeted mix of fixed and floating rate debt and to minimize significant fluctuations in earnings and cash flows that may result from interest rate volatility. The Company is exposed to price volatility related to raw materials used in production. Futures and option contracts are used on a limited basis to manage volatility related to anticipated raw material inventory purchases. The results of the Companys commodity hedging activities are not material. The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to the financial instrument contracts held by the Company; however, nonperformance by these counterparties is considered remote as it is the Companys policy to contract with diversified counterparties that have a long term debt rating of A or higher. Value at Risk The Companys risk management procedures include the monitoring of interest rate and foreign exchange exposures and hedge positions utilizing statistical analyses of cash flows, market value and sensitivity analysis. However, the use of these techniques to quantify the market risk of such instruments should not be construed as an endorsement of their accuracy or the accuracy of the related assumptions. Market exposures are evaluated using a value at risk (VAR) model and an earnings at risk (EAR) model that are intended to measure the maximum potential loss in interest rate and foreign exchange financial instruments, assuming adverse market conditions occur, given a 95% confidence level. The models utilize a variance/covariance modeling technique. 13 (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Historical interest rates and foreign exchange rates from the preceding year are used to estimate the volatility and correlation of future rates. The estimated maximum potential one day loss in fair value of interest rate or foreign exchange rate instruments, calculated using the VAR model, is not material to the consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows of the Company in 2002 and 2001. The estimated maximum yearly loss in earnings due to interest rate or foreign exchange rate instruments, calculated utilizing the EAR model, is not material to the Companys results of operations in 2002 and 2001. Actual results in the future may differ materially from these projected results due to actual developments in the global financial markets. For information regarding the Companys accounting policies for financial instruments and a description of financial instrument activities, refer to Note 2 and Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Recent Accounting Pronouncements On January 1, 2002, the Company adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Boards (FASB) Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 00 14, Accounting for Certain Sales Incentives, and Issue No. 00 25, Vendor Income Statement Characterization of Consideration Paid to a Reseller of the Vendors Products, that relate to the classification of various types of sales incentives and promotional expenses. The Consolidated Statements of Income for 2001 and 2000 have been revised to reflect the reclassification of certain sales incentives and promotional expenses from selling, general and administrative expenses to a reduction of net sales and cost of sales; however, the revisions had no impact on the Companys financial position, net income or earnings per share. These reclassifications reduced net sales by $343.5 and $353.5 and cost of sales by $2.0 and $8.5 for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively, with an offsetting reduction in each period in selling, general and administrative expenses. On January 1, 2002, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, which eliminates the amortization of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets but requires annual impairment reviews. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, prior period amounts were not restated. A reconciliation of previously reported net income, basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share for 2001 and 2000 to the amounts adjusted to exclude goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets amortization is presented in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements requires management to use judgment and make estimates. The level of uncertainty in estimates and assumptions increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions are completed. Actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates. The accounting policies that are most critical in the preparation of the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements are those that are both important to the portrayal of the Companys financial condition and results of operations and require significant or complex judgments and estimates on the part of management. The Companys critical accounting policies have been reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. In certain instances, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America allow for the selection of alternative accounting methods. The Companys significant policies that involve the selection of alternative methods are accounting for stock options, shipping and handling costs, and inventories. 14 (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Two alternative methods for accounting for stock options are available, the intrinsic value method and the fair value method. The Company uses the intrinsic value method of accounting for stock options, and accordingly, no compensation expense has been recognized. Under the fair value method, the determination of the pro forma amounts involves several assumptions including option life and future volatility. If the fair value method were used, diluted earnings per share for 2002 would decrease approximately 3%. (Refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.) Shipping and handling costs may be reported as either a component of cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses. The Company reports such costs, primarily related to warehousing and outbound freight, in the Consolidated Statements of Income as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses. If such costs were included in cost of sales, gross margin as a percent to sales would decrease from 54.6% to 47.6% in 2002 with no impact on reported earnings. The Company accounts for inventories using both the first in, first out (FIFO) method (80% of inventories) and the last in, first out (LIFO) method (20% of inventories). There would be no impact on reported earnings for 2002, 2001 and 2000 if all inventories were accounted for under the FIFO method. The areas of accounting that involve significant or complex judgments and estimates are pensions and other postretirement benefits, asset impairment, tax valuation allowances, and legal and other contingencies. In pension accounting, the most significant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate and the long term rate of return on plan assets. The discount rate for domestic plans was 6.75%, 7.25% and 7.75% as of December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. As required, the discount rate is based upon published year end rates on high quality bonds. The assumed long term rate of return on plan assets for domestic plans was 8.0%, 9.0% and 9.25% as of December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. This assumption is based on historical experience and long term expectations of asset performance. A 1% change in either the discount rate or the assumed return on plan assets would impact net income by approximately $6. A third less significant assumption is the long term rate of compensation increase, a change in which, would partially offset the impact of a change in either of the above rates. The most judgmental assumption in accounting for other postretirement benefits is the medical cost trend rate. In 2002, the assumed rate was 9% for 2003 and declining 1% per year until reaching the ultimate assumed rate of 5% per year. The effect of a 1% increase in the assumed long term medical cost trend rate would reduce net income by approximately $1.5. Asset impairment analysis is primarily performed for intangible assets and requires several estimates including future cash flows, growth rates and the selection of a discount rate. Since the estimated fair value of the Companys intangible assets substantially exceeds the recorded book value, significant changes in these estimates would have to occur to result in an impairment charge. Tax valuation allowances are established to reduce tax assets, such as tax loss carryforwards, to net realizable value. Factors considered in estimating net realizable value include carryforward periods, income tax strategies and forecasted taxable income. A significant change to the Companys valuation allowances will not materially impact reported earnings. Legal and other contingency reserves are based on managements assessment of the risk of potential loss, which includes consultation with outside legal counsel and advisors. Such assessments are reviewed each period and revised, based on current facts and circumstances, if necessary. It is managements opinion that the ultimate disposition of these matters, to the extent not previously provided for, will not have a material impact on the Companys financial position, results of operations or ongoing cash flows. (Refer to Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Companys contingencies.) The Company generates revenue through the sale of well known consumer products to trade customers under established trading terms. While the recognition of revenue and receivables requires the use of estimates, there is a short time frame (typically less than 60 days) between the shipment of product and cash receipt, thereby reducing the level of uncertainty in these estimates. (Refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further description of the Companys significant accounting policies.) 15 (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Outlook Looking forward into 2003, the Company is well positioned for continued growth in most of its markets. However, the Company operates in a highly competitive global marketplace that is experiencing increased trade concentration. In addition, movements in foreign currency exchange rates can impact future operating results as measured in U.S. Dollars. In particular, economic uncertainty in some countries in Latin America and changes in the value of the Euro may impact the overall results of Latin America and Europe. The Company expects the continued success of Colgate toothpaste, using patented and proprietary technology, to bolster worldwide Oral Care leadership and expects new products in Oral Care and other categories to add potential for further growth. Overall, subject to global economic conditions, the Company does not expect the 2003 market conditions to be materially different from those experienced in 2002 and the Company expects its positive momentum to continue. Historically, the consumer products industry has been less susceptible to changes in economic growth than many other industries. Therefore, the Company constantly evaluates projects that will focus operations on opportunities for enhanced growth potential. Over the long term, Colgates continued focus on its consumer products business and the strength of its global brand names, its broad international presence in both developed and developing markets, and its strong capital base all position the Company to take advantage of growth opportunities and to continue to increase profitability and shareholder value. Cautionary Statement on Forward Looking Statements In this report and from time to time, the Company may make statements that constitute or contain forward looking information as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 or by the Securities and Exchange Commission in its rules, regulations and releases. Such statements may relate, for example, to sales or volume growth, earnings growth, financial goals, cost reduction plans and new product introductions among other matters. The Company cautions investors that any such forward looking statements made by the Company are not guarantees of future performance and that actual results may differ materially from anticipated results or expectations expressed in the Companys forward looking statements. The following are some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from forward looking statements: 1. Global Economic Conditions. The Company operates on a global basis, with approximately 70% of its net sales coming from operations outside the U.S. The Company is subject to the full range of economic risks, including those associated with international operations, such as economic recession, inflation, access to capital markets and related costs, movements in currency exchange rates and interest rates, return on pension assets, trade restrictions, tax law changes, political and legal instability, the imposition of trade restrictions and similar factors beyond the control of the Company. 2. Competition. The Company faces vigorous competition from multinational consumer product companies throughout the world with the same or greater resources than the Company. Such competition is based on pricing of products, promotional activities, advertising, new product introductions, electronic commerce initiatives and other activities of competitors, the timing and scale of which cannot be foreseen by the Company. The Companys ability to compete also depends on the strength of its brands, its ability to attract and retain key talent, and its ability to protect its patent, trademark and trade dress rights and to defend against related challenges brought by competitors. 3. Retail Trade. The Company can be negatively affected by changes in the policies of its retail trade customers, such as inventory de stocking, limitations on access to shelf space, electronic data transmission requirements and other conditions. With the growing trend towards retail trade consolidation, especially in developed markets such as the U.S. and Europe, the Company is increasingly dependent on key retailers, and these retailers have increasingly greater bargaining strength. In addition, private label brands sold by retail trade chains are becoming a source of competition for certain product lines of the Company. 16 (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) 4. Products. The Companys growth depends on the successful development and introduction of new products and line extensions, which face the uncertainty of retail and consumer acceptance and reaction from competitors, as well as the continued success of existing products. In addition, the Companys ability to create new products and line extensions and to sustain existing products is affected by its ability to develop technological innovations, to receive and maintain necessary patent and trademark protection and regulatory approvals, and to anticipate successfully consumer needs and preferences. 5. Cost Pressures. The Companys ability to manage its cost structure can be adversely affected by movements in raw material prices and by unanticipated delays or difficulties in achieving cost efficiencies in manufacturing and distribution. In addition, the Companys move to global suppliers, to achieve cost reductions and simplify its business, has resulted in an increasing dependence on key suppliers. For certain materials, new suppliers may have to be qualified under industry and government standards, which can require additional investment and take some period of time. 6. Manufacturing. As a company engaged in manufacturing on a global scale, the Company is subject to the risks inherent in such activities, including industrial accidents, environmental events, strikes and other labor disputes, loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites, product quality and safety issues, natural disasters and other external factors over which the Company has no control.
