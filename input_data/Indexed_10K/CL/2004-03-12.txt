ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Executive Overview Colgate Palmolive Company seeks to deliver consistent, superior shareholder returns by providing consumers, on a global basis, with products that make their lives healthier and more enjoyable. To this end the Company is tightly focused on two business segments: Oral, Personal, Household Surface and Fabric Care; and Pet Nutrition. Within these segments, the Company follows a closely defined business strategy to develop and increase market leadership positions in key product categories. These core businesses and product categories are selected and prioritized according to their capacity to sustain longer term growth, strong global equities and maximize the use of the organizations core competencies to yield a competitive advantage capable of delivering financial returns above its cost of capital. Operationally, the Company is organized along geographic lines with specific regional management teams having responsibility for the financial results in each area. As a consequence of this geographic diversity the Company competes in more than 200 countries and territories worldwide the organization has a geographic balance which limits exposure to external events in any one country or part of the world. The Oral, Personal, Household Surface and Fabric Care segment is operated through four operating divisions, North America, Latin America, Europe and Asia/Africa, which sell to a variety of retail and wholesale customers and distributors. In the Pet Nutrition segment, Hills also competes on a worldwide basis selling its products principally through the veterinary profession and specialty pet retailers. To achieve its financial objectives, the Company employs a strategy which is used in all businesses worldwide and that focuses the organization on initiatives to both drive growth and simultaneously fund that growth. Growth and therefore revenues are driven by bringing to the marketplace products which offer value to the consumer through new benefits and convenience in the categories where the Company competes. The investments needed to fund this growth are developed through continuous, corporate wide initiatives to lower costs and increase effective asset utilization. The Company also continues to prioritize its investments toward its higher margin businesses, specifically Oral Care, Personal Care and Pet Nutrition. In December 2003, the Company announced that it has agreed to acquire GABA Holding AG (GABA), a privately owned European oral care company headquartered in Switzerland. Also, consistent with the Companys strategy to de emphasize heavy duty detergents, the Company completed the sale of its European laundry detergent brands during 2003. 7 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) The Company sees material opportunities for growth through its ability to identify and meet new consumer needs within the categories in which it competes. This includes deploying the insights and products developed in one region on a global basis. Growth opportunities are especially evident in those areas where the Company can leverage economic development and where rising consumer disposable incomes expand the markets for its products. The organization is, therefore, actively focused on the development of such products using global and local knowledge and consumer insight and has an organization in place to ensure these learnings and product bundles are introduced expeditiously around the world. On an ongoing basis, management focuses on a variety of key indicators to monitor business health and performance. These indicators include measurements of market share, sales (including volume, pricing and foreign exchange components), gross profit margins, operating profits and net income; and measures to optimize the management of working capital, capital expenditures, cash flow and return on capital. For an additional discussion of key factors and risks that could impact future financial results, refer to the information set forth below under the caption Cautionary Statement on Forward Looking Statements. Ultimately, these indicators and other procedures for corporate governance (including the Corporate Code of Conduct) are used to ensure that business health is maintained and effective control exercised. The success of these measures is indicated by the vitality of the business and in its financial strength. The resultant strong and consistent cash flow, evidenced by the companys AA /(Aa3) credit rating, in turn provides flexibility for future investments and growth. Results of Operations The Company markets its products in over 200 countries and territories throughout the world in two distinct business segments: Oral, Personal, Household Surface and Fabric Care; and Pet Nutrition. Segment performance is evaluated based on several factors, including operating profit. The Company uses operating profit as a measure of operating segment performance because it excludes the impact of corporate driven decisions related to interest expense and income taxes. 2003 2002 2001(3) Worldwide Net Sales by Business Segment and Geographic Region Oral, Personal, Household Surface and Fabric Care North America(1) $ 2,356.2 $ 2,374.1 $ 2,299.9 Latin America 2,179.5 2,206.8 2,356.0 Europe 2,304.1 1,984.3 1,835.0 Asia/Africa 1,747.5 1,542.0 1,484.3 Total Oral, Personal, Household Surface and Fabric Care 8,587.3 8,107.2 7,975.2 Total Pet Nutrition(2) 1,316.1 1,187.1 1,109.1 Net Sales $ 9,903.4 $ 9,294.3 $ 9,084.3 (1) Net sales in the U.S. for Oral, Personal, Household Surface and Fabric Care were $1,986.9, $2,030.4 and $1,976.7 in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. (2) Net sales in the U.S. for Pet Nutrition were $752.8, $714.5 and $661.5 in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. (3) Segment information for 2001 has been revised for the following new accounting requirements and certain reclassifications. Net sales were revised for the impact of accounting for sales incentives described in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, with no effect on operating profit or net income. Amounts for certain businesses in the Caribbean, which were previously reported in Latin America, have been reclassified to North America to conform with current year presentation and the change in management responsibilities that occurred in 2002. 8 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Net Sales Worldwide net sales increased 6.5% to $9,903.4 in 2003 on volume growth of 3.5%, increases in net selling prices of 0.5% and a positive foreign exchange impact of 2.5%. Net sales in the Oral, Personal, Household Surface and Fabric Care segment increased 6.0% on 3.5% volume growth while net sales in Pet Nutrition increased 11.0% on 4.5% volume growth. In 2002, worldwide net sales, excluding divestitures, increased 2.5% to $9,294.3 on volume growth of 4.5%, offset by the negative impact of foreign currencies. Gross Profit Gross profit margin increased to 55.0%, above both the 2002 level of 54.6% and the 2001 level of 53.4%. This favorable trend reflects the Companys strategy to improve all aspects of its supply chain through global sourcing, regionalization of manufacturing facilities and other cost reduction initiatives despite an increase in worldwide materials costs in 2003, as well as its focus on its high margin oral and personal care businesses. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were 33.3% in 2003, 32.6% in 2002 and 32.1% in 2001. The increase as a percent of sales in 2003 was driven by increases in advertising of 0.6% and pension and other employee benefit costs of 0.4%, partially offset by savings from cost control initiatives of 0.3%. The 2002 increase was primarily driven by pension and other employee benefit costs that were partially offset by the benefit of ongoing cost savings initiatives. Total advertising support behind the Companys brands, including media, promotion and other consumer and trade incentives, some of which reduce reported net sales, has increased by 13%, 8% and 1% in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Included in selling, general and administrative expenses is media spending of $514.0, $486.6 and $509.0 in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Increased media spending in 2003 supported new product launches and helped increase market shares throughout the world. The decrease in media spending in 2002 reflected lower media pricing, the negative impact of foreign exchange and a slight shift in investment to other forms of total advertising support. Other (Income) Expense, Net During 2003, Other (income) expense, net changed by $38.0, from $23.0 of expense to ($15.0) of income. The primary components driving this change consist of gains of $107.2 ($63.5 aftertax) related to the sale of non core brands partially offset by $59.3 ($39.0 aftertax) of costs related to the regionalization of manufacturing facilities, which combined resulted in a net benefit of $47.9 ($24.5 aftertax). The Company sold various detergent brands marketed in France, Italy and Scandinavia and certain non core soap brands marketed in Europe. In connection with the European brands divestment during 2003 and the Companys ongoing focus on the regionalization of manufacturing facilities to streamline and strengthen its operations, the Company initiated the realignment of certain manufacturing operations and workforce reduction programs primarily in Europe, Latin America and Asia/Africa. For additional information refer to Restructuring Activities below and Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. During 2002, Other (income) expense, net decreased from $94.5 to $23.0 reflecting the benefit from the change in accounting for goodwill and intangible assets and changes in the fair value of foreign currency contracts. These contracts are an economic hedge of certain foreign currency debt but do not qualify for hedge accounting. 9 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) The components of Other (income) expense, net are presented below: 2003 2002 2001 Minority interest $ 45.2 $ 41.3 $ 40.1 Amortization of intangible assets 12.3 12.5 68.0 Equity losses/(income) (.3 ) .6 (.2 ) Gains on sales of non core product lines, net (107.2 ) (10.8 ) Restructuring activities 59.3 Other, net (24.3 ) (31.4 ) (2.6 ) Total other (income) expense, net $ (15.0 ) $ 23.0 $ 94.5 Other, net consists of miscellaneous gains and losses including gains and losses on interest rate and foreign currency hedge contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting. Operating Profit Operating profit rose 8% to $2,166.0 in 2003 from $2,013.1 in 2002, which had reflected a 10% increase from 2001 operating profit of $1,834.8. The continued increase resulted from sales growth, cost saving initiatives as well as the net impact of sales of non core brands and restructuring activities. If 2001 results were adjusted for the impact of the change in accounting for goodwill and intangible assets, operating profit would have been $1,889.1. Interest Expense, Net Interest expense, net was $124.1 in 2003 compared with $142.8 in 2002 and $166.1 in 2001. This decreasing trend is the result of lower interest rates and, in 2003, reduced debt levels. Income Taxes The effective tax rate on income was 30.4% in 2003 versus 31.1% in 2002 and 31.3% in 2001. If 2001 had been adjusted for the impact of the change in accounting for goodwill and intangible assets, the tax rate would have been 30.9%. The effective tax rate was reduced through the realization of tax credits and incentives in all years presented, and as a result of global tax planning strategies including overseas asset revaluations in 2003 and 2001. Net Income Net income was $1,421.3 in 2003 or $2.46 per share on a diluted basis compared with $1,288.3 in 2002 or $2.19 per share and $1,146.6 in 2001 or $1.89 per share. As previously discussed, net income in 2003 includes a net aftertax benefit of $24.5 or $.04 per share resulting from the gain on the sale of certain European detergent brands, offset by restructuring activities. If results for 2001 were adjusted for the impact of the change in accounting for goodwill and intangible assets, net income and diluted earnings per share would have been $1,190.4 and $1.96, respectively. 10 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Segment Results 2003 2002 2001(1) Worldwide Operating Profit by Business Segment and Geographic Region Oral, Personal, Household Surface and Fabric Care North America $ 547.4 $ 578.7 $ 516.6 Latin America 613.3 647.4 663.2 Europe 488.2 409.0 342.6 Asia/Africa 280.7 232.6 195.9 Total Oral, Personal, Household Surface and Fabric Care 1,929.6 1,867.7 1,718.3 Total Pet Nutrition 371.0 318.3 282.1 Total Corporate (134.6 ) (172.9 ) (165.6 ) Operating Profit $ 2,166.0 $ 2,013.1 $ 1,834.8 (1) As is described in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company changed its accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets in 2002 to conform to new accounting requirements. In accordance with the new standard, prior periods were not restated. Amounts for certain businesses in the Caribbean, which were previously reported in Latin America, have been reclassified to North America to conform with current year presentation and change in management responsibilities that occurred in 2002. North America Net sales in North America declined 1.0% to $2,356.2 on volume gains of 0.5%, positive foreign exchange of 1.0% and declines in net selling prices of 2.5%. Lower Colgate Simply White at home tooth whitening gel sales in 2003 were offset by recent introductions such as Colgate Simply White toothpaste, Colgate Total Advanced Fresh toothpaste, Colgate Whitening and Colgate Massager manual toothbrushes, Colgate powered toothbrushes for kids featuring LEGO BIONICLE, and Softsoap Aromatherapy, Softsoap Foamworks and Softsoap Naturals Milk & Honey brand liquid hand soaps, which contributed to volume growth. In 2002, North America achieved overall sales growth of 3.0% to $2,374.1 on volume growth of 6.0%. Operating profit in North America declined 5% to $547.4 due to increased media and promotion costs as well as the decline in sales. Operating profit in 2002 increased 12% to $578.7, as a result of volume gains, emphasis on higher margin products, and cost savings initiatives improving gross profit margin. The impact of the discontinuation of amortization of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets in 2002 was largely offset by increased pension and benefit costs. Latin America Net sales in Latin America declined 1.0% to $2,179.5 on 4.0% volume growth and increases in net selling prices of 7.5%, offset by the negative impact of 12.5% resulting from foreign currency declines primarily in Mexico, Venezuela, the Dominican Republic and Colombia. The strongest volume gains in the region were achieved in Mexico, Venezuela, Ecuador, Colombia, Peru and Chile. New products contributing to volume growth in Oral Care include Colgate Total Plus Whitening and Sorriso Super Refreshing toothpastes, Colgate Simply White at home tooth whitening gel, and Colgate Active Angle, Colgate Extra Clean and Colgate Disney Finding Nemo manual toothbrushes. Driving growth in Personal and Household Surface Care are Palmolive Aromatherapy translucent bar soap, Palmolive Caprice specialty shampoos, and Fabuloso Orange Energy and Ajax Baking Soda and Citrus liquid cleaners. In 2002, Latin America net sales declined 5.5% to $2,206.8 as volume gains of 2.5% were negatively impacted by foreign exchange. 11 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Operating profit in Latin America decreased 5% to $613.3 due to negative foreign currency impact offset by volume growth and cost control initiatives. These factors, offset by the discontinuation of amortization of goodwill and indefinite life intangibles, caused a 2% decrease in operating profit in 2002 to $647.2. Europe Net sales in Europe increased 16.0% to $2,304.1 on volume gains of 3.0% and a 15.5% positive impact of stronger foreign currencies, primarily the euro, offset by a 2.5% decline in net selling prices. The United Kingdom, Russia, Turkey, Ukraine and Scandinavia achieved the strongest volume increases in the region. New products contributing to growth in Oral Care throughout Europe include Colgate Sensitive and Colgate Triple Action toothpastes, and Colgate Massager, Colgate Extra Clean and Colgate Whitening manual toothbrushes. Palmolive Aromatherapy Sensual, Palmolive Thermal and Palmolive Thermal Spa shower gels and bath foams, Lady Speed Stick Aloe deodorant, Palmolive Oxygen dishwashing liquid and Soupline Hearts fabric conditioner tablets drove growth in Personal, Household Surface and Fabric Care. In 2002, European net sales increased 8.0% to $1,984.3 on volume growth of 5.0%. Operating profit in Europe increased 19% to $488.2 in 2003 and 19% to $409.0 in 2002 as a result of volume growth, gross margin improvement, the impact of the stronger euro and, in 2002, the discontinuation of amortization of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets. Asia/Africa Net sales in Asia/Africa increased 13.5% to $1,747.5 on volume gains of 7.5% and the positive impact of 8.5% from foreign currencies offset by a 2.5% decrease in net selling prices. China, Malaysia, the Philippines and Australia achieved the strongest volume gains in the region. Successful new products driving growth in Oral Care are Colgate Herbal and Colgate Herbal White toothpastes, and Colgate Premier Ultra and Colgate Navigator Plus manual toothbrushes. Protex SunCare bar soap, Palmolive Naturals shampoo and Palmolive Aromatherapy shampoo, shower gel, talc, liquid hand soap and translucent bar soap contributed to growth in Personal Care throughout the region. In 2002, net sales in Asia/Africa increased 4.0% to $1,542.0 as volume gains of 4.5% were partially offset by foreign currency weakness. Operating profit grew 21% in Asia/Africa to $280.7 in 2003 and 19% to $232.6 in 2002, driven by volume gains and higher gross profit margins benefiting from the regionalization of manufacturing facilities as well as strong foreign currencies. Pet Nutrition Net sales for Hills Pet Nutrition increased 11.0% to $1,316.1 on 4.5% volume growth, an increase of 1.5% in net selling prices and 5.0% in positive foreign currency impact. Hills business in the U.S. was driven by the continued success of Science Diet Natures Best, Science Diet Advanced Protection and Prescription Diet Feline m/d. Internationally, Japan, Hong Kong, Australia, Brazil, France, the United Kingdom, Spain, New Zealand, the Philippines and Russia each contributed strong volume gains. The continued rollout of Science Plan and Science Diet Natures Best throughout Europe and Asia contributed to the strong international results. In 2002, net sales for the Pet Nutrition segment increased 7.0% to $1,187.1 on 5.5% volume gains. Operating profit in Pet Nutrition grew 17% to $371.0 in 2003 and 13% to $318.3 in 2002 as a result of strong volume gains and higher gross profit margins, as well as ongoing cost savings initiatives.

The increase reflects the Companys improved profitability and working capital management including lower cash taxes. A portion of the higher taxes paid in 2002 related to a deferral of 2001 taxes into 2002 under a government relief program as a result of the events of September 11, 2001. The Companys working capital as a percentage of sales improved to 1.7% of sales as compared with 3.2% of sales in 2002. The Company defines working capital as the difference between current assets (excluding cash and marketable securities, the latter of which is reported in other current assets) and current liabilities (excluding short term debt). The inventory and accounts receivable components of working capital changed slightly from December 31, 2002 as both inventory days coverage and receivable days sales outstanding remained essentially unchanged. Working capital at December 31, 2003 includes an increase of approximately $69.6 of accrued liabilities related to taxes and restructuring costs incurred in connection with the Companys sale of certain non core product lines and other associated actions. The majority of these amounts are expected to be paid in the first half of 2004. Cash generated from operations in 2003 was used to fund capital spending, pay dividends, repurchase common stock and reduce overall debt levels. Investing activities used $117.6 of cash during 2003 compared with $357.2 and $323.5 during 2002 and 2001, respectively, reflecting an increase in proceeds related to the sale of non core product lines and from the sale of marketable securities and investments, as well as lower capital expenditures than in the comparable periods. Capital expenditures were $302.1, $343.7 and $340.2 for 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Capital spending continues to be focused primarily on projects that yield high aftertax returns. Capital expenditures for 2004 are expected to be at the rate of approximately 3.0% to 3.5% of net sales. During 2003, the Company sold various detergent and certain non core soap brands marketed in Europe for an aggregate sales price of $127.6. These non core brands accounted for approximately 1% of the Companys 2003 net sales. Certain detergent product lines in Central America were sold in 2001 for an aggregate sale price of $12.5. There were no significant divestitures in 2002. Proceeds from the sale of various marketable securities and investments include the settlement of certain foreign currency contracts. During 2003, long term debt decreased to $2,999.3 from $3,509.3 in 2002 and total debt decreased to $3,102.9 in 2003 from $3,603.9 in 2002, primarily due to the Companys strong free cash flow before dividends (defined below) and the proceeds from the sale of non core brands, partially offset by share repurchases. The Companys long term debt has maintained a rating of AA by Standard & Poors and Aa3 by Moodys Investors Service. The Company currently issues commercial paper in the U.S., Canadian and European markets. Domestic and foreign commercial paper outstanding was $46.1 and $391.4, as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Commercial paper outstanding during 2003 averaged $640.0 down from the $780.0 average in 2002. The maximum commercial paper outstanding during 2003 and 2002 was $920.0 and $1,100.0, respectively. These borrowings carry a Standard & Poors rating of A1+ and a Moodys rating of P1. The commercial paper and certain current maturities of notes payable of $562.4 are classified as long term debt at December 31, 2003, as the Company has the intent and ability to refinance such obligations on a long term basis, including, if necessary, utilizing its lines of credit that expire in 2007. Certain of the Companys financing arrangements require the maintenance of a minimum ratio of operating cash flow to debt. The ESOP notes guaranteed by the Company and certain amounts payable to banks contain cross default provisions. Noncompliance with these requirements could ultimately result in the acceleration of amounts owed. The Company is in full compliance with all such requirements and believes the likelihood of noncompliance is remote. In 1993, the Company formed a financing subsidiary with outside equity investors that purchases some of the Companys receivables. The Company consolidates this entity, including such receivables, and reports the 13 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) amounts invested by outside investors as a minority interest. The purpose of this arrangement is to provide the Company access to low cost sources of capital. During 2000, this subsidiary ceased operations resulting in a cash payment of $113.9 to the outside investors. In 2001, the subsidiary resumed operations with funding of $89.7 from outside investors. The Company repurchases common shares in the open market and in private transactions for employee benefit plans and to maintain its targeted capital structure. During 2003, the Company redeemed all outstanding shares of its $4.25 Preferred Stock at the stated redemption price of $100 per share. Aggregate repurchases for 2003 included 10.2 million common shares and .1 million shares of preferred stock for a total purchase price of $554.9. In 2002 and 2001, 20.3 million and 22.0 million shares were repurchased, respectively, with total purchase prices of $1,105.2 and $1,263.3, respectively. Dividend payments were $506.8, up from $413.4 in 2002 and $396.7 in 2001. Common stock dividend payments increased to $.90 per share in 2003 from $.72 per share in 2002 and $.68 per share in 2001. The Series B Preference Stock dividend payments were increased to $7.20 per share in 2003 from $5.76 per share in 2002 and $5.40 in 2001. The Companys annualized common stock and Series B Preference Stock dividends at December 31, 2003 were $.96 and $7.68 per share, respectively. The Company believes that internally generated cash flows are adequate to support business operations and capital expenditures. Free cash flow before dividends was $1,465.6, $1,267.5 and $1,163.7 in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The Company defines free cash flow before dividends as net cash provided by operations less capital expenditures. As management uses this measure to evaluate the Companys ability to satisfy current and future obligations, repurchase stock, pay dividends and fund future business opportunities, the Company believes that it provides useful information to investors. Free cash flow before dividends is not a measure of cash available for discretionary expenditures since the Company has certain nondiscretionary obligations such as debt service that are not deducted from the measure. Free cash flow before dividends is not a GAAP measurement and may not be comparable with similarly titled measures reported by other companies. A reconciliation of net cash provided by operations to free cash flow before dividends follows: 2003 2002 2001 Net cash provided by operations $ 1,767.7 $ 1,611.2 $ 1,503.9 Less: Capital expenditures (302.1 ) (343.7 ) (340.2 ) Free cash flow before dividends $ 1,465.6 $ 1,267.5 $ 1,163.7 The Company has additional sources of liquidity available in the form of lines of credit maintained with various banks and access to financial markets worldwide. Accordingly, the Company believes it has sufficient liquidity to meet its financing needs. At December 31, 2003, the Company had access to domestic and foreign unused lines of credit of $1,868.8 and also had $535.0 of medium term notes available for issuance pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement. The Companys domestic lines of credit include a $1,300.0 facility maturing in May 2007 and a $30.0 364 day facility maturing in December 2004. These domestic lines are available for general corporate purposes and to support commercial paper issuance. On December 18, 2003, the Company agreed to acquire GABA Holding AG (GABA), a privately owned European oral care company headquartered in Switzerland. The transaction is structured as an all cash acquisition of between 80% to 100% of the outstanding shares of GABA for an aggregate price ranging from 800 million Swiss francs to 1,050 million Swiss francs (approximately $645.0 to $846.5 based on December 31, 2003 exchange rates), depending on the number of shares acquired and subject to a purchase price adjustment. It is expected that substantially all the outstanding shares will be acquired by the Company. The acquisition is subject 14 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) to regulatory approvals in several European countries and other customary closing conditions and is expected to be completed within the next three to five months. The pending acquisition of GABA will be funded using a combination of debt, primarily short term, and available cash balances with the majority anticipated to be repaid within 12 months of the closing of the acquisition. The portion of long term debt, if any, will depend upon future market conditions and other factors. In connection with the financing of the GABA acquisition, the Company anticipates that the amount of its common stock repurchases during 2004 will decline as compared with 2003 levels. The following represents the scheduled maturities of the Companys contractual obligations as of December 31, 2003. Total Payments Due by Period 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 Thereafter Long term debt including current portion $ 2,949.6 $ 871.1 (1) $ 333.7 $ 265.0 $ 249.5 $ 212.9 $ 1,017.4 Capitalized leases 49.7 5.7 6.1 6.1 6.5 6.7 18.6 Operating leases 428.2 79.8 72.7 64.7 57.8 57.4 95.8 Purchase obligations(2) 583.1 225.7 146.7 101.4 70.4 38.9 Total(3) $ 4,010.6 $ 1,182.3 $ 559.2 $ 437.2 $ 384.2 $ 315.9 $ 1,131.8 (1) Long term debt due in 2004 includes $562.4 of commercial paper and certain current maturities of notes payable that have been classified as long term debt as of December 31, 2003, as the Company has the intent and ability to refinance such obligations on a long term basis under its unused lines of credit which expire in 2007. (2) The Company has outstanding purchase obligations with suppliers at the end of 2003 for raw, packaging and other materials in the normal course of business. These purchase obligation amounts do not represent total anticipated purchases but represent only those items which are based on agreements that are enforceable, legally binding and specify minimum quantity, price and term. (3) The Company intends to voluntarily contribute a minimum of $30.0 to benefit plans in the first half of 2004. As more fully described in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company is party to various superfund and other environmental matters in connection with prior acquisitions. Substantially all of these liabilities have been acknowledged in writing as being covered by investment grade insurance carriers that are presently making all their required payments directly to the cleanup efforts and are expected to do so in the future. The Company is also contingently liable with respect to lawsuits, taxes and other matters arising out of the normal course of business. While it is possible that the Companys cash flows and results of operations in a particular period could be affected by the one time impact of the resolution of such contingencies, it is the opinion of management that the ultimate disposition of these matters, to the extent not previously provided for, will not have a material impact on the financial position, results of operations or ongoing cash flows of the Company. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company does not have off balance sheet financing or unconsolidated special purpose entities. Restructuring Activities As more fully described in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company incurred $59.3 of costs in connection with the realignment of certain manufacturing operations and workforce reduction programs. 15 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) The components and related restructuring activity for 2003 are presented below: TerminationBenefits Incremental Depreciation Total Charges $ 38.2 $ 21.1 $ 59.3 Cash payments (5.5 ) (5.5 ) Charges against assets (21.1 ) (21.1 ) Restructuring accrual $ 32.7 $ $ 32.7 Accrued termination benefits at December 31, 2003 are expected to be paid in 2004. Additional restructuring activities expected to be incurred in 2004 for related termination benefits and incremental depreciation are currently estimated at $11.4 for these activities. It is anticipated that the ongoing impact from the divestment of the non core European detergents and soap brands combined with the effects of these restructuring activities will not result in a material impact on future earnings. Additionally, the Company continues to assess the further regionalization of manufacturing facilities to reduce costs and to streamline its operations. Costs for these restructuring activities are reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Income in Other (income) expense, net primarily in the Corporate segment as these decisions are corporate driven and are not included in internal measures of segment operating performance. Managing Foreign Currency, Interest Rate and Commodity Price Exposure The Company is exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity price fluctuations. Volatility relating to these exposures is managed on a consolidated basis by utilizing a number of techniques, including working capital management, selective borrowings in local currencies and entering into certain derivative instrument transactions in accordance with the Companys treasury and risk management policies. The Companys treasury and risk management policies prohibit the use of leveraged derivatives or derivatives for trading purposes. With operations in over 200 countries and territories, the Company is exposed to currency fluctuation related to manufacturing and selling its products in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The major foreign currency exposures involve the markets in the European Union and certain Latin American countries, although all regions of the world are subject to foreign currency changes versus the U.S. dollar. The Company actively monitors its foreign currency exposures in these markets and has been able to substantially offset the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements through a combination of cost containment measures, selling price increases and foreign currency hedging of certain costs. The Company primarily utilizes currency forward and swap contracts to hedge portions of its exposures relating to foreign currency purchases and assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business. From time to time, the Company hedges certain of its forecasted foreign currency purchases using forward contracts with durations no greater than 18 months. Interest rate swaps and debt issuances are utilized to manage the Companys targeted mix of fixed and floating rate debt and to minimize significant fluctuations in earnings and cash flows that may result from interest rate volatility. The Company is exposed to price volatility related to raw materials used in production. Futures contracts are used on a limited basis to manage volatility related to anticipated raw material inventory purchases. The results of the Companys commodity hedging activities are not material. 16 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to the financial instrument contracts held by the Company; however, nonperformance by these counterparties is considered remote as it is the Companys policy to contract with diversified counterparties that have a long term debt rating of AA /Aa3 or higher. Value at Risk The Companys risk management procedures include the monitoring of interest rate and foreign exchange exposures and hedge positions utilizing statistical analyses of cash flows, market value and sensitivity analysis. However, the use of these techniques to quantify the market risk of such instruments should not be construed as an endorsement of their accuracy or the accuracy of the related assumptions. Market exposures are evaluated using a value at risk (VAR) model and an earnings at risk (EAR) model that are intended to measure the maximum potential loss in interest rate and foreign exchange financial instruments, assuming adverse market conditions occur, given a 95% confidence level. The models utilize a variance/covariance modeling technique. Historical interest rates and foreign exchange rates from the preceding year are used to estimate the volatility and correlation of future rates. The estimated maximum potential one day loss in fair value of interest rate or foreign exchange rate instruments, calculated using the VAR model, is not material to the consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows of the Company in 2003 and 2002. The estimated maximum yearly loss in earnings due to interest rate or foreign exchange rate instruments, calculated utilizing the EAR model, is not material to the Companys results of operations in 2003 and 2002. Actual results in the future may differ materially from these projected results due to actual developments in the global financial markets. For information regarding the Companys accounting policies for financial instruments and a description of financial instrument activities, refer to Notes 2 and 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Recent Accounting Pronouncements On January 1, 2002, the Company adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Boards (FASB) Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 00 14, Accounting for Certain Sales Incentives, and Issue No. 00 25, Vendor Income Statement Characterization of Consideration Paid to a Reseller of the Vendors Products, which relate to the classification of various types of sales incentives and promotional expenses. The Consolidated Statement of Income for 2001 has been revised to reflect the reclassification of certain sales incentives and promotional expenses from selling, general and administrative expenses to a reduction of net sales and cost of sales; however, the revision had no impact on the Companys financial position, net income or earnings per share. These reclassifications reduced net sales by $343.5 and cost of sales by $2.0 for the year ended December 31, 2001, with an offsetting reduction in selling, general and administrative expenses. On January 1, 2002, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, which eliminates the amortization of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets but requires annual impairment reviews. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, prior period amounts were not restated. A reconciliation of previously reported net income, basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share for 2001 to the amounts adjusted to exclude goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets amortization is presented in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. 17 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements requires management to use judgment and make estimates. The level of uncertainty in estimates and assumptions increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions are completed. Actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates. The accounting policies that are most critical in the preparation of the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements are those that are both important to the portrayal of the Companys financial condition and results of operations and require significant or complex judgments and estimates on the part of management. The Companys critical accounting policies have been reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. In certain instances, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America allow for the selection of alternative accounting methods. The Companys significant policies that involve the selection of alternative methods are accounting for stock options, shipping and handling costs, and inventories. Two alternative methods for accounting for stock options are available, the intrinsic value method and the fair value method. The Company uses the intrinsic value method of accounting for stock options, and accordingly, no compensation expense has been recognized. Under the fair value method, the determination of the pro forma amounts involves several assumptions including option life and future volatility. If the fair value method were used, diluted earnings per share for 2003 would decrease approximately 3%. (Refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.) Shipping and handling costs may be reported as either a component of cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses. The Company reports such costs, primarily related to warehousing and outbound freight, in the Consolidated Statements of Income as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses. Accordingly, the Companys gross profit margin is not comparable with the gross profit margin of those companies that include shipping and handling charges in cost of sales. If such costs were included in cost of sales, gross profit margin as a percent to sales would decrease from 55.0% to 52.1% in 2003 with no impact on reported earnings. The Company accounts for inventories using both the first in, first out (FIFO) method (80% of inventories) and the last in, first out (LIFO) method (20% of inventories). There would be no impact on reported earnings for 2003, 2002 and 2001 if all inventories were accounted for under the FIFO method. The areas of accounting that involve significant or complex judgments and estimates are pensions and other postretirement benefits, asset impairment, tax valuation allowances, and legal and other contingencies. In pension accounting, the most significant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate and the long term rate of return on plan assets. The discount rate for domestic plans was 6.25%, 6.75% and 7.25% as of December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. As required, the discount rate is based upon published year end rates on high quality bonds. The assumed long term rate of return on plan assets for domestic plans was 8.0%, 8.0% and 9.0% as of December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. In determining the long term rate of return, the Company considers the nature of the plans investments, an expectation for the plans investment strategies and the historical rates of return. A 1% change in either the discount rate or the assumed return on plan assets would impact net income by approximately $7. A third, less significant assumption is the long term rate of compensation increase, a change in which would partially offset the impact of a change in either the discount rate or the long term rate of return. This rate was 4.25%, 4.25% and 4.75% as of December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The most judgmental assumption in accounting for other postretirement benefits is the medical cost trend rate. In 2003, the assumed rate of increase was 9.0% for 2004 and declining 1% per year until reaching the ultimate assumed rate of increase of 5% per year. The effect of a 1% increase in the assumed long term medical cost trend rate would reduce net income by approximately $1.5. Asset impairment analysis is primarily performed for intangible assets and requires several estimates including future cash flows, growth rates and the selection of a discount rate. Since the estimated fair 18 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) value of the Companys intangible assets substantially exceeds the recorded book value, significant changes in these estimates would have to occur to result in an impairment charge. Tax valuation allowances are established to reduce tax assets, such as tax loss carryforwards, to net realizable value. Factors considered in estimating net realizable value include historical results by tax jurisdiction, carryforward periods, income tax strategies and forecasted taxable income. A significant change to the Companys valuation allowances would primarily impact equity and would not materially impact reported earnings. Legal and other contingency reserves are based on managements assessment of the risk of potential loss, which includes consultation with outside legal counsel and advisors. Such assessments are reviewed each period and revised, based on current facts and circumstances, if necessary. It is managements opinion that the ultimate disposition of these matters, to the extent not previously provided for, will not have a material impact on the Companys financial position, results of operations or ongoing cash flows. (Refer to Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Companys contingencies.) The Company generates revenue through the sale of well known consumer products to trade customers under established trading terms. While the recognition of revenue and receivables requires the use of estimates, there is a short time frame (typically less than 60 days) between the shipment of product and cash receipt, thereby reducing the level of uncertainty in these estimates. (Refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further description of the Companys significant accounting policies.) Outlook Looking forward into 2004, the Company is well positioned for continued growth in most of its markets. However, the Company operates in a highly competitive global marketplace that is experiencing increased trade concentration in many markets. In addition, movements in foreign currency exchange rates can impact future operating results as measured in U.S. dollars. In particular, economic uncertainty in some countries in Latin America and changes in the value of the euro may impact the overall results of Latin America and Europe. The Company expects the continued success of Colgate toothpaste, using patented and proprietary technology, to bolster worldwide Oral Care leadership and expects new products in Oral Care and other categories to add potential for further growth. Overall, subject to global economic conditions, the Company does not expect the 2004 market conditions to be materially different from those experienced in 2003 and the Company expects its positive momentum to continue. Historically, the consumer products industry has been less susceptible to changes in economic growth than many other industries. Therefore, the Company constantly evaluates projects that will focus operations on opportunities for enhanced growth potential. Over the long term, Colgates continued focus on its consumer products business and the strength of its global brand names, its broad international presence in both developed and developing markets, and its strong capital base all position the Company to take advantage of growth opportunities and to continue to increase profitability and shareholder value. Cautionary Statement on Forward Looking Statements In this report and from time to time, the Company may make statements that constitute or contain forward looking information as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 or by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission in its rules, regulations and releases. Such statements may relate, for example, to sales or volume growth, earnings growth, financial goals, cost reduction plans and new product introductions among other matters. The Company cautions investors that any such forward looking 19 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) statements made by the Company are not guarantees of future performance and that actual results may differ materially from anticipated results or expectations expressed in the Companys forward looking statements. The following are some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from forward looking statements: 1. Global Economic Conditions. The Company operates on a global basis, with approximately 70% of its net sales coming from operations outside the U.S. The Company is subject to the full range of economic risks, including those associated with international operations, such as economic recession, inflation, access to capital markets and related costs, movements in currency exchange rates and interest rates, return on pension assets, trade restrictions, tax law changes, political and legal instability, the imposition of trade restrictions and similar factors beyond the control of the Company. 2. Competition. The Company faces vigorous competition from multinational consumer product companies throughout the world with the same or greater resources than the Company. Such competition is based on pricing of products, promotional activities, advertising, new product introductions, electronic commerce initiatives and other activities of competitors, the timing and scale of which cannot be foreseen by the Company. The Companys ability to compete also depends on the strength of its brands, its ability to attract and retain key talent, and its ability to protect its patent, trademark and trade dress rights and to defend against related challenges brought by competitors. 3. Retail Trade. The Company can be negatively affected by changes in the policies of its retail trade customers, such as inventory de stocking, limitations on access to shelf space, electronic data transmission requirements and other conditions. With the growing trend towards retail trade consolidation, especially in developed markets such as the U.S. and Europe, the Company is increasingly dependent on key retailers, and these retailers, including large format retailers, have increasingly greater bargaining strength and are reducing their inventory levels. In addition, private label brands sold by retail trade chains are becoming a source of competition for certain product lines of the Company. 4. Products. The Companys growth depends on the successful development and introduction of new products and line extensions, which face the uncertainty of retail and consumer acceptance and reaction from competitors, as well as the continued success of existing products. In addition, the Companys ability to create new products and line extensions and to sustain existing products is affected by its ability to develop technological innovations, to receive and maintain necessary patent and trademark protection and regulatory approvals, and to anticipate successfully consumer needs and preferences. 5. Cost Pressures. The Companys ability to manage its cost structure can be adversely affected by movements in raw material prices and by unanticipated delays or difficulties in achieving cost efficiencies in manufacturing and distribution. In addition, the Companys move to global suppliers, to achieve cost reductions and simplify its business, has resulted in an increasing dependence on key suppliers. For certain materials, new suppliers may have to be qualified under industry and government standards, which can require additional investment and take some period of time. 6. Manufacturing. As a company engaged in manufacturing on a global scale, the Company is subject to the risks inherent in such activities, including industrial accidents, environmental events, strikes and other labor disputes, loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites, product quality and safety issues, natural disasters and other external factors over which the Company has no control. 7. Acquisitions. From time to time the Company makes strategic acquisitions. Acquisitions have inherent risks, such as obtaining necessary regulatory approvals, retaining key personnel, integration of the acquired business, and achievement of planned synergies and projections. 20 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) ITEM 7A.
