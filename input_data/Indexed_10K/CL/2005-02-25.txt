ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Executive Overview Colgate Palmolive Company seeks to deliver strong, consistent business results and superior shareholder returns by providing consumers, on a global basis, with products that make their lives healthier and more enjoyable. To this end, the Company is tightly focused on two product segments: Oral, Personal and Home Care; and Pet Nutrition. Within these segments, the Company follows a closely defined business strategy to develop and increase market leadership positions in key product categories. These product categories are prioritized based on their capacity to maximize the use of the organizations core competencies and strong global equities and to deliver sustainable long term growth. Operationally, the Company is organized along geographic lines with specific regional management teams having responsibility for the financial results in each region. The Company competes in more than 200 countries and territories worldwide, with established businesses in all regions contributing to the Companys sales and profitability. This geographic diversity and balance helps to reduce the Companys exposure to business and other risks in any one country or part of the world. The Oral, Personal and Home Care segment is operated through four reportable operating segments, North America, Latin America, Europe and Asia/Africa, which sell to a variety of retail and wholesale customers and distributors. In the Pet Nutrition segment, Hills also competes on a worldwide basis selling its products principally through the veterinary profession and specialty pet retailers. To achieve its financial objectives, the Company focuses the organization on initiatives to drive growth and to fund growth. The Company seeks to capture significant opportunities for growth by identifying and meeting consumer needs within its core categories, in particular by deploying valuable consumer and shopper insights in the development of successful new products regionally which are then rolled out on a global basis. Growth opportunities are enhanced in those areas of the world in which economic development and rising consumer incomes expand the size and number of markets for the Companys products. The investments needed to fund this growth are developed through continuous, corporate wide initiatives to lower costs and increase effective asset utilization. The Company also continues to prioritize its investments toward its higher margin businesses, specifically Oral Care, Personal Care and Pet Nutrition. In June 2004, the Company completed its acquisition of GABA Holding AG (GABA), a privately owned European oral care company headquartered in Switzerland. Also, consistent with the Companys strategy to de emphasize heavy duty detergents, the Company completed the sale of certain European and Latin American laundry detergent brands during 2003 and 2004, respectively. On an ongoing basis, management focuses on a variety of key indicators to monitor business health and performance. These indicators include market share, sales (including volume, pricing and foreign exchange components), gross profit margin, operating profit, net income and earnings per share (with and without charges related to the 2004 Restructuring Program described below); and measures to optimize the management of working capital, capital expenditures, cash flow and return on capital. The monitoring of these indicators, as well as the Companys corporate governance practices (including the Companys Code of Conduct), are used to ensure that business health and strong internal controls are maintained. In 2004, Net sales grew 7.0% driven by strong volume growth of 5.5%, despite increased competition in several of the Companys key markets. These gains were driven by increased advertising and promotional support in key categories and markets, in line with the Companys strategy to invest in its higher margin businesses. At the same time, however, raw and packing material costs increased. The combined increase in these costs and the higher advertising and promotional spending more than offset savings generated during the year by 7 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) the Companys ongoing global cost reduction programs. As a result, Operating profit for the year declined 2%, which included a $68.7 charge in connection with the four year restructuring and business building plan the Company announced and began implementing in December 2004 (the 2004 Restructuring Program). The 2004 Restructuring Program is designed to enhance the Companys global leadership position in its core businesses. The savings and benefits from the 2004 Restructuring Program along with the Companys other ongoing cost savings initiatives are anticipated to provide additional funds for investment in support of key categories and new product development while also supporting an increased level of profitability. For more information regarding the 2004 Restructuring Program, see Restructuring Activities below. Results of Operations Net Sales Worldwide sales were $10,584.2 in 2004. Sales increased 7.0% driven by volume gains of 5.5%, a decrease in net selling prices of 1.5% and a positive foreign exchange impact of 3.0%. The acquisition of GABA contributed 1.0% to worldwide sales and volume growth. Excluding the 2003 divestments of certain European detergent and soap brands and the 2004 divestment of certain detergents in Latin America, sales increased 8.0% on volume growth of 6.5%. Sales in the Oral, Personal and Home Care segment were $9,151.1, up 6.5% from 2003 on volume growth of 5.5%, decreases in net selling prices of 2.0% and a 3.0% positive impact of foreign exchange. Excluding the divestments in Europe and Latin America, sales in this segment increased 8.0% on volume growth of 7.0%. Sales in Pet Nutrition grew 9.0% to $1,433.1, driven by volume growth of 3.5%, positive foreign exchange of 4.0% and an increase in net selling prices of 1.5%. In 2003, worldwide sales increased 6.5% to $9,903.4 on volume growth of 3.5%, increases in net selling prices of 0.5% and a positive foreign exchange impact of 2.5%. Gross Profit Gross profit margin was 55.1% in 2004 compared to 55.0% in 2003 reflecting the Companys shift toward higher margin oral care products and cost savings programs partially offset by increased promotional spending, raw and packing material costs and restructuring charges of $3.4 related to accelerated depreciation and certain employee retention payments under the 2004 Restructuring Program included in Cost of sales. The increase in 2003 from the 2002 level of 54.6% was driven by the Companys focus on its high margin oral and personal care businesses, savings from global sourcing, the regionalization of manufacturing facilities and other cost reduction initiatives, despite an increase in worldwide materials costs. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were 34.2% in 2004, 33.3% in 2003 and 32.6% in 2002. The 90 basis point (bps) increase as a percentage of sales in 2004 was primarily driven by increases in advertising spending (30 bps), selling and marketing costs (30 bps) and shipping and handling costs (20 bps). The increase as a percent of sales in 2003 resulted from increases in advertising of 60 bps and pension and other employee benefit costs of 40 bps, partially offset by savings from cost control initiatives of 30 bps. Included in selling, general and administrative expenses is advertising spending of $1,063.0, $965.6 and $897.9 in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, supporting new product launches and helping increase market shares throughout the world. Additionally, total commercial investment behind the Companys brands, including media, promotion and other consumer and trade incentives, some of which are recorded as a reduction of Net sales, increased by 13% in 2004 and 2003 and by 8% in 2002. Other (Income) Expense, Net Other (income) expense, net was $90.3, ($15.0) and $23.0 in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The changes year over year were driven by gains on sales of non core brands and restructuring costs. 8 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Other (income) expense, net in 2004 included charges of $65.3 related to the Companys 2004 Restructuring Program and a gain of $26.7 on the sale of certain detergent businesses in Latin America. For additional information regarding the Companys 2004 Restructuring Program, refer to Restructuring Activities below and Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Other (income) expense, net in 2003 included gains of $107.2 ($63.5 aftertax) related to the sale of non core brands partially offset by $59.3 ($39.0 aftertax) of costs related to the regionalization of manufacturing facilities, which combined resulted in a net benefit of $47.9 ($24.5 aftertax). The components of Other (income) expense, net are presented below: 2004 2003 2002 Minority interest $ 47.9 $ 45.2 $ 41.3 Amortization of intangible assets 14.3 12.3 12.5 Equity losses (income) (8.5 ) (.3 ) .6 Gains on sales of non core product lines, net (26.7 ) (107.2 ) 2004 Restructuring Program 65.3 2003 restructuring activities 2.8 59.3 Other, net (4.8 ) (24.3 ) (31.4 ) $ 90.3 $ (15.0 ) $ 23.0 Other, net consists primarily of miscellaneous gains and losses including gains and losses on interest rate and foreign currency hedge contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting. Operating Profit In 2004, Operating profit declined 2% to $2,122.1 after an 8% increase in 2003 to $2,166.0 from $2,013.1 in 2002. All years presented benefited from sales growth and cost savings initiatives. Additionally, 2004 included restructuring charges of $68.7 ($48.0 aftertax) in connection with the 2004 Restructuring Program and other business realignment costs of $19.7 ($15.2 aftertax), as well as a gain of $26.7 ($15.0 aftertax) on the sale of certain detergent businesses in Latin America. Operating profit in 2003 reflected the net impact of $47.9 ($24.5 aftertax) related to the sales of non core brands and restructuring activities. Interest Expense, Net Interest expense, net was $119.7 in 2004 compared with $124.1 in 2003 and $142.8 in 2002. Low interest rates have allowed the Company to lower its interest expense despite increased debt levels resulting from the GABA acquisition in 2004. The decrease in 2003 resulted from lower interest rates and debt levels. Income Taxes The effective income tax rate was 33.7% in 2004 versus 30.4% in 2003 and 31.1% in 2002. The increase in 2004 is due in part to changes in the mix of income in foreign tax rate jurisdictions and increased costs of remittances, while the effective tax rate was reduced in 2003 through the realization of tax credits and incentives, and as a result of global tax planning strategies including overseas asset revaluations. Net Income Net income was $1,327.1 in 2004 or $2.33 per share on a diluted basis compared with $1,421.3 in 2003 or $2.46 per share and $1,288.3 in 2002 or $2.19 per share. As previously discussed, Net income in 2004 includes an aftertax charge of $48.0 ($.09 per share) associated with the initial phase of the 2004 Restructuring Program. Net income in 2003 includes a net aftertax benefit of $24.5 ($.04 per share) resulting from the gain on the sale of certain European detergent brands, partially offset by 2003 restructuring activities. 9 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Segment Results The Company markets its products in over 200 countries and territories throughout the world in two distinct business segments: Oral, Personal and Home Care; and Pet Nutrition. Segment performance is evaluated based on several factors, including operating profit. The Company uses operating profit as a measure of operating segment performance because it excludes the impact of corporate driven decisions related to restructuring and related costs, interest expense, income taxes, and gains and losses on sales of non core brands and assets.

In 2003, Operating profit in Latin America decreased 5% to $613.3 due to negative foreign currency impact partially offset by volume growth and cost control initiatives. Europe Net sales in Europe as reported increased 14.0% to $2,621.3 on 8.0% volume growth, a 9.0% positive impact of the stronger euro and other European currencies, and a 3.0% decline in net selling prices.

Asia/Africa Net sales in Asia/Africa as reported increased 8.0% to $1,885.1 on 7.0% volume growth, a 5.5% positive impact of foreign exchange and a 4.5% decline in net selling prices. Excluding divestments, sales increased 9.0% on volume gains of 8.0%. Healthy volume gains were achieved in China, India, Taiwan, Philippines, Thailand, Australia, South Africa and the Middle East. Strong growth in Oral Care throughout the region was driven by new product launches including Colgate Herbal Whitening and Colgate Fresh Confidence Plus Whitening toothpastes and Colgate Massager manual toothbrush. Palmolive Aromatherapy shampoo and Palmolive Aroma Cr&egrave;me shower gel contributed to gains in Personal Care. In 2003, Net sales in Asia/Africa increased 13.5% to $1,747.5 on volume gains of 7.5% and the positive impact of 8.5% from foreign currencies offset by a 2.5% decrease in net selling prices. 11 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Operating profit grew 10% in Asia/Africa to $310.1 in 2004 and 21% to $280.7 in 2003, driven by volume gains and higher gross profit margins benefiting from the regionalization of manufacturing facilities as well as strong foreign currencies.

Operating profit for 2003 increased 17% to $371.0 as a result of strong volume gains and higher gross profit margins, as well as ongoing cost savings initiatives. Corporate Operating profit (loss) for the Corporate segment was ($274.5), ($134.6) and ($172.9) for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. As previously discussed in Other (income) expense, net, the changes year over year were primarily driven by restructuring costs and gains on sales of non core brands. Corporate operating expenses in 2004 include $68.7 of pretax charges related to the Companys 2004 Restructuring Program and a $26.7 pretax gain on the sale of certain detergent businesses in Latin America. In 2003 corporate operating expenses were reduced by gains on the sale of non core brands, net of costs related to the 2003 regionalization of manufacturing facilities and business realignment activities, which had a combined net impact of $51.5, as well as gains on interest rate and foreign currency hedge contracts used to hedge economic exposures but that do not qualify for hedge accounting. Restructuring Activities 2004 Restructuring Program In December 2004, the Company commenced a four year restructuring and business building program to enhance the Companys global leadership position in its core businesses (the 2004 Restructuring Program). As part of the 2004 Restructuring Program, the Company anticipates streamlining its global supply chain through the rationalization of approximately one third of its manufacturing facilities and the closure of certain warehousing facilities and also plans to centralize its purchasing and other business support functions. Business building initiatives include enhancing and reallocating resources with an increase and upgrade in the sales, marketing and new product organizations in high potential developing and other key markets, and the consolidation of these organizations in certain mature markets. The 2004 Restructuring Program is expected to result in approximately a 12% reduction in employees over the next four years. The cost of implementing the 2004 Restructuring Program is estimated to result in cumulative pretax charges, once all phases are approved and implemented, totaling between $750 and $900 ($550 and $650 aftertax). The estimated cost in 2005 is $250 $325 ($175 $225 aftertax). Savings are projected to be in the range of $325 $400 ($250 $300 aftertax) annually by the fourth year of the program. The projected savings in 2005 are estimated at approximately $45 aftertax. Over the course of the four year 2004 Restructuring Program, it is estimated that approximately 50% 60% of the charges will result in cash expenditures. Managements estimates of the cost and savings associated with the 2004 Restructuring Program are forward looking statements and are subject to revision over time. 12 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) During 2004 the Company incurred $68.7 ($48.0 aftertax) of charges in connection with the initial phase of the program related to restructuring activities in Europe (51%), North America (25%), Latin America (9%), Asia/Africa (7%) and Corporate (8%). These activities include the previously announced closing or reconfiguration of eight manufacturing facilities in North America, Asia/Africa, Europe and Latin America and the realignment of marketing and sales organizations in Europe and Asia/Africa, which will result in net headcount reductions of approximately 1,100 employees. Summary of Activity for the 2004 Restructuring Program Termination Benefits Incremental Depreciation AssetImpairments Other Total Charges $ 41.6 $ 3.3 $ 22.0 $ 1.8 $ 68.7 Cash payments (1.4 ) (1.4 ) (2.8 ) Non cash activity (3.3 ) (22.0 ) (25.3 ) Foreign exchange 1.5 1.5 Restructuring accrual $ 41.7 $ $ $ .4 $ 42.1 Costs for these restructuring activities are reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Income in Cost of sales ($3.4) and Other (income) expense, net ($65.3) in the Corporate segment as these decisions are corporate driven and are not included in internal measures of segment operating performance. 2003 Restructuring Activities In connection with the European brand divestments during 2003 and the Companys ongoing focus on the regionalization of manufacturing facilities to streamline and strengthen its operations, the Company realigned certain manufacturing operations and implemented workforce reduction programs primarily in Europe, Latin America and Asia/Africa. The Company incurred $2.8 and $59.3 of costs in 2004 and 2003, respectively, related to these restructuring activities which were substantially complete at the end of 2004. Costs for these restructuring activities are reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Income in Other (income) expense, net primarily in the Corporate segment. Liquidity and Capital Resources Net cash provided by operations in 2004 was $1,754.3 compared with $1,767.7 in 2003 and $1,611.2 in 2002. Higher cash tax payments and working capital changes in 2004 contributed to a slight decline in operating cash flow as compared to the prior year. A portion of the increased tax payments reflected in net cash provided by operations during 2004 includes tax payments of $55 related to the prior sale of certain non core brands. The Companys working capital as a percentage of sales increased to 2.4% of sales in 2004 as compared with 1.7% of sales in 2003 primarily due to the accrued taxes in 2003 payable on the sale of non core brands. The Company defines working capital as the difference between current assets (excluding cash and marketable securities, the latter of which is reported in other current assets) and current liabilities (excluding short term debt). From a working capital perspective, the Companys inventory days coverage ratio has increased due to higher material costs and manufacturing and distribution changes while its receivable days sales outstanding ratio declined slightly. Investing activities used $1,090.4 of cash during 2004 compared with $117.6 and $357.2 during 2003 and 2002, respectively, predominantly due to payments for acquisitions. The Companys acquisition of GABA is discussed in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Investing activities in 2004 reflect $37.0 of proceeds from the sale of certain non core detergent brands in Latin America, while during 2003, the Company 13 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) sold various detergent and certain non core soap brands primarily marketed in Europe for an aggregate sales price of $127.6. Capital expenditures were $348.1, $302.1 and $343.7 for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Capital spending continues to be focused primarily on projects that yield high aftertax returns. Capital expenditures for 2005 are expected to be at the rate of approximately 3.5% to 4.0% of Net sales. Financing activities used $611.1 of cash during 2004 compared with a use of $1,557.2 and $1,260.0 of cash during 2003 and 2002, respectively. Financing activities reflect financing related to the GABA acquisition, increases in common stock dividend payments and higher share repurchase activity during 2004. During 2004, long term debt increased to $3,540.8 from $2,999.3 in 2003 and total debt increased to $3,675.1 in 2004 from $3,102.9 in 2003. The Companys long term debt is rated AA by Standard & Poors and Aa3 by Moodys Investors Service. The Company currently issues commercial paper in U.S., Canadian and European currencies, predominantly the Swiss franc. Commercial paper outstanding was $844.7 and $46.1 as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The maximum commercial paper outstanding during 2004 and 2003 was $1,519 and $920, respectively. These borrowings carry a Standard & Poors rating of A1+ and a Moodys rating of P1. The commercial paper and certain current maturities of notes payable totaling $852.5 are classified as long term debt at December 31, 2004, as the Company has the intent and ability to refinance such obligations on a long term basis, including, if necessary, by utilizing its lines of credit that expire in 2007. Certain of the Companys financing arrangements require the maintenance of a minimum ratio of operating cash flow to debt. The ESOP notes guaranteed by the Company and certain credit facilities contain cross default provisions. Noncompliance with these requirements could ultimately result in the acceleration of amounts owed. The Company is in full compliance with all such requirements and believes the likelihood of noncompliance is remote. The Company repurchases common shares in the open market and in private transactions to maintain its targeted capital structure and to fulfill the requirements of its compensation and benefit plans. In October 2004, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to purchase up to 20 million shares of the Companys common stock through December 31, 2005 (the 2004 Program). Aggregate repurchases for 2004, including repurchases under the 2004 Program and other Board authorizations, were 12.4 million common shares for a total purchase price of $637.9. Aggregate repurchases for 2003 were 10.2 million common shares and .1 million shares of preferred stock for a total purchase price of $554.9. In 2002, 20.3 million shares were repurchased for a total purchase price of $1,105.2. Dividend payments in 2004 were $536.2, up from $506.8 in 2003 and $413.4 in 2002. Common stock dividend payments increased to $.96 per share in 2004 from $.90 per share in 2003 and $.72 per share in 2002. The Series B Preference Stock dividend payments were increased to $7.68 per share in 2004 from $7.20 per share in 2003 and $5.76 per share in 2002. The Company recently increased the annualized common stock dividend to $1.16 per share and the annualized Series B Preference Stock dividend to $9.28 per share effective in the second quarter of 2005. Management currently intends to continue to pay dividends at increasing annual amounts per share from free cash flow. The Company believes that internally generated cash flows are adequate to support business operations and capital expenditures. Free cash flow before dividends was $1,406.2, $1,465.6 and $1,267.5 in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The Company defines free cash flow before dividends as net cash provided by operations less capital expenditures. As management uses this measure to evaluate the Companys ability to satisfy current and future obligations, repurchase stock, pay dividends and fund future business opportunities, the Company believes that it provides useful information to investors. Free cash flow before dividends is not a measure of cash available for discretionary expenditures since the Company has certain nondiscretionary obligations, such as debt service, that are not deducted from the measure. Free cash flow before dividends is not a GAAP measurement 14 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) and may not be comparable with similarly titled measures reported by other companies. A reconciliation of net cash provided by operations to free cash flow before dividends follows: 2004 2003 2002 Net cash provided by operations $ 1,754.3 $ 1,767.7 $ 1,611.2 Less: Capital expenditures (348.1 ) (302.1 ) (343.7 ) Free cash flow before dividends $ 1,406.2 $ 1,465.6 $ 1,267.5 In December 2004, the Company commenced the 2004 Restructuring Program, a four year restructuring and business building program, to enhance the Companys global leadership position in its core businesses. It is anticipated that cash requirements for the restructuring program will be funded with operating cash flow. Accordingly, management expects that in 2005 the projected cash costs of $110 $125 associated with the program will have a negative impact on 2005 operating cash flow. The Company has additional sources of liquidity available in the form of lines of credit maintained with various banks and access to financial markets worldwide. Accordingly, the Company believes it has sufficient liquidity to meet its financing needs. At December 31, 2004, the Company had access to unused domestic and foreign lines of credit of approximately $2,200 and also had $431.8 of medium term notes available for issuance pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement. The Companys domestic lines of credit include $1,300.0 in facilities expiring in May 2007 and facilities of $330.0 expiring in December 2005. These domestic lines are available for general corporate purposes and to support commercial paper issuance. The following represents the scheduled maturities of the Companys contractual obligations as of December 31, 2004: Total Payments Due by Period 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 Thereafter Long term debt including current portion $ 3,496.0 $ 1,297.8 (1) $ 278.3 $ 750.5 $ 134.2 $ 95.2 $ 940.0 Net cash interest payments on long term debt(2) 1,142.1 116.5 103.1 102.1 54.5 50.3 715.6 Capitalized leases 44.8 6.0 6.6 6.6 6.7 7.0 11.9 Operating leases 452.0 94.5 79.5 69.6 59.8 56.4 92.2 Purchase obligations(3) 703.4 394.2 141.3 69.2 51.8 19.3 27.6 Total(4) $ 5,838.3 $ 1,909.0 $ 608.8 $ 998.0 $ 307.0 $ 228.2 $ 1,787.3 (1) Long term debt due in 2005 includes $852.5 of commercial paper and certain current maturities of notes payable that have been classified as long term debt as of December 31, 2004, as the Company has the intent and ability to refinance such obligations on a long term basis, including, if necessary, by utilizing its unused lines of credit that expire in 2007. (2) Includes the net interest payments on fixed and variable rate debt and associated interest rate swaps. Interest payments associated with floating rate instruments are based on managements best estimate of projected interest rates for the remaining term of variable rate debt. (3) The Company has outstanding purchase obligations with suppliers at the end of 2004 for raw, packaging and other materials in the normal course of business. These purchase obligation amounts represent only those items which are based on agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify minimum quantity, price and term and do not represent total anticipated purchases. 15 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) (4) Long term liabilities associated with the Companys postretirement plans are excluded from the table above due to the uncertainty of the timing of their cash flows. The amount and timing of cash funding related to these benefit plans will generally depend on local regulatory requirements, various economic assumptions (the most significant of which are detailed in Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates below) and voluntary Company contributions. Based on current information, the Company is not required to make any mandatory contributions to its qualified domestic pension plan until 2012. Managements best estimate of cash requirements to be paid directly from the Companys assets for its postretirement plans for the year ending December 31, 2005 is $99, including $55 of expected contributions to the Companys postretirement plans. As more fully described in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company is party to various superfund and other environmental matters in connection with prior acquisitions. Substantially all of these liabilities have been acknowledged in writing as being covered by the Companys insurance carriers which are presently making all their required payments directly to the cleanup efforts and are expected to do so in the future. The Company is also contingently liable with respect to lawsuits, taxes and other matters arising in the ordinary course of business. While it is possible that the Companys cash flows and results of operations in a particular period could be affected by the one time impact of the resolution of such contingencies, it is the opinion of management that the ultimate disposition of these matters, to the extent not previously provided for, will not have a material impact on the financial position, results of operations or ongoing cash flows of the Company. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company does not have off balance sheet financing or unconsolidated special purpose entities. Managing Foreign Currency, Interest Rate and Commodity Price Exposure The Company is exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity price fluctuations. Volatility relating to these exposures is managed on a global basis by utilizing a number of techniques, including working capital management, selective borrowings in local currencies and entering into certain derivative instrument transactions in accordance with the Companys treasury and risk management policies. The Companys treasury and risk management policies prohibit the use of leveraged derivatives or derivatives for trading purposes. With operations in over 200 countries and territories, the Company is exposed to currency fluctuation related to manufacturing and selling its products in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The major foreign currency exposures involve the markets in the European Union and certain Latin American countries, although all regions of the world are subject to foreign currency changes versus the U.S. dollar. The Company actively monitors its foreign currency exposures in these markets and has been able to substantially offset the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements through a combination of cost containment measures, selling price increases and foreign currency hedging of certain costs. The Company primarily utilizes currency forward and swap contracts to hedge portions of its exposures relating to foreign currency purchases and assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business. From time to time, the Company hedges certain of its forecasted foreign currency purchases using forward contracts with durations no greater than 18 months. Interest rate swaps and debt issuances are utilized to manage the Companys targeted mix of fixed and floating rate debt and to minimize significant fluctuations in earnings and cash flows that may result from interest rate volatility. 16 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) The Company is exposed to price volatility related to raw materials used in production. Futures contracts are used on a limited basis to manage volatility related to anticipated raw material inventory purchases. The results of the Companys commodity hedging activities are not material. The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to the financial instrument contracts held by the Company; however, nonperformance by these counterparties is considered remote as it is the Companys policy to contract with diversified counterparties that have a long term debt rating of AA /Aa3 or higher. Value at Risk The Companys risk management procedures include the monitoring of interest rate and foreign exchange exposures and hedge positions utilizing statistical analyses of cash flows, market value and sensitivity analysis. However, the use of these techniques to quantify the market risk of such instruments should not be construed as an endorsement of their accuracy or the accuracy of the related assumptions. Market exposures are evaluated using a value at risk (VAR) model and an earnings at risk (EAR) model that are intended to measure the maximum potential loss in interest rate and foreign exchange financial instruments, assuming adverse market conditions occur, given a 95% confidence level. Historical interest rates and foreign exchange rates are used to estimate the volatility and correlation of future rates. The estimated maximum potential one day loss in fair value of interest rate or foreign exchange rate instruments, calculated using the VAR model, is not material to the consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows of the Company in 2004 and 2003. The estimated maximum yearly loss in earnings due to interest rate or foreign exchange rate instruments, calculated utilizing the EAR model, is not material to the Companys results of operations in 2004 and 2003. Actual results in the future may differ materially from these projected results due to actual developments in the global financial markets. For information regarding the Companys accounting policies for financial instruments and description of financial instrument activities, refer to Notes 2 and 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 123R, Share Based Payment, replacing SFAS No. 123 and superseding Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25. SFAS 123R requires public companies to recognize compensation expense for the cost of awards of equity compensation effective July 1, 2005. This compensation cost will be measured as the fair value of the award estimated using an option pricing model on the grant date. The Company is currently evaluating the various transition provisions under SFAS 123R and will adopt SFAS 123R effective July 1, 2005, which is expected to result in increased compensation expense in future periods. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the AJCA) was enacted on October 22, 2004. Among other provisions, the AJCA repeals an export incentive, creates a new deduction for qualified domestic manufacturing activities, and includes a special one time deduction of 85% of certain foreign earnings repatriated to the U.S. The AJCA did not impact the Companys 2004 Consolidated Financial Statements. The FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) 109 1, Application of FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, to the Tax Deduction on Qualified Production Activities Provided by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (FSP FAS 109 1) on December 21, 2004. In accordance with FSP FAS 109 1, the Company will treat the deduction for qualified domestic manufacturing activities as a reduction of the income tax provision in future years as realized. The deduction for qualified domestic manufacturing activities did not impact the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements in 2004, and this deduction combined with the phase out of the export incentive is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys effective tax rate in 2005. 17 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) In December 2004, the FASB issued FSP FAS 109 2, Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (FSP FAS 109 2), allowing companies additional time to evaluate the effect of the AJCA on plans for reinvestment or repatriation of foreign earnings. Management is currently evaluating recent tax law changes under the AJCA that create a temporary incentive for U.S. corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned abroad by providing an 85% dividends received deduction for certain qualifying dividends. Currently, uncertainty remains as to how to interpret certain provisions under the AJCA. As such, the Company has not concluded its analysis to determine whether, and to what extent, it might repatriate foreign earnings. Based on the analysis to date, however, it is possible that the Company may repatriate approximately $500 under the provisions of the AJCA. While substantial uncertainty remains, the Company has presently estimated that the associated tax cost of this amount could range from $15 to $50. The Company expects to be in a position to finalize the assessment within a reasonable amount of time after the issuance of clarifying U.S. Treasury or Congressional guidance. Refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements requires management to use judgment and make estimates. The level of uncertainty in estimates and assumptions increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions are completed. Actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates. The accounting policies that are most critical in the preparation of the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements are those that are both important to the presentation of the Companys financial condition and results of operations and require significant or complex judgments and estimates on the part of management. The Companys critical accounting policies are reviewed periodically with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. In certain instances, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America allow for the selection of alternative accounting methods. The Companys significant policies that involve the selection of alternative methods are accounting for stock options, shipping and handling costs, and inventories. At December 31, 2004, two alternative methods for accounting for stock options were available, the intrinsic value method and the fair value method. The Company uses the intrinsic value method of accounting for stock options, and accordingly, no compensation expense has been recognized. Under the fair value method, the determination of the pro forma amounts involves several assumptions including option term until exercise and future stock price volatility. If the fair value method were used, diluted earnings per share for 2004, 2003 and 2002 would have decreased approximately 3%. As noted above, effective July 1, 2005, SFAS 123R will require all companies issuing stock options to implement the fair value method and recognize compensation expense for stock options granted. (Refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.) Shipping and handling costs may be reported as either a component of cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses. The Company reports such costs, primarily related to warehousing and outbound freight, in the Consolidated Statements of Income as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses. Accordingly, the Companys gross profit margin is not comparable with the gross profit margin of those companies that include shipping and handling charges in cost of sales. If such costs had been included in cost of sales, gross profit margin as a percent to sales would have decreased from 55.1% to 47.9% in 2004 with no impact on reported earnings. The Company accounts for inventories using both the first in, first out (FIFO) method (80% of inventories) and the last in, first out (LIFO) method (20% of inventories). There would have been no impact on reported earnings for 2004, 2003 and 2002 had all inventories been accounted for under the FIFO method. 18 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) The areas of accounting that involve significant or complex judgments and estimates are pensions and other postretirement benefits, asset impairment, tax valuation allowances, and legal and other contingencies. In pension accounting, the most significant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate and the long term rate of return on plan assets. The discount rate for domestic plans was 5.75%, 6.25% and 6.75% as of December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. As required, the discount rate is based upon published year end rates on high quality bonds. The assumed long term rate of return on plan assets for domestic plans was 8.0% as of December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002. In determining the long term rate of return, the Company considers the nature of the plans investments, an expectation for the plans investment strategies and the historical rates of return. A 1% change in either the discount rate or the assumed rate on plan assets would impact Net income by approximately $8. A third assumption is the long term rate of compensation increase, a change in which would partially offset the impact of a change in either the discount rate or the long term rate of return. This rate was 4.0%, 4.25% and 4.25% as of December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The most judgmental assumption in accounting for other postretirement benefits is the medical cost trend rate. In 2004, the assumed rate of increase was 10.0% for 2005 and declining 1% per year until reaching the ultimate assumed rate of increase of 5% per year. The effect of a 1% increase in the assumed long term medical cost trend rate would reduce Net income by approximately $3.2. Asset impairment analysis performed for goodwill and intangible assets requires several estimates including future cash flows, growth rates and the selection of a discount rate. Since the estimated fair value of the Companys intangible assets substantially exceeds the recorded book value, significant changes in these estimates would have to occur to result in an impairment charge related to these assets. Asset impairment analysis related to certain fixed assets in connection with the 2004 Restructuring Program requires managements best estimate of net realizable value. Tax valuation allowances are established to reduce tax assets such as tax loss carryforwards, to net realizable value. Factors considered in estimating net realizable value include historical results by tax jurisdiction, carryforward periods, income tax strategies and forecasted taxable income. A significant change to the Companys valuation allowances would primarily impact equity and would not materially impact reported earnings. Legal and other contingency reserves are based on managements assessment of the risk of potential loss, which includes consultation with outside legal counsel and advisors. Such assessments are reviewed each period and revised, based on current facts and circumstances, if necessary. While it is possible that the Companys cash flows and results of operations in a particular quarter or year could be affected by the one time impacts of the resolution of such contingencies, it is the opinion of management that the ultimate disposition of these matters, to the extent not previously provided for, will not have a material impact on the Companys financial position, results of operations or ongoing cash flows. (Refer to Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Companys contingencies.) The Company generates revenue through the sale of well known consumer products to trade customers under established trading terms. While the recognition of revenue and receivables requires the use of estimates, there is a short time frame (typically less than 60 days) between the shipment of product and cash receipt, thereby reducing the level of uncertainty in these estimates. (Refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further description of the Companys significant accounting policies.) 19 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Outlook In 2004, Net sales grew 7.0% driven by strong volume growth of 5.5%, despite increased competition in several of the Companys key markets. These gains were driven by increased advertising and promotional support in key categories and markets, in line with the Companys strategy to invest in its higher margin businesses. At the same time, however, raw and packing material costs increased. The combined increase in these costs and the higher advertising and promotional spending more than offset savings generated during the year by the Companys ongoing global cost reduction programs. As a result, Operating profit for the year declined 2%, which included a $68.7 charge in connection with the four year restructuring and business building plan the Company began implementing in December 2004. The 2004 Restructuring Program is designed to enhance the Companys global leadership position in its core businesses. As part of the 2004 Restructuring Program, the Company anticipates streamlining its global supply chain, reallocating resources with an increase and upgrade in the sales, marketing and new product organizations in high potential developing and other key markets and the consolidation of these organizations in certain mature markets. Looking forward into 2005, while the Company expects market conditions to remain highly competitive, it believes it is well positioned for continued growth. It anticipates continuing to prioritize its investments in key categories and markets in order to further strengthen its competitive position and build market share. The savings and benefits from the 2004 Restructuring Program, along with the Companys other ongoing cost savings initiatives, are anticipated to provide additional funds for investment in support of key categories and new product development while also supporting an increased level of profitability. However, as noted above, the Company operates in a highly competitive global marketplace that is experiencing increased trade concentration and industry consolidation. In addition, changes in economic conditions, movements in commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates can impact future operating results as measured in U.S. dollars. In particular, economic and political uncertainty in some countries in Latin America and changes in the value of Latin American and European currencies may impact the overall results of these regions. Historically, the consumer products industry has been less susceptible to changes in economic growth than many other industries. Over the long term, Colgates continued focus on its consumer products business and the strength of its global brand names, its broad international presence in both developed and developing markets, and its strong capital base all position the Company to take advantage of growth opportunities and to increase profitability and shareholder value. Cautionary Statement on Forward Looking Statements In this report and from time to time, the Company may make statements that constitute or contain forward looking information as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 or by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission in its rules, regulations and releases. Such statements may relate, for example, to sales or volume growth, earnings growth, financial goals, cost reduction plans, estimated charges and savings associated with the 2004 Restructuring Program, and new product introductions among other matters. The Company cautions investors that any such forward looking statements made by the Company are not guarantees of future performance and that actual results may differ materially from anticipated results or expectations expressed in the Companys forward looking statements. The following are some of the factors that could impact the Companys business and cause actual results to differ materially from forward looking statements: 1. Global Economic Conditions. The Company operates on a global basis, with approximately 70% of its net sales coming from operations outside the U.S. The Company is subject to the full range of economic risks, particularly those associated with international operations. These economic risks include recession, inflation, access to capital markets, movements in currency exchange rates and interest rates, return on pension assets, tax law changes, political and legal instability, the imposition of trade restrictions and similar factors beyond the control of the Company. 20 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) 2. Competition. The Company faces vigorous competition from multinational consumer product companies throughout the world with the same or greater resources than the Company. Such competition is based on pricing of products, promotional activities, advertising, new product introductions, electronic commerce initiatives and other activities of competitors, the timing and scale of which cannot be foreseen by the Company. The Companys ability to compete also depends on the strength of its brands, its ability to attract and retain key talent, and its ability to protect its patent, trademark and trade dress rights and to defend against related challenges brought by competitors. 3. Retail Trade. The Company can be negatively affected by changes in the policies of its retail trade customers, such as inventory de stocking, limitations on access to shelf space, electronic data transmission requirements and other conditions. With the growing trend toward retail trade consolidation, especially in developed markets such as the U.S. and Europe, the Company is increasingly dependent on key retailers, and these retailers, including large format retailers, have increasingly greater bargaining strength and are reducing their inventory levels. In addition, private label brands sold by retail trade chains are a source of competition for certain product lines of the Company. 4. Products. The Companys growth depends on the successful development and introduction of new products and line extensions, which face the uncertainty of retail and consumer acceptance and reaction from competitors, as well as the continued success of existing products. In addition, the Companys ability to create new products and line extensions and to sustain existing products is affected by its ability to develop technological innovations, to receive and maintain necessary patent and trademark protection, to obtain governmental approvals and registrations of regulated products, to comply with FDA and other governmental regulations and to anticipate successfully consumer needs and preferences. 5. Cost Pressures. The Companys ability to manage its cost structure can be adversely affected by movements in commodity and other raw material prices such as those experienced during 2004, and by unanticipated delays or difficulties in achieving cost efficiencies in manufacturing and distribution. In addition, the Companys move to global suppliers, to achieve cost reductions and simplify its business, has resulted in an increasing dependence on key suppliers. For certain materials, new suppliers may have to be qualified under industry and government standards, which can require additional investment and take some period of time. 6. 2004 Restructuring Program. In December 2004, the Company commenced the 2004 Restructuring Program, a four year restructuring and business building program to enhance the Companys global leadership position in its core businesses. This program presents significant organizational challenges and in many cases will require successful negotiations with third parties, including labor organizations. There can be no assurance that the 2004 Restructuring Program will be completed in accordance with the planned timetable, that the actual charges incurred will not exceed the estimated charges or that the full extent of the expected savings will be realized. 7. Manufacturing. As a company engaged in manufacturing on a global scale, the Company is subject to the risks inherent in such activities, including industrial accidents, environmental events, strikes and other labor disputes, disruptions in logistics, loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites, product quality, safety, licensing requirements and other regulatory issues, as well as natural disasters and other external factors over which the Company has no control. 8. Acquisitions. From time to time the Company makes strategic acquisitions, such as the June 2004 acquisition of GABA. Acquisitions have inherent risks, such as obtaining necessary regulatory approvals, retaining key personnel, integration of the acquired business, and achievement of planned synergies and projections. 21 Table of Contents ITEM 7A.
