ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Executive Overview Colgate Palmolive Company seeks to deliver strong, consistent business results and superior shareholder returns by providing consumers, on a global basis, with products that make their lives healthier and more enjoyable. To this end, the Company is tightly focused on two product segments: Oral, Personal and Home Care; and Pet Nutrition. Within these segments, the Company follows a closely defined business strategy to develop and increase market leadership positions in key product categories. These product categories are prioritized based on their capacity to maximize the use of the organizations core competencies and strong global equities and to deliver sustainable long term growth. Operationally, the Company is organized along geographic lines with specific regional management teams having responsibility for the financial results in each region. The Company competes in more than 200 countries and territories worldwide, with established businesses in all regions contributing to the Companys sales and profitability. This geographic diversity and balance helps to reduce the Companys exposure to business and other risks in any one country or part of the world. The Oral, Personal and Home Care segment is operated through four reportable operating segments, North America, Latin America, Europe and Asia/Africa, which sell to a variety of retail and wholesale customers and distributors. In the Pet Nutrition segment, Hills also competes on a worldwide basis selling its products principally through the veterinary profession and specialty pet retailers. On an ongoing basis, management focuses on a variety of key indicators to monitor business health and performance. These indicators include market share, sales (including volume, pricing and foreign exchange components), gross profit margin, operating profit, net income and earnings per share; and measures to optimize the management of working capital, capital expenditures, cash flow and return on capital. The monitoring of these indicators, as well as the Companys corporate governance practices (including the Companys Code of Conduct), are used to ensure that business health and strong internal controls are maintained. To achieve its financial objectives, the Company focuses the organization on initiatives to drive growth and to fund growth. The Company seeks to capture significant opportunities for growth by identifying and meeting consumer needs within its core categories, in particular by deploying valuable consumer and shopper insights in the development of successful new products regionally which are then rolled out on a global basis. Growth opportunities are enhanced in those areas of the world in which economic development and rising consumer incomes expand the size and number of markets for the Companys products. The investments needed to fund this growth are developed through continuous, corporate wide initiatives to lower costs and increase effective asset utilization. The Company also continues to prioritize its investments toward its higher margin businesses, specifically Oral Care, Personal Care and Pet Nutrition. In June 2004, the Company completed its acquisition of GABA Holding AG (GABA), a privately owned European oral care company headquartered in Switzerland. Also, consistent with the Companys strategy to prioritize higher margin businesses, the Company divested its North American and Southeast Asian heavy duty laundry detergent brands in the third and fourth quarter of 2005, respectively, and certain Latin American and European laundry detergent brands during 2004 and 2003, respectively. In December 2004, the Company commenced a four year restructuring and business building program to enhance the Companys global leadership position in its core businesses (the 2004 Restructuring Program). As part of the 2004 Restructuring Program, the Company anticipates the rationalization of approximately one third of its manufacturing facilities, closure of certain warehousing facilities and an estimated 12% workforce 11 (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) reduction. The cost of implementing the 2004 Restructuring Program is estimated to result in cumulative pretax charges, once all phases are approved and implemented, totaling between $750 and $900 ($550 and $650 aftertax). Savings are projected to be in the range of $325 $400 ($250 $300 aftertax) annually by 2008. Given the continued competitive marketplace and high raw and packaging material and energy costs, the Company anticipates that the near term operating environment will remain challenging. However, the savings and benefits from the 2004 Restructuring Program along with the Companys other ongoing cost savings and growth initiatives are anticipated to provide additional funds for investment in support of key categories and new product development while also supporting an increased level of profitability. Results of Operations Net Sales Worldwide sales were $11,396.9 in 2005. Sales increased 7.5% driven by volume gains of 5.5%, an increase in net selling prices of 0.5% and a positive foreign exchange impact of 1.5%. The June 2004 acquisition of GABA contributed 1.0% to worldwide sales and volume growth. Excluding the divestment of non core product lines, sales increased 8.5% on volume growth of 6.5%. Sales in the Oral, Personal and Home Care segment were $9,876.7, up 8.0% from 2004 on volume growth of 5.5%, increases in net selling prices of 0.5% and a 2.0% positive impact of foreign exchange. Excluding divestments, sales in this segment increased 9.0% on volume growth of 6.5%. Sales in Pet Nutrition grew 6.0% to $1,520.2, driven by volume growth of 4.0%, an increase in net selling prices of 1.5% and positive foreign exchange of 0.5%. In 2004, worldwide sales increased 7.0% to $10,584.2 on volume growth of 5.5%, a decrease in net selling prices of 1.5% and a positive foreign exchange impact of 3.0%. Gross Profit Gross profit margin was 54.4% in 2005, 55.1% in 2004 and 55.0% in 2003. The reduction in gross profit during 2005 is driven primarily by costs associated with the Companys ongoing 2004 Restructuring Program. Restructuring charges of $100.2, which related to accelerated depreciation and certain employee termination benefits under the 2004 Restructuring Program, were included in Cost of sales. These charges reduced gross profit margin by approximately 90 basis points (bps) for the year ended 2005. The benefits from higher pricing, the Companys shift towards higher margin oral care products and cost saving programs in 2005 more than offset the impact of higher raw and packaging material costs. The increase in 2004 from the 2003 level was driven by the Companys focus on its high margin oral and personal care businesses, savings from global sourcing, the regionalization of manufacturing facilities and other cost reduction initiatives, despite an increase in worldwide materials costs. For additional information regarding the Companys 2004 Restructuring Program, refer to Restructuring Activities below and Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were 34.4% in 2005, 34.2% in 2004 and 33.3% in 2003. Advertising expense increased by 12% in 2005, an increase of 40 bps as a percent of sales, on top of a 10% increase in 2004. Included in Selling, general and administrative expenses is advertising spending of $1,193.6, $1,063.0 and $965.6 in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, supporting new product 12 (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) launches and helping increase market shares throughout the world. Despite the 40 bps increase in advertising, Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales in 2005 only increased by a net 20 bps as ongoing cost savings programs more than offset increases in shipping and handling costs (30 bps) and selling and marketing costs (10 bps). The increase as a percent of sales in 2004 as compared with 2003 resulted from increases in advertising spending (30 bps), selling and marketing costs (30 bps) and shipping and handling costs (20 bps). Other (Income) Expense, Net Other (income) expense, net was $69.2, $90.3 and ($15.0) in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The components of Other (income) expense, net are presented below: 2005 2004 2003 Minority interest $ 55.3 $ 47.9 $ 45.2 Amortization of intangible assets 15.6 14.3 12.3 Equity (income) (2.0 ) (8.5 ) (0.3 ) Gains on sales of non core product lines, net (147.9 ) (26.7 ) (107.2 ) 2004 Restructuring Program 80.8 65.3 2003 restructuring activities 2.8 59.3 Pension and other postretirement charges 34.0 Investment losses (income) 19.7 (8.7 ) (39.6 ) Other, net 13.7 3.9 15.3 $ 69.2 $ 90.3 $ (15.0 ) Other (income) expense, net in 2005 included a gain of $147.9 on the sale of heavy duty laundry detergent businesses in North America and Southeast Asia, which was partially offset by charges related to the Companys 2004 Restructuring Program of $80.8 and pension and other postretirement charges of $34.0. The charges associated with certain pension and other postretirement obligations were primarily a result of the conversion of one of the Companys international pension plans to a defined contribution plan for all eligible participants and a lump sum payment of normal retirement benefits associated with a retirement plan in the U.S. as required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 88, Employers Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits (SFAS 88). Investment losses (income) consists primarily of gains and losses on foreign currency contracts, which are economic hedges of certain foreign currency debt, but do not qualify for hedge accounting. Other (income) expense, net in 2004 included charges of $65.3 related to the Companys 2004 Restructuring Program and a gain of $26.7 on the sale of certain detergent businesses in Latin America. Other (income) expense, net in 2003 included gains of $107.2 related to the sale of non core brands partially offset by $59.3 of costs related to the regionalization of manufacturing facilities. Operating Profit In 2005, Operating profit increased 4% to $2,215.0 after a 2% decline in 2004 to $2,122.1 from $2,166.0 in 2003. All years presented benefited from sales growth and cost savings initiatives. The gain on sale of non core product lines recognized in 2005 and 2004 was more than offset by pretax restructuring charges related to the Companys 2004 Restructuring Program of $182.8 and $68.7 in 2005 and 2004, respectively, as well as other business realignment costs of $19.7 in 2004. For additional information regarding the Companys 2004 Restructuring Program, refer to Restructuring Activities below and Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 13 (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Interest Expense, Net Interest expense, net was $136.0 in 2005 compared with $119.7 in 2004 and $124.1 in 2003. Higher interest rates and higher average debt levels primarily to finance the GABA acquisition have resulted in increased interest expense in 2005. In 2004 low interest rates allowed the Company to lower its interest expense despite increased debt levels resulting from the GABA acquisition. Income Taxes The effective income tax rate was 35.0% in 2005 versus 33.7% in 2004 and 30.4% in 2003. The higher tax rate in 2005 is due to $40.9 of income taxes (200 bps) for the incremental repatriation of $780 of foreign earnings related to the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the AJCA) as well as the impact (130 bps) of the lower effective benefit rate on charges incurred in connection with the Companys 2004 Restructuring Program. These increases were partially offset by the Companys global tax planning strategies which are reflected principally in overseas earnings being taxed at lower rates. The increase in 2004 is due in part to changes in the mix of income in foreign tax rate jurisdictions and increased costs of remittances, while the effective tax rate was reduced in 2003 through the realization of tax credits and incentives, and as a result of global tax planning strategies including overseas asset revaluations. The impact of the 2004 Restructuring Program on the effective income tax rate for an individual period will depend upon the projects and the related tax jurisdictions involved. Since the majority of restructuring costs have been incurred in low tax jurisdictions, the tax benefit derived from the charges incurred in 2005 and 2004 for the 2004 Restructuring Program was at a rate of 20.6% and 30.1%, respectively. Over its duration, charges associated with the 2004 Restructuring Program are projected to generate tax benefits at a rate between 25% and 30%. For additional information refer to Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Net Income Net income was $1,351.4 in 2005 or $2.43 per share on a diluted basis compared with $1,327.1 in 2004 or $2.33 per share and $1,421.3 in 2003 or $2.46 per share. As discussed above, Net income in 2005 was impacted by a net aftertax charge of $115.2 ($0.21 per share) resulting from restructuring charges, gains on sales of certain non core brands, income tax expense for the incremental repatriation of foreign earnings related to the AJCA and certain pension charges. Net income in 2004 includes an aftertax charge of $48.0 ($0.09 per share) associated with the initial phase of the 2004 Restructuring Program. Segment Results The Company markets its products in over 200 countries and territories throughout the world in two distinct business segments: Oral, Personal and Home Care; and Pet Nutrition. Segment performance is evaluated based on several factors, including operating profit. The Company uses operating profit as a measure of operating segment performance because it excludes the impact of corporate driven decisions related to restructuring and related costs, interest expense, income taxes, and gains and losses on sales of non core brands and assets. 14 (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Worldwide Net Sales by Business Segment and Geographic Region 2005 2004 2003 Oral, Personal and Home Care North America(1) $ 2,509.8 $ 2,378.7 $ 2,356.2 Latin America 2,623.8 2,266.0 2,179.5 Europe 2,739.4 2,621.3 2,304.1 Asia/Africa 2,003.7 1,885.1 1,747.5 Total Oral, Personal and Home Care 9,876.7 9,151.1 8,587.3 Pet Nutrition(2) 1,520.2 1,433.1 1,316.1 Net Sales $ 11,396.9 $ 10,584.2 $ 9,903.4 (1) Net sales in the U.S. for Oral, Personal and Home Care were $2,124.2, $2,000.3 and $1,986.9 in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

In 2004, Operating profit in Latin America increased 2% to $627.7 reflecting increased sales and gross profit margins partially offset by higher advertising spending and shipping and handling costs. Europe Net sales in Europe increased 4.5% to $2,739.4 on 6.0% volume growth, a 0.5% positive impact of stronger currencies, and a 2.0% decline in net selling prices. Excluding divestments, net sales increased 5.0% on volume gains of 6.5%. The June 2004 acquisition of GABA contributed 4.0% to European sales and volume growth. Volume gains achieved at GABA and in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Denmark, Spain, Russia, Turkey, Ukraine, Romania, the Adria region, Poland and the Baltic States more than offset challenging economic conditions in Italy, France and Germany. New products which contributed to these gains include Colgate Sensitive Plus Whitening, Colgate Oxygen and Colgate Max Fresh toothpastes, Colgate 360&deg; manual toothbrush and Colgate MicroSonic battery powered toothbrush. Growth in the region was also driven by strong sales of Colgate Total, Colgate Cavity Protection Extra Mint and Colgate Sensitive toothpastes and Colgate Smiles line of manual toothbrushes for kids.

Operating profit in Pet Nutrition grew 6% to $412.8 in 2005 on increased sales and gross profit margins partially offset by higher advertising and increased shipping and handling costs. Operating profit for 2004 increased 5% to $389.7 as a result of increased sales and ongoing cost savings initiatives, partially offset by higher advertising spending and a decline in gross profit margin reflecting a sharp rise in commodity costs early in the year. Corporate Operating profit (loss) for the Corporate segment was ($306.8), ($274.5) and ($134.6) for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. As previously discussed in Other (income) expense, net, the change in 2005 as compared with the prior year was primarily driven by restructuring charges, gains on sales of certain non core brands and charges relating to certain pension obligations. Corporate operating expenses in 2004 include $68.7 of pretax charges related to the Companys 2004 Restructuring Program and a $26.7 pretax gain on the sale of certain detergent businesses in Latin America. Restructuring Activities 2004 Restructuring Program In December 2004, the Company commenced a four year restructuring and business building program to enhance the Companys global leadership position in its core businesses (the 2004 Restructuring Program). As part of the 2004 Restructuring Program, the Company anticipates streamlining its global supply chain through the rationalization of approximately one third of its manufacturing facilities and the closure of certain warehousing facilities and also plans to centralize its purchasing and other business support functions. Business building initiatives include enhancing and reallocating resources with an increase and upgrade in the sales, marketing and new product organizations in high potential developing and other key markets, and the consolidation of these organizations in certain mature markets. The 2004 Restructuring Program is expected to result in approximately a 12% workforce reduction. The cost of implementing the 2004 Restructuring Program is estimated to result in cumulative pretax charges, once all phases are approved and implemented, totaling between $750 and $900 ($550 and $650 aftertax). The estimated cost in 2006 is $300 $350 ($225 $250 aftertax). Savings are projected to be in the range of $325 $400 ($250 $300 aftertax) annually by the fourth year of the program. Over the course of the four year 2004 Restructuring Program, it is estimated that approximately 50% 60% of the charges will result in cash expenditures. While the Companys initial estimates remain unchanged, charges and savings may vary in a given year. Managements estimates of the cost and savings associated with the 2004 Restructuring Program are forward looking statements and are subject to revision over time. 17 (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) During 2004, in connection with the initial phase of the program, the Company announced the closing or reconfiguration of eight manufacturing facilities in North America, Asia/Africa, Europe and Latin America and the realignment of marketing and sales organizations in Europe and Asia/Africa. During 2005, the Company commenced additional projects the more significant of which related to changes being implemented in its European and North American manufacturing networks. These changes will allow the Company to more cost effectively manufacture toothpaste, taking advantage of state of the art technologies, and obtain cost savings through the transfer of bar soap manufacturing to an established U.S. third party. The Company plans to consolidate toothpaste production in Europe, which is currently located at five company sites, into a new state of the art manufacturing facility in Europe. Upon completion of the consolidation project over two years, toothpaste manufacturing is expected to cease at the Companys facilities in Salford, United Kingdom; Anzio, Italy; Brasov, Romania; Gebze, Turkey; and Halinow, Poland. Other manufacturing activities will continue at these sites, except the Salford facility, which is expected to be closed. In North America, the Company plans to phase down production at its Jeffersonville, Indiana plant over the next two years, with all production expected to cease by January 2008. The plan calls for transferring production of the Companys market leading Colgate Total toothpaste to a new state of the art facility to be built in Morristown, Tennessee, and the relocation of other production and administrative services currently performed at Jeffersonville to other facilities. Additionally, the Companys Kansas City, Kansas facility, where bar soap is currently produced, is expected to be closed in late 2006 after all production is transitioned to an established U.S. third party manufacturer. Since the inception of the 2004 Restructuring Program in December 2004, the Company has incurred total charges of $251.5 ($193.1 aftertax) in connection with the implementation of various projects. The majority of costs incurred to date relate to the following significant projects: the consolidation of toothpaste production in Europe; exiting certain manufacturing activities in other categories in Portugal, Belgium, Denmark, Canada and Kansas City; and a realignment of the sales and administrative functions in Germany. In the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company incurred $182.8 ($145.1 aftertax) of charges in connection with restructuring and implementation related activities, as detailed below: Year Ended December 31, 2005 Termination Benefits Incremental Depreciation AssetImpairments Other Total Restructuring accrual at December 31, 2004 $ 41.7 $ $ $ 0.4 $ 42.1 Charges 45.8 65.3 30.2 41.5 182.8 Cash payments (47.8 ) (23.4 ) (71.2 ) Non cash activity (65.3 ) (30.2 ) (15.0 ) (110.5 ) Foreign exchange (4.4 ) (0.1 ) (4.5 ) Restructuring accrual at December 31, 2005 $ 35.3 $ $ $ 3.4 $ 38.7 Charges in the period related to restructuring activities in Europe (48%), North America (29%), Latin America (4%), Asia/Africa (11%), Pet Nutrition (1%) and Corporate (7%) and are reflected in the Corporate segment in the Consolidated Statements of Income in Cost of sales ($100.2), Selling, general and administrative expenses ($1.8) and Other (income) expense, net ($80.8). 18 (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) During 2004 the Company incurred $68.7 ($48.0 aftertax) of charges in connection with the initial phase of the 2004 Restructuring Program, as detailed below: Year Ended December 31, 2004 Termination Benefits Incremental Depreciation AssetImpairments Other Total Charges $ 41.6 $ 3.3 $ 22.0 $ 1.8 $ 68.7 Cash payments (1.4 ) (1.4 ) (2.8 ) Non cash activity (3.3 ) (22.0 ) (25.3 ) Foreign exchange 1.5 1.5 Restructuring accrual at December 31, 2004 $ 41.7 $ $ $ 0.4 $ 42.1 Charges in the period related to restructuring activities in Europe (51%), North America (25%), Latin America (9%), Asia/Africa (7%) and Corporate (8%) and are reflected in the Corporate segment in the Consolidated Statements of Income in Cost of sales ($3.4) and Other (income) expense, net ($65.3). 2003 Restructuring Activities In connection with the European brand divestments during 2003 and the Companys ongoing focus on the regionalization of manufacturing facilities to streamline and strengthen its operations, the Company realigned certain manufacturing operations and implemented workforce reduction programs primarily in Europe, Latin America and Asia/Africa. The Company incurred $2.8 and $59.3 of costs in 2004 and 2003, respectively, related to these restructuring activities which were substantially complete at the end of 2004. Costs for these restructuring activities are reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Income in Other (income) expense, net primarily in the Corporate segment. Liquidity and Capital Resources Net cash provided by operations in 2005 was $1,784.4 as compared with $1,754.3 in 2004 and $1,767.7 in 2003. The increase in 2005 reflects the Companys improved profitability and working capital management despite $38.0 of increased spending related to restructuring activities. The Companys working capital as a percentage of sales decreased to 1.7% of sales in 2005 as compared with 2.4% of sales in 2004. The Company defines working capital as the difference between current assets (excluding cash and marketable securities, the latter of which is reported in other current assets) and current liabilities (excluding short term debt). As a result of an increased focus on working capital management, the Companys receivable days sales outstanding and inventory days coverage improved from 2004. Additionally, working capital at December 31, 2005 includes an increase of approximately $40 of accrued liabilities related to taxes and other costs associated with the Companys sale of certain non core brands in 2005. Investing activities used $220.7 of cash during 2005 compared with $1,090.4 and $117.6 during 2004 and 2003, respectively, with the 2004 period reflecting the Companys acquisition of GABA. In 2005, the Company increased its ownership interests in certain overseas subsidiaries to 100% at a cost of $38.5, primarily related to its Malaysia subsidiary. Investing activities in 2005 reflect $215.6 of proceeds from the sales of the Companys Southeast Asian and North American heavy duty laundry detergent brands, as compared with 2004 which reflects $37.0 of proceeds from the sale of certain non core detergent brands in Latin America, and with 2003 when the Company sold various detergent and certain non core soap brands primarily marketed in Europe for an aggregate sales price of $127.6. Capital expenditures were $389.2, $348.1 and $302.1 for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Capital spending continues to be focused primarily on projects that yield high aftertax returns. As a result of the Companys multi year restructuring and business building program, overall capital expenditures for 2006 are expected to increase to a rate of approximately 4.0% to 4.5% of Net sales. 19 (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Financing activities used $1,524.4 of cash during 2005 compared with a use of $611.1 and $1,557.2 of cash during 2004 and 2003, respectively. Financing activities in 2005 reflect increases in the common and preference stock dividend payments as well as higher share repurchases associated with the share repurchase program authorized by the Board of Directors in October 2004. Financing activities in 2004 reflect an increased level of proceeds associated with borrowings related to the GABA acquisition. During 2005, long term debt decreased to $3,274.7 from $3,540.8 in 2004 and total debt decreased to $3,446.2 in 2005 from $3,675.1 in 2004. The Companys long term debt is rated AA by Standard & Poors and Aa3 by Moodys Investors Service. Commercial paper outstanding was $621.8 and $844.7 as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, is denominated in U.S. dollars, Swiss francs and Canadian dollars. The maximum commercial paper outstanding during 2005 and 2004 was $1,715 and $1,519, respectively. These borrowings carry a Standard & Poors rating of A 1+ and a Moodys rating of P 1. The commercial paper and certain current maturities of notes payable totaling $641.9 are classified as long term debt at December 31, 2005, as the Company has the intent and ability to refinance such obligations on a long term basis, including, if necessary, by utilizing its lines of credit that expire in 2010. The ESOP notes guaranteed by the Company and certain credit facilities contain cross default provisions. Noncompliance with these requirements could ultimately result in the acceleration of amounts owed. The Company is in full compliance with all such requirements and believes the likelihood of noncompliance is remote. The Company had a financing subsidiary with outside equity investors the purpose of which was to purchase some of the Companys receivables thereby giving the Company access to additional sources of capital. The subsidiary, including such receivables, was consolidated and the amounts invested by outside investors were reported as a minority interest. During 2005, the subsidiary ceased operations resulting in a cash payment to the outside investors of $89.7. The Company repurchases common shares in the open market and in private transactions to maintain its targeted capital structure and to fulfill the requirements of its compensation and benefit plans. In October 2004, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to purchase up to 20 million shares of the Companys common stock through December 31, 2005 (the 2004 Program) and, in December 2005, the Board of Directors extended this authorization through March 31, 2006. It is anticipated that the remaining 2.5 million shares under the current program will be repurchased in the first quarter of 2006 and that the Company will implement a new stock repurchase program to take effect upon the conclusion of the 2004 Program. Aggregate repurchases for 2005, including repurchases under the 2004 Program and other Board authorizations, were 15.1 million common shares for a total purchase price of $796.2. Aggregate repurchases for 2004 were 12.4 million common shares for a total purchase price of $637.9. In 2003, 10.2 million common shares and 0.1 million shares of preferred stock were repurchased for a total purchase price of $554.9. Dividend payments in 2005 were $607.2, up from $536.2 in 2004 and $506.8 in 2003. Common stock dividend payments increased to $1.11 per share in 2005 from $0.96 per share in 2004 and $0.90 per share in 2003. The Series B Preference Stock dividend payments were increased to $8.88 per share in 2005 from $7.68 per share in 2004 and $7.20 per share in 2003. Management currently intends to continue to pay dividends at increasing annual amounts per share from free cash flow. The Company believes that internally generated cash flows are adequate to support business operations and capital expenditures. Free cash flow before dividends was $1,395.2, $1,406.2 and $1,465.6 in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The Company defines free cash flow before dividends as net cash provided by operations less capital expenditures. As management uses this measure to evaluate the Companys ability to satisfy current and future obligations, repurchase stock, pay dividends and fund future business opportunities, the Company believes that it provides useful information to investors. Free cash flow before dividends is not a measure of cash 20 (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) available for discretionary expenditures since the Company has certain nondiscretionary obligations, such as debt service, that are not deducted from the measure. Free cash flow before dividends is not a GAAP measurement and may not be comparable with similarly titled measures reported by other companies. A reconciliation of net cash provided by operations to free cash flow before dividends follows: 2005 2004 2003 Net cash provided by operations $ 1,784.4 $ 1,754.3 $ 1,767.7 Less: Capital expenditures (389.2 ) (348.1 ) (302.1 ) Free cash flow before dividends $ 1,395.2 $ 1,406.2 $ 1,465.6 In December 2004, the Company commenced the 2004 Restructuring Program, a four year restructuring and business building program, to enhance the Companys global leadership position in its core businesses. It is anticipated that cash requirements for the restructuring program will continue to be funded from operating cash flow. The Company has additional sources of liquidity available in the form of lines of credit maintained with various banks and access to financial markets worldwide. The Company believes it has sufficient liquidity to meet its financing needs. At December 31, 2005, the Company had access to unused domestic and foreign lines of credit of approximately $2,400 and also had $1,754.4 of medium term notes available for issuance pursuant to effective shelf registration statements. In November 2005, the Company entered into a new five year revolving credit facility of $1,500.0 with a syndicate of banks. The facility, which expires in November 2010, replaces existing credit facilities of $300.0 and $1,300.0 which were due to expire in December 2005 and May 2007, respectively. These domestic lines are available for general corporate purposes and to support commercial paper issuance. During 2005, the Company also issued 250 million of Swiss franc denominated five year bonds (approximately $190 at the year end exchange rate) at a fixed rate of 1.9%. The following represents the scheduled maturities of the Companys contractual obligations as of December 31, 2005: Total Payments Due by Period 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Thereafter Long term debt including current portion $ 3,239.1 $ 992.8 (1) $ 701.5 $ 153.4 $ 95.2 $ 280.6 $ 1,015.6 Net cash interest payments on long term debt(2) 1,263.0 176.0 104.5 79.1 72.8 64.9 765.7 Capitalized leases 35.6 5.8 6.1 6.2 6.4 6.7 4.4 Operating leases 474.7 94.6 86.0 76.5 68.6 54.2 94.8 Purchase obligations(3) 675.8 427.7 155.1 72.7 6.3 5.7 8.3 Total(4) $ 5,688.2 $ 1,696.9 $ 1,053.2 $ 387.9 $ 249.3 $ 412.1 $ 1,888.8 (1) Long term debt due in 2006 includes $641.9 of commercial paper and certain current maturities of notes payable that have been classified as long term debt as of December 31, 2005, as the Company has the intent and ability to refinance such obligations on a long term basis, including, if necessary, by utilizing its unused lines of credit that expire in 2010. (2) Includes the net interest payments on fixed and variable rate debt and associated interest rate swaps. Interest payments associated with floating rate instruments are based on managements best estimate of projected interest rates for the remaining term of variable rate debt. 21 (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) (3) The Company has outstanding purchase obligations with suppliers at the end of 2005 for raw, packaging and other materials in the normal course of business. These purchase obligation amounts represent only those items which are based on agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify minimum quantity, price and term and do not represent total anticipated purchases. (4) Long term liabilities associated with the Companys postretirement plans are excluded from the table above due to the uncertainty of the timing of these cash disbursements. The amount and timing of cash funding related to these benefit plans will generally depend on local regulatory requirements, various economic assumptions (the most significant of which are detailed in Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates below) and voluntary Company contributions. Based on current information, the Company does not anticipate having to make any mandatory contributions to its qualified U.S. pension plan until 2014. Managements best estimate of cash requirements to be paid directly from the Companys assets for its postretirement plans for the year ending December 31, 2006 is $126. This estimate includes $77 of expected contributions to the Companys postretirement plans, the majority of which relate to voluntary contributions to the U.S. plans. As more fully described in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company is contingently liable with respect to lawsuits, environmental matters, taxes and other matters arising in the ordinary course of business. While it is possible that the Companys cash flows and results of operations in a particular period could be materially affected by the one time impacts of the resolution of such contingencies, it is the opinion of management that the ultimate disposition of these matters will not have a material impact on the Companys financial position, or ongoing results of operations and cash flows. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company does not have off balance sheet financing or unconsolidated special purpose entities. Managing Foreign Currency, Interest Rate and Commodity Price Exposure The Company is exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity price fluctuations. Volatility relating to these exposures is managed on a global basis by utilizing a number of techniques, including working capital management, selective borrowings in local currencies and entering into certain derivative instrument transactions in accordance with the Companys treasury and risk management policies. The Companys treasury and risk management policies prohibit the use of leveraged derivatives or derivatives for trading purposes. With operations in over 200 countries and territories, the Company is exposed to currency fluctuations related to manufacturing and selling its products in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The major foreign currency exposures involve the markets in Europe and certain Latin American countries, although all regions of the world are subject to foreign currency changes versus the U.S. dollar. The Company monitors its foreign currency exposures in these markets through a combination of cost containment measures, selling price increases and foreign currency hedging of certain costs in an effort to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements. The Company primarily utilizes currency forward contracts, cross currency interest rate swaps, local currency deposits and local currency borrowings to hedge portions of its exposures relating to foreign currency purchases and assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business. From time to time, the Company hedges certain of its forecasted foreign currency transactions using forward contracts with durations no greater than 18 months. Interest rate swaps and debt issuances are utilized to manage the Companys targeted mix of fixed and floating rate debt and to minimize significant fluctuations in earnings and cash flows that may result from interest rate volatility. 22 (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) The Company is exposed to price volatility related to raw materials used in production. Futures contracts are used on a limited basis to manage volatility related to anticipated raw material inventory purchases. In 2005 the results of the Companys commodity hedging activities were not material. The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to the financial instrument contracts held by the Company; however, nonperformance by these counterparties is considered remote as it is the Companys policy to contract with diversified counterparties that have a long term debt rating of AA /Aa3 or higher. Value at Risk The Companys risk management procedures include the monitoring of interest rate and foreign exchange exposures and hedge positions utilizing statistical analyses of cash flows, market value and sensitivity analysis. However, the use of these techniques to quantify the market risk of such instruments should not be construed as an endorsement of their accuracy or the accuracy of the related assumptions. Market exposures are evaluated using a value at risk (VAR) model and an earnings at risk (EAR) model that are intended to measure the maximum potential loss in interest rate and foreign exchange financial instruments, assuming adverse market conditions occur, given a 95% confidence level. Historical interest rates and foreign exchange rates are used to estimate the volatility and correlation of future rates. The estimated maximum potential one day loss in fair value of interest rate or foreign exchange rate instruments, calculated using the VAR model, is not material to the consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows of the Company in 2005 and 2004. The estimated maximum yearly loss in earnings due to interest rate or foreign exchange rate instruments, calculated utilizing the EAR model, is not material to the Companys results of operations in 2005 and 2004. Actual results in the future may differ materially from these projected results due to actual developments in the global financial markets. For information regarding the Companys accounting policies for financial instruments and description of financial instrument activities, refer to Notes 2 and 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In November 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 151, Inventory Costs An Amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 43, Chapter 4 (SFAS 151). SFAS 151 clarifies that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and spoilage should be expensed as incurred and not included in overhead. Further, SFAS 151 requires that allocation of fixed production overhead to conversion costs be based on normal capacity of the production facilities. The provisions in SFAS 151 must be applied prospectively to the Companys inventory costs incurred on or after January 1, 2006. The adoption of SFAS 151 is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R, Share Based Payment, (SFAS 123R). SFAS 123R replaces SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation (SFAS 123) by eliminating the choice to account for employee stock options under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees (APB 25), and requires companies to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments, such as stock options and restricted stock, based on the fair value of those awards at the date of grant. Currently under APB 25 the value of restricted stock awards is expensed by the Company over the restriction period and, no compensation expense is recognized for stock option grants as all such grants have an exercise price not less than fair market value on the date of grant. Additionally, certain of the Companys stock options granted to eligible participants have an accelerated vesting feature associated with employee retirement and most of the restricted stock awards specify that 23 (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) participants will continue to vest in the award after retirement. Currently the Company follows the nominal vesting period approach, which requires recognition of the compensation expense over the vesting period except in the instance of the participants actual retirement. Upon the adoption of SFAS 123R, the Companys policy regarding the timing of expense recognition for new awards to employees eligible for retirement will, as required, be changed to recognize compensation cost over the period through the date that the employee first becomes eligible to retire and is no longer required to provide service to earn the award. The Company will adopt the provisions of SFAS 123R effective January 1, 2006 using the modified prospective method which will result in an incremental expense upon adoption. The impact on earnings per share in fiscal year 2006 of these requirements is currently estimated in the range of $0.09 to $0.10. Future expense amounts for any particular quarterly or annual period could be affected by changes in the Companys assumptions or changes in market conditions. Due to the timing of the Companys equity grants the charge will not be spread evenly throughout the year. SFAS 123R also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost be reported as a financing cash flow, rather than as an operating cash flow as currently required, thereby potentially reducing net operating cash flows and increasing net financing cash flows in periods after adoption. Such amounts cannot be estimated for future periods with certainty because they depend largely on when employees will exercise the stock options and the market price of the Companys stock at the time of exercise. Refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements requires management to use judgment and make estimates. The level of uncertainty in estimates and assumptions increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions are completed. Actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates. The accounting policies that are most critical in the preparation of the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements are those that are both important to the presentation of the Companys financial condition and results of operations and require significant or complex judgments and estimates on the part of management. The Companys critical accounting policies are reviewed periodically with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. In certain instances, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America allow for the selection of alternative accounting methods. The Companys significant policies that involve the selection of alternative methods are accounting for stock options, shipping and handling costs, and inventories. During 2005, two alternative methods for accounting for stock options were available, the intrinsic value method and the fair value method. The Company used the intrinsic value method of accounting for stock options, and accordingly, no compensation expense has been recognized. If the fair value method were used, diluted earnings per share for 2005, 2004 and 2003 would have decreased approximately 3%. SFAS 123R will require all companies issuing stock options to implement the fair value method and recognize compensation expense for stock options granted. As noted above, the Company will adopt SFAS 123R effective January 1, 2006 using the modified prospective method. (Refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.) Shipping and handling costs may be reported as either a component of cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses. The Company reports such costs, primarily related to warehousing and outbound freight, in the Consolidated Statements of Income as a component of Selling, general and administrative expenses. Accordingly, the Companys gross profit margin is not comparable with the gross profit margin of those companies that include shipping and handling charges in cost of sales. If such costs had been included in cost of sales, gross profit margin as a percent to sales would have decreased by 750 bps from 54.4% to 46.9% in 2005 and decreased by 720 bps and 710 bps in 2004 and 2003, respectively, with no impact on reported earnings. 24 (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) The Company accounts for inventories using both the first in, first out (FIFO) method (approximately 80% of inventories) and the last in, first out (LIFO) method (20% of inventories). There would have been no material impact on reported earnings for 2005, 2004 and 2003 had all inventories been accounted for under the FIFO method. The areas of accounting that involve significant or complex judgments and estimates are pensions and other postretirement benefits, asset impairment, tax valuation allowances, and legal and other contingencies. In pension accounting, the most significant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate and the long term rate of return on plan assets. The discount rate for U.S. plans was 5.50%, 5.75% and 6.25% as of December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Discount rates used for the U.S. defined benefit and other postretirement plans are based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high quality bonds for which the timing and amount of cash outflows approximate the estimated payouts of the U.S. plans. For the Companys international plans, the discount rates are set by benchmarking against investment grade corporate bonds rated AA or better. The assumed long term rate of return on plan assets for domestic plans was 8.0% as of December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003. In determining the long term rate of return, the Company considers the nature of the plans investments, an expectation for the plans investment strategies and the historical rate of return. The historical rate of return for the U.S. plans for the most recent 15 year period was 9%. In addition, the current rate of return assumption for the U.S. plans is based upon a targeted asset allocation of approximately 35% in fixed income securities (which are expected to earn approximately 6% in the long term), 61% in equity securities (which are expected to earn approximately 10% in the long term) and 4% in real estate and other (which are expected to earn approximately 6% in the long term). A 1% change in either the discount rate or the assumed rate on plan assets of the U.S. pension plans would impact Net income by approximately $10. A third assumption is the long term rate of compensation increase, a change in which would partially offset the impact of a change in either the discount rate or the long term rate of return. This rate was 4.0%, 4.0% and 4.25% as of December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. (Refer to Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.) The most judgmental assumption in accounting for other postretirement benefits is the medical cost trend rate. The Company reviews external data and its own historical trends for health care costs to determine the medical cost trend rate. In 2005, the assumed rate of increase was 10.0% for 2006 and declining 1% per year until reaching the ultimate assumed rate of increase of 5% per year. The effect of a 1% increase in the assumed long term medical cost trend rate would reduce Net income by approximately $4.5. Asset impairment analysis performed for goodwill and intangible assets requires several estimates including future cash flows, growth rates and the selection of a discount rate. Since the estimated fair value of the Companys intangible assets substantially exceeds the recorded book value, significant changes in these estimates would have to occur to result in an impairment charge related to these assets. Asset impairment analysis related to certain fixed assets in connection with the 2004 Restructuring Program requires managements best estimate of net realizable value. Tax valuation allowances are established to reduce tax assets such as tax loss carryforwards, to net realizable value. Factors considered in estimating net realizable value include historical results by tax jurisdiction, carryforward periods, income tax strategies and forecasted taxable income. A significant change to the Companys valuation allowances would primarily impact equity and would not materially impact reported earnings. Legal and other contingency reserves are based on managements assessment of the risk of potential loss, which includes consultation with outside legal counsel and advisors. Such assessments are reviewed each period and revised, based on current facts and circumstances, if necessary. While it is possible that the Companys cash flows and results of operations in a particular quarter or year could be materially 25 (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) affected by the one time impacts of the resolution of such contingencies, it is the opinion of management that the ultimate disposition of these matters will not have a material impact on the Companys financial position, or ongoing results of operations and cash flows. (Refer to Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Companys contingencies.) The Company generates revenue through the sale of well known consumer products to trade customers under established trading terms. While the recognition of revenue and receivables requires the use of estimates, there is a short time frame (typically less than 60 days) between the shipment of product and cash receipt, thereby reducing the level of uncertainty in these estimates. (Refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further description of the Companys significant accounting policies.) Outlook Looking forward into 2006, while the Company expects market conditions to remain highly competitive, it believes it is well positioned for continued growth. It anticipates continuing to prioritize its investments in key categories and markets in order to further strengthen its competitive position and build market share. The 2004 Restructuring Program is designed to enhance the Companys global leadership position in its core businesses. As part of the 2004 Restructuring Program, the Company anticipates streamlining its global supply chain, reallocating resources with an increase and upgrade in the sales, marketing and new product organizations in high potential developing and other key markets and the consolidation of these organizations in certain mature markets. The savings and benefits from the 2004 Restructuring Program, along with the Companys other ongoing cost savings and growth initiatives, are anticipated to provide additional funds for investment in support of key categories and new product development while also supporting an increased level of profitability. However, as noted above, the Company operates in a highly competitive global marketplace that is experiencing increased trade concentration and industry consolidation. In addition, changes in economic conditions, movements in commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates can impact future operating results as measured in U.S. dollars. In particular, economic and political uncertainty in some countries in Latin America and changes in the value of Latin American and European currencies may impact the overall results of these regions. Historically, the consumer products industry has been less susceptible to changes in economic growth than many other industries. Over the long term, Colgates continued focus on its consumer products business and the strength of its global brand names, its broad international presence in both developed and developing markets, and its strong capital base all position the Company to take advantage of growth opportunities and to increase profitability and shareholder value.
