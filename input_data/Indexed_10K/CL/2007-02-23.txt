ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Executive Overview Colgate Palmolive Company seeks to deliver strong, consistent business results and superior shareholder returns by providing consumers, on a global basis, with products that make their lives healthier and more enjoyable. To this end, the Company is tightly focused on two product segments: Oral, Personal and Home Care; and Pet Nutrition. Within these segments, the Company follows a closely defined business strategy to develop and increase market leadership positions in key product categories. These product categories are prioritized based on their capacity to maximize the use of the organizations core competencies and strong global equities and to deliver sustainable long term growth. Operationally, the Company is organized along geographic lines with specific regional management teams having responsibility for the financial results in each region. The Company competes in more than 200 countries and territories worldwide, with established businesses in all regions contributing to the Companys sales and profitability. This geographic diversity and balance helps to reduce the Companys exposure to business and other risks in any one country or part of the world. The Oral, Personal and Home Care segment is operated through four reportable operating segments, North America, Latin America, Europe/South Pacific and Greater Asia/Africa, which sell to a variety of retail and wholesale customers and distributors. In the Pet Nutrition segment, Hills also competes on a worldwide basis selling its products principally through the veterinary profession and specialty pet retailers. On an ongoing basis, management focuses on a variety of key indicators to monitor business health and performance. These indicators include market share, sales (including volume, pricing and foreign exchange components), gross profit margin, operating profit, net income and earnings per share; and measures to optimize the management of working capital, capital expenditures, cash flow and return on capital. The monitoring of these indicators, as well as the Companys corporate governance practices (including the Companys Code of Conduct), are used to ensure that business health and strong internal controls are maintained. To achieve its financial objectives, the Company focuses the organization on initiatives to drive growth and to fund growth. The Company seeks to capture significant opportunities for growth by identifying and meeting consumer needs within its core categories, in particular by deploying valuable consumer and shopper insights in the development of successful new products regionally which are then rolled out on a global basis. Growth opportunities are enhanced in those areas of the world in which economic development and rising consumer incomes expand the size and number of markets for the Companys products. The investments needed to fund this growth are developed through continuous, corporate wide initiatives to lower costs and increase effective asset utilization. The Company also continues to prioritize its investments toward its higher margin businesses, specifically Oral Care, Personal Care and Pet Nutrition. The Company purchased Toms of Maine, Inc. in the second quarter of 2006. This acquisition allowed the Company to enter the fast growing health and specialty trade channel where Toms of Maine toothpaste and deodorant are market leaders. In 2004, the Company completed its acquisition of GABA Holding AG (GABA), a privately owned European oral care company headquartered in Switzerland. Consistent with the Companys strategy to prioritize higher margin businesses, in the fourth quarter of 2006 the Company announced its agreement to sell its Latin American and Canadian bleach brands. The transaction closed in Canada during the fourth quarter of 2006. The Latin American transaction is expected to close during the first half of 2007. Also, consistent with this strategy the Company divested its North American and Southeast Asian heavy duty laundry detergent brands during 2005. 11 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) In December 2004, the Company commenced a four year restructuring and business building program (the 2004 Restructuring Program) to enhance the Companys global leadership position in its core businesses. As part of this program the Company anticipates the rationalization of approximately one third of the Companys manufacturing facilities, closure of certain warehousing facilities and an estimated 12% workforce reduction. The cost of implementing the 2004 Restructuring Program is estimated to result in cumulative pretax charges, once all the phases are approved and implemented, totaling between $750 and $900 ($550 and $650 aftertax). Savings are projected to be in the range of $325 and $400 ($250 and $300 aftertax) annually by 2008. Looking forward into 2007, while the Company expects market conditions to remain highly competitive, the Company believes it is well positioned for continued growth. As further explained in the Outlook section of Part II, Item 7 of this report, over the long term, the Companys continued focus on its consumer products business and the strength of its global brand names, its broad international presence in both developed and developing markets, and its strong capital base all position it to take advantage of growth opportunities and to increase profitability and shareholder value. Results of Operations Net Sales Worldwide sales were $12,237.7 in 2006, up 7.5% from 2005 driven by unit volume gains of 5.5%, net selling price increases of 1.5% and a positive foreign exchange impact of 0.5%. Excluding the impact of the 2005 divestment of the Companys heavy duty laundry detergent business in North America and Southeast Asia, sales increased 9.0% in 2006 on volume growth of 7.0%. Sales in the Oral, Personal and Home Care segment were $10,568.6 in 2006, up 7.0% from 2005 driven by volume growth of 5.0%, net selling price increases of 1.0% and a positive foreign exchange impact of 1.0%. Excluding the impact of the 2005 divestments of the Companys heavy duty laundry detergent business in North America and Southeast Asia, sales increased 9.0% on volume growth of 7.0%. The May 2006 acquisition of Toms of Maine, Inc. did not have a material impact on reported sales, net income and earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2006. Sales in Pet Nutrition were $1,669.1 in 2006, up 10.0% from 2005 driven by volume growth of 6.0% and net selling price increases of 4.5%, offset by a 0.5% negative impact of foreign exchange. In 2005, worldwide sales were $11,396.9. Sales increased 7.5% from 2004 driven by volume gains of 5.5%, an increase in net selling prices of 0.5% and a positive foreign exchange impact of 1.5%. Gross Profit Gross profit margin was 54.8% in 2006, 54.4% in 2005 and 55.1% in 2004. In 2006, Gross profit benefited from higher pricing, a continued focus on cost savings programs and the shift toward higher margin products, which more than offset the impact of higher raw and packaging material costs and increased restructuring charges. Restructuring charges of $196.2 for the year ended December 31, 2006, which related to accelerated depreciation and certain employee termination benefits under the 2004 Restructuring Program, were included in Cost of sales. Cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2005 included restructuring charges of $100.2. These charges lowered the reported gross profit margin by 160 basis points (bps) and 90 bps in 2006 and 2005, respectively. The reduction in gross profit margin in 2005 from 2004 was driven by costs associated with the Companys ongoing 2004 Restructuring Program. In 2005, the benefits from higher pricing, the Companys shift towards higher margin oral care products and cost savings programs more than offset the impact of higher raw and packaging material costs. 12 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) For additional information regarding the Companys 2004 Restructuring Program, refer to Restructuring Activities below and Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were 35.6% in 2006, 34.4% in 2005, and 34.2% in 2004. The 120 bps increase in 2006 was driven by higher levels of advertising (30 bps), charges related to the Companys 2004 Restructuring Program (40 bps) and incremental stock based compensation expense recognized as a result of adopting Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123 (Revised 2004), Share Based Payment (SFAS 123R) (60 bps). During 2006, the increase in gross profit margin and other savings programs funded an increase in advertising of 11% to $1,320.3, on top of a 12% increase in 2005, to $1,193.6, supporting new product launches and helping increase market shares throughout the world. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales in 2005 only increased by a net 20 bps despite a 40 bps increase in advertising as ongoing cost savings programs more than offset increases in shipping and handling costs (30 bps) and selling and marketing costs (10 bps). Other (Income) Expense, Net Other (income) expense, net was $185.9, $69.2, and $90.3 in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The components of Other (income) expense, net are presented below: 2006 2005 2004 Minority interest $ 57.5 $ 55.3 $ 47.9 Amortization of intangible assets 16.3 15.6 14.3 Equity (income) (3.4 ) (2.0 ) (8.5 ) Gains on sales of non core product lines, net (46.5 ) (147.9 ) (26.7 ) 2004 Restructuring Program 153.1 80.8 65.3 2003 restructuring activities 2.8 Pension and other retiree benefits 34.0 Investment losses (income) (5.7 ) 19.7 (8.7 ) Other, net 14.6 13.7 3.9 Total Other (income) expense, net $ 185.9 $ 69.2 $ 90.3 As noted in the preceding table, Other (income) expense, net in 2006 included a gain on the sale of the Companys household bleach business in Canada, which was more than offset by increased restructuring charges related to the Companys 2004 Restructuring Program of $153.1. Investment losses (income) consisted of gains and losses on foreign currency contracts, principally due to declines and increases in the fair value of foreign denominated deposits which are economic hedges of certain foreign currency debt but do not qualify for hedge accounting. Other (income) expense, net in 2005 included a gain on the sale of heavy duty laundry detergent businesses in North America and Southeast Asia, which was partially offset by charges related to the Companys 2004 Restructuring Program and pension and other retiree benefits. The charges associated with certain pension and other retiree benefits were primarily a result of the conversion of one of the Companys international pension plans to a defined contribution plan for all eligible participants and a lump sum payment of normal retirement benefits associated with a retirement plan in the U.S. as required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 88, Employers Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits (SFAS 88). 13 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Other (income) expense, net in 2004 included charges of $65.3 related to the Companys 2004 Restructuring Program and a gain of $26.7 on the sale of certain detergent businesses in Latin America. Operating Profit In 2006, Operating profit decreased 2% to $2,160.5 as compared with an increase of 4% in 2005 to $2,215.0 from $2,122.1 in 2004. All years presented benefited from sales growth and cost saving initiatives. The decrease in 2006 was primarily due to an increase in restructuring charges of $212.6, lower gains on sale of non core brands of $101.4 and incremental stock based compensation expense of $69.8 recognized as a result of adopting SFAS 123R, partially offset by a higher gross profit margin. Gains on sale of non core product lines of $46.5, $147.9 and $26.7 recognized in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, were more than offset by restructuring charges related to the Companys 2004 Restructuring Program of $395.4, $182.8 and $68.7 in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. In addition, Operating profit included $34.0 of charges related to the remeasurement of certain pension obligations in 2005 and $19.7 of business realignment cost in 2004. For additional information regarding the Companys 2004 Restructuring Program, refer to Restructuring Activities below and Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Interest Expense, Net Interest expense, net was $158.7 in 2006, compared with $136.0 in 2005 and $119.7 in 2004. Interest expense, net was higher in 2006 due to an increase in average interest rates to approximately 5.0% from approximately 4.0% in 2005. Higher interest rates and higher average debt levels primarily to finance the GABA acquisition resulted in increased interest expense in 2005. In 2004, low interest rates allowed the Company to lower interest expense despite increased debt levels resulting from the GABA acquisition. Income Taxes The effective income tax rate was 32.4% in 2006, versus 35.0% in 2005 and 33.7% in 2004. The 2006 effective tax rate was increased as a result of the lower effective tax rate on restructuring charges (80 bps) and decreased by a lower effective tax rate on the sale of the household bleach business in Canada (30 bps). The 2005 effective tax rate was impacted by $40.9 of income taxes (200 bps) for the incremental repatriation of $780 of foreign earnings related to the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the AJCA) as well as the lower effective tax rate on charges incurred in connection with the Companys 2004 Restructuring Program (130 bps), which in total increased the reported effective tax rate by 330 bps. Both years benefited from the Companys global tax planning strategies which are reflected principally in overseas earnings being taxed at lower rates. The impact of the 2004 Restructuring Program on the effective income tax rate for an individual period will depend upon the projects and the related tax jurisdictions involved. The tax benefit derived from the charges incurred in 2006, 2005 and 2004 for the 2004 Restructuring Program was at a rate of 27.6%, 20.6% and 30.1%, respectively. Over its duration, charges associated with the 2004 Restructuring Program are projected to generate tax benefits at a rate between 25% and 30%. For additional information regarding the Companys income taxes refer to Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 14 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Net Income Net income was $1,353.4 in 2006 or $2.46 per share on a diluted basis compared with $1,351.4 in 2005 or $2.43 per share and $1,327.1 in 2004 or $2.33 per share. Net income in 2006 included $38.2 ($0.07 per share) of gains on the sale of the household bleach business in Canada which was more than offset by $286.3 ($0.52 per share) of charges related to the Companys 2004 Restructuring Program and $48.1 ($0.09 per share) of incremental stock based compensation charges due to the adoption of SFAS 123R. In 2005, Net income was impacted by a net aftertax charge of $115.2 ($0.21 per share) resulting from restructuring charges, gains on sales of certain non core brands, income tax expense for the incremental repatriation of foreign earnings related to the AJCA and certain pension charges. Net income in 2004 includes an aftertax charge of $48.0 ($0.09 per share) associated with the initial phase of the 2004 Restructuring Program. Segment Results Effective January 1, 2006, the Company modified the geographic reporting structure of its Oral, Personal and Home Care segment in order to address evolving markets and more closely align countries with similar consumer needs and retail trade structures. Management responsibility for Eastern European operations, including Russia, Turkey, Ukraine and Belarus, was transferred to Greater Asia management and responsibility for operations in the South Pacific, including Australia, was transferred to European management. The financial information for 2005 and 2004 has been reclassified to conform to the new reporting structure. The Company markets its products in over 200 countries and territories throughout the world in two distinct business segments: Oral, Personal and Home Care; and Pet Nutrition. Management evaluates segment performance based on several factors, including Operating profit. The Company uses Operating profit as a measure of operating segment performance because it excludes the impact of corporate driven decisions related to interest expense and income taxes.

The components of Operating profit (loss) for the Corporate segment are presented below: 2006 2005 2004 Gains on sales of non core product lines, net $ 46.5 $ 147.9 $ 26.7 2004 Restructuring Program (395.4 ) (182.8 ) (68.7 ) Pension and other retiree benefits (24.8 ) Adoption impact of SFAS 123R (69.8 ) Unallocated overhead cost and other, net (251.6 ) (247.1 ) (232.5 ) Total Corporate Operating profit (loss) $ (670.3 ) $ (306.8 ) $ (274.5 ) The increase in Corporate Operating profit (loss) in 2006 as compared to 2005 was primarily driven by restructuring charges and incremental stock based compensation, offset by lower gains on the sale of certain non core brands. In 2005, Corporate operating expenses increased due to restructuring charges and the remeasurement of certain pension obligations as required by SFAS 88, offset by gains on the sale of heavy duty laundry detergent brands in North America and Southeast Asia. Restructuring Activities 2004 Restructuring Program In December 2004, the Company commenced a four year restructuring and business building program (the 2004 Restructuring Program) to enhance the Companys global leadership position in its core businesses. As part of this program, the Company anticipates streamlining its global supply chain through the rationalization of approximately one third of its manufacturing facilities and the closure of certain warehousing facilities and also plans to centralize its purchasing and other business support functions. Business building initiatives include enhancing and reallocating resources with an increase and upgrade in the sales, marketing and new product organizations in high potential developing and other key markets, and the consolidation of these organizations in certain mature markets. The 2004 Restructuring Program is expected to result in approximately a 12% workforce reduction. The cost of implementing the 2004 Restructuring Program is estimated to result in cumulative pretax charges, once all phases are approved and implemented, totaling between $750 and $900 ($550 and $650 aftertax). Savings are projected to be in the range of $325 and $400 ($250 and $300 aftertax) annually by 2008. Over the course of the four year 2004 Restructuring Program, it is estimated that approximately 50% 60% of the charges will result in cash expenditures. The estimated cost in 2007 is between $175 and $250 ($125 and $175 aftertax). While the Company believes the overall program will be completed within existing estimates, charges and savings may vary in a given year. 18 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) During 2004, in connection with the initial phase of the program, the Company announced the closing or reconfiguration of eight manufacturing facilities in North America, Greater Asia/Africa, Europe and Latin America and the realignment of marketing and sales organizations in Europe/South Pacific and Greater Asia/Africa. During 2005, the Company commenced additional projects, the more significant of which related to changes being implemented in its European and North American manufacturing networks. These changes will allow the Company to more cost effectively manufacture toothpaste, taking advantage of state of the art technologies, and obtain cost savings through the transfer of bar soap manufacturing to an established U.S. third party. The Company plans to consolidate toothpaste production in Europe, which is currently located at five company sites, into a new state of the art manufacturing facility in Poland. Upon completion of the consolidation project within the next year, toothpaste manufacturing is expected to cease at the Companys facilities in Salford, United Kingdom; Anzio, Italy; Brasov, Romania; Gebze, Turkey; and Halinow, Poland. Other manufacturing activities will continue at these sites, except the Salford facility, which is expected to be closed. In North America, the Company plans to phase down production at its Jeffersonville, Indiana plant with all production expected to cease by January 2008. The plan calls for transferring production of the Companys market leading Colgate Total toothpaste to a new state of the art facility to be built in Morristown, Tennessee, and the relocation of other production and administrative services currently performed at Jeffersonville to other facilities. The Companys Kansas City, Kansas facility, formally the site of U.S. bar soap production, was closed in late 2006 and all production was transitioned to an established U.S. third party manufacturer. In 2006, the Company continued with the implementation of previously announced projects, most notably the changes being implemented in its European and North American manufacturing networks. In addition, the Company implemented several new projects including a voluntary early retirement program in the United States, enabling the Company to continue to re align organizational resources consistent with its business building goals. Also consistent with it global manufacturing strategy, the Company initiated the closure of its toothbrush facility in Puerto Rico. For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 restructuring and implementation related charges are reflected in the following income statement categories: 2006 2005 2004 Cost of sales $ 196.2 $ 100.2 $ 3.4 Selling, general and administrative expense 46.1 1.8 Other (income) expense, net 153.1 80.8 65.3 Total 2004 Restructuring Program charges pretax $ 395.4 $ 182.8 $ 68.7 Total 2004 Restructuring Program charges aftertax $ 286.3 $ 145.1 $ 48.0 Restructuring charges, in the preceding table, are recorded in the Corporate segment as these decisions are corporate driven and are not included in internal measures of segment operating performance. Total 2006 charges relate to restructuring activities in North America (45%), Europe/South Pacific (19%), Latin America (4%), Greater Asia/Africa (7%), Pet Nutrition (1%) and Corporate (24%). Total program to date accumulated charges relate to restructuring activities in North America (39%), Europe/South Pacific (32%), Latin America (4%), Greater Asia/Africa (7%), Pet Nutrition (1%) and Corporate (17%). Since the inception of the 2004 Restructuring Program in December 2004, the Company has incurred total charges of $646.9 ($479.4 aftertax) in connection with the implementation of various projects. The majority of costs incurred since inception relate to the following significant projects: the voluntary early retirement program in the U.S.; the announced closing of the Jeffersonville, Indiana oral care facility; the 19 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) consolidation of toothpaste production in Europe; and exiting certain manufacturing activities in other categories in Portugal, Belgium, Denmark, Canada and Kansas City, Kansas. The following table summarizes the activity for the restructuring charges discussed above and related accrual: Termination Benefits Incremental Depreciation AssetImpairments Other Total Charges $ 41.6 $ 3.3 $ 22.0 $ 1.8 $ 68.7 Cash payments (1.4 ) (1.4 ) (2.8 ) Charges against assets (3.3 ) (22.0 ) (25.3 ) Foreign exchange 1.5 1.5 Balance at December 31, 2004 $ 41.7 $ $ $ 0.4 $ 42.1 Charges 58.6 65.3 30.2 28.7 182.8 Cash payments (47.8 ) (23.4 ) (71.2 ) Charges against assets (11.4 ) (65.3 ) (30.2 ) (6.4 ) (113.3 ) Other (1.4 ) 4.2 2.8 Foreign exchange (4.4 ) (0.1 ) (4.5 ) Balance at December 31, 2005 $ 35.3 $ $ $ 3.4 $ 38.7 Charges 212.7 91.5 6.6 84.6 395.4 Cash payments (89.7 ) (75.3 ) (165.0 ) Charges against assets (98.4 ) (91.5 ) (6.6 ) (6.7 ) (203.2 ) Other (10.0 ) 5.2 (4.8 ) Foreign exchange 3.5 0.1 3.6 Balance at December 31, 2006 $ 53.4 $ $ $ 11.3 $ 64.7 Termination benefits are calculated based on long standing benefit practices, local statutory requirements and, in certain cases, voluntary termination arrangements. Termination benefits incurred pursuant to the 2004 Restructuring Program include pension and other retiree benefit enhancements of $108.4 and $12.8 as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and are reflected as Charges against assets and Other charges within Termination Benefits in the preceding table, as the corresponding balance sheet amounts are reflected as a reduction of pension assets and an increase to other retiree benefit liabilities, respectively. During 2006 the Company made an $85.0 voluntary contribution to partially fund this obligation. The Company anticipates that it will make incremental cash contributions to its plans in order to fund these pension obligations over the duration of the 2004 Restructuring Program. Incremental depreciation was recorded to reflect changes in useful lives and estimated residual values for long lived assets that will be taken out of service prior to the end of their normal service period. Asset impairments have been recorded to write down assets held for sale or disposal to their fair value based on amounts expected to be realized. Liquidity and Capital Resources The Company expects cash flow from operations and existing credit facilities will be sufficient to meet foreseeable business operating and recurring cash needs (including dividends, capital expenditures, planned stock repurchases and restructuring payments). The Companys strong cash generating capability and financial condition also allow it to access financial markets worldwide. 20 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Cash Flow Net cash provided by operations in 2006 was $1,821.5 as compared with $1,784.4 in 2005 and $1,754.3 in 2004. The increase in 2006 reflects the Companys improved profitability partially offset by changes in working capital, higher tax payments and increased spending related to the 2004 Restructuring Program. The Companys working capital as a percentage of sales increased to 2.3% of sales in 2006 as compared with 1.7% of sales in 2005. The Company defines working capital as the difference between current assets (excluding cash and marketable securities, the latter of which is reported in other current assets) and current liabilities (excluding short term debt). The Companys working capital changes were driven in part by increased inventory levels, higher accounts receivable balances and higher tax payments, offset by higher levels of payables and accruals. Inventory days coverage ratio increased to 69 in 2006 as compared to 61 in 2005, largely as a result of efforts to ensure continued product supply during factory closings related to the 2004 Restructuring Program. Higher balances in accounts receivables were due primarily to higher sales in the fourth quarter of 2006 and a slight increase in days sales outstanding over the prior year, partly due to timing. Higher tax payments were the result of improved profitability as well as the timing of payments. A portion of tax payments for calendar year 2005 were made in 2006, including tax payments of approximately $20 relating to the sale of the Companys Southeast Asian detergent brands in the fourth quarter of 2005. Investing activities used $620.4 of cash during 2006 compared with uses of $220.7 and $1,090.4 during 2005 and 2004, respectively. The change over 2005 is primarily due to higher payments in 2006 associated with acquisitions versus higher proceeds in 2005 associated with divestitures, along with increased capital spending in 2006. In 2006, the Company purchased 84% of the outstanding shares of Toms of Maine, Inc. for approximately $100 plus transaction costs. Additionally, the Company increased its ownership interests in its Poland and Romania subsidiaries to 100% at a cost of approximately $95. In 2005, the Company increased its ownership interests in certain subsidiaries to 100% at a cost of $38.5, primarily related to its Malaysia subsidiary. In 2004, payments for acquisitions pertained to the purchase of 100% of the outstanding shares of GABA. Consistent with the Companys strategy to prioritize higher margin businesses, investing activities include proceeds from the sale of certain non core product lines. Investing activities reflect $55.0 of proceeds from the sale of the Companys Canadian bleach brands in 2006 and $215.6 of proceeds from the sale of the Companys Southeast Asian and North American heavy duty detergent brands in 2005. Investing activities for 2004 include the Companys sale of certain non core detergent brands in Latin America for an aggregate sales price of $37.0. Capital expenditures were $476.4, $389.2 and $348.1 for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Capital spending is trending upwards as a result of the Companys multi year restructuring and business building program and continues to focus primarily on projects that yield high aftertax returns. Overall capital expenditures for 2007 are expected to increase to a rate of approximately 5% of Net sales. Financing activities used $1,059.0 of cash during 2006 compared to $1,524.4 and $611.1 during 2005 and 2004, respectively. Financing activities in 2006 reflect higher proceeds from exercise of stock options, which more than offset an increase in common and preference stock dividend payments as well as higher share repurchases associated with the share repurchase programs authorized by the Board of Directors in 2006 and 2004. Additionally, debt increased $139.1, net of payments, in 2006 versus a decrease of $78.4, net of proceeds, in 2005. In 2005, financing activities reflect a cash payment of $89.7 to an outside investor as a result of the discontinuation of a financing subsidiary of the Company. The Company previously had a financing subsidiary with outside equity investors, the purpose of which was to purchase some of the Companys receivables thereby 21 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) giving the Company access to additional sources of capital. The subsidiary, including such receivables, was consolidated and the amounts invested by outside investors were reported as a minority interest. Dividend payments in 2006 were $677.8, up from $607.2 in 2005 and $536.2 in 2004. Common stock dividend payments increased to $1.25 per share in 2006 from $1.11 per share in 2005 and $0.96 per share in 2004. The Series B Preference Stock dividend payments increased to $10.00 per share in 2006 from $8.88 per share in 2005 and $7.68 per share in 2004. Management currently intends to continue to pay dividends at increasing annual amounts per share from cash provided by operations. The Company repurchases common shares in the open market and in private transactions to maintain its targeted capital structure and to fulfill the requirements of its compensation and benefit plans. In October 2004, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to purchase up to 20 million shares of the Companys common stock through December 31, 2005 (the 2004 Program) and, in December 2005, the Board of Directors extended this authorization through March 31, 2006. The Company completed this program in the first quarter of 2006. In March 2006, the Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program (the 2006 Program), under which the Company may purchase up to 30 million common shares. Aggregate repurchases in 2006, including repurchases under the 2004 and 2006 Programs as well as other Board authorizations, were 15.0 million common shares for a total purchase price of $884.7. Aggregate repurchases for 2005 were 15.1 million common shares for a total purchase price of $796.2. Aggregate repurchases for 2004 were 12.4 million common shares for a total purchase price of $637.9. Long term debt increased to $3,497.1 as of December 31, 2006 as compared to $3,274.7 as of December 31, 2005 and total debt increased to $3,671.2 as of December 31, 2006 as compared to $3,446.2 as of December 31, 2005. The Companys long term debt is rated AA by Standard & Poors and Aa3 by Moodys Investors Service. During 2005, the Company issued 250 million of Swiss franc denominated five year bonds (approximately $205 at the December 31, 2006 exchange rate) at a fixed rate of 1.9%. Domestic and foreign commercial paper outstanding was $651.6 and $621.8 as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and is denominated in U.S. dollars, Swiss francs and Canadian dollars. The maximum commercial paper outstanding during 2006 and 2005 was $1,400 and $1,715, respectively. These borrowings carry a Standard & Poors rating of A 1+ and a Moodys Investors Service rating of P 1. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, commercial paper and certain current maturities of notes payable totaling $674.0 and $641.9, respectively, are classified as long term debt, as the Company has the intent and ability to refinance such obligations on a long term basis, including, if necessary, by utilizing its lines of credit that expire in 2011. At December 31, 2006, the Company had access to unused domestic and foreign lines of credit of approximately $2,500 and also had $1,417.2 of medium term notes available for issuance pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement. The Companys domestic lines of credit include a five year revolving credit facility of $1,500.0 which was extended an additional year in the fourth quarter of 2006 and now expires in November 2011. These domestic lines are available for general corporate purposes and to support commercial paper issuance. The ESOP notes guaranteed by the Company and certain credit facilities contain cross default provisions. Noncompliance with these requirements could ultimately result in the acceleration of amounts owed. The Company is in full compliance with all such requirements and believes the likelihood of noncompliance is remote. 22 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) The following represents the scheduled maturities of the Companys contractual obligations as of December 31, 2006: Total Payments Due by Period 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Long term debt including current portion(1) $ 3,463.8 $ 1,424.5 $ 163.0 $ 231.2 $ 295.4 $ 25.5 $ 1,324.2 Net cash interest payments on long term debt(2) 1,615.9 210.9 107.4 95.6 85.5 75.8 1,040.7 Capitalized leases 33.3 26.2 1.1 1.1 1.0 1.0 2.9 Operating leases 529.8 117.0 104.1 87.7 66.7 51.2 103.1 Purchase obligations(3) 864.0 568.8 246.6 38.7 9.6 0.3 Total(4) $ 6,506.8 $ 2,347.4 $ 622.2 $ 454.3 $ 458.2 $ 153.8 $ 2,470.9 (1) Long term debt due in 2007 includes $674.0 of commercial paper and certain current maturities of notes payable that have been classified as long term debt as of December 31, 2006, as the Company has the intent and ability to refinance such obligations on a long term basis, including, if necessary, by utilizing its unused lines of credit that expire in 2011. (2) Includes the net interest payments on fixed and variable rate debt and associated interest rate swaps. Interest payments associated with floating rate instruments are based on managements best estimate of projected interest rates for the remaining term of variable rate debt. (3) The Company has outstanding purchase obligations with suppliers at the end of 2006 for raw, packaging and other materials in the normal course of business. These purchase obligation amounts represent only those items which are based on agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify minimum quantity, price and term and do not represent total anticipated purchases. (4) Long term liabilities associated with the Companys postretirement plans are excluded from the table above due to the uncertainty of the timing of these cash disbursements. The amount and timing of cash funding related to these benefit plans will generally depend on local regulatory requirements, various economic assumptions (the most significant of which are detailed in Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates below) and voluntary Company contributions. Based on current information, the Company does not anticipate having to make any mandatory contributions to its qualified U.S. pension plan until 2008. Managements best estimate of cash required to be paid directly from the Companys assets for its postretirement plans for the year ending December 31, 2007 is approximately $57. In addition, the Company currently plans to make approximately $50 of voluntary contributions to the U.S. pension plans. As more fully described in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company is contingently liable with respect to lawsuits, environmental matters, taxes and other matters arising in the ordinary course of business. While it is possible that the Companys cash flows and results of operations in a particular period could be materially affected by the one time impact of the resolution of such contingencies, it is the opinion of management that the ultimate disposition of these matters will not have a material impact on the Companys financial position, or ongoing results of operations and cash flows. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company does not have off balance sheet financing or unconsolidated special purpose entities. 23 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Managing Foreign Currency, Interest Rate and Commodity Price Exposure The Company is exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity price fluctuations. Volatility relating to these exposures is managed on a global basis by utilizing a number of techniques, including working capital management, selective borrowings in local currencies and entering into selective derivative instrument transactions, issued with standard features, in accordance with the Companys treasury and risk management policies. The Companys treasury and risk management policies prohibit the use of leveraged derivatives or derivatives for trading purposes. As the Company markets its products in over 200 countries and territories, it is exposed to currency fluctuations related to manufacturing and selling its products in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The Companys major foreign currency exposures involve the markets in Europe and certain Latin American countries, although all regions of the world are subject to foreign currency changes versus the U.S. dollar. The Company monitors its foreign currency exposures in these markets through a combination of cost containment measures, selling price increases and foreign currency hedging of certain costs in an effort to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements. The Company primarily utilizes currency forward contracts, cross currency interest rate swaps, local currency deposits and local currency borrowings to hedge portions of its exposures relating to foreign currency purchases and assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business. From time to time, the Company hedges certain of its forecasted foreign currency transactions using forward contracts with durations no greater than 18 months. Interest rate swaps and debt issuances are utilized to manage the Companys targeted mix of fixed and floating rate debt and to minimize significant fluctuations in earnings and cash flows that may result from interest rate volatility. The Company is exposed to price volatility related to raw materials used in production. Futures contracts are used on a limited basis to manage volatility related to anticipated raw material inventory purchases. In 2006, the results of the Companys commodity hedging activities were not material. The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to the financial instrument contracts held by the Company; however, nonperformance by these counterparties is considered remote as it is the Companys policy to contract with diversified counterparties that have a long term debt rating of AA /Aa3 or higher. Value at Risk The Companys risk management procedures include the monitoring of interest rate and foreign exchange exposures and hedge positions utilizing statistical analyses of cash flows, market value and sensitivity analysis. However, the use of these techniques to quantify the market risk of such instruments should not be construed as an endorsement of their accuracy or the accuracy of the related assumptions. Market exposures are evaluated using a value at risk (VAR) model and an earnings at risk (EAR) model that are intended to measure the maximum potential loss in interest rate and foreign exchange financial instruments, assuming adverse market conditions occur, given a 95% confidence level. Historical interest rates and foreign exchange rates are used to estimate the volatility and correlation of future rates. The estimated maximum potential one day loss in fair value of interest rate or foreign exchange rate instruments, calculated using the VAR model, is not material to the consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows of the Company in 2006 and 2005. The estimated maximum yearly loss in earnings due to interest rate or foreign exchange rate instruments, calculated utilizing the EAR model, is not material to the 24 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Companys results of operations in 2006 and 2005. Actual results in the future may differ materially from these projected results due to actual developments in the global financial markets. For information regarding the Companys accounting policies for financial instruments and description of financial instrument activities, refer to Notes 2 and 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48), which prescribes accounting for and disclosure of uncertainty in tax positions. This interpretation defines the criteria that must be met for the benefits of a tax position to be recognized in the financial statements and the measurement of tax benefits recognized. The provisions of FIN 48 are effective as of the beginning of the Companys 2007 fiscal year, with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings. The Company is currently finalizing its analysis of the impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements of adopting FIN 48 and believes that the impact, if any, will not be material. Refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements requires management to use judgment and make estimates. The level of uncertainty in estimates and assumptions increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions are completed. Actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates. The accounting policies that are most critical in the preparation of the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements are those that are both important to the presentation of the Companys financial condition and results of operations and require significant or complex judgments and estimates on the part of management. The Companys critical accounting policies are reviewed periodically with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. In certain instances, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America allow for the selection of alternative accounting methods. The Companys significant policies that involve the selection of alternative methods are accounting for shipping and handling costs and inventories. Shipping and handling costs may be reported as either a component of cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses. The Company reports such costs, primarily related to warehousing and outbound freight, in the Consolidated Statements of Income as a component of Selling, general and administrative expenses. Accordingly, the Companys gross profit margin is not comparable with the gross profit margin of those companies that include shipping and handling charges in cost of sales. If such costs had been included in cost of sales, gross profit margin as a percent of sales would have decreased by 770 bps from 54.8% to 47.1% in 2006 and decreased by 750 bps and 720 bps in 2005 and 2004, respectively, with no impact on reported earnings. The Company accounts for inventories using both the first in, first out (FIFO) method (approximately 80% of inventories) and the last in, first out (LIFO) method (approximately 20% of inventories). There would have been no impact on reported earnings for 2006, 2005 and 2004 had all inventories been accounted for under the FIFO method. The areas of accounting that involve significant or complex judgments and estimates are pensions and other postretirement benefits, stock options, asset impairment, tax valuation allowances, and legal and other contingencies. In pension accounting, the most significant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate and the long term rate of return on plan assets. The discount rate for U.S. plans was 5.80%, 5.50% and 5.75% as of 25 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Discount rates used for the U.S. defined benefit and other postretirement plans are based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high quality bonds for which the timing and amount of cash outflows approximate the estimated payouts of the U.S. plans. For the Companys international plans, the discount rates are set by benchmarking against investment grade corporate bonds rated AA or better. The assumed long term rate of return on plan assets for U.S. plans was 8.0% as of December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. In determining the long term rate of return, the Company considers the nature of the plans investments, an expectation for the plans investment strategies and the historical rate of return. The historical rate of return for the U.S. plans for the most recent 15 year period was 9%. In addition, the current rate of return assumption for the U.S. plans is based upon a targeted asset allocation of approximately 33% in fixed income securities (which are expected to earn approximately 6% in the long term), 63% in equity securities (which are expected to earn approximately 9.25% in the long term) and 4% in real estate and other (which are expected to earn approximately 6% in the long term). A 1% change in either the discount rate or the assumed rate of return on plan assets of the U.S. pension plans would cumulatively impact future Net income by approximately $10. A third assumption is the long term rate of compensation, a change in which would partially offset the impact of a change in either the discount rate or the long term rate of return. This rate was 4.0% as of December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. (Refer to Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Companys pension and other postretirement plans.) The most judgmental assumption in accounting for other postretirement benefits is the medical cost trend rate. The Company reviews external data and its own historical trends for health care costs to determine the medical cost trend rate. The assumed rate of increase is 10% for 2007, declining 1% per year until reaching the ultimate assumed rate of increase of 5% per year. The effect of a 1% increase in the assumed long term medical cost trend rate would reduce Net income by approximately $4. Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS 123R, Share Based Payment, (SFAS 123R) using the modified prospective method. SFAS 123R requires companies to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments, such as stock options and restricted stock, based on the fair value of those awards at the date of grant. The Company uses the Black Scholes Merton (Black Scholes) option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock option awards under SFAS 123R. The weighted average estimated fair value of each stock option granted for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $10.30. The Black Scholes model uses various assumptions to determine the fair value of options. These assumptions include expected term of options, expected volatility, risk free interest rate and expected dividend yield. While these assumptions do not require significant judgment, as the significant inputs are determined from independent third party sources, changes in these inputs however, could result in significant changes in fair value. A one year change in term would result in a 15% change in fair value. A one percent change in volatility would change fair value by 4%. Asset impairment analysis performed for goodwill and intangible assets requires several estimates including future cash flows, growth rates and the selection of a discount rate. Since the estimated fair value of the Companys intangible assets substantially exceeds the recorded book value, significant changes in these estimates would have to occur to result in an impairment charge related to these assets. Asset impairment analysis related to certain fixed assets in connection with the 2004 Restructuring Program requires managements best estimate of net realizable value. Tax valuation allowances are established to reduce tax assets such as tax loss carryforwards, to net realizable value. Factors considered in estimating net realizable value include historical results by tax jurisdiction, carryforward periods, income tax strategies and forecasted taxable income. Legal and other contingency reserves are based on managements assessment of the risk of potential loss, which includes consultation with outside legal counsel and advisors. Such assessments are reviewed each period and revised, based on current facts and circumstances, if necessary. While it is possible that the Companys cash flows and results of operations in a particular quarter or year could be materially 26 Table of Contents (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) affected by the one time impacts of the resolution of such contingencies, it is the opinion of management that the ultimate disposition of these matters will not have a material impact on the Companys financial position, or ongoing results of operations and cash flows. (Refer to Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Companys contingencies.) The Company generates revenue through the sale of well known consumer products to trade customers under established trading terms. While the recognition of revenue and receivables requires the use of estimates, there is a short time frame (typically less than 60 days) between the shipment of product and cash receipt, thereby reducing the level of uncertainty in these estimates. (Refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further description of the Companys significant accounting policies.) Outlook Looking forward into 2007, while the Company expects market conditions to remain highly competitive, it believes it is well positioned for continued growth. It anticipates continuing to prioritize its investments in key categories and markets in order to further strengthen its competitive position and build market share. The 2004 Restructuring Program is designed to enhance the Companys global leadership position in its core businesses. As part of the 2004 Restructuring Program, the Company is in the process of streamlining its global supply chain, reallocating resources with an increase and upgrade in the sales, marketing and new product organizations in high potential developing and other key markets and the consolidation of these organizations in certain mature markets. The savings and benefits from the 2004 Restructuring Program, along with the Companys other ongoing cost savings and growth initiatives, are anticipated to provide additional funds for investment in support of key categories and new product development while also supporting an increased level of profitability. However, as noted above, the Company operates in a highly competitive global marketplace that is experiencing increased trade concentration and industry consolidation. In addition, changes in economic conditions, movements in commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates can impact future operating results as measured in U.S. dollars. In particular, economic and political uncertainty in some countries in Latin America and changes in the value of Latin American and European currencies may impact the overall results of these regions. Historically, the consumer products industry has been less susceptible to changes in economic growth than many other industries. Over the long term, the Companys continued focus on its consumer products business and the strength of its global brand names, its broad international presence in both developed and developing markets, and its strong capital base all position it to take advantage of growth opportunities and to increase profitability and shareholder value.
