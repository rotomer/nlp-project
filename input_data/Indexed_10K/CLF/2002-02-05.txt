ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. In 2001, Cleveland Cliffs Inc (Company) had a net loss of $22.9 million, or $2.27 per share (references to per share earnings are diluted earnings per share) versus net income for the year 2000 of $18.1 million, or $1.73 per share. Following is a summary of results: (In millions, except per share amounts) 2001 2000 1999 Net income (loss) before special items and cumulative effect of accounting change $ (32.2 ) $ 10.1 $ .4 Special items 8.0 4.4 Cumulative effect of accounting change 9.3 Net income (loss) Amount $ (22.9 ) $ 18.1 $ 4.8 Per share (basic) $ (2.27 ) $ 1.74 $ .43 Per share (diluted) $ (2.27 ) $ 1.73 $ .43 Average number of shares (in thousands) Basic 10,073 10,393 11,076 Diluted 10,073 10,439 11,124 2001 versus 2000 Net loss for the year 2001 was $22.9 million, or $2.27 per share, including $9.3 million net income from a change in accounting principle. The cumulative effect of $9.3 million results from a change in the method of accounting for investment gains and losses on pension assets for the calculation of net periodic pension costs. Previously, the Company utilized a method that deferred and amortized realized and unrealized gains and losses over five years for most pension plans. The new method recognizes these changes immediately. The accounting change reduced 2001 pension expense by $.1 million. Excluding the accounting change effect, the net loss was $32.2 million, or $3.19 per share. Net income for the year 2000 of $18.1 million, or $1.73 per share, included three special items: $9.9 million after tax recovery on an insurance claim related to lost 1999 sales; $5.2 million tax credit reflecting a reassessment of income tax obligations based on current audits of prior years federal tax returns; and $7.1 million after tax charge to recognize the decrease in value of the Companys investment in LTV common stock. Excluding the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle and special items, the 2001 loss of $32.2 million represented an earnings decrease of $42.3 million from 2000. The decrease reflected a higher loss before income taxes, $60.7 million, partially offset by lower income taxes, $18.4 million. The $60.7 million decrease in pre tax results was primarily due to: 14 Table of Contents ITEM 7. (Continued) A decrease in pellet sales margin of $52.0 million. Following is a summary comparison of sales margin for 2001 and 2000: (In Millions) Increase (Decrease) 2001 2000 Amount Percent Sales (Tons) 8.4 10.4 (2.0 ) (19 )% Revenue from product sales and services $ 319.3 $ 379.4 $ (60.1 ) (16 )% Cost of goods sold and operating expenses 372.1 380.2 (8.1 ) (2 )% Sales margin (loss) $ (52.8 ) $ (.8 ) $ (52.0 ) N/M Revenue from product sales and services decreased $60.1 million primarily due to the 2.0 million ton sales volume decrease partly offset by a modest increase in average price realization. Included in 2001 cost of goods sold and operating expenses was approximately $48 million of idle expense related to production curtailments at the Companys mining ventures and higher employment costs, primarily related to benefits. Royalty and management fee revenue, including amounts paid by the Company as a participant in mining ventures, decreased $7.5 million, reflecting the production curtailments. The loss from Cliffs and Associates Limited (CAL), net of minority interest, was $19.3 million in 2001, compared to a loss of $13.3 million in 2000. The increased loss of $6.0 million reflected the start up and commissioning of the HBI venture in Trinidad and Tobago in mid March of 2001 and the increased Company ownership, 82.4 percent in 2001 versus 46.5 percent for most of 2000 (See Ferrous Metallics). Interest expense was $4.4 million higher in 2001 reflecting interest on borrowings under the Companys $100 million revolving credit facility. Interest expense was partially offset by $.9 million of increased interest income reflecting higher cash balances. Other expenses reflect lower business development expense in 2001, largely offset by 2001 restructuring charges of $4.8 million, primarily relating to headcount reductions at the Michigan mines, corporate office, and central service functions. Other income was $3.1 million higher in 2001 primarily due to gains on the sale of non strategic assets, principally non mining lands. Administrative, selling and general expenses decreased about 20 percent, $3.5 million, reflecting employee reductions and other cost saving initiatives. 2000 versus 1999 Net income for the year 2000 of $18.1 million, or $1.73 per share, included special items discussed previously. Year 1999 net income of $4.8 million, or $.43 per share included favorable after tax income adjustments of $4.4 million that related primarily to prior years state tax refunds. Excluding special items in both years, net income in 2000 of $10.1 million was $9.7 million higher than 1999 net income of $.4 15 Table of Contents ITEM 7. (Continued) million. The $9.7 million improvement in 2000 net income before special items reflected higher income before income taxes, $14.4 million, partially offset by higher income taxes, $4.7 million. The increase in pre tax income before special items was primarily due to: An improvement of $19.2 million in pellet sales margin from the 1999 negative margin of $20.0 million. Following is a summary comparison of sales margin for 2000 and 1999: (In Millions) Increase (Decrease) 2000 1999 Amount Percent Sales (Tons) 10.4 8.9 1.5 17 % Revenue from product sales and services $ 379.4 $ 316.1 $ 63.3 20 % Cost of goods sold and operating expenses 380.2 336.1 44.1 13 % Sales margin (loss) $ (.8 ) $ (20.0 ) $ 19.2 96 % Revenue from product sales and services increased $63.3 million primarily due to the 1.5 million ton sales volume increase along with a modest improvement in average sales price realization. The increase in cost of goods sold and operating expenses reflected the increase in volume, production curtailments in 1999 and significant increases in energy rates, which added almost $14 million to cost in 2000. Royalty and management fees, including amounts paid by the Company as a participant in the mining ventures, of $50.7 million in 2000 versus $48.5 million in 1999, an increase of $2.2 million, primarily due to increased production at Tilden Mine. Higher other income, $3.3 million, including insurance company demutualization proceeds, favorable settlement of a legal dispute, and gains from sales of non strategic lands. Partially offsetting were: Higher CAL pre operating losses, $4.5 million, reflecting continuing plant start up difficulties, holding costs during plant modifications, and the Companys increased ownership in the venture as of November 20, 2000. Increased administrative, selling and general expense, $2.6 million, due to higher active and retiree medical costs and pensions, and increased management incentive compensation expense. Higher other expenses, $2.0 million, largely reflecting the reserving of certain amounts related to administrative services and management fees due from a subsidiary of LTV Corporation (LTV) at the time that LTV filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Higher interest expense, $1.2 million, resulting from the cessation of interest capitalization in April, 1999 on the construction of CALs hot briquetted iron (HBI) facility in Trinidad and Tobago. The $4.7 million increase in income taxes before special items was principally due to higher pre tax income. 16 Table of Contents ITEM 7. (Continued) Cash Flow and Liquidity At December 31, 2001, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $183.8 million. Following is a summary of 2001 cash flow activity: (In Millions) Net cash flow from operations $ 6.8 Borrowings under revolving credit facility 100.0 Proceeds from LTV Steel Mining Company transaction 50.0 Proceeds from sale of assets 11.0 Capital expenditures (13.2 ) Dividends (4.1 ) Contributions to CAL by minority shareholder 7.1 Other (3.7 ) Increase in cash and cash equivalents $ 153.9 Following is a summary of key liquidity measures: At December 31 (In Millions) 2001 2000 1999 Cash and cash equivalents $ 183.8 $ 29.9 $ 67.6 Available bank credit 100.0 100.0 Total liquidity $ 183.8 $ 129.9 $ 167.6 Working capital $ 172.9 $ 145.8 $ 143.4 Ratio of current assets to current liabilities 1.9:1 2.4:1 3.0:1 In October, the Company and Minnesota Power, a business of Allete, Inc., acquired the LTV Steel Mining Company (LTVSMC) assets. As a result, the Company received $50 million in cash and assumed certain remediation and closure obligations at LTVSMC. For further discussion, see LTVSMC transaction. The Company received a refund of $15.4 million of current and prior years federal tax payments in 2001 associated with the Companys adjustment of its tax basis of CAL properties. The Company expects to receive a tax refund in 2002 of approximately $4 million. The Company anticipates that its share of capital expenditures related to the iron ore business, which was $7.2 million in 2001, will be less than $15 million in 2002. The estimate for 2002 capital expenditures is highly uncertain, and will depend on production levels at the Company managed mines and the financial position of the mine owners. Additionally, the Company invested $3.0 million in 2001 (with an additional commitment to invest $7.4 million in 2002) in a new joint venture to acquire certain power related assets in a purchase leaseback arrangement. The Company expects to fund its share of capital and venture expenditures from available cash and current operations. 17 Table of Contents ITEM 7. (Continued) Capitalization Long term debt of the Company consists of $70 million of senior unsecured notes, with a fixed interest rate of 7.0 percent, which are scheduled to be repaid on December 15, 2005. In addition, the Company has a $100 million revolving credit agreement, which expires on May 31, 2003. On January 8, 2001, the Company borrowed $65 million and on May 10, 2001, an additional $35 million was borrowed on the facility. The loan interest rate, based on the LIBOR rate plus a premium, is fixed through the middle of June, 2002 at an average rate of 2.4 percent. Loan repayment timing is flexible; however, the Company expects to repay the loan before December 31, 2002. The note and revolving credit agreements require the Company to meet certain covenants related to net worth, leverage and other provisions. The Company was in compliance with the debt covenants at December 31, 2001, exceeding the requirements by more than $17 million at December 31, 2001 for the most restrictive covenant (net worth) in the revolving credit facility and $153 million in the senior unsecured notes. Given the severe economic environment confronting the Companys steel company partners and customers, the company expects its business fundamentals will continue to be difficult. Continued adverse earnings performance in 2002 would result in the Company being unable to comply with the net worth covenant in the revolving credit facility. In that event, the Company would attempt to amend the existing revolving credit facility or seek alternative financing. The Company had capital lease obligations at December 31, 2001 of $3.9 million, including its share of mining ventures, which are largely non recourse to the Company. On January 8, 2002, the Company announced suspension of its $.10 per Common Share quarterly dividend which will save approximately $4 million in cash annually. Iron Ore North American steel industry fundamentals, which deteriorated significantly in the second half of 2000, continued to decline throughout 2001. Weak steel order books and price decreases attributable to slowing economies in the United States and Canada, and high volumes of steel imports, have caused crisis conditions in the North American iron and steel industry. (See Bankruptcies of Mine Partners and Customers.) The Company is supporting steel industry efforts to combat unfair imports. Given the current conditions in the industry, significant uncertainty exists concerning the Companys sales and production at its mines in 2002. Iron ore pellet production at the Companys managed mines in 2001 was 25.4 million tons compared to 41.0 million tons in 2000. The 15.6 million ton decrease was principally due to the permanent closure of LTVSMC in early 2001 and production curtailments at all mines. The Company preliminarily expects 2002 production to approximate 2001 levels. The Companys share of 2001 production was 7.8 million tons, which was 4.0 million tons below production for 2000. The Company ended the year 2001 with 3.0 million tons of iron ore pellet inventory, a decrease of .3 million tons from 2000. The decrease was mainly due to production curtailments which were undertaken to address lower sales volume in 2001 and to reduce inventory. The Companys iron ore pellet sales were 8.4 million tons in 2001 versus 10.4 million tons in 2000. The decrease in iron ore pellet sales in 2001 was due to lower demand by the integrated steel industry resulting from a broad based weakening in the North American economy, along with the cessation of LTV operations. The Company expects pellet sales of 11.5 to 12.0 million tons in 2002 to approximate production, after the Company completes the sales contract with Algoma Steel Inc. (Algoma) and acquires its 45 percent interest in the Tilden Mine. (See Bankruptcies of Mine Partners and Customers.) The Companys sales volume is largely committed under multi year sales contracts, which are subject to changes in customer requirements. International iron ore pellet price changes impact certain of the Companys multi year sales contracts, which use international prices as price adjustment factors. Other 18 Table of Contents ITEM 7. (Continued) factors impacting the Companys average price realization under various sales contracts include mine operating costs, energy costs, and steel prices. Five year labor agreements between the United Steelworkers of America (USWA) and the Empire, Hibbing, and Tilden mines were ratified in August 1999. The agreements, which were patterned after agreements negotiated by major steel companies, provide employees with improvements in pensions, wages, and other benefits. The agreements also commit the mines and the union jointly to seek operating cost improvements. The Wabush Mine in Canada also settled on a five year contract in July, 1999. Bankruptcies of Mine Partners and Customers In late 2001, LTV, which had filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code on December 29, 2000, ceased integrated steelmaking operations and agreed to maintain operations on hot idle through February 28, 2002 for potential sale of the steel operations. Up to that time, 1.4 million tons had been produced for LTVs account at Empire in 2001. As a result, Empire operations were idled for an indefinite period commencing in mid November while the remaining partners (Ispat Inland, 40 percent, and the Company, 35 percent) in Empire assess their alternatives. Through mid November, 2001, the Company sold LTV approximately 1.0 million tons (.2 million tons in 2000). The Company had no trade receivables exposure related to these sales. On April 23, 2001, Algoma, a 45 percent owner of Tilden Mine and a significant rail transportation customer of the Company, initiated a financial restructuring, and as part of the process obtained an Order for protection under the Companies Creditors Arrangement Act in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice. At the time of the Order, the Companys exposure to Algoma was limited to $.7 million of transportation receivables, which was reserved. Algoma has met its cash funding obligations at the Tilden Mine and for transportation subsequent to the Order. On November 2, 2001, the Company announced a planned acquisition of Algomas 45 percent interest in the Tilden Mine for the assumption of Algomas share of Tilden liabilities, which are expected to be between $15 million and $20 million. The acquisition, expected in the first quarter of 2002, will increase the Companys ownership in the mine to 85 percent, and increase its share of the mines annual production capacity by 3.5 million tons to 6.6 million tons. The Company and Algoma have also agreed to terms for a sales agreement that will make the Company the sole supplier of iron ore pellets purchased by Algoma for a 15 year period. Sales to Algoma under this new contract are expected to approximate 3 million tons in 2002. On October 15, 2001, Bethlehem Steel Corporation (Bethlehem), a 70.3 percent owner in the Hibbing Mine and a customer of the Company, filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Bethlehem has continued to fund its Hibbing obligations and take iron ore from the mine. At the time of the filing, the Company had a trade receivable of approximately $1.0 million, which has been reserved. In 1998, Acme Metals Incorporated and its wholly owned subsidiary Acme Steel Company (collectively Acme), a 15.1 percent owner in Wabush and an iron ore customer, filed for bankruptcy protection. On August 26, 2001, Acme ceased funding its cash requirements for its obligation at Wabush. As a result, production at Wabush was curtailed in the fourth quarter by about .4 million tons. Sales to Acme in 2001 were less than .2 million tons. The Company had no trade receivable exposure to Acme. Prior to Wheeling Pittsburgh Steel Corporations (Wheeling Pittsburgh) filing for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in November, 2000, the Company exercised its rights under agreements with Wheeling Pittsburgh to acquire Wheeling Pittsburghs 12.4375 percent indirect interest in Empire, increasing its ownership share to 35 percent. At the time of the filing, the Company did not have a term sales contract with Wheeling Pittsburgh, and there was no trade receivable exposure. 19 Table of Contents ITEM 7. (Continued) The major business risk faced by the Company in iron ore is lower customer or venture partner consumption of iron ore from the Companys managed mines which may result from competition from other iron ore suppliers; use of iron ore substitutes, including imported semi finished steel; steel industry consolidation, rationalization or financial failure; or decreased North American steel production, resulting from increased imports or lower steel consumption. Loss of sales and or royalty and management fee income on any such unmitigated loss of business would have a significantly greater impact on operating results and cash flow than revenue, due to the high level of fixed costs in the iron mining business and the high cost to idle or close mines. In the event of a venture participants failure to perform, remaining solvent venturers, including the Company, may be required to assume and record additional material obligations. LTVSMC Transaction In October, 2001, subsidiaries of the Company and Minnesota Power, a business of Allete, Inc. acquired LTVs assets of LTVSMC in Minnesota for $25 million (Company share $12.5 million) and the assumption of environmental and certain facility closure obligations. Minnesota Power acquired the 225 megawatt electric generating facility at Taconite Harbor, transmission facilities, and non mining property and made a $62.5 million payment to the Company. In addition, the Company received all of the iron ore mining and processing facilities of LTVSMC, including its 74 mile mainline railroad and dock operation at Taconite Harbor and assumed certain environmental and closure obligations of the facility. The Company does not intend to operate the mining assets for the production of iron ore pellets, but is investigating other options including non ferrous metals development and providing transportation support services to other Minnesota mining operations. The Company has entered into an option agreement with Minnesota Iron Range Resources and Rehabilitation Board (IRRRB) for the sale to IRRRB of mining lands for future development. Ferrous Metallics The Companys strategy includes extending its business scope to produce and supply ferrous metallic products to an expanded customer base, including electric arc furnace steelmakers. In November, 2000, a subsidiary of the Company and Lurgi Metallurgie GmbH (Lurgi) acquired LTVs 46.5 percent interest in CAL for $2 million (Companys share $1.7 million) and additional future contingent payments that could total $30 million through 2020 dependent on CALs production, sales volume and price realizations. In December, 2001, the owners of CAL (Company ownership 82.4 percent) suspended operations at the HBI facility in Trinidad and Tobago for an indefinite period due to a weak market for ferrous metallics products. Prior to the suspension of operations, CAL had produced and sold in excess of 130,000 tonnes of commercial grade Circal briquettes once plant modifications were completed in March, 2001. If plant operations were to remain suspended for 2002, CAL idle costs before depreciation are not expected to exceed $6 million. 20 Table of Contents ITEM 7. (Continued) The Companys pre tax loss from CAL in 2001 was $19.3 million, net of minority interest. At December 31, 2001 and 2000, the Companys consolidated financial statements included the following amounts related to CAL: (Millions) December 31 2001 2000 Property, plant and equipment (including capitalized interest) $ 122.9 $ 119.1 Working capital deficit (3.7 ) (3.0 ) Minority interest (25.9 ) (23.9 ) Total $ 93.3 $ 92.2 The primary business risk faced by the Company in ferrous metallics is the ability of the Trinidad facility to produce and sustain a quantity of commercial grade HBI at a cost level necessary to achieve profitable operations given the adverse market for HBI. The Company has determined its CAL investment at December 31, 2001 is not impaired based on expected resumption of operations and future cash flows. Strategic Investments The Company is pursuing investment opportunities to broaden its scope as a supplier of iron products to the steel industry. In the normal course of business, the Company examines opportunities to strengthen its position by evaluating various investment opportunities consistent with its strategy. In the event of any future acquisitions or joint venture opportunities, the Company may consider using available liquidity, incurring additional indebtedness, project financing, or other sources of funding to make investments. Actuarial Assumptions As a result of a decrease in long term interest rates, the Company has decreased the discount rate used to determine its pension and other postretirement benefit (OPEB) obligations to 7.50 percent at December 31, 2001 from 7.75 percent at December 31, 2000. The decrease in the discount rate is projected to increase pension and OPEB expense for 2002 by $.1 million. The Company assumes a 9 percent annual return on pension plan investments. Adverse investment performance in 2001 will result in higher pension expense of $.8 million in 2002. The Company makes contributions to the pension plans within income tax deductibility restrictions in accordance with statutory requirements. The Company, including its share of ventures funding, contributed $.4 million and $1.7 million in 2001 and 2000, respectively, compared to $4.4 million and $5.9 million for pension expense for the same periods. Environmental and Closure Obligations At December 31, 2001, the Company had environmental and closure obligations, including its share of the obligations of ventures, of $70.6 million ($27.0 million at December 31, 2000), of which $9.1 million is current. Payments in 2001 were $5.6 million (2000 $1.9 million). The obligations include certain responsibilities for environmental and closure of LTVSMC, which were assumed in the LTVSMC asset acquisition. 21 Table of Contents ITEM 7. (Continued) Market Risk The Company is subject to a variety of market risks, including those caused by changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Company has established policies and procedures to manage such risks; however, certain risks are beyond the control of the Company. The Companys investment policy relating to its short term investments (classified as cash equivalents) is to preserve principal and liquidity while maximizing the return through investment of available funds. The carrying value of these investments approximates fair value on the reporting dates. The Companys mining ventures enter into forward contracts for certain commodities, primarily natural gas, as a hedge against price volatility. Such contracts, which are in quantities expected to be delivered and used in the production process, are a means to limit exposure to price fluctuations. At December 31, 2001, the notional amounts of the outstanding forward contracts were $11.4 million (Company share $5.4 million), with an unrecognized fair value loss of $1.4 million (Company share $.7 million) based on December 31, 2001 forward rates. The contracts mature at various times through November, 2002. If the forward rates were to change 10 percent from the year end rate, the value and potential cash flow effect on the contracts would be approximately $1.0 million (Company share $.5 million). The Company has $70 million of long term debt outstanding at a fixed interest rate of 7 percent due in December, 2005. Additionally, the Company has $100 million outstanding on its revolving credit facility with an average fixed interest rate of 2.4 percent through the middle of June, 2002. A hypothetical increase or decrease of 10 percent from 2001 year end interest rates would change the fair value of the senior unsecured notes and the revolving credit facility by $.8 million and $.1 million, respectively. A portion of the Companys operating costs related to Wabush Mines are subject to change in the value of the Canadian dollar; however, the Company does not hedge its exposure to changes in the Canadian dollar. Financial Reporting and Disclosure The Company annually reviews its financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies to ensure that its financial reporting and disclosure system provides accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment. As part of the process, the Company has reviewed its selection, application and communication of critical accounting policies and financial disclosures. Areas most critical to the Company consist of disclosures regarding business risk, including the limited number and distressed financial condition of its iron ore partners and customers, the fixed costs, legacy costs and restructuring costs associated with its mining operations, and the market volatility of HBI; and the limited flexibility under its revolving credit facility. In light of the difficult business climate affecting the Companys operations, the Company has reviewed the estimates and assumptions used in supporting the carrying value of its assets, especially long lived assets, and the recognition and disclosure of its obligations. At December 31, 2001, the Company believes its financial statements are fairly presented and its disclosures are balanced and responsive. The Company believes that its business plans and actions are addressing its current business risks and challenges; however, future events could result in financial statement adjustments and or additional disclosures. Forward Looking Statements The preceding discussion and analysis of the Companys operations, financial performance and results, as well as material included elsewhere in this report, includes statements not limited to historical facts. Such statements are forward looking statements (as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause future results to differ materially 22 Table of Contents ITEM 7. (Continued) from expected results. Such statements are based on managements beliefs and assumptions made on information currently available to it. Factors that could cause the Companys actual results to be materially different from the Companys expectations include, but are not limited to the following: Displacement of iron production by North American integrated steel producers due to electric furnace production or imports of semi finished steel or pig iron; Loss of major iron ore sales contracts, or failure of customers to perform under existing contracts; Changes in the financial condition of the Companys partners and or customers; Rejection of major contracts and or venture agreements by customers and or participants under provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or similar statutes in other countries; Substantial changes in imports of steel, iron ore, or ferrous metallic products; Lower domestic demand for steel and iron ore; Unanticipated changes in the market value of steel, iron ore or ferrous metallics; Premature closing or impairment of operations due to changes in product demand, production costs, ore characteristics or availability, or owner actions; Major equipment failure, availability, and magnitude and duration of repairs; Unanticipated geological conditions or ore processing changes; Process difficulties, including the failure of new technology to perform as anticipated; Availability and cost of the key components of production (e.g., labor, electric power, fuel, water); Weather conditions (e.g., extreme winter weather, availability of process water due to drought); Changes in financial markets, such as interest rates and availability of credit; Changes in laws, regulations or enforcement practices governing environmental, closure and safety obligations; and Changes in domestic or international economic and political conditions. The Company is under no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. 23 Table of Contents ITEM 7.A.
