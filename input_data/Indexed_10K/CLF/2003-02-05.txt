ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. Overview Cleveland Cliffs Inc (including its consolidated subsidiaries, the Company or Cliffs) is the largest supplier of iron ore pellets in North America. The Company operates five iron ore mines located in Michigan, Minnesota, and Eastern Canada that are capable of producing 32.6 million tons of pellets annually. Cliffs share of 2003 production capacity is almost 20 million tons, representing about 25 percent of the total pellet capacity in North America. The Company sells most of its pellets to integrated steel companies in the United States and Canada under multi year contracts that have terms ranging from 3 to 15 years. Sales volume under these contracts is largely dependent on customer requirements, and in most cases, Cliffs is the sole supplier of pellets to the customer. Each contract has a base price that is adjusted over the life of the contract using one or more adjustment factors. Factors that can adjust price include measures of general inflation, steel prices, the international pellet price, and mine operating cost factors, including energy costs. The steel industry in North America is going through a restructuring process which is expected to ultimately produce a stronger, more productive industry. However, the restructuring process is likely to result in a reduction of integrated steelmaking capacity over time, and thereby reduce iron ore consumption. In order to address the market, Cliffs is focused on improving the competitiveness of its operations. Cliffs strategy also includes obtaining a larger share of this market by entering into long term pellet sales contracts, supported by increased mine ownership, as required. Cliffs has repositioned itself from a manager of iron ore mines on behalf of steel company owners to primarily a merchant of iron ore to steel company customers. In 2002, the Company completed the following actions to increase its sales and mine ownerships: On January 31, Cliffs converted Algoma Steel Inc. (Algoma) from a partner to a customer by acquiring Algomas 45 percent interest in the Tilden Mining Company L.C. (Tilden) and executing a pellet sales agreement that makes Cliffs the sole supplier of pellets to Algoma for 15 years. The acquisition increased Cliffs ownership of the Tilden Mine from 40 percent to 85 percent, and increased its share of the mines annual production capacity from 3.1 million tons to 6.6 million tons. In April, Cliffs entered into a 15 year agreement with International Steel Group Inc. (ISG) to be the sole supplier of iron ore pellets to steelmaking operations which ISG acquired from LTV Corporation (LTV). As a result, ISG was the Companys largest customer in 2002, with additional sales volume expected in future years. On July 24, the Company amended its pellet sales agreement with Rouge Industries Inc. (Rouge), which will make Cliffs the sole supplier of pellets to Rouge beginning in 2003. Sales to Rouge accounted for 9 percent of the Companys revenues in 2002, with volume expected to double in 2003. 14 In July, Cliffs acquired an additional 8 percent interest in the Hibbing Mine from Bethlehem Steel Corporation (Bethlehem) retroactive to January 1, 2002. The acquisition increased the Companys ownership of Hibbing from 15 percent to 23 percent, and increased its share of Hibbings annual production capacity from 1.2 million tons to 1.8 million tons. In August, the Company increased its ownership in the Wabush Mines by about 4 percent, proportionate with the other remaining Canadian owners of Wabush, due to Acme Steel Companys rejection of its interest in bankruptcy. On December 31, Cliffs increased its interest in Empire Mining Partnership (Empire) to 79 percent. Concurrently, the Company executed a 12 year sales agreement for Ispat Inland Inc.s (Ispat or Ispat Inland), a subsidiary of Ispat International N.V., pellet requirements which exceed those provided from Ispats remaining 21 percent interest in the Empire Mine and the Minorca Mine, which is wholly owned by Ispat. Iron ore pellet sales in 2002 were a record 14.7 million tons, a 6.3 million ton, or 75 percent increase, from the 8.4 million tons sold in 2001. Sales under new contracts with ISG and Algoma accounted for over 90 percent of the increase in 2002 sales volume. Iron ore pellet production for Cliffs account was 14.7 million tons in 2002 versus 7.8 million tons in 2001. The 6.9 million ton, or 88 percent, increase was largely due to the Companys increased ownership of Tilden and the significant reduction of production curtailments in 2002. The 2002 curtailments totaled about 2.6 million tons, or 15 percent of production capacity. In 2001, the curtailments totaled 5.0 million tons, or 40 percent of production capacity. The major business risk faced by the Company, as it increases its merchant position, is lower customer consumption of iron ore from the Companys mines which may result from competition from other iron ore suppliers; increased use of iron ore substitutes, including imported semi finished steel; customer rationalization or financial failure; or decreased North American steel production, resulting from increased imports or lower steel consumption. The Companys sales are concentrated with a relatively few number of customers. Unmitigated loss of sales would have a significantly greater impact on operating results and cash flow than revenue, due to the high level of fixed costs in the iron ore mining business in the near term and the high cost to idle or close mines. In the event of a venture participants failure to perform, remaining solvent venturers, including the Company, may be required to assume additional fixed costs and record additional material obligations. The premature closure of a mine due to the loss of a significant customer or the failure of a venturer would accelerate substantial employment and mine shutdown costs. 15 Results Of Operations In 2002, Cliffs had a net loss of $188.3 million, or $18.62 per share (references to per share earnings are diluted earnings per share), versus a net loss for the year 2001 of $22.9 million, or $2.27 per share. Following is a summary of results: (In Millions) 2002 2001 2000 Income (loss) from continuing operations before impairment of mining assets $ (13.7 ) $ (19.5 ) $ 26.7 Impairment of mining assets (52.7 ) Income (loss) from continuing operations (66.4 ) (19.5 ) 26.7 Loss from discontinued operation (108.5 ) (12.7 ) (8.6 ) Cumulative effect of accounting changes (13.4 ) 9.3 Net income (loss) amount $ (188.3 ) $ (22.9 ) $ 18.1 per share basic $ (18.62 ) $ (2.27 ) $ 1.74 per share diluted $ (18.62 ) $ (2.27 ) $ 1.73 Average number of shares (in thousands) basic 10,117 10,073 10,393 diluted 10,117 10,073 10,439 Operating results from continuing operations EBIT* $ (2.8 ) $ (23.7 ) $ 31.9 EBITDA* $ 31.1 $ (.3 ) $ 57.3 * Excludes impairment of mining assets Operating Results from Continuing Operations The Company had pre tax income (loss), before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization from continuing operations, as follows: (In Millions) 2002 2001 2000 Income (loss) from continuing operations $ (66.4 ) $ (19.5 ) $ 26.7 Income taxes (credit) 9.1 (9.2 ) 3.2 Pre tax income (loss) from continuing operations (57.3 ) (28.7 ) 29.9 Impairment of mining assets 52.7 (4.6 ) (28.7 ) 29.9 Interest expense 6.6 8.8 4.9 Interest income (4.8 ) (3.8 ) (2.9 ) Earnings (loss) before interest and taxes (EBIT) (2.8 ) (23.7 ) 31.9 Depreciation and amortization 33.9 23.4 25.4 Earnings (loss) before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) $ 31.1 $ (.3 ) $ 57.3 EBIT and EBITDA are non GAAP measures utilized by management to measure operating performance. 16 2002 Versus 2001 The net loss for the year 2002 was $188.3 million, or $18.62 per share, including a loss of $108.5 million from a discontinued operation, a $13.4 million cumulative effect charge related to a change in the Companys accounting method for recognizing estimated future mine closure obligations, and a $52.7 million charge for the impairment of mining assets. The net loss in 2001 of $22.9 million, or $2.27 per share, included a loss from the discontinued operation of $12.7 million and an after tax credit to income of $9.3 million ($14.3 million pre tax) related to a change in the Companys accounting method for recognizing gains and losses on pension investments. The loss before asset impairment, discontinued operation and the cumulative effect of accounting changes was $13.7 million in 2002 versus $19.5 million in 2001. The $5.8 million lower loss reflected improved pre tax results of $24.1 million partially offset by increased income tax expense, primarily due to establishing a deferred tax valuation allowance in 2002. The improved pre tax results largely reflect higher sales margins, as follows: (In Millions) Increase (Decrease) 2002 2001 Amount Percent Iron ore pellet sales (tons) 14.7 8.4 6.3 75 % Revenues from iron ore sales and services* $ 510.8 $ 301.5 $ 209.3 69 % Cost of goods sold and operating expenses* Total 507.1 340.9 166.2 49 % Costs of production curtailments 20.6 48.0 (27.4 ) (57 )% Excluding costs of production curtailments 486.5 292.9 $ 193.6 66 % Sales margin (loss) Total $ 3.7 $ (39.4 ) $ 43.1 N/M Excluding costs of production curtailments Amount $ 24.3 $ 8.6 $ 15.7 182 % Percent of revenues 4.8 % 2.9 % 1.9 % * Excludes revenues and expenses of $75.6 million and $17.8 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively, related to freight and minority interest. Revenues from Iron Ore Sales and Services Revenues from iron ore sales and services were $510.8 million in 2002, an increase of $209.3 million or 69 percent, from revenues of $301.5 million in 2001. The increase was mainly due to the 6.3 million ton, or 75 percent, increase in pellet sales volume in 2002. The 14.7 million tons sold in 2002 was a record, surpassing the previous record of 12.1 million tons of North American iron ore pellets sold in 1998. The six largest customers accounted for 78 percent of total sales. Sales under new contracts with ISG and Algoma equaled 36 percent of total revenues. 17 Cost of Goods Sold and Operating Expenses Cost of goods sold and operating expenses totaled $507.1 million in 2002, an increase of $166.2 million, or 49 percent, from $340.9 million in 2001. Excluding fixed costs related to production curtailments, 2002 costs and expenses were $193.6 million, or 66 percent, higher than 2001, due to higher sales volume. Sales Margin (Loss) Sales margin in 2002 was $3.7 million compared to a negative sales margin of $39.4 million in 2001. Excluding fixed costs related to production curtailments, the sales margin was $24.3 million, or 4.8 percent of revenues in 2002, versus $8.6 million or 2.9 percent of revenues, in 2001. The improved sales margin in 2002 reflected operating at a higher percent of capacity and lower costs excluding the impact of production curtailments. Other Revenues Royalties and management fees from partners were $12.2 million in 2002, a decrease of $17.6 million from 2001. The decrease in these revenues, which results from Cliffs strategy of converting mine partners into customers, was largely attributable to the acquisition of Algomas 45 percent interest in the Tilden Mine in 2002. The loss of LTV as a partner in Empire and reduced production at Empire in 2002 also contributed to the decrease. Interest income of $4.8 million in 2002 was $1.0 million above 2001 income of $3.8 million. The increase reflected higher average cash balances in 2002 and interest earned on Long term receivables. Partly offsetting was the impact of lower short term interest rates in 2002. Insurance recoveries in 2002 include a $1.8 million insurance recovery on a 1999 business interruption claim relating to the loss of more than one million tons of pellet sales to Rouge as a result of an explosion at the power plant that supplied Rouge. This finalizes the claim, resulting in a total recovery of $17.5 million, of which $15.3 million occurred in 2000 and $.4 million in 2001. Additionally, in 2002 the Company settled with an insurance provider covering certain environmental sites, resulting in a $1.7 million recovery. Administrative, Selling and General Expenses Administrative, selling and general expenses were $23.8 million in 2002, an increase of $8.6 million from expenses of $15.2 million in 2001. The increase in 2002 expenses was mainly due to higher pension expense, increased medical and other post retirement benefits, and higher incentive compensation, including the effects of the Companys common stock price. Other Expenses Interest expense was $6.6 million in 2002, a decrease of $2.2 million from 2001 interest expense of $8.8 million. The decrease was due to lower interest rates and lower 18 average borrowings under the revolving credit facility, which was terminated in October 2002. Both years include $4.9 million of interest expense on the senior unsecured notes. Other expenses were $8.6 million in 2002, a decrease of $.5 million from 2001 expenses of $9.1 million. The decrease was primarily due to lower restructuring activities in 2002, partly offset by costs related to the Mesabi Nugget Project in 2002. Income Taxes The Company uses the liability method whereby income taxes are recognized during the year in which transactions enter into the determination of financial statement income or loss. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities. The Company assesses the recoverability of its deferred tax assets in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 109. The Company is required to record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets when the Company cannot provide objective evidence that more likely than not the deferred tax assets will be utilized before they expire. During 2002, substantial non cash losses caused the Companys deferred tax assets to increase to a level that required a deferred tax valuation allowance. Of the $120.6 million allowance, $38.4 million represented deferred tax assets applied directly to shareholders equity for the other comprehensive loss. The balance was charged to current year results, resulting in net income tax expense of $9.1 million for 2002, with no tax benefit recorded on the minimum pension liability charge, cumulative effect adjustment or discontinued operation in 2002. The Company is required to maintain a valuation allowance for its net deferred tax assets and net loss carryforwards until sufficient positive evidence exists to support the reversal of the reserve. Until such time, except for potential alternative minimum taxes and minor state, local and foreign tax provisions, the Company will have no reported tax provision net of valuation allowance adjustments. In the event the Company was to determine, based on the existence of sufficient positive evidence, that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination was made. Impairment of Mining Assets As a result of increasing production costs at Empire Mine, revised economic mine planning studies were completed in the fourth quarter of 2002. Based on the outcome of these studies, the economic ore reserves at Empire were reduced from 116 million tons at December 31, 2001 to 63 million tons of pellets at December 31, 2002. The Company concluded that the assets of Empire were impaired, based on an undiscounted probability weighted cash flow analysis. The Company recorded an impairment charge of $52.7 million at December 31, 2002 to write off the carrying value of the long lived assets of Empire. The Company expects to continue to operate the Empire Mine. Discontinued Operation In the fourth quarter of 2002, Cliffs exited the ferrous metallics business and abandoned its 82 percent investment in Cliffs and Associates Limited (CAL), an HBI facility located in Trinidad and Tobago. For the year 2002, Cliffs reported a loss from discontinued operation of $108.5 million, consisting of $97.4 million of impairment charges and $11.1 million of idle expense. In 19 the third quarter of 2002, due to uncertainties concerning the HBI market, operating costs and volume, and startup timing, the Company determined that CAL was impaired. Accordingly, the carrying value of the long lived assets were written off, resulting in an impairment charge of $95.7 million. In the fourth quarter, the Company wrote off CALs remaining net current assets of $1.7 million, resulting in total impairment charges of $97.4 million for the year. The Company expects CAL to be liquidated by the CAL creditors, and accordingly, has reflected no ongoing obligations of CAL. Excluding the impairment charges, the loss from CAL was $11.1 million in 2002, an $8.5 million decrease from the $19.6 million pre tax loss in 2001 ($12.7 million after tax). CAL was idle for the entire year 2002. CAL operated for a portion of 2001 and generated net sales of $11.1 million. Cumulative Effect of Accounting Changes Effective January 1, 2002, the Company implemented Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 143 Asset Retirement Obligations. The statement requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period incurred. As a result of the change in accounting method, the Company recorded a cumulative effect non cash charge of $13.4 million, recognized on January 1, 2002 to provide for contractual and legal obligations associated with the eventual closure of its mining operations. Effective January 1, 2001, the Company changed its method of accounting for gains and losses on pension assets for the calculation of net periodic pension cost. Under the new accounting method, the market value of plan assets reflects unrealized gains and losses from current year performance in the succeeding year. Previously, the Company deferred realized and unrealized gains and losses, recognizing them over a five year period. The cumulative effect of the accounting change was a non cash credit to income of $9.3 million ($14.3 million pre tax) recognized in January 1, 2001. 2001 versus 2000 Net loss for the year 2001 was $22.9 million, or $2.27 per share, including $9.3 million net income from a change in accounting principle and a loss from a discontinued operation of $12.7 million. The cumulative effect of $9.3 million results from a change in the method of accounting for investment gains and losses on pension assets for the calculation of net periodic pension costs. Net income for the year 2000 of $18.1 million, or $1.73 per share, included a loss from the discontinued operation of $8.6 million. Excluding the cumulative effect of a change in accounting method and the discontinued operation, the 2001 loss from continuing operations of $19.5 million represented an earnings decrease of $46.2 million from the 2000 earnings of $26.7 million. The decrease in results from continuing operations of $46.2 million is comprised of lower pre tax earnings of $58.6 million partially offset by lower income taxes of $12.4 million. The $58.6 million decrease in pre tax earnings was primarily due to a lower sales margin of $52.8 million, lower insurance recoveries related to the Rouge business interruption claim, $14.9 million, and lower royalty and management fee income, $6.7 million, partially offset by a non recurring $10.9 million charge in 2000 to recognize the decrease in value of the LTV common stock. Following is a summary: 20 (In Millions) Increase (Decrease) 2001 2000 Amount Percent Iron ore pellet sales (tons) 8.4 10.4 (2.0 ) (19 )% Revenue from iron ore sales and services* $ 301.5 $ 363.9 $ (62.4 ) (17 )% Cost of goods sold and operating expenses* Total 340.9 350.5 (9.6 ) (2.7 )% Costs of production curtailments 48.0 48.0 N/M Excluding costs of production curtailments 292.9 350.5 (57.6 ) (16.4 )% Sales margin (loss) Total $ (39.4 ) $ 13.4 $ (52.8 ) N/M Excluding costs of production curtailments Amount $ 8.6 $ 13.4 $ (4.8 ) N/M Percent of revenues 2.9 % 3.7 % (.8 )% * Excludes revenues and expenses of $17.8 million, and $15.5 million in 2001 and 2000, respectively, related to freight. Revenues from Iron Ore Sales and Services Revenues from iron ore sales and services were $301.5 million in 2001, a decrease of $62.4 million from 2000. The decrease was primarily due to the 2.0 million ton sales volume decrease, partly offset by a modest increase in average price realization. Cost of Goods Sold and Operating Expenses Cost of goods sold and operating expenses totaled $340.9 million in 2001, a $9.6 million decrease from 2000. Included in 2001 cost of goods sold and operating expenses was $48.0 million of idle expense related to production curtailments at the Companys mining ventures, and higher employment costs, primarily related to benefits. Excluding costs of production curtailments, costs and expenses were $57.6 million or 16.4 percent less than 2000. Sales Margin (Loss) Total sales margin in 2001 was a negative $39.4 million. Excluding fixed costs related to production curtailments in 2001, sales margin was $8.6 million, or 2.9 percent of revenues, compared to $13.4 million or 3.7 percent in 2000. 21 Other Revenues During 2001, the Company received $.4 million of additional insurance recoveries related to the Rouge business interruption claim, a decrease of $14.9 million from the $15.3 million of proceeds received in 2000. Royalty and management fee revenue from partners, decreased $6.7 million, reflecting the production curtailments. Other income was $3.1 million higher in 2001, primarily due to gains on the sale of non strategic assets, principally non mining lands. Administrative, Selling and General Expense Administrative, selling and general expenses decreased about 20 percent, $3.5 million, reflecting employee reductions and other cost saving initiatives. Other Expenses During 2000, the Company recognized a charge to operations of $10.9 million to reflect the decrease in value of 842,000 shares of LTV common stock. The Company sold the shares by early 2001. Interest expense was $3.9 million higher in 2001, reflecting interest on borrowings under the Companys revolving credit facility. Other expenses reflect lower business development expense in 2001, largely offset by 2001 restructuring charges of $4.8 million, primarily relating to headcount reductions at the Michigan mines, corporate office, and central service functions. Income Taxes Year 2000 income tax expense includes a $5.2 million tax credit reflecting a reassessment of income tax obligations based on current audits of prior years tax returns. Discontinued Operation The pre tax loss from the discontinued CAL operation, net of minority interest, was $19.6 million in 2001 ($12.7 million after tax), compared to a pre tax loss of $13.3 million in 2000 ($8.6 million after tax). The increased pre tax loss of $6.3 million reflected the start up and commissioning in mid March of 2001 and the increased Company ownership, 82 percent in 2001 versus 46.5 percent for most of 2000. 22 Cash Flow and Liquidity At December 31, 2002, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $61.8 million. Following is a summary of 2002 cash flow activity: (In Millions) Net cash flow from continuing operations $ 40.9 Repayment of revolving credit facility (100.0 ) Repayment on long term debt (15.0 ) Investment in steel companies equity and debt (27.4 ) Investment in power related joint venture (6.0 ) Capital expenditures (10.6 ) Proceeds from sale of assets 8.2 Other .3 Cash used by continuing operations (109.6 ) Cash used by discontinued operation (12.4 ) Decrease in cash and cash equivalents $ (122.0 ) Following is a summary of key liquidity measures: At December 31 (In Millions) 2002 2001 2000 Cash and cash equivalents $ 61.8 $ 183.8 $ 29.9 Available bank credit 100.0 Total liquidity $ 61.8 $ 183.8 $ 129.9 Cash and cash equivalents $ 61.8 $ 183.8 $ 29.9 Debt (55.0 ) (170.0 ) (70.0 ) Net cash (debt) $ 6.8 $ 13.8 $ (40.1 ) Working capital $ 95.7 $ 172.9 $ 145.8 In October 2002, the Company repaid its $100 million revolving credit facility and terminated the agreement. The Company is evaluating a possible $20 million revolving credit bank facility to provide additional liquidity. In December 2002, the Company paid $15 million on its senior notes, reducing the balance outstanding to $55 million. The Company received a federal income tax refund in the second quarter of 2002 of $11.6 million, an increase of $7.7 million compared to the December 31, 2001 receivable. The increase was primarily due to the Job Creation and Worker Assistance Act of 2002 which was enacted by Congress in March 2002 and allowed for the carryback of net operating losses for up to five years; previously the limitation was two years. The Company anticipates that its share of capital expenditures related to the iron ore business, which was $10.6 million in 2002, will increase to about $30 million in 2003, reflecting the Companys increased ownership. The Company expects to fund its capital expenditures from available cash and current operations. 23 Capitalization In December 2002, the Company amended it $70 million senior unsecured note agreement. As part of the fourth quarter negotiations, the Company paid and expensed an amendment fee of $1.2 million. The amended agreement contains various covenants including limitations on incurrence of additional debt, leases, and disposition of assets, and a minimum EBITDA requirement and coverage ratio. The Company was in compliance with the amended covenants at December 31, 2002, and expects to remain in compliance in 2003. The Company made a principal payment of $15 million on December 31, 2002 to reduce the amount outstanding to $55 million at the end of 2002. In addition, scheduled principal payments of $20 million in December, 2003, $20 million in December, 2004 and $15 million in December, 2005 are required. Scheduled payments may be accelerated for realization of excess cash flows and certain asset sales; the notes may be paid off at any time without penalty. The interest rate remains at 7.0 percent through December 15, 2003, increases to 9.5 percent from December 15, 2003 through December 14, 2004, and to 10.5 percent from December 14, 2004 to maturity of the agreement on December 15, 2005. In the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company repaid the $100 million borrowed on its revolving credit facility and terminated the agreement. The Company had capital lease obligations at December 31, 2002 of $12.3 million, including its unconsolidated share of mining ventures. The Company had no unsecured letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2002. Operations and Customers Sales The Companys pellet sales were 14.7 million tons in 2002 versus 8.4 million tons in 2001. The increase in pellet sales in 2002 was due to higher demand by the integrated steel industry and new sales agreements in 2002. The Company ended the year 2002 with 3.9 million tons of iron ore pellet inventory, an increase of .9 million tons from 2001, reflecting the Companys increased sales and mine ownership. The Company expects pellet sales in 2003 to approximate production of about 20 million tons. The Companys sales volume is largely committed under multi year sales contracts, which are subject to changes in customer requirements. Factors impacting the Companys average price realization under various sales contracts include measures of general inflation, steel prices, the international pellet price, and mine operating cost factors, including energy costs. Customers In April 2002, the Company signed a long term agreement to supply iron ore pellets to ISG. The Company is the sole supplier of pellets purchased by ISG for its Cleveland and Indiana Harbor facilities for a 15 year period beginning in 2002. Sales depend on ISGs pellet requirements. The Company invested $13.0 million in the second quarter and $4.4 million in the third quarter in ISG common stock, representing approximately 7 percent of ISGs equity. The investment is being accounted for under the cost method and is included in Other investments. 24 In July 2002, the Company amended its iron ore pellet sales agreement with Rouge, which provides that the Company will be the sole supplier of iron ore pellets to Rouge. Rouge is expected to purchase in excess of 3 million tons per year beginning in 2003, and has annual minimum obligations through 2007. The Company also loaned $10 million to Rouge on a secured basis, with final maturity in 2007. The loan is classified as held to maturity and recorded at cost in Long term receivables, with periodic interest accruing to Interest income. Production Following is a summary of 2002 and 2001 mine production and Company ownership: (Million Tons) Companys Ownership Companys December 31 Share Total Production 2002 2001 2002 2001 2002 2001 Mine Empire 79.0 % 35.0 % 1.1 1.7 3.6 5.7 Hibbing 23.0 15.0 1.5 .2 7.7 6.1 Northshore 100.0 100.0 4.2 2.8 4.2 2.8 Tilden 85.0 40.0 6.7 2.2 7.9 6.4 Wabush 26.8 22.8 1.2 .9 4.5 4.4 Total Production 14.7 7.8 27.9 25.4 The 6.9 million ton increase in the Companys share of 2002 production compared to 2001 reflected Cliffs increased ownership in four mines and increased production at all mines, except Empire, to meet increased iron ore demand and orders from steel company customers. Empire was idled in the first part of 2002, but operated at capacity in the later part of the year. The Company preliminarily expects total mine production in 2003 to be 32.6 million tons; the Companys share of production is currently expected to be 19.9 million tons to meet sales requirements. Production schedules remain subject to change in pellet demand. Ownership Increases Empire Mine Effective December 31, 2002, the Company increased its ownership in Empire from 35 percent to 79 percent for assumption of all mine liabilities. Under terms of the agreement, the Company has indemnified Ispat Inland from obligations of Empire in exchange for certain future payments to Empire and to the Company by Ispat Inland of $120.0 million, recorded at a present value of $58.8 million at December 31, 2002 ($53.8 million classified as Long term receivable with the balance current) over the 12 year life of a new sales agreement. A subsidiary of Ispat Inland will retain a 21 percent ownership in Empire, for which it has a unilateral right to put to the Company in five years. The Company will become the sole supplier of pellets purchased by Ispat Inland for the term of the sales agreement. As a result of this transaction, the Companys financial position at December 31, 2002 includes consolidation of Empire; previously the Companys investment in Empire had been accounted for utilizing the equity method and was included in Investment in Associated Iron Ore Ventures. 25 Prior to the foregoing agreement, Ispat Inland and the Company funded total fixed obligations of Empire in proportion to their 40 percent and 35 percent respective ownerships under an interim agreement after a subsidiary of LTV Corporation (LTV) discontinued meeting its 25 percent Empire ownership obligations in November, 2001. LTV, which had filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code on December 29, 2000, rejected its Empire ownership in March, 2002. As a result of increasing production costs, revised economic mine planning studies were completed in the fourth quarter of 2002. Based on the outcome of these studies, the economic ore reserves at Empire were reduced from 116 million tons at December 31, 2001 to approximately 63 million tons of pellets at December 31, 2002. Subsequently, the Company concluded that the assets of Empire were impaired, based on an undiscounted probability weighted cash flow analysis. The Company recorded an impairment charge of $52.7 million at December 31, 2002 to write off the recorded carrying value of the long lived assets of Empire. Tilden Mine On January 31, 2002, the Company increased its ownership in Tilden to 85 percent with the acquisition of Algomas interest in Tilden for assumption of mine liabilities. The acquisition increased the Companys annual production capacity by 3.5 million tons. Concurrently, a sales agreement was executed that made the Company the sole supplier of iron ore pellets purchased by Algoma for a 15 year period. Hibbing Mine In July, 2002, the Company acquired (effective retroactive to January 1, 2002) an 8 percent interest in Hibbing from Bethlehem for the assumption of mine liabilities associated with the interest. The acquisition increased the Companys ownership of Hibbing from 15 percent to 23 percent. This transaction reduces Bethlehems ownership interest in Hibbing to 62.3 percent. In October 2001, Bethlehem filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Bethlehem continues to fund its Hibbing obligations and take iron ore from the mine. At the time of the filing, the Company had a trade receivable of approximately $1.0 million which has been reserved. Wabush Mines In August 2002, Acme Steel Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of Acme Metals Incorporated (collectively Acme), which had been under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection since 1998, rejected its 15.1 percent interest in Wabush. As a result, the Companys interest increased to 26.83 percent. Acme had discontinued funding its Wabush obligations in August 2001. Effect of Mine Ownership Increases While none of the increases in mine ownerships during 2002 required cash payments or assumption of debt, the ownership changes resulted in the Company recognizing net obligations of approximately $93 million at December 31, 2002. Obligations totaled approximately $163 million, primarily related to employment and legacy obligations at Empire and Tilden mines, partially offset by non capital long term assets, principally the $58.9 million Ispat Inland long term receivable ($5.0 million current). 26 Other Related Items The iron ore industry has been identified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as an industrial category that emits pollutants established by the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments. These pollutants included over 200 substances that are now classified as hazardous air pollutants (HAP). The EPA is required to develop rules that would require major sources of HAP to utilize Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) standards for their emissions. The EPA published a Proposed Rule on December 18, 2002, and is scheduled to issue a Final Rule in August 2003, and require compliance by 2006. The projected costs to the Company, including capital expenditures, to meet the proposed MACT standards, as currently proposed, could be approximately of $15 million. Five year labor agreements between the United Steelworkers of America (USWA) and the Empire, Hibbing, and Tilden mines were ratified in August 1999. The agreements, which were patterned after agreements negotiated by major steel companies, provide employees with improvements in pensions, wages, and other benefits. The agreements also commit the mines and the union jointly to seek operating cost improvements. Wabush Mines in Canada also settled on a five year contract in July 1999. On April 4, 2002, the Company signed an agreement to participate in Phase II of the Mesabi Nugget Project. Other participants include Kobe Steel, Ltd., Steel Dynamics, Inc., Ferrometrics, Inc. and the State of Minnesota. A $24 million pilot plant is being constructed at the Companys Northshore Mine to test and develop Kobe Steels technology for converting iron ore into nearly pure iron in nugget form, with minor funding support provided by the U.S. Department of Energy. The Companys contribution to the project through the pilot plant testing and development phase, is $4.5 million, primarily contributions of in kind facilities and services. If the pilot plant is successful, construction of a commercial size facility with a capacity range of 300,000 to 700,000 tons annually, could start as early as 2004. In January 2002, the Company invested $7.4 million ($3.0 million in 2001) in a new joint venture to acquire certain power related assets in a purchase leaseback arrangement. The investment, which is included in Other investments is accounted for utilizing the equity method. Strategic Investments The Company is pursuing investment opportunities to broaden its scope as a supplier of iron ore pellets to the integrated steel industry through acquisition of additional mining interests. In the normal course of business, the Company examines opportunities to strengthen its position by evaluating various investment opportunities consistent with its strategy. In the event of any future acquisitions or joint venture opportunities, the Company may consider using available liquidity or other sources of funding to make investments. Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits The Company and its unconsolidated ventures offer defined benefit pension plans, defined contribution pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans, primarily consisting of retiree healthcare benefits, as part of a total compensation and benefits program. As of December 31, 2002, the Company and its unconsolidated ventures had combined employment of 3,858 employees and 3,773 retirees, or slightly less than one retiree per active employee. 27 The defined benefit pension plans are largely noncontributory, and benefits are generally based on employees years of service and average earnings for a defined period prior to retirement, or a minimum formula. In addition, the Company and its ventures currently provide various levels of retirement health care and life insurance benefits (Other Benefits) to most full time employees who meet certain length of service and age requirements (a portion of which are pursuant to collective bargaining agreements). Most U.S. salaried plans require retiree contributions and have deductibles, co pay requirements, and benefit limits. Most U.S. bargaining unit plans require retiree contributions and co pays for major medical and prescription coverage. The Company does not provide Other Benefits for approximately 150 U.S. salaried employees hired after January 1, 1993. Other Benefits are provided through programs administered by insurance companies whose charges are based on benefits paid. Annual contributions to pension plan investment trusts are made within income tax deductibility restrictions in accordance with statutory regulations. In the event of plan termination, the plan sponsors could be required to fund shutdown and early retirement obligations which are not included in the pension benefit obligations. Assets for Other Benefits include deposits relating to insurance contracts and Voluntary Employee Benefit Association (VEBA) Trusts for certain mining ventures that are available to fund retired employees life insurance obligations and medical benefits. The Companys estimated annual contribution to the VEBAs will approximate $3.5 million in 2003 based on production. As a result of decreasing long term interest rates, the Company decreased the discount rate used to determined its defined benefit pension and Other Benefits obligations to 6.9 percent at December 31, 2002 from 7.5 percent at December 31, 2001 and 7.75 percent at December 31, 2000. The Companys assumption of 9 percent returns on pension plan and VEBA assets remains unchanged. The assumption is supported by long term performance. The 2001 change in accounting method resulted in variances in gains and losses on pension plan assets being fully recognized immediately in the subsequent years pension expense. Additionally, as a result of recent experience, the Company increased the medical trend rate assumption it utilized in determining its obligation for Other Benefits. An annual increase in the per capita cost of covered healthcare benefits of 10.0 percent was assumed for 2003 (7.5 percent in 2002) decreasing to an annual rate of 5.0 percent in 2008 and annually thereafter. Following is a summary of the Companys (and its share of unconsolidated ventures) actual defined benefit pension and Other Benefit expense and funding for the years 2001 and 2002 and estimates for 2003 and 2004 incorporating the changes in assumptions, expected asset returns, existing plan provisions and increased mine ownerships: (In Millions) Defined Benefit Pensions Other Benefits Expense Funding Expense Funding 2001 $ 4.4 $ .4 $ 15.8 $ 7.7 2002 7.2 1.1 21.5 16.8 2003 Estimated 28.6 2.7 35.3 21.6 2004 Estimated 33.8 10.5 37.9 25.4 28 Due to the sharp decline in the value of the equity holdings of its various pension trusts, lower interest rates utilized in discounting liabilities, and the Companys increased ownership in mines at December 31, 2002, the Company recorded, in accordance with SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pension, an additional minimum pension liability of $180.4 million, which resulted in a 2002 charge directly to shareholders equity of $109.7 million in 2002. The charge to equity does not run through the Statement of Operations, and in concept, represents the current state of the pension plans as if they were frozen in time. Additionally, the charge does not affect pension funding requirements in the near term. Environmental and Closure Obligations At December 31, 2002, the Company had environmental and closure obligations, including its share of the obligations of ventures, of $95.5 million ($70.6 million at December 31, 2001), of which $9.8 million is current. Payments in 2002 were $8.3 million (2001 $5.6 million). The obligations at December 31, 2002 include certain responsibilities for environmental remediation sites, $18.3 million, closure of LTV Steel Mining Company (LTVSMC), $41.1 million, and obligations for closure of the Companys five operating mines, $36.1 million, reflecting implementation of SFAS No. 143 Asset Retirement Obligations effective January 1, 2002. The LTVSMC closure obligation resulted from an October 2001 transaction where subsidiaries of the Company and Minnesota Power, a business of Allete, Inc. acquired LTVs assets of LTVSMC in Minnesota for $25.0 million (Company share $12.5 million). As a result of this transaction the Company received a payment of $62.5 million from Minnesota Power and assumed environmental and certain facility closure obligations of $50.0 million. Market Risk The Company is subject to a variety of market risks, including those caused by changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Company has established policies and procedures to manage such risks; however, certain risks are beyond the control of the Company. The Companys investment policy relating to its short term investments (classified as cash equivalents) is to preserve principal and liquidity while maximizing the return through investment of available funds. The carrying value of these investments approximates fair value on the reporting dates. The Companys mining ventures enter into forward contracts for certain commodities, primarily natural gas, as a hedge against price volatility. Such contracts, which are in quantities expected to be delivered and used in the production process, are a means to limit exposure to price fluctuations. At December 31, 2002, the notional amounts of the outstanding forward contracts were $4.6 million (Company share $3.7 million), with an unrecognized fair value gain of $1.2 million (Company share $1.0 million) based on December 31, 2002 forward rates. The contracts mature at various times through April 2003. If the forward rates were to change 10 percent from the year end rate, the value and potential cash flow effect on the contracts would be approximately $.6 million (Company share $.5 million). 29 The Company has $55 million of long term debt outstanding with a fixed interest rate of 7.0 percent through December 15, 2003, increasing to 9.5 percent through December 15, 2004, and 10.5 percent to maturity on December 15, 2005. A hypothetical increase or decrease of 10 percent from 2002 year end interest rates would change the fair value of the senior unsecured notes by $.8 million. A portion of the Companys operating costs related to Wabush Mines are subject to change in the value of the Canadian dollar; however, the Company does not hedge its exposure to changes in the Canadian dollar. Critical Accounting Policies Managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on the Companys consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). Preparation of financial statements requires management to make assumptions, estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses, and the related disclosures of contingencies. Management bases its estimates on various assumptions and historical experience which are believed to be reasonable; however, due to the inherent nature of estimates, actual results may differ significantly due to changed conditions or assumptions. Management believes that the following critical accounting policies and practices incorporate estimates and judgments have the most significant impact on the Companys financial statements. Iron Ore Reserves The Company regularly evaluates its economic iron ore reserves and updates them as required in accordance with SEC Industry Guide 7. The estimated ore reserves could be affected by future industry conditions, geological conditions and ongoing mine planning. Maintenance of effective production capacity or the ore reserve could require increases in capital and development expenditures. Alternatively, changes in economic conditions, or the expected quality of ore reserves could decrease capacity or ore reserves. Technological progress could alleviate such factors or increase capacity or ore reserves. Significant reductions were made to the ore reserves at Empire and Wabush Mines in the fourth quarter of 2002 due to increasing mining and processing costs. The Company uses its ore reserve estimates to determine the mine closure dates utilized in recording the fair value liability for asset retirement obligations. See Note 5 Environmental and Mine Closure Obligations (Mine Closure) in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Since the liability represents the present value of the expected future obligation, a significant change in ore reserves would have a substantial effect on the recorded obligation. The Company also utilizes economic ore reserves for evaluating potential impairments of mine assets and in determining maximum useful lives utilized to calculate depreciation and amortization of long lived mine assets. Decreases in ore reserves could significantly affect these items. Asset Retirement Obligations The accrued mine closures obligations for the Companys active mining operations reflects the adoption of SFAS No. 143 effective January 1, 2002 to provide for contractual and legal obligations associated with the eventual closure of the mining operations. The Companys obligations are determined based on detailed estimates adjusted for factors that an outside party would consider (i.e., inflation, overhead and profit), which were escalated (at an assumed 3 percent) to the estimated closure dates, and then discounted using a credit adjusted risk free 30 interest rate of 10.25 percent. The closure date for each location was determined based on the exhaustion date of the remaining iron ore reserves. The estimated obligations are particularly sensitive to the impact of changes in mine lives given the difference between the inflation and discount rates. Changes in the base estimates of legal and contractual closure costs due to changed legal or contractual requirements, available technology, inflation, overhead or profit rates would also have a significant impact on the recorded obligations. See Note 5 Environmental and Mine Closure Obligations (Mine Closure) in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Asset Impairment The Company monitors conditions that indicate that the carry value of an asset or asset group may be impaired. The Company determines impairment based on the assets ability to generate cash flow greater than its carrying value, utilizing an undiscounted probability weighted analysis. If the analysis indicates the asset is impaired, the carrying value is adjusted to fair value. The impairment analysis and fair value determination can result in significantly different outcomes based on critical assumptions and estimates including the quantity and quality of remaining economic ore reserves, and future iron ore prices and production costs. See Note 1 Operations and Customers (Empire Mine) and Note 3 Discontinued Operation in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Environmental Remediation Costs The Company has a formal code of environmental protection and restoration. The Companys obligations for known environmental problems at active and closed mining operations and other sites have been recognized based on estimates of the cost of investigation and remediation at each site. If the estimate can only be estimated as a range of possible amounts, with no specific amount being most likely, the minimum of the range is accrued. Management reviews its environmental remediation sites quarterly to determine if additional cost adjustments or disclosures are required. The characteristics of environmental remediation obligations, where information concerning the nature and extent of clean up activities is not immediately available, or changes in regulatory requirements result in a significant risk of increase to the obligations as they mature. Expected future expenditures are not discounted to present value. Potential insurance recoveries are not recognized until realized. Employee Retirement Benefit Obligations Assumptions used in determining the benefit obligations and the value of plan assets for defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefit plans (primarily retiree healthcare benefits) offered by the Company and its ventures, are evaluated periodically by management in conjunction with outside actuaries. Critical assumptions, such as the discount rate used to measure the benefit obligations, the expected long term rate of return on plan assets, and the medical care cost trend are reviewed annually. Changes in actuarial assumptions, including discount rates, employee retirement rates, mortality, compensation levels, plan asset investment performance, and healthcare costs, are determined in conjunction with outside actuaries. Changes in actuarial assumptions and or investment performance of plan assets can have a significant impact on the Companys financial condition due to the magnitude of the Companys retirement obligations. See Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits in this section and Note 8 Retirement Related Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 31 Income Taxes Income taxes are based on income (loss) for financial reporting purposes and reflect a current tax liability (asset) for the estimated taxes payable (recoverable) in the current year tax return and changes in deferred taxes. Deferred tax assets or liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using enacted tax laws and rates. The Company recorded a valuation allowance in 2002 for its net deferred tax assets and net loss carryforwards in recognition of the uncertainty of their realization. In making the determination to record the valuation allowance, management considered the likelihood of future taxable income and feasible and prudent tax planning strategies to realize deferred tax assets. In the future, if the Company determines that it expect to realize more or less of the deferred tax assets, an adjustment to the valuation allowance will affect income in the period such determination is made. See Note 9 Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Forward Looking Statements Cautionary Statements Certain expectations and projections regarding future performance of the Company referenced in this report are forward looking statements. These expectations and projections are based on currently available financial, economic and competitive data, along with the Companys operating plans, and are subject to certain future events and uncertainties. We caution readers that in addition to factors described elsewhere in this report, the following factors, among others, could cause the Companys actual results in 2003 and thereafter to differ significantly from those expressed. Steel Company Customers: More than 95 percent of the Companys revenue is derived from the North American integrated steel industry, consisting of fourteen current or potential customers. Of the fourteen companies (not all of whom are current customers or partners of the Company), three companies are in reorganization, and certain others have experienced financial difficulties. The Companys sales are concentrated with a relatively few number of customers. Loss of major sales contracts or the failure of customers to perform under existing arrangements due to financial difficulties could adversely affect the Company. Rejection of major contracts and or partner agreements by customers and or partners under provisions related to bankruptcy/reorganization represents a major uncertainty. Demand for Iron Ore Pellets: Demand for iron ore is a function of the operating rates for the blast furnaces of North American steel companies. The restructuring of the steel industry is likely to result in a reduction of integrated steelmaking capacity over time, and thereby reduce iron ore consumption. Demand for iron ore can be displaced by lower iron production in North America due to imports of finished and semi finished steel, replacement by electric furnace production, or insufficient resources to reline or adequately maintain blast furnaces. Most of the Companys sales contracts are requirements based or provide for flexibility of volume above a minimum level. Mine Operating Risks: The Companys iron ore operations are volume sensitive with a portion of its costs fixed irrespective of current operating levels. Iron ore operations can be affected by unanticipated geological conditions, ore processing changes, availability and cost of key components of production (e.g., labor, electric power and fuel), and weather conditions (e.g., extreme winter weather and availability of process water due to draught). 32 Mine Closure Risks: Although ore reserves are long lived, premature closure or reduced operating levels of an iron ore mine could accelerate significant employment legacy costs and environmental closure obligations, and result in asset impairment charges. Litigation; Taxes; Environmental Exposures: The Companys operations are subject to various governmental, tax, environmental and other laws and regulations, and potentially to claims for various legal, environmental and tax matters. While the Company carries liability insurance which it believes to be appropriate to its businesses, and has provided accounting reserves, in accordance with SFAS No. 5, for such matters which it believes to be adequate, an unanticipated liability or increase in a currently identified liability arising out of litigation, tax, or environmental proceeding could have a material adverse effect on the Company. The Company has no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. 33 ITEM 7.A. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (Information regarding Market Risk of the Company is presented under the caption Market Risk, which is included in Item 7 and is incorporated by reference and made a part hereof). 34
