Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview Founded in 1847, Cleveland Cliffs Inc (including its consolidated subsidiaries, the Company or Cliffs) is the largest producer of iron ore pellets in North America and sells the majority of its pellets to integrated steel companies in the United States and Canada. The Company operates six iron ore mines located in Michigan, Minnesota, and Eastern Canada that currently have a rated capacity of 36.9 million tons of iron ore pellet production annually. Based on its percentage ownership in the mines it operates, Cliffs share of the rated pellet production capacity is currently 22.6 million tons annually, representing approximately 28 percent of total North American annual pellet capacity. The Company sells its share of iron ore production to integrated steel producers, generally pursuant to term supply agreements with various price adjustment provisions. Sales volume under these agreements is largely dependent on customer requirements, and in some cases, Cliffs is the sole supplier of pellets to the customer. Each agreement has a base price that is adjusted over the life of the agreement using one or more adjustment factors. Factors that can adjust price include measures of general industrial inflation, steel prices, and the international pellet price. In past years, Cliffs held a minority interest in the mines it managed, with the majority interest in each mine held by various North American steel companies. Cliffs earnings were principally comprised of royalties and management fees paid by the partnerships, along with sales of its equity share of the mine pellet production. In recent years, Cliffs has repositioned itself from a manager of iron ore mines on behalf of steel 15 Table of Contents company customers to primarily a merchant of iron ore to those customers by increasing its interests in its mines. The Companys ownership interests in its six North American mines are as follows: Ownership Interest as of December 31, Location and Name 2003 2002 2001 Michigan (Marquette Range) Empire Iron Mining Partnership 79.0 % 79.0 % 46.7 % Tilden Mining Company L.C. 85.0 85.0 40.0 Minnesota (Mesabi Range) Hibbing Taconite Company Joint Venture 23.0 23.0 15.0 Northshore Mining Company 100.0 100.0 100.0 United Taconite LLC 70.0 Canada (Newfoundland and Quebec) Wabush Mines Joint Venture 26.8 26.8 22.8 The Company increased its ownership in its mines (other than Northshore and United Taconite) through assumption of liabilities associated with the mine interests. This increased ownership has allowed it to convert its mine partners into customers with term supply agreements. The increased mine ownership has also served to improve the competitiveness of Cliffs operations, by allowing it to make operating and capital decisions faster and more efficiently and enhancing its ability to improve productivity, decrease production costs and continuously improve pellet quality. Following is a summary of the Companys key operating and financial indicators for the years 2003, 2002 and 2001: 2003 2002 2001 Pellet Sales (Million Tons) 19.2 14.7 8.4 Revenues from Iron Ore Sales and Services (Millions)* $ 686.8 $ 510.8 $ 301.5 Pellet Production (Million Tons) Total 30.3 27.9 25.4 Companys Share 18.1 14.7 7.8 Sales Margin (Loss) Amount (Millions) $ (9.9 ) $ 3.7 $ (39.4 ) Per Ton of Sales $ (.53 ) $ .25 $ (4.69 ) Loss from Continuing Operations Amount (Millions) $ (34.9 ) $ (66.4 ) $ (19.5 ) Per Share $ (3.40 ) $ (6.58 ) $ (1.93 ) Net Loss Amount (Millions) $ (32.7 ) $ (188.3 ) $ (22.9 ) Per Share $ (3.19 ) $ (18.62 ) $ (2.27 ) * The Company also received revenues of $138.3 million, $75.6 million and $17.8 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, related to freight and minority interest. Iron ore pellet sales in 2003 were 19.2 million tons, a 4.5 million ton, or 31 percent increase, from the previous record 14.7 million tons sold in 2002. The sales increase primarily reflects the effect of new and revised agreements initiated in 2002 and 2003 consistent with the Companys increased mine ownerships. Iron ore pellet production for Cliffs account was 18.1 million tons in 2003 versus 14.7 million tons in 2002. The 3.4 million ton, or 23 percent, increase was largely due to increased mine ownerships and higher production at all mines except Tilden. The Companys decrease in sales margin from 2002 largely reflects the impact of higher unit production costs due to increased energy rates, higher pension and medical costs, ore throughput difficulties at the 16 Table of Contents Michigan mines in 2003, an equipment outage at the Tilden operation in Michigan in December 2003 and the impact of the decreased valuation of the U.S. dollar on its Canadian operating results. Partially offsetting the cost increases was the increase in sales and production volume. In July 2003, the Company initiated an action plan to significantly improve operating results by achieving annualized cost savings in excess of $35 million from 2003 projected results. The plan incorporated reduction actions in the areas of employment, energy, services, maintenance and supplies costs during the remainder of 2003 and in 2004, with the impact expected to be fully realized by 2005. The Companys business is affected by a number of factors, which are described in detail below under Risks Relating to the Company. As the Company has increased its role as a merchant of iron ore to steel company customers, it has become more dependent on the revenues from its term supply agreements. Because its agreements are largely requirements contracts, those revenues are heavily dependent on customer consumption of iron ore from the Companys mines. Customer requirements may be affected by increased use of iron ore substitutes, including imported semi finished steel, customer rationalization or financial failure, and decreased North American steel production resulting from increased imports or lower steel consumption. Further, the Companys sales are concentrated with a relatively few number of customers. Unmitigated loss of sales would have a significantly greater impact on operating results and cash flow than revenue, due to the high level of fixed costs in the iron ore mining business in the near term and the high cost to idle or close mines. In the event of a venture participants failure to perform, remaining solvent venturers, including the Company, may be required to assume additional fixed costs and record additional material obligations. The premature closure of a mine due to the loss of a significant customer or the failure of a venturer would accelerate substantial employment and mine shutdown costs. Results of Operations In 2003, the Company had a net loss of $32.7 million, or $3.19 per share, versus a net loss for the year 2002 of $188.3 million, or $18.62 per share. Following is a summary of results: (In Millions) 2003 2002 2001 Loss from continuing operations* $ (34.9 ) $ (66.4 ) $ (19.5 ) Loss from discontinued operation** (108.5 ) (12.7 ) Loss before extraordinary gain and cumulative effect of accounting changes** (34.9 ) (174.9 ) (32.2 ) Extraordinary gain** 2.2 Cumulative effect of accounting changes*** (13.4 ) 9.3 Net loss amount $ (32.7 ) $ (188.3 ) $ (22.9 ) per share basic $ (3.19 ) $ (18.62 ) $ (2.27 ) per share diluted $ (3.19 ) $ (18.62 ) $ (2.27 ) Average number of shares (in thousands) basic 10,256 10,117 10,073 diluted 10,256 10,117 10,073 Earnings (loss) before interest and taxes (EBIT)* $ (41.2 ) $ (55.5 ) $ (23.7 ) Earnings (loss) before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA)* $ (12.2 ) $ (21.6 ) $ (.3 ) 17 Table of Contents * Includes charges for impairments of mining assets of $2.6 million in 2003 and $52.7 million in 2002. ** Net of tax and minority interest *** Net of tax Following is a reconciliation of the Companys EBIT and EBITDA to its Net cash from operating activities: (In Millions) 2003 2002 2001 Net cash from operating activities (continuing operations) $ 42.7 $ 40.9 $ 28.9 Changes in operating assets and liabilities 5.3 (12.9 ) (39.6 ) Other non cash adjustments excluding depreciation and amortization (53.9 ) (60.5 ) 14.6 Income tax (credit) expense (.3 ) 9.1 (9.2 ) Interest income (10.6 ) (4.8 ) (3.8 ) Interest expense 4.6 6.6 8.8 EBITDA (12.2 ) (21.6 ) (.3 ) Depreciation and amortization (29.0 ) (33.9 ) (23.4 ) EBIT $ (41.2 ) $ (55.5 ) $ (23.7 ) EBIT and EBITDA are non GAAP measures utilized by management to measure liquidity. 2003 Versus 2002 The net loss for the year 2003 was $32.7 million, or $3.19 per share, including an extraordinary gain of $2.2 million related to the United Taconite acquisition of the Eveleth mine assets in Minnesota in December 2003. The net loss in 2002 of $188.3 million, or $18.62 per share included a loss of $108.5 million from a discontinued operation, and a $13.4 million cumulative effect charge related to a change in the Companys accounting method for recognizing estimated future mine closure obligations. The loss from continuing operations was $34.9 million, or $3.40 per share in 2003 versus a loss of $66.4 million or $6.58 per share in 2002. The $31.5 million lower loss reflected improved pre tax results of $22.1 million and lower income tax expense of $9.4 million principally due to establishing a deferred tax valuation allowance in 2002. The improvement in pre tax results was primarily due to the $52.7 million charge 18 Table of Contents for the impairment of mining assets in 2002; the impairment charge was $2.6 million in 2003. Partially offsetting the lower impairment charge was a $23.1 million decrease in sales margin, summarized as follows: (In Millions) Increase (Decrease) 2003 2002 Amount Percent Iron ore pellet sales (tons) 19.2 14.7 4.5 31 % Revenues from iron ore sales and services* $ 686.8 $ 510.8 $ 176.0 34 % Cost of goods sold and operating expenses* Total 696.7 507.1 189.6 37 Costs of production curtailments 11.1 20.6 (9.5 ) (46 ) Excluding costs of production curtailments 685.6 486.5 199.1 41 % Sales margin (loss) Total $ (9.9 ) $ 3.7 $ (13.6 ) N/M Excluding costs of production curtailments Amount $ 1.2 $ 24.3 $ (23.1 ) (95 )% Percent of revenues .2 % 4.8 % (4.6 )% * The Company also received revenues and expenses of $138.3 million and $75.6 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively, related to freight and minority interest. Revenues from Iron Ore Sales and Services Revenues from iron ore sales and services were $686.8 million in 2003, an increase of $176.0 million, or 34 percent, from revenues of $510.8 million in 2002. The increase was mainly due to the 4.5 million ton, or 31 percent, increase in pellet sales volume in 2003. The 19.2 million tons sold in 2003 was a record, surpassing the previous record of 14.7 million tons sold in 2002. The increase in revenue also reflected an increase in sales price realization which resulted from favorable term supply agreement escalation factors and the mix of agreements. Cost of Goods Sold and Operating Expenses Cost of goods sold and operating expenses totaled $696.7 million in 2003, an increase of $189.6 million, or 37 percent, from $507.1 million in 2002. Excluding fixed costs related to production curtailments, 2003 costs and expenses were $199.1 million, or 41 percent, higher than 2002, principally due to increased sales volume and higher unit costs. The unit cost increase reflected higher energy rates, increased pension and medical costs, throughput difficulties at the Michigan mines, an equipment outage at the Tilden operations in Michigan in December 2003, and the impact of the decreased U.S. exchange rate with Canada. On May 15, 2003, the failure of a dam in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan resulted in flood conditions which caused production curtailments at the Empire and Tilden mines for approximately five weeks. While the flooding did not directly damage the mines, the mines were idled when Wisconsin Energy Corporation, which supplies electricity to the mines, was forced to shutdown its power plant in Marquette, Michigan. The mines returned to full production by the end of June; however, approximately 1.0 million tons of production was lost (Companys share .8 million tons). The Companys share of fixed costs related to the lost production was $11.1 million. The Company is pursuing a business interruption claim under its property insurance program. Production curtailments in 2002, due to market conditions, had a $20.6 million fixed cost effect. On November 26, 2003, the Tilden mine experienced a crack in a kiln riding ring that required the shutdown of its Unit #2 furnace in the pelletizing plant. As a result of the failure, Tildens production in 2003 decreased by .3 million tons resulting in a 2003 loss of approximately $6 million, including the cost of the 19 Table of Contents repair and the cost of accelerating planned 2004 maintenance into December 2003 to coincide with the riding ring repair. Year 2004 production is not expected to be significantly affected by the failure. Sales Margin (Loss) Sales margin in 2003 was a loss of $9.9 million versus a sales margin of $3.7 million in 2002. Excluding fixed costs related to production curtailments, the sales margin was $1.2 million in 2003 versus $24.3 million in 2002. The decrease in sales margin in 2003 reflected increased unit production costs partially offset by higher production and sales volume and increased sales realization. Other Revenues Royalties and management fees from partners were $10.6 million in 2003, a decrease of $1.6 million from 2002. The decrease was principally due to the whole year effect of the Companys increased ownership in mines in 2002, partially offset by increased production. Interest income of $10.6 million in 2003 was $5.8 million above 2002 income of $4.8 million. The increase primarily reflected interest on the long term receivables from Ispat Inland Inc (Ispat) and Rouge Industries Inc. (Rouge). Other income of $11.4 million in 2003 was $2.3 million less than 2002. The decrease reflected two insurance recoveries in 2002 totaling $3.5 million, partially offset by higher sales of non strategic assets in 2003. Impairment of Mining Assets As a result of increasing production costs at Empire mine, revised economic mine planning studies were completed in the fourth quarter of 2002 and updated in the fourth quarter of 2003. Based on the outcome of these studies, the ore reserve estimates at Empire were reduced from 116 million tons at December 31, 2001 to 63 million tons at December 31, 2002 and 29 million tons at December 31, 2003. The Company concluded that the assets of Empire were impaired as of December 31, 2002, based on an undiscounted probability weighted cash flow analysis. The Company recorded an impairment charge of $52.7 million to write off the carrying value of the long lived assets of Empire. In 2003, the Company recorded an additional impairment charge of $2.6 million for current years fixed asset additions. Studies are ongoing to identify the optimum production rate and consequently the mine life for Empire. An evaluation of satellite mineral resources has also been initiated for potential addition to Empires reserve base. Administrative, Selling and General Expenses Administrative, selling and general expenses in 2003 were $25.1 million, an increase of $1.3 million from 2002. The increase primarily reflects higher professional fees related to financing and business development activities and higher stock based compensation partially offset by lower employment costs and incentive compensation. The increase in stock based compensation of $4.3 million principally reflected the approximate 157 percent increase in the Companys common share price in 2003. Restructuring Charge In the third quarter 2003, the Company initiated a salaried reduction program as part of its cost reduction initiatives. The action resulted in a reduction of 136 staff employees at its corporate, central services and various mining operations, which represented an approximate 20 percent decrease in salaried workforce at the Companys U.S. operations (prior to the acquisition of United Taconite). Accordingly, the Company recorded a restructuring charge of $8.7 million in 2003. The charge is principally related to severance, pension and healthcare benefits with less than $1.6 million requiring cash funding in 2003. 20 Table of Contents Provision for Customer Bankruptcy Exposure As noted in the Risks Relating to the Company, three of the Companys significant customers petitioned for protection under chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in 2003. As a result, the Company recorded reserves totaling $7.5 million in the second and third quarters of 2003 related to its bankruptcy exposures. Other Expenses Interest expense was $4.6 million in 2003, a decrease of $2.0 million from 2002 interest expense of $6.6 million. The decrease principally reflected lower average borrowing due to the repayment and cancellation of the Companys $100 million revolving credit facility in October 2002 and repayment of a portion of the senior unsecured notes. The Company made senior unsecured note repayments of $15 million in December 2002, $5 million in June 2003, $25 million in December 2003 and the $25.0 million balance early in 2004. Other expenses were $9.4 million in 2003, an increase of $1.5 million from 2002 expenses of $7.9 million. The increase primarily reflected coal retiree expense of $2.0 million, an increase in the Companys litigation reserves of $.5 million and higher state and local taxes of $.4 million, partially offset by lower debt restructuring fees. Income Taxes In the third quarter 2002, the Company recorded a valuation allowance to fully reserve its net deferred tax assets in recognition of uncertainty regarding their realization. In 2003, the Company increased its deferred tax valuation allowance by $2.1 million to $122.7 million to offset increases in the deferred tax assets. The Company recorded an income tax credit of $.3 million, which was attributable to qualifying for a special refund of taxes paid in prior years, $.9 million, partially offset by foreign, state and local taxes. The $9.1 million net tax expense in 2002 reflected the recognition of the valuation allowance net of a $4.4 million favorable adjustment of prior years tax liabilities. The Companys deferred tax assets include significant net operating loss carryforwards, including a $12.3 million loss carryforward for alternative minimum tax purposes generated in 2003. If in the future it is determined that it is more likely than not that some or all of the net deferred tax assets will be realized, a reversal of the valuation allowance will be made. This reversal would increase income in the period such determination is made. Extraordinary Gain Effective December 1, 2003, United Taconite, a newly formed company owned 70 percent by a subsidiary of the Company and 30 percent by a subsidiary of Laiwu Steel Group Limited (Laiwu) of China, purchased the assets of Eveleth Mines LLC in Minnesota. The purchase price was $3.0 million plus the assumption of certain liabilities, primarily mine closure related environmental obligations. As a result of this transaction and in accordance with the provisions of FAS 141, the Company, after assigning appropriate values to assets acquired and liabilities assumed, was required to record an extraordinary gain of $2.2 million, net of $.5 million tax and $1.2 million minority interest. 2002 Versus 2001 The net loss for the year 2002 was $188.3 million, or $18.62 per share, including a loss of $108.5 million from a discontinued operation, a $13.4 million cumulative effect charge related to a change in the Companys accounting method for recognizing estimated future mine closure obligations, and a $52.7 million charge for the impairment of mining assets. The net loss in 2001 of $22.9 million, or $2.27 per share, included a loss from the discontinued operation of $12.7 million and an after tax credit to income of $9.3 million ($14.3 million pre tax) related to a change in the Companys accounting method for recognizing gains and losses on pension investments. 21 Table of Contents The loss before asset impairment, discontinued operation and the cumulative effect of accounting changes was $13.7 million in 2002 versus $19.5 million in 2001. The $5.8 million lower loss reflected improved pre tax results of $24.1 million partially offset by increased income tax expense, primarily due to establishing a deferred tax valuation allowance in 2002. The improved pre tax results largely reflect higher sales margins, as follows: (In Millions) Increase (Decrease) 2002 2001 Amount Percent Iron ore pellet sales (tons) 14.7 8.4 6.3 75 % Revenues from iron ore sales and services* $ 510.8 $ 301.5 $ 209.3 69 % Cost of goods sold and operating expenses* Total 507.1 340.9 166.2 49 Costs of production curtailments 20.6 48.0 (27.4 ) (57 ) Excluding costs of production curtailments 486.5 292.9 193.6 66 % Sales margin (loss) Total $ 3.7 $ (39.4 ) $ 43.1 N/M Excluding costs of production curtailments Amount $ 24.3 $ 8.6 $ 15.7 182 % Percent of revenues 4.8 % 2.9 % 1.9 % * The Company also received revenues and expenses of $75.6 million and $17.8 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively, related to freight and minority interest. Revenues from Iron Ore Sales and Services Revenues from iron ore sales and services were $510.8 million in 2002, an increase of $209.3 million or 69 percent, from revenues of $301.5 million in 2001. The increase was mainly due to the 6.3 million ton, or 75 percent, increase in pellet sales volume in 2002. Cost of Goods Sold and Operating Expenses Cost of goods sold and operating expenses totaled $507.1 million in 2002, an increase of $166.2 million, or 49 percent, from $340.9 million in 2001. Excluding fixed costs related to production curtailments, 2002 costs and expenses were $193.6 million, or 66 percent, higher than 2001, due to higher sales volume. Sales Margin Sales margin in 2002 was $3.7 million compared to a negative sales margin of $39.4 million in 2001. Excluding fixed costs related to production curtailments, the sales margin was $24.3 million, or 4.8 percent of revenues in 2002, versus $8.6 million or 2.9 percent of revenues, in 2001. The improved sales margin in 2002 reflected operating at a higher percent of capacity and lower costs excluding the impact of production curtailments. Other Revenues Royalties and management fees from partners were $12.2 million in 2002, a decrease of $17.6 million from 2001. The decrease in these revenues, which results from Cliffs strategy of converting mine partners into customers, was largely attributable to the acquisition of Algomas 45 percent interest in the Tilden mine in 2002. The loss of LTV as a partner in Empire and reduced production at Empire in 2002 also contributed to the decrease. 22 Table of Contents Interest income of $4.8 million in 2002 was $1.0 million above 2001 income of $3.8 million. The increase reflected higher average cash balances in 2002 and interest earned on Long term receivables. Partly offsetting was the impact of lower short term interest rates in 2002. Insurance recoveries in 2002 include a $1.8 million insurance recovery on a 1999 business interruption claim relating to the loss of more than one million tons of pellet sales to Rouge as a result of an explosion at the power plant that supplied Rouge. This finalized the claim, resulting in a total recovery of $17.5 million, of which $15.3 million occurred in 2000 and $.4 million in 2001. Additionally, in 2002 the Company settled with an insurance provider covering certain environmental sites, resulting in a $1.7 million recovery. Administrative, Selling and General Expenses Administrative, selling and general expenses were $23.8 million in 2002, an increase of $8.6 million from expenses of $15.2 million in 2001. The increase in 2002 expenses was mainly due to higher pension expense, increased medical and other post retirement benefits, and higher incentive compensation. Other Expenses Interest expense was $6.6 million in 2002, a decrease of $2.2 million from 2001 interest expense of $8.8 million. The decrease was due to lower interest rates and lower average borrowings under the revolving credit facility, which was terminated in October 2002. Both years include $4.9 million of interest expense on the senior unsecured notes. Other expenses were $7.9 million in 2002, an increase of $4.5 million from 2001 expenses of $3.4 million. The increase was primarily due to higher business development costs, primarily expenditures on the Mesabi Nugget Project and higher debt restructuring fees, in 2002. Discontinued Operation In the fourth quarter of 2002, Cliffs exited the ferrous metallics business and abandoned its 82 percent investment in Cliffs and Associates Limited (CAL), an HBI facility located in Trinidad and Tobago. For the year 2002, Cliffs reported a loss from discontinued operation of $108.5 million, consisting of $97.4 million ($95.7 million in the third quarter) of impairment charges and $11.1 million of idle expense, compared to a $19.6 million pre tax ($12.7 million after tax) expense in 2001. CAL operated for a portion of the year 2001 and generated net sales of $11.1 million. No expense was recorded in 2003. The Company expects CAL to be liquidated, and accordingly, has reflected no ongoing obligations of CAL. Cumulative Effect of Accounting Changes Effective January 1, 2002, the Company implemented Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 143 Asset Retirement Obligations. The statement requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period incurred. As a result of the change in accounting method, the Company recorded a cumulative effect non cash charge of $13.4 million, recognized on January 1, 2002 to provide for contractual and legal obligations associated with the eventual closure of its mining operations. Effective January 1, 2001, the Company changed its method of accounting for gains and losses on pension assets for the calculation of net periodic pension cost. Under the new accounting method, the market value of plan assets reflects unrealized gains and losses from current year performance in the succeeding year. Previously, the Company deferred realized and unrealized gains and losses, recognizing them over a five year period. The cumulative effect of the accounting change was a non cash credit to income of $9.3 million ($14.3 million pre tax) recognized on January 1, 2001. 23 Table of Contents Cash Flow and Liquidity At December 31, 2003, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $67.8 million. Following is a summary of 2003 cash flow activity: (In Millions) Net cash flow from operating activities $ 42.7 Repayment of long term debt (30.0 ) Capital expenditures (21.6 ) Proceeds from sale of assets 8.9 Proceeds from stock options 6.0 Purchase of EVTAC assets (2.0 ) Other 2.0 Increase in cash and cash equivalents $ 6.0 Following is a summary of key liquidity measures: At December 31 (In Millions) 2003 2002 2001 Cash and cash equivalents $ 67.8 $ 61.8 $ 183.8 Debt (25.0 ) (55.0 ) (170.0 ) Net cash $ 42.8 $ 6.8 $ 13.8 Working capital $ 87.4 $ 95.7 $ 172.9 EBIT* $ (41.2 ) $ (55.5 ) $ (23.7 ) EBITDA* $ (12.2 ) $ (21.6 ) $ (.3 ) * Includes charges for impairments of mining assets of $2.6 million in 2003 and $52.7 million in 2002. The Company made principal repayments on its senior unsecured notes of $15.0 million in December 2002, $5.0 million in June 2003, $25.0 million in December 2003 and the $25.0 million balance in early 2004. In October 2002, the Company repaid its $100 million revolving credit facility and terminated the agreement. During the fourth quarter 2003, the Company realized $6.0 million from the exercise of stock options. A total of 180,000 shares were issued from treasury stock. The Company anticipates that its share of capital expenditures related to the iron ore business, which was $21.6 million in 2003, will increase to approximately $35 million in 2004. The Company expects to fund its capital expenditures from available cash and current operations. Subsequent Event Issuance of Preferred Stock In January 2004, the Company completed a private offering of $172.5 million of redeemable cumulative convertible perpetual preferred stock. The preferred stock will pay cash dividends at a rate of 3.25 percent per annum. The shares of preferred stock are convertible into the Companys common shares at an initial conversion rate of 16.1290 common shares per share of preferred stock, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price $62.00 per common share, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. The Company may also exchange this preferred stock for convertible subordinated debentures in certain circumstances. The Company expects the net proceeds after offering expenses to be approximately $166 million. A portion of the proceeds was utilized to repay the remaining $25.0 million of the Companys senior unsecured notes early in 2004; the Company has used approximately $23 million to fund its underfunded salaried pension plan and intends to use some additional amounts for other pension obligations in 2004. The Company expects to use any remaining proceeds of the offering for working capital and general corporate purposes, including capital expenditures, increased investments in its existing mines and additional contributions to its pension plans. 24 Table of Contents Operations and Customers Sales The Companys pellet sales were a record 19.2 million tons in 2003 versus the previous record of 14.7 million tons in 2002. The increase in pellet sales in 2003 was due to higher demand by the integrated steel industry and new term supply agreements in 2002 and 2003. The Company ended the year 2003 with 4.1 million tons of iron ore pellet inventory, an increase of .2 million tons from 2002, reflecting the Companys increased sales and mine ownership. The Company expects pellet sales in 2004 of approximately 22 million tons. The Companys sales volume is largely committed under term supply agreements, which are subject to changes in customer requirements. Factors impacting the Companys average price realization under various term supply agreements include measures of general industrial inflation, steel prices, and the international pellet price. The price adjustment provisions are weighted, and some are subject to annual collars, which may limit the magnitude of the Companys annual price changes. Subsequent Event International Pellet Price Settlement The major iron ore producers of Brazil and Eastern Canada annually negotiate and publish the price of their seaborne iron ore products. On February 6, 2004, Companhia Val do Rio Doce (CVRD), Brazils principal iron ore producer, reached settlement on its 2004 price for blast furnace pellets with a major European consumer. The price represents an increase of 19.0 percent or 20.1 percent for 2004 versus 2003, depending on the point of sale. If the Eastern Canadian iron ore pellet producers settle for a similar percentage price increase, the estimated effect of the international pellet price adjustment factor on the Companys revenues per ton from iron ore sales and services for 2004 will be an average increase of approximately five percent from 2003. This would represent an improvement in operating earnings of approximately $40 million, based on the 22 million tons of estimated pellet sales for 2004. The estimated 2004 impact of the other price adjustment factors included in the Companys term supply agreements, including the adjustments based on general industrial inflation rates and the price of steel, cannot be determined at this time; however, additional price increases will be limited by annual collars. Customers Rouge, a significant pellet sales customer of the Company, filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on October 23, 2003, and on January 30, 2004 sold substantially all of its assets to Severstal North America, Inc., a U.S. affiliate of OAO Severstal (Severstal), Russias second largest steel producer. The Company sold 3.0 million tons of pellets to Rouge in 2003 and 1.4 million tons in 2002. At the time of Rouges filing, the Company had no trade receivable exposure to Rouge; however, the Company has a $10 million secured loan to Rouge with a final maturity in 2007. As of December 31, 2003, the loan had a balance of $11.5 million including accrued interest. Rouge failed to make an interest payment of $1.4 million on December 15, 2003. Management will continue to assess events as they occur pertaining to collectability of the loan and interest. The Companys term supply agreement with Rouge, which provided that it would be the sole supplier of pellets to Rouge through 2012, was assumed by Severstal with minor modifications. On September 16, 2003, WCI petitioned for protection under chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. At the time of the filing, the Company had a trade receivable exposure of $4.9 million, which was reserved in the third quarter. WCI purchased 1.5 million tons (.4 million tons since the filing date) in 2003 and 1.4 million tons of pellets in 2002. The Companys term supply agreement with WCI expires at the end of 2004. On May 19, 2003, Weirton petitioned for protection under chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Weirton purchased 2.8 million tons, or 14 percent of total tons sold by the Company in 2003, and 2.9 million tons, or 20 percent of total tons sold in 2002. The Company has modified its term supply agreement with Weirton. Under the modified agreement which runs through 2005, the Company will provide the greater of 67 percent of Weirtons pellet requirements or 1.9 million tons. The Company is a 40.6 percent participant in a joint venture which acquired certain power related assets from a subsidiary of Weirton in 2001, in a purchase leaseback arrangement. The Companys investment at December 31, 2003 of $10.4 million, which is included in Other investments, is accounted for utilizing the 25 Table of Contents equity method. Subsequent to its filing, Weirton has continued to meet its obligations under the lease agreement which extends through 2012. In the second quarter of 2003, the Company recorded a provision of $2.6 million for Weirton bankruptcy exposures. In April 2002, the Company executed a term agreement to supply iron ore pellets to ISG through 2016. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company is the sole supplier of pellets purchased by ISG for its Cleveland and Indiana Harbor Works facilities. Sales, which are dependent on ISGs requirements, totaled 5.9 million tons, or 31 percent of total tons sold, in 2003 and 3.1 million tons, or 21 percent of tons sold, in 2002. In 2002, the Company invested $17.4 million in ISG common stock, which represented 7 percent of ISGs equity at that time. Initially, the Company recorded the investment utilizing the cost method. In December 2003 after ISG completed an initial public offering of its common stock, the Companys investment value increased to $196.7 million at December 31, 2003 resulting in an after tax credit to Other comprehensive income of $144.9 million reflecting the marked to market gain of $179.3 million. The investment is classified as available for sale. The Company is restricted from selling its shares until June 9, 2004. Production Following is a summary of 2003, 2002 and 2001 mine production and Company ownership: Production Companys Ownership (Million Tons) December 31 Companys Share Total Production Mine 2003 2002 2001 2003 2002 2001 2003 2002 2001 Empire 79.0 % 79.0 % 46.7 % 4.0 1.1 1.7 5.2 3.6 5.7 Tilden 85.0 85.0 40.0 6.0 6.7 2.2 7.0 7.9 6.4 Hibbing 23.0 23.0 15.0 1.8 1.5 .2 8.0 7.7 6.1 Northshore 100.0 100.0 100.0 4.8 4.2 2.8 4.8 4.2 2.8 United Taconite* 70.0 .1 1.6 4.2 4.2 Wabush 26.8 26.8 22.8 1.4 1.2 .9 5.2 4.5 4.4 Total Production** 18.1 14.7 7.8 30.3 27.9 25.4 * Production in 2001 and 2002 and 1.5 million tons of the tons produced in the first five months of 2003 occurred under the management of the previous mine owners prior to the acquisition by United Taconite in December 2003. ** Excludes United Taconite production under previous mine ownership. The increase in the Companys share of production from 7.8 million tons in 2001 to 14.7 million tons in 2002 to 18.1 million tons in 2003 reflected the Companys increased ownership in four mines in 2002 and generally higher production to meet increased market demand. The Company preliminarily expects total mine production in 2004 to be approximately 36 million tons; the Companys share of production is currently estimated to be approximately 22 million tons. The increase in 2004 estimated production reflects the whole year impact of United Taconites acquisition and anticipated higher production levels at all other mines. Production schedules are subject to change in pellet demand. Ownership Increases United Taconite Effective December 1, 2003, United Taconite, a newly formed company owned 70 percent by a subsidiary of the Company and 30 percent by a subsidiary of Laiwu, purchased the ore mining and pelletizing assets of Eveleth Mines, LLC. Eveleth Mines had ceased mining operations in May 2003 after filing for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on May 1, 2003. Under the terms of the purchase agreement, United Taconite purchased all of Eveleth Mines assets for $3 million in cash and the assumption of certain liabilities, primarily mine closure related environmental obligations. As a result of this transaction, the Company, after assigning 26 Table of Contents appropriate values to assets acquired and liabilities assumed, was required to record an extraordinary gain of $2.2 million, net of $.5 million tax and $1.2 million minority interest. In conjunction with this transaction, the Company and its Wabush Mines venture partners entered into pellet sales and trade agreements with Laiwu to optimize shipping efficiency. Empire Mine Effective December 31, 2002, the Company increased its ownership in Empire from 46.7 percent to 79 percent in exchange for assumption of all mine liabilities. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company indemnified Ispat Inland from obligations of Empire in exchange for certain future payments to Empire and to the Company by Ispat Inland of $120.0 million, recorded at a present value of $61.3 million at December 31, 2003 ($58.8 million at December 31, 2002) with $56.3 million classified as Long term receivable with the balance current, over the 12 year life of the supply agreement. A subsidiary of Ispat Inland has retained a 21 percent ownership in Empire, which it has a unilateral right to put to the Company in 2008. The Company is the sole outside supplier of pellets purchased by Ispat Inland for the term of the supply agreement. Tilden Mine On January 31, 2002, the Company increased its ownership in Tilden from 40 percent to 85 percent with the acquisition of Algomas interest in Tilden for assumption of mine liabilities associated with the interest. The acquisition increased the Companys share of the annual production capacity by 3.5 million tons. Concurrently, a term supply agreement was executed that made the Company the sole supplier of iron ore pellets purchased by Algoma for a 15 year period. Hibbing Mine In July 2002, the Company acquired (effective retroactive to January 1, 2002) an 8 percent interest in Hibbing from Bethlehem for the assumption of mine liabilities associated with the interest. The acquisition increased the Companys ownership of Hibbing from 15 percent to 23 percent. This transaction reduced Bethlehems ownership interest in Hibbing to 62.3 percent. In October 2001, Bethlehem filed for protection under chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. At the time of the filing, the Company had a trade receivable of approximately $1.0 million which has been written off. In May 2003, ISG purchased the assets of Bethlehem, including Bethlehems 62.3 percent interest in Hibbing. Wabush Mines In August 2002, Acme Steel Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of Acme Metals Incorporated, which had been under chapter 11 bankruptcy protection since 1998, rejected its 15.1 percent interest in Wabush. As a result, the Companys interest increased to 26.83 percent. Acme had discontinued funding its Wabush obligations in August 2001. Subsequent Event Stelco Restructuring On January 29, 2004, Stelco applied and obtained bankruptcy court protection from creditors in Ontario Superior Court under the Companies Creditors Arrangement Act. Pellet sales to Stelco totaled .1 million tons in 2003 and .3 million tons in 2002. Stelco Inc. is a 44.6 percent participant in Wabush Mines and U.S. subsidiaries of Stelco (which are not believed to have filed for bankruptcy protection) own 14.7 percent of Hibbing Taconite Company Joint Venture and 15 percent of Tilden Mining Company L.C. At the time of the filing, the Company had no trade receivable exposure to Stelco. Additionally, Stelco has met its cash call requirements at the mining ventures to date. The Company currently expects Stelco to continue its participation in the mining ventures. Effect of Mine Ownership Increases While none of the increases in mine ownerships during 2002 required cash payments or assumption of debt, the ownership changes resulted in the Company recognizing net obligations of approximately $93 million 27 Table of Contents at December 31, 2002. Additional consolidated obligations assumed totaled approximately $163 million at December 31, 2002, primarily related to employment and legacy obligations at the Empire and Tilden mines, partially offset by non capital long term assets, principally the $58.8 million Ispat Inland long term receivable. United Taconites acquisition of the Eveleth mine assets in December 2003 was for $3 million cash and assumption of certain liabilities, primarily mine closure related environmental obligations. Other Related Items The iron ore industry has been identified by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (the EPA) as an industrial category that emits pollutants established by the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments. These pollutants included over 200 substances that are now classified as hazardous air pollutants (HAP). The EPA is required to develop rules that would require major sources of HAP to utilize Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) standards for their emissions. Pursuant to this statutory requirement, the EPA published a final rule on October 30, 2003 imposing emission limitations and other requirements on taconite iron ore processing operations. We must comply with the new requirements not later than October 30, 2006. Our projected costs, including capital expenditures, to meet the proposed MACT standards are approximately $15 million. The United Steel Workers of America (USWA) represents all hourly employees at our Empire, Hibbing, Tilden and United Taconite mines, as well as the Wabush mine in Canada. The collective bargaining agreements for the employees at the Empire, Hibbing, Tilden and United Taconite mines will expire on August 1, 2004, and the collective bargaining agreements for the employees at the Wabush mine will expire on March 1, 2004. On April 4, 2002, the Company signed an agreement to participate in Phase II of the Mesabi Nugget Project. Other participants include Kobe Steel, Ltd., Steel Dynamics, Inc., Ferrometrics, Inc. and the State of Minnesota. Construction of a $24 million pilot plant at the Companys Northshore Mine, to test and develop Kobe Steels technology for converting iron ore into nearly pure iron in nugget form, was completed in May 2003. The high iron content product could be utilized to replace steel scrap as a raw material for electric steel furnaces and blast furnaces or basic oxygen furnaces of integrated steel producers. All of the participants have recently agreed to enter a second six month operating phase of the pilot plant, which is expected to be completed in May 2004, to explore the commercial viability of this technology. The Companys contribution to the project through the pilot plant testing and development phase was $5.2 million, primarily contributions of in kind facilities and services. Strategic Investments The Company intends to continue to pursue investment and management opportunities to broaden its scope as a supplier of iron ore pellets to the integrated steel industry through the acquisition of additional mining interests to strengthen its market position. The Company is particularly focused on expanding its international investments to leverage its expertise in processing low grade ores to capitalize on global demand for steel and iron ore in areas such as China. The Companys innovative United Taconite joint venture with Laiwu is one example of its ability to expand geographically, and the Company intends to continue to pursue similar opportunities in other regions. In the event of any future acquisitions or joint venture opportunities, the Company may consider using available liquidity or other sources of funding to make investments. Environmental and Closure Obligations At December 31, 2003, the Company had environmental and closure obligations, including its share of the obligations of ventures, of $97.8 million ($95.5 million at December 31, 2002), of which $10.2 million is current. Payments in 2003 were $7.5 million ($8.3 million in 2002). The obligations at December 31, 2003 include certain responsibilities for environmental remediation sites, $15.5 million, closure of LTV Steel Mining Company (LTVSMC), $37.1 million, and obligations for closure of the Companys six operating mines, $45.2 million, reflecting implementation of SFAS No. 143 Asset Retirement Obligations effective January 1, 2002. 28 Table of Contents The LTVSMC closure obligation resulted from an October 2001 transaction where subsidiaries of the Company and Minnesota Power, a business of Allete, Inc., acquired LTVs assets of LTVSMC in Minnesota for $25.0 million (Company share $12.5 million). As a result of this transaction the Company received a payment of $62.5 million from Minnesota Power and assumed environmental and certain facility closure obligations of $50.0 million. In September 2002, the Company received a draft of a proposed Administrative Order on Consent (Consent Order) from the EPA, for cleanup and reimbursement of costs associated with the Milwaukee Solvay coke plant site in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The plant was operated by a predecessor of the Company from 1973 to 1983, which predecessor was acquired by the Company in 1986. In January 2003, the Company completed the sale of the plant site and property to a third party. Following this sale, a Consent Order was entered into with the EPA by the Company, the new owner and another third party who had operated on the site. In connection with the Consent Order, the new owner agreed to take responsibility for the removal action and agreed to indemnify the Company for all costs and expenses in connection with the removal action. In the third quarter 2003, the new owner, after completing a portion of the removal, experienced financial difficulties. In an effort to continue progress on the removal action, the Company expended approximately $.9 million in the third and fourth quarters. The Company will likely be required to expend additional amounts of approximately $2 million, for the completion of the removal action, which expenditures were previously provided for in the Companys environmental reserve. Summary of Contractual Obligations Following is a summary of the Companys contractual obligations at December 31, 2003: Payments Due by Period(1) (Millions) Contractual Obligations Total Less than 1 year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years More than 5 Years Long Term Debt $ 25.0 $ 25.0 $ $ $ Capital Lease Obligations 11.4 3.3 4.1 3.4 .6 Operating Leases 63.7 21.6 25.8 11.8 4.5 Purchase Obligations Open Purchase Orders 15.4 15.4 Minimum Take or Pay Purchase Commitments(2) 187.6 56.7 68.6 52.4 9.9 Total Purchase Obligations 203.0 72.1 68.6 52.4 9.9 Other Long Term Liabilities Pension Funding Minimums 140.9 4.3 29.0 51.7 55.9 OPEB Claim Payments 153.4 17.6 40.6 45.6 49.6 Mine Closure Obligations 82.3 5.7 11.0 16.1 49.5 Coal Industry Retiree Health Benefits 8.0 1.4 1.6 1.5 3.5 Personal Injury 9.5 1.5 2.3 1.8 3.9 Other(3) 78.8 Total Other Long Term Liabilities 472.9 30.5 84.5 116.7 162.4 Total $ 776.0 $ 152.5 $ 183.0 $ 184.3 $ 177.4 (1) Includes the Companys consolidated obligations and the Companys ownership share of unconsolidated ventures obligations. (2) Includes minimum electric power demand charges, minimum coal and natural gas obligations, and minimum railroad transportation obligations. 29 Table of Contents (3) Primarily includes deferred income taxes payable (principally related to the ISG marked to market, other comprehensive income) and other contingent liabilities for which payment timing is non determinable. Market Risk The Company is subject to a variety of market risks, including those caused by changes in market value of equity investments, commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Company has established policies and procedures to manage risks; however, certain risks are beyond the control of the Company. The Companys investment policy relating to its short term investments (classified as cash equivalents) is to preserve principal and liquidity while maximizing the return through investment of available funds. The carrying value of these investments approximates fair value on the reporting dates. The value of the Companys equity investment in common stock of ISG is subject to changes in market value as reflected in the trading price. This investment has been classified as an available for sale investment, and accordingly, changes in value have been recorded in Shareholders Equity. If the market price of the stock at December 31, 2003, were to increase or decrease 10 percent, the value of the investment would change approximately $20 million before taxes. The Companys mining ventures enter into forward contracts for certain commodities, primarily natural gas, as a hedge against price volatility. Such contracts, which are in quantities expected to be delivered and used in the production process, are a means to limit exposure to price fluctuations. At December 31, 2003, the notional amounts of the outstanding forward contracts were $22.5 million (Company share $18.1 million), with an unrecognized fair value gain of $4.2 million (Company share $3.4 million) based on December 31, 2003 forward rates. The contracts mature at various times through October 2004. If the forward rates were to change 10 percent from the year end rate, the value and potential cash flow effect on the contracts would be approximately $2.7 million (Company share $2.2 million). The Company had $25 million of senior unsecured notes outstanding at December 31, 2003, which were repaid early in 2004. A portion of the Companys operating costs related to the Wabush mine is subject to change in the value of the Canadian dollar; however, the Company does not hedge its exposure to changes in the Canadian dollar. Critical Accounting Policies Managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on the Companys consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). Preparation of financial statements requires management to make assumptions, estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses, and the related disclosures of contingencies. Management bases its estimates on various assumptions and historical experience which are believed to be reasonable; however, due to the inherent nature of estimates, actual results may differ significantly due to changed conditions or assumptions. Management believes that the following critical accounting policies and practices incorporate estimates and judgments that have the most significant impact on the Companys financial statements. Iron Ore Reserves The Company regularly evaluates its economic iron ore reserves and updates them as required in accordance with SEC Industry Guide 7. The estimated ore reserves could be affected by future industry conditions, geological conditions and ongoing mine planning. Maintenance of effective production capacity or the ore reserve could require increases in capital and development expenditures. Generally as mining operations progress, haul lengths and lifts increase. Alternatively, changes in economic conditions, or the expected quality of ore reserves could decrease capacity or ore reserves. Technological progress could alleviate such factors or increase capacity or ore reserves. Remaining Empire mine ore reserves were decreased to 30 Table of Contents 29 million tons at December 31, 2003 from 63 million tons at December 31, 2002 and 116 million tons at December 31, 2001. The reduction in ore reserves reflected increasing production and processing costs in recent years as the Empire mine approaches the latter portion of its economic life. Additionally, economic ore reserves at the Wabush mine were reduced in the last two years to 61 million tons at December 31, 2003 from 94 million tons at December 31, 2002 and 244 million tons at December 31, 2001. The decrease in ore reserves at the Wabush mine reflects increased operating costs, the impact of currency exchange rates, and a reduction in the maximum mining depth in one critical mining area due to assessment of dewatering capabilities based on a recently completed hydrologic evaluation. The Company uses its ore reserve estimates to determine the mine closure dates utilized in recording the fair value liability for asset retirement obligations. See Note 5 Environmental and Mine Closure Obligations Mine Closure in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Since the liability represents the present value of the expected future obligation, a significant change in ore reserves would have a substantial effect on the recorded obligation. The Company also utilizes economic ore reserves for evaluating potential impairments of mine assets and in determining maximum useful lives utilized to calculate depreciation and amortization of long lived mine assets. Decreases in ore reserves could significantly affect these items. Asset Retirement Obligations The accrued mine closure obligations for the Companys active mining operations reflect the adoption of SFAS No. 143 effective January 1, 2002 to provide for contractual and legal obligations associated with the eventual closure of the mining operations. The Companys obligations are determined based on detailed estimates adjusted for factors that an outside party would consider (i.e., inflation, overhead and profit), which were escalated (at an assumed 3 percent) to the estimated closure dates, and then discounted using a credit adjusted risk free interest rate (12.0 percent for United Taconite and 10.25 percent for all others). The closure date for each location was determined based on the exhaustion date of the remaining iron ore reserves. The estimated obligations are particularly sensitive to the impact of changes in mine lives given the difference between the inflation and discount rates. Changes in the base estimates of legal and contractual closure costs due to changed legal or contractual requirements, available technology, inflation, overhead or profit rates would also have a significant impact on the recorded obligations. See Note 5 Environmental and Mine Closure Obligations Mine Closure in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Asset Impairment The Company monitors conditions that indicate that the carrying value of an asset or asset group may be impaired. The Company determines impairment based on the assets ability to generate cash flow greater than its carrying value, utilizing an undiscounted probability weighted analysis. If the analysis indicates the asset is impaired, the carrying value is adjusted to fair value. The impairment analysis and fair value determination can result in significantly different outcomes based on critical assumptions and estimates including the quantity and quality of remaining economic ore reserves, and future iron ore prices and production costs. See Note 1 Operations and Customers Empire Mine and Note 3 Discontinued Operation in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Environmental Remediation Costs The Company has a formal code of environmental protection and restoration. The Companys obligations for known environmental problems at active and closed mining operations and other sites have been recognized based on estimates of the cost of investigation and remediation at each site. If the estimate can only be estimated as a range of possible amounts, with no specific amount being most likely, the minimum of the range is accrued. Management reviews its environmental remediation sites quarterly to determine if additional cost adjustments or disclosures are required. The characteristics of environmental remediation obligations, where information concerning the nature and extent of clean up activities is not immediately available, or changes in regulatory requirements, result in a significant risk of increase to the obligations as they mature. Expected future expenditures are not discounted to present value. Potential insurance recoveries are not recognized until realized. 31 Table of Contents Employee Retirement Benefit Obligations Assumptions used in determining the benefit obligations and the value of plan assets for defined benefit pension plans and post retirement benefit plans (primarily retiree healthcare benefits) offered by the Company and its ventures are evaluated periodically by management in conjunction with outside actuaries. Critical assumptions, such as the discount rate used to measure the benefit obligations, the expected long term rate of return on plan assets, and the medical care cost trend are reviewed annually. At December 31, 2003, the Company reduced its discount rate to 6.25 percent from 6.90 percent at December 31, 2002. The Company also reduced its expected return on plan assets utilized for calculating 2004 pension and OPEB expense by ..5 percent to 8.5 percent. Additionally, the Company increased its medical care cost trend assumption to 10 percent in 2004 decreasing to 5 percent in 2009 and thereafter; previously the Company utilized a medical trend rate assumption of 9 percent in 2004 decreasing to 5 percent in 2008 and thereafter. Following are sensitivities on estimated 2004 pension and OPEB expense of potential further changes in these key assumptions: Increase in 2004 Expense (In Millions) Pension OPEB Decrease discount rate .25 percent $ 1.2 $ .9 Decrease return on assets 1 percent 4.0 .5 Increase medical trend rate 1 percent N/A 3.4 Changes in actuarial assumptions, including discount rates, employee retirement rates, mortality, compensation levels, plan asset investment performance, and healthcare costs, are determined in conjunction with outside actuaries. Changes in actuarial assumptions and or investment performance of plan assets can have a significant impact on the Companys financial condition due to the magnitude of the Companys retirement obligations. See Note 8 Retirement Related Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Income Taxes Income taxes are based on income (loss) for financial reporting purposes and reflect a current tax liability (asset) for the estimated taxes payable (recoverable) in the current year tax return and changes in deferred taxes. Deferred tax assets or liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using enacted tax laws and rates. The Company recorded a valuation allowance in 2002 for its net deferred tax assets and net loss carryforwards in recognition of the uncertainty of their realization. In making the determination to record the valuation allowance, management considered the likelihood of future taxable income and feasible and prudent tax planning strategies to realize deferred tax assets. In the future, if the Company determines that it expects to realize more or less of the deferred tax assets, an adjustment to the valuation allowance will affect income in the period such determination is made. See Note 9 Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Risks Relating to the Company Excess global capacity and the availability of competitive substitute materials have resulted in intense competition in the steel industry, which may further reduce steel prices and decrease steel production and our customers demand for iron ore products. More than 95 percent of our revenues are derived from the North American integrated steel industry, which is highly competitive. From time to time, global overcapacity in steel manufacturing has a negative impact on North American steel sales and reduces the production of steel and consequently the demand for iron ore. Further, production of steel by North American integrated steel manufacturers may be replaced to a certain extent by production of substitute materials by other manufacturers. In the case of certain product applications, North American steel manufacturers compete with manufacturers of other materials, including plastic, aluminum, graphite composites, ceramics, glass, wood and concrete. Most of our term supply agreements for the sale of iron ore products are requirements based or provide for flexibility of volume above a 32 Table of Contents minimum level. Reduced demand for and consumption of iron ore products by North American integrated steel producers have had and may continue to have a significant negative impact on our sales, margins and profitability. Increased imports of steel into the United States could adversely impact North American steel sales, which could adversely affect demand for our products and our sales, margins and profitability. From time to time, global overcapacity in steel manufacturing and a weakening of certain foreign economies, particularly in Eastern Europe, Asia and Latin America, may negatively impact steel prices in those foreign economies and result in high levels of steel imports from those countries into the United States at depressed prices. Based on the American Iron and Steel Institutes Apparent Steel Supply (excluding semi finished steel products), imports of steel into the United States constituted 20.4 percent, 20.2 percent and 22.3 percent of the domestic steel market supply for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Significant imports of steel into the United States have substantially reduced sales, margins and profitability of North American steel producers, and therefore, have reduced demand for iron ore. The purchase by North American steel producers of semi finished steel products from foreign suppliers also will decrease demand for our iron ore products. The U.S. government established various protective actions during 2001 and 2002, including the enactment of various steel import quotas and tariffs, which contributed to a decrease of some steel imports during 2002. However, these protective measures were only temporary and many foreign steel manufacturers were granted exemptions from applications of these measures. Furthermore, some products (including iron ore and some semi finished steel products) and some countries were not covered by these protective measures. On November 10, 2003, the highest trade court of the World Trade Organization issued a final decision declaring that the tariffs imposed by the United States on hot rolled and cold rolled finished steel imports violated global trade rules. Shortly after this decision was announced, a number of countries threatened to impose retaliatory tariffs on various products produced in the United States if the United States did not terminate its steel tariffs. On December 4, 2003, President Bush announced that the steel import quotas and tariffs would be lifted, effective at midnight on that day. At this time it is uncertain how the lifting of these measures will affect the North American steel industry, but the removal of these measures may lead to an increase of steel imports and result in a reduction of North American steel sales. The decreased North American steel sales could decrease demand for iron ore products and have a substantial negative impact on our sales, margins and profitability. The North American steel industry is undergoing a restructuring process that has resulted in industry consolidation and is likely to result in a reduction of integrated steel making capacity over time, and thereby reduce iron ore consumption. The North American steel industry has undergone consolidation, and that consolidation is likely to continue. Consolidation of the North American steel industry will result in fewer customers for iron ore. The restructuring process may reduce integrated steel making capacity, which would reduce demand for our iron ore products and may adversely affect our sales. Further, if the steel producers that have captive iron ore mines obtain a larger share of the North American steel production, they may obtain their iron ore from their own mines, if they have excess capacity, rather than from us. These factors could adversely affect our sales, margins and profitability. Our sales and earnings are subject to significant fluctuations as a result of the cyclical nature of the North American steel industry. In 2002 and 2003, 14.5 million and 18.6 million tons, respectively, of the iron ore pellets we produced were sold to North American steel manufacturers, while only .2 million and .6 million tons, respectively, of our pellets were sold outside of North America. The North American steel industry has been highly cyclical in nature, influenced by a combination of factors, including periods of economic growth or recession, strength or weakness of the U.S. dollar, worldwide production capacity, the strength of the U.S. automotive industry, levels of steel imports and applicable tariffs. The demand for steel products is generally affected by macroeconomic fluctuations in North America and the global economies in which steel companies sell their 33 Table of Contents products. For example, future economic downturns, stagnant economies or currency fluctuations in the United States or globally could decrease the demand for steel products or increase the amount of imports of steel or iron ore into the United States. In addition, a disruption or downturn in the oil and gas, gas transmission, construction, commercial equipment, rail transportation, appliance, agricultural, automotive or durable goods industries, all of which are significant markets for steel products and are highly cyclical, could negatively impact sales of steel by North American producers. These trends could decrease the demand for iron ore products and significantly adversely affect our sales, margins and profitability. If North American steelmakers use methods other than blast furnace production to produce steel, or if their blast furnaces shut down or otherwise reduce production, the demand for our iron ore products may decrease, which would adversely affect our sales, margins and profitability. Demand for our iron ore products is determined by the operating rates for the blast furnaces of North American steel companies. However, not all finished steel is produced by blast furnaces; finished steel also may be produced by other methods that do not require iron ore products. For example, steel mini mills, which are steel recyclers, generally produce steel by using scrap steel, not iron ore pellets, in their electric furnaces. Production of steel by steel mini mills was approximately 50 percent of North American total finished steel production in 2003. Steel producers also can produce steel using imported iron ore or semi finished steel products, which eliminates the need for domestic iron ore. Environmental restrictions on the use of blast furnaces also may reduce our customers use of their blast furnaces. Maintenance of blast furnaces can require substantial capital expenditures. Our customers may choose not to maintain their blast furnaces, and some of our customers may not have the resources necessary to adequately maintain their blast furnaces. If our customers use methods to produce steel that do not use iron ore products, demand for our iron ore products will decrease, which could adversely affect our sales, margins and profitability. Natural disasters, equipment failures and other unexpected events may lead our steel industry customers to curtail production or shut down their operations. Operating levels at our steel industry customers are subject to conditions beyond their control, including raw material shortages, weather conditions, natural disasters, interruptions in electrical power or other energy services, equipment failures, and other unexpected events. Any of those events could also affect other suppliers to the North American steel industry. In either case, those events could cause our steel industry customers to curtail production or shut down a portion or all of their operations, which could reduce their demand for our iron ore products. For example, in late 2003, a fire occurred in a mine of a major coal supplier to U.S. Steel, which supplies a majority of the coke, a processed form of coal, used by our steel industry customers to operate their blast furnaces. The fire caused U.S. Steel to curtail its production of coke, and to reduce its coke shipments to at least two of our steel industry customers. As a result, one of our steel industry customers had to curtail its steel production, and its demand for our iron ore products decreased. Accordingly, as discussed below, that customer invoked the force majeure provision of its term supply agreement with us and reduced its requirements for our iron ore products in the first quarter of 2004 by 180,000 long tons. Another of our steel industry customers announced that it is exploring alternatives, including temporary curtailments of some of its steel making operations, in order to deal with the coke shortage. Production of steel by our other steel industry customers may also be adversely affected by the failure of U.S. Steel to ship adequate supplies of coke to them. Decreased demand for our iron ore products could adversely affect our sales, margins and profitability. If the rate of steel consumption in China slows, the demand for iron ore could decrease. Although we do not have significant international sales, the price of iron ore is strongly influenced by international demand. The current growing level of international demand for iron ore and steel is largely due to the rapid industrial growth in China. A large quantity of steel is currently being used in China to build roads, bridges, railroads and factories. If the economic growth rate in China slows, which may be difficult to forecast, less steel will be used in construction and manufacturing, which would decrease demand for iron ore. This 34 Table of Contents could adversely impact the world iron ore market, which would impact the North American iron ore market, and could also adversely impact our United Taconite joint venture with Laiwu. We operate in a very competitive industry. Iron ore resources are in abundant supply world wide, and the iron mining business is highly competitive, with producers in all iron producing regions. Some of our competitors may have greater financial resources than we have and may be better able to withstand changes in conditions within the North American steel industry than we are. In the future, we may face increasing competition. As a result, we may face pressures on sales prices and volumes of our products from competitors and large customers. Our sales and competitive position depend on our ability to transport our products to our customers at competitive rates and in a timely manner. Our competitive position is largely dependent on the ability to transport iron ore to our markets at competitive rates. Disruption of the lake freighter and rail transportation services because of weather related problems, including ice and winter weather conditions on the Great Lakes, strikes, lock outs or other events, could impair our ability to supply iron ore pellets to our customers at competitive rates or in a timely manner and, thus, could adversely affect our sales and profitability. Further, increases in transportation costs, or changes in such costs relative to transportation costs incurred by our competitors, could make our products less competitive, restrict our access to certain markets and have an adverse effect on our sales, margins and profitability. If a substantial portion of our term supply agreements terminate and are not renewed, and we are unable to find alternate buyers willing to purchase our products on terms comparable to those in our existing term supply agreements, our sales, margins and profitability will suffer. A substantial majority of our sales are made under term supply agreements, which are important to the stability and profitability of our operations. In 2003 and 2002, more than 94 percent of our sales volume was sold under term supply agreements. If a substantial portion of our term supply agreements were modified or terminated, we could be materially adversely affected to the extent that we are unable to renew the agreements or find alternate buyers for our iron ore at the same level of profitability. We cannot assure you that we will be able to renew or replace existing term supply agreements at the same prices or with similar profit margins when they expire. A loss of sales to our existing customers could have a substantial negative impact on our sales, margins and profitability. We depend on a limited number of customers, and the loss of, or significant reduction in, purchases by our largest customers could adversely affect our sales. The following six customers together accounted for a total of 93 percent and 79 percent of our total sales revenues in the years ended 2003 and 2002, respectively: Percent of Sales Revenues Year Ended December 31, Customer 2003 2002 ISG 30 % 21 % Algoma 17 19 Rouge 16 9 Weirton 15 21 Ispat Inland 8 1 WCI 7 8 Total 93 % 79 % 35 Table of Contents If one or more of these customers were to significantly reduce their purchases of iron ore products from us, or if we were unable to sell iron ore products to them on terms as favorable to us as the terms under our current term supply agreements, our sales, margins and profitability could suffer materially due to the high level of fixed costs in the near term and the high costs to idle or close mines. We are a merchant mine producer of iron ore products, not a captive producer owned by a steel manufacturer, and therefore we rely on sales to our joint venture partners and other third party customers for our revenues. In addition, Weirton, WCI and Stelco have petitioned for protection under bankruptcy or similar laws, as discussed below, and the bankruptcy or reorganization of our customers could affect our sales, margins and profitability. Changes in demand for our products by our customers could cause our sales, margins and profitability to fluctuate. Our term supply agreements generally are requirements contracts, the majority of which have no minimum requirement provisions, and some of which provide for flexibility of volume above minimum levels. A decrease in one or more of our customers requirements could cause our sales to decline, as we may not be able to find other customers to purchase our iron ore pellets. In addition, if our customers requirements decline, since many of our production costs are fixed, our production costs per ton may rise, which may affect our margins and profitability. Unmitigated loss of revenues would have a greater impact on margins and profitability than sales, due to the high level of fixed costs in the iron ore mining business in the near term and the high cost to idle or close mines. The provisions of our term supply agreements could cause our sales, margins and profitability to fluctuate. Our term supply agreements typically contain force majeure provisions allowing temporary suspension of performance by the customer during specified events beyond the customers control, including raw material shortages, power failures, equipment failures, adverse weather conditions and other events. For example, as noted above, one of our large customers notified us in January 2004 that it was reducing its requirements for iron ore pellets in the first quarter of 2004 by 180,000 long tons pursuant to the force majeure provisions of its term supply agreement with us. That customer invoked the force majeure provision due to a failure of U.S. Steel to ship the quantity of coke that the customer had ordered due to shortages caused by a fire at a mine that supplied coal to U.S. Steel. If the coke shortages continue, other customers may seek to reduce their iron ore supply requirements. Price escalators in our term supply agreements also expose us to short term price volatility, which can adversely affect our margins and profitability. Our term supply agreements also contain provisions requiring us to deliver iron ore pellets meeting quality thresholds for certain characteristics, such as chemical makeup. Failure to meet these specifications could result in economic penalties. All of these contractual provisions could adversely affect our sales, margins and profitability. Mine closures entail substantial costs, and if we close one or more of our mines sooner than anticipated, our results of operations and financial condition may be significantly and adversely affected. If we close any of our mines, our revenues would be reduced unless we were able to increase production at any of our other mines, which may not be possible. The closure of an open pit mine involves significant fixed closure costs, including accelerated employment legacy costs, severance related obligations, reclamation and other environmental costs, and the costs of terminating long term obligations, including energy contracts and equipment leases. We base our assumptions regarding the life of our mines on detailed studies we perform from time to time, but those studies and assumptions do not always prove to be accurate. We accrue for the costs of reclaiming open pits, stockpiles, tailings ponds, roads and other mining support areas over the estimated mining life of our property. If we were to reduce the estimated life of any of our mines, the fixed mine closure costs would be applied to a shorter period of production, which would increase production costs per ton produced and could significantly and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Further, if we were to close one or more of our mines prematurely, we would incur significant accelerated employment legacy costs, severance related obligations, reclamation and other environmental costs, as well as asset impairment charges, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition. 36 Table of Contents A mine closure would significantly increase employment legacy costs, including our expense and funding costs for pension and other post retirement benefit obligations. First, retirement eligible employees would be eligible for enhanced pension benefits under certain pension plans upon a mine closure. Second, the number of employees who are eligible for retirement under the pension plans would increase under special eligibility rules that apply upon a mine closure. Third, all employees eligible for retirement under the pension plans at the time of the mine closure also would be eligible for post retirement health and life insurance benefits, thereby accelerating our obligation to provide these benefits. Fourth, a closure of the Empire mine would likely terminate the status of the pension plan covering hourly employees at the Empire and Tilden mines as a multi employer pension plan, causing more stringent minimum funding requirements to apply to that plan. Fifth, a closure of the Empire or Tilden mine likely would trigger withdrawal liability to the pension plan covering hourly employees at the Empire and Tilden mines. Finally, a mine closure could trigger significant severance related obligations, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Applicable statutes and regulations require that mining property be reclaimed following a mine closure in accordance with specified standards and an approved reclamation plan. The plan addresses matters such as removal of facilities and equipment, regrading, prevention of erosion and other forms of water pollution, revegetation and post mining land use. We may be required to post a surety bond or other form of financial assurance equal to the cost of reclamation as set forth in the approved reclamation plan. The establishment of the final mine closure reclamation liability is based upon permit requirements and requires various estimates and assumptions, principally associated with reclamation costs and production levels. Although our management believes, based on currently available information, we are making adequate provisions for all expected reclamation and other costs associated with mine closures for which we will be responsible, our business, results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected if such accruals were later determined to be insufficient. We have significantly reduced our ore reserve estimates for the Empire mine and may close the Empire mine sooner than we had anticipated, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We significantly decreased our ore reserve estimates for the Empire mine from 116 million tons in 2002 to 63 million tons in 2003 and further to 29 million tons in 2004. The 2004 reductions were due to our inability to develop effective mine plans to produce cost effective combinations of production volume, ore quality and stripping requirements. We may reduce the annual production at the Empire mine as a result of these decreased ore reserve estimates. If the ore reserves at Empire are insufficient to sustain our operations there, we may be required to close the mine. We have taken significant asset impairment charges relating to the Empire mine. If we were to close the Empire mine, we would incur significant mine closure costs, employment legacy costs, severance related obligations, reclamation and other environmental costs and the costs of terminating long term obligations, including energy contracts and equipment leases. A closure of the Empire mine sooner than we anticipate could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We rely on the estimates of our recoverable reserves, and if those estimates are inaccurate, our financial condition may be adversely affected. We regularly evaluate our economic iron ore reserves based on expectations of revenues and costs and update them as required in accordance with Industry Guide 7 promulgated by the SEC. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of reserves of our mines, many of which have been in operation for several decades, including many factors beyond our control. Estimates of reserves and future net cash flows necessarily depend upon a number of variable factors and assumptions, such as historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas, the assumed effects of regulations by governmental agencies and assumptions concerning future prices for iron ore, assumptions regarding future industry conditions and operating costs, severance and excise taxes, development costs and costs of extraction and reclamation costs, all of which may in fact vary considerably from actual results. For these reasons, estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of reserves attributable to any particular group of properties, 37 Table of Contents classifications of such reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of future net cash flows expected therefrom prepared by different engineers or by the same engineers at different times may vary substantially. Estimated reserves could be affected by future industry conditions, geological conditions and ongoing mine planning. Actual production, revenues and expenditures with respect to our reserves will likely vary from estimates, and if such variances are material, our sales and profitability could be adversely affected. For example, based on revised economic mine planning studies that we completed in the fourth quarter of 2002, we reduced the estimates of the ore reserves at the Empire mine from 116 million tons to 63 million tons due to increasing mining and processing costs. Based on an update to those studies completed in the fourth quarter of 2003, we further significantly reduced the ore reserve estimates to 29 million tons. The reduction is due to the inability to develop effective mine plans to produce cost effective combinations of production volume, ore quality and stripping requirements with the 2003 reserve base. Studies are ongoing to identify the optimum production rate, and consequently mine life, for Empire. The evaluation of satellite mineral resources has also been initiated for potential additions to Empires reserve base. We also completed revised economic mine planning studies in the fourth quarter of 2002 for our Wabush mine, and we reduced our estimate of ore reserves at the Wabush mine from 244 million tons to 94 million tons due to increasing mining and processing costs. Based on an update to those studies completed in the fourth quarter of 2003, we further significantly reduced the Wabush mine ore reserve estimate to 61 million tons. The revised Wabush estimate is largely a reflection of increased operating costs, the impact of currency exchange rates and a reduction in maximum mining depth due to dewatering capabilities based on a recently completed hydrologic evaluation. The price adjustment provisions of our term supply agreements may prevent us from increasing our prices to match international ore contract prices or to pass increased costs of production on to our customers. Our term supply agreements contain a number of price adjustment provisions, or price escalators, including adjustments based on general industrial inflation rates, the price of steel and the international price of iron ore pellets, among other factors, that allow us to adjust the prices under those agreements generally on an annual basis. Our price adjustment provisions are weighted and some are subject to annual collars, which limit our ability to raise prices to match international levels and fully capitalize on strong demand for iron ore. Most of our term supply agreements do not allow us to increase our prices and to directly pass through higher production costs to our customers. An inability to increase prices or pass along increased costs could adversely affect our margins and profitability. Our sales, margins and profitability may be significantly affected by the bankruptcy or reorganization of our customers. The volatility, fluctuating prices, level of imports and low demand affecting the North American steel industry have severely impacted the ability of many North American steelmakers to generate profits. Many North American steelmakers, particularly large integrated steel producers, have been hampered with significant legacy costs, particularly underfunded pension obligations and significant retiree health obligations. Since 1997, approximately 49 North American steelmakers have filed for bankruptcy, reorganization, restructuring or similar protection including Acme Steel, Algoma, Bethlehem Steel, Geneva Steel Holdings Corp., Gulf States Steel, LTV Steel, National Steel Corporation, Slater Steel Inc. and Wheeling Pittsburgh Steel Corporation. Since May 2003, four of our North American steel industry customers, WCI, Weirton, Rouge, and Stelco petitioned for protection under bankruptcy or other similar laws. Financially distressed customers may be unable to perform under their agreements with us and, if they file for protection under bankruptcy or other similar laws, they may be able to reject their agreements with us pursuant to the operation of those laws. Such laws may enable a customer under bankruptcy protection to reject its existing term supply agreement with us, which may adversely affect our sales and profitability. In effect, such laws may allow the customer (or a party that might acquire the customers business through the bankruptcy process) to renegotiate the customers existing term supply agreement with us or to pursue arrangements with another pellet supplier without penalty. 38 Table of Contents We cannot assure that WCI, Weirton and Stelco will successfully emerge from bankruptcy or restructuring or that they will continue to meet their obligations under their agreements with us. We currently have trade receivable exposure of $4.9 million to WCI (which was reserved against in the third quarter of 2003). We currently have an agreement to sell iron ore pellets to Weirton, but we cannot assess whether Weirton will successfully emerge from bankruptcy. We invested $10.4 million for a 40.6 percent interest in a joint venture that acquired certain steam generating and power related assets from a subsidiary of Weirton in 2001 and leased such assets back to an affiliate of Weirton with a guaranty of such lease by Weirton in a purchase leaseback arrangement. Subsequent to its filing, Weirton has continued to meet its obligations under the lease agreement, which extends through 2012. We sold Rouge 1.4 million tons of pellets in fiscal 2002 and 3.0 million tons in 2003. At the time of Rouges bankruptcy petition, we had no trade receivable exposure to Rouge; however, we have a $10.0 million secured loan to Rouge that will mature in 2007. As of December 31, 2003, the loan had a balance of $11.5 million, including accrued interest. At this time, we cannot assess the impact of Rouges bankruptcy and subsequent sale on our loan with Rouge. The bankruptcy or reorganization of our largest customers could have a significant impact on our sales, margins and profitability. Our ability to collect payments from our customers depends on their creditworthiness. Our ability to receive payment for iron ore products sold and delivered to our customers depends on the creditworthiness of our customers. Generally, we deliver iron ore products to our customers in advance of payment for those products, and title and risk of loss with respect to those products does not pass to the customer until payment for the pellets is received. Accordingly, there is typically a period of time in which pellets, as to which we have reserved title, are within our customers control. As discussed above, several of our customers have petitioned for protection under bankruptcy or other similar laws, and most of our North American customers have below investment grade or no credit rating. Failure to receive payment from our customers for products that we have delivered could adversely affect our results of operations. Our change in strategy from a manager of iron ore mines on behalf of steel company owners to primarily a merchant of iron ore to steel company customers has increased our obligations with respect to those mines and has made our revenues, earnings and profit margins more dependent on sales of iron ore products and more susceptible to product demand and pricing fluctuations. Historically, we have acted as a manager of iron ore mines on behalf of steel company owners, and in that capacity have been generally entitled to management fees, royalties on reserves that we have leased or subleased to the Empire and Tilden mines, and income from our sales of iron ore products to our customers, including the other mine owners. Our revised business strategy is to increase our ownership in our co owned mines. In accordance with that revised strategy, in fiscal year 2002 we increased our ownership in (1) the Empire mine from 47 percent to 79 percent, (2) the Tilden mine from 40 percent to 85 percent, (3) the Hibbing mine from 15 percent to 23 percent, and (4) the Wabush mine from 23 percent to 27 percent. While we have gained greater control of the mines we operate, we have also increased our share of the operating costs, employment legacy costs and financial obligations associated with those mines. Our increased ownership of those mines has caused the management fees and royalties due to us from our partners in the mines to decline from $29.8 million in 2001 to $10.6 million in 2003. The decline in royalties and management fees has made our revenues, earnings and profit margins more volatile and more dependent on sales of our iron ore products to third party customers. We rely on our joint venture partners in our mines to meet their payment obligations, and the inability of a joint venture partner to do so could significantly affect our operating costs. We co own five of our six mines with various joint venture partners that are integrated steel producers or their subsidiaries, including Dofasco, ISG, Ispat Inland, Laiwu and Stelco. While we are the manager of each of the mines we co own, we rely on our joint venture partners to make their required capital contributions and to pay for their share of the iron ore pellets that we produce. Most of our venture partners are also our customers and are subject to the creditworthiness risks described above. If one or more of our venture partners fail to perform their obligations, the remaining venturers, including ourselves, may be required to assume 39 Table of Contents additional material obligations, including significant pension and post retirement health and life insurance benefit obligations. On January 29, 2004, Stelco applied and obtained bankruptcy court protection from creditors in Ontario Superior Court under the Companies Creditors Arrangement Act. Stelco is a 44.6 percent participant in the Wabush Mines joint venture, and U.S. subsidiaries of Stelco (which are not believed to have filed for bankruptcy protection) own 14.7 percent of Hibbing Taconite Company Joint Venture and 15 percent of Tilden Mining Company L.C. Stelco has met its cash call requirements at the mining ventures to date. The Company currently expects Stelco to continue its participation in the mining ventures. The premature closure of a mine due to the failure of a joint venture partner to perform its obligations could result in significant fixed mine closure costs, including severance, employment legacy costs and other employment costs, reclamation and other environmental costs, and the costs of terminating long term obligations, including energy contracts and equipment leases. Unanticipated geological conditions and natural disasters could increase the cost of operating our business. A portion of our production costs are fixed regardless of current operating levels. Our operating levels are subject to conditions beyond our control that can delay deliveries or increase the cost of mining at particular mines for varying lengths of time. These conditions include weather conditions (for example, extreme winter weather, floods and availability of process water due to drought) and natural disasters, pit wall failures, unanticipated geological conditions, including variations in the amount of rock and soil overlying the deposits of iron ore, variations in rock and other natural materials and variations in geologic conditions and ore processing changes. These conditions could impair our ability to fulfill our plan to operate all of our mines at full capacity, which could materially adversely affect our ability to meet the expected demand for our iron ore products. In the second and third quarters of 2003, pellet production at the Tilden mine was adversely affected by approximately .3 million tons as a result of unexpected variations in the composition of the iron ore in one area of the mining pit, which made the ore difficult to process, causing low throughput and recovery rates. Many of our mines are dependent on a single source energy supplier, and interruption in energy services may have a significant adverse effect on our sales, margins and profitability. Many of our mines are dependent on one source for electric power and for natural gas. For example, Minnesota Power is the sole supplier of electric power to our Hibbing and United Taconite mines; Wisconsin Energy Company is the sole supplier of electric power to our Tilden and Empire mines; and our Northshore mine is largely dependent on its wholly owned power facility for its electrical supply. A significant interruption in service from our energy suppliers due to terrorism or any other cause can result in substantial losses that may not be fully covered by our business interruption insurance. For example, in May 2003, we incurred approximately $11.1 million in fixed costs relating to lost production when our Empire and Tilden mines were idled for approximately five weeks due to loss of power stemming from the failure of a dam in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. One natural gas pipeline serves all of our Minnesota and Michigan mines, and a pipeline failure may idle those operations. Any substantial unmitigated interruption of our business due to these conditions could materially adversely affect our sales, margins and profitability. Equipment failures and other unexpected events at our facilities may lead to production curtailments or shutdowns. Interruptions in production capabilities will inevitably increase our production costs and reduce our profitability. We do not have meaningful excess capacity for current production needs, and we are not able to quickly increase production at one mine to offset an interruption in production at another mine. In addition to equipment failures, our facilities are also subject to the risk of loss due to unanticipated events such as fires, explosions or adverse weather conditions. The manufacturing processes that take place in our mining operations, as well as in our crushing, concentrating and pelletizing facilities, depend on critical pieces of equipment, such as drilling and blasting equipment, crushers, grinding mills, pebble mills, thickeners, separators, filters, mixers, furnaces, kilns and rolling equipment, as well as electrical equipment, such as transformers. This equipment may, on occasion, be out of service because of unanticipated failures. In 40 Table of Contents addition, many of our mines and processing facilities have been in operation for several decades, and the equipment is aged. For example, in November 2003, our Tilden facility experienced a crack in a kiln riding ring that required the shutdown of that kiln in its pelletizing plant, resulting in a production loss of approximately .3 million tons. In the future, we may experience additional material plant shutdowns or periods of reduced production because of equipment failures. Material plant shutdowns or reductions in operations could materially adversely affect our sales, margins and profitability. Further, remediation of any interruption in production capability may require us to make large capital expenditures that could have a negative effect on our profitability and cash flows. Our business interruption insurance would not cover all of the lost revenues associated with equipment failures. Further, longer term business disruptions could result in a loss of customers, which could adversely affect our future sales levels, and therefore our profitability. We are subject to extensive governmental regulation, which imposes, and will continue to impose, significant costs and liabilities on us, and future regulation could increase those costs and liabilities or limit our ability to produce iron ore products. We are subject to various federal, provincial, state and local laws and regulations on matters such as employee health and safety, air quality, water pollution, plant and wildlife protection, reclamation and restoration of mining properties, the discharge of materials into the environment, and the effects that mining has on groundwater quality and availability. Numerous governmental permits and approvals are required for our operations. We cannot assure you that we have been or will be at all times in complete compliance with such laws, regulations and permits. If we violate or fail to comply with these laws, regulations or permits, we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators. Prior to commencement of mining, we must submit to, and obtain approval from, the appropriate regulatory authority of plans showing where and how mining and reclamation operations are to occur. These plans must include information such as the location of mining areas, stockpiles, surface waters, haul roads, tailings basins and drainage from mining operations. All requirements imposed by any such authority may be costly and time consuming and may delay commencement or continuation of exploration or production operations. See Item 2. Properties. Environment. In addition, new legislation and or regulations and orders, including proposals related to the protection of the environment, to which we would be subject or that would further regulate and or tax our customers, namely the North American integrated steel producer customers, may also require us or our customers to reduce or otherwise change operations significantly or incur costs. Such new legislation, regulations or orders (if enacted) could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or profitability. In particular, we are subject to the new rules promulgated by the EPA that will require us to utilize MACT standards for our air emissions by 2006. The costs, including capital expenditures, that we will incur in order to meet the new MACT standards may be substantial. See Item 2. Properties. Environment. Further, we are subject to a variety of potential liability exposures arising at certain sites where we do not currently conduct operations. These sites include sites where we formerly conducted iron ore mining or processing or other operations, inactive sites that we currently own, predecessor sites, acquired sites, leased land sites and third party waste disposal sites. While we believe our liability at sites where claims have been asserted will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations, we may be named as a responsible party at other sites in the future, and we cannot assure you that the costs associated with these additional sites will not be material. See Item 2. Properties. Environment. We could also be held liable for any and all consequences arising out of human exposure to hazardous substances used, released or disposed of by us or other environmental damage, including damage to natural resources. In particular, we and certain of our subsidiaries are involved in various claims relating to the exposure of asbestos and silica to seamen who sailed on the Great Lakes vessels formerly owned and operated by certain of our subsidiaries. The full impact of these claims, as well as whether insurance coverage will be sufficient and whether other defendants named in these claims will be able to fund any costs arising out of these claims, continues to be unknown. Based on currently available information, however, we believe the 41 Table of Contents resolution of currently pending claims in the aggregate would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings. Our expenditures for post retirement benefit and pension obligations could be materially higher than we have predicted if our underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect, if there are mine closures or our joint venture partners fail to perform their obligations that relate to employee pension plans. We provide defined benefit pension plans and OPEB benefits to eligible union and non union employees, including our share of expense and funding obligations with respect to unconsolidated ventures. Our pension expense and our required contributions to our pension plans are directly affected by the value of plan assets, the projected rate of return on plan assets, the rate of return on plan assets and the actuarial assumptions we use to measure our defined benefit pension plan obligations, including the rate that future obligations are discounted to a present value (discount rate). We decreased the discount rate to 6.25 percent at December 31, 2003 from 6.90 percent at December 31, 2002, 7.50 percent at December 31, 2001 and 7.75 percent at December 31, 2000. For pension accounting purposes, we assumed a 9 percent rate of return on pension plan assets for all periods, although we decreased the return on asset assumption to 8.50 percent at December 31, 2003, which will increase our 2004 pension expense. Based on these assumptions, our actual funding levels and pension expense for 2001, 2002 and 2003 and our estimated minimum funding obligations and pension expense (based on our making only our minimum required contributions) for 2004, including our share of expense and funding obligations with respect to unconsolidated ventures are as follows: Pension (In Millions) Minimum Funding Year Expense Obligation 2001 $ 4.4 $ .4 2002 7.2 1.1 2003 32.0 6.4 2004 (estimate) 22.9 4.3 We cannot predict whether changing market or economic conditions, regulatory changes or other factors will increase our pension expenses or our funding obligations, diverting funds we would otherwise apply to other uses. Further, our funding projections for our pension plans assume that the pension plan covering hourly employees at the Empire and Tilden mines remains a multiemployer pension plan. If that plan loses its multiemployer plan status, we estimate that our minimum funding obligations for that plan would increase by approximately $25.6 million through 2004. We calculate our total accumulated post retirement benefit obligation (APBO) for our OPEB benefits under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106, Employers Accounting for Post retirement Benefits Other Than Pensions. The unfunded APBO obligation had a present value of $317.2 million at December 31, 2003. We have calculated the unfunded obligation based on a number of assumptions. Discount rate and return on plan asset assumptions parallel those utilized for pensions. We increased our assumed rate of annual increase in the cost of health care benefits to 10 percent in 2003 (from 7.50 percent in 2002) and assumed a 1 percent decrease per year for the following five years to 5 percent in 2008 and thereafter. We increased the assumed rate of annual increase in the cost of health care benefits again to 10 percent in 2004 and again assume a 1 percent decrease per year for the following five years, thereby delaying the decrease to 5 percent until 2009. We also contribute annually to trusts for certain mining ventures that are available to fund these liabilities, and we assume a 9 percent (decreasing to 8.50 percent for 2004 expense) rate of return on the assets held in these trusts. We expect to contribute approximately $3.7 million to these trusts in 2004, based on production at the Empire, Hibbing and Tilden mines in 2003. We also implemented a cap on the amounts that we would pay per retiree annually for existing and future U.S. salaried retirees. Based on these assumptions and plan provisions, our actual expenses and funding for these benefits for 2001, 2002 and 2003 42 Table of Contents and estimated expense and funding requirements for 2004, including our share of expense and funding obligations with respect to unconsolidated ventures are as follows: OPEB (In Millions) Funding Year Expense Obligation 2001 $ 15.8 $ 7.7 2002 21.5 16.8 2003 29.1 17.0 2004 (estimate) 27.4 21.3 If our assumptions do not materialize as expected, cash expenditures and costs that we incur could be materially higher. Moreover, we cannot assure that regulatory changes will not increase our obligations to provide these or additional benefits. These obligations also may increase substantially in the event of adverse medical cost trends or unexpected rates of early retirement, particularly for bargaining unit employees for whom there is no retiree health care cost cap. Early retirement rates likely would increase substantially in the event of a mine closure. Additionally, our pension and post retirement health and life insurance benefits obligations, expenses and funding costs would increase significantly if one or more of the mines in which we have invested is closed, or if one or more of our joint venturers at one or more mines is unable to perform its obligations. A mine closure would trigger accelerated pension and OPEB obligations, and the failure of a joint venturer to perform its obligations could shift additional pension and OPEB liabilities to us. Any of these events could significantly adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We are a related person to certain companies that were operators and are required under the Coal Industry Retiree Health Benefit Act of 1992 (the Coal Retiree Act) to make premium payments to the United Mine Workers Association Combined Benefit Fund (the Combined Fund), and our obligations to the Combined Fund could increase if other coal mine operators file for bankruptcy protection or become insolvent. We are a related party to certain companies that were coal mine operators. As a result we are subject to the Coal Retiree Act and are obligated to make premium payments to the Combined Fund for health and death benefits paid by the Combined Fund to retired coal miners. At December 31, 2003, the net present value of our estimated liability to the Combined Fund was $7.0 million. We are assessed premiums for unassigned or orphan retirees on a pro rata basis with other coal mine operators and related parties. If other coal mine operators and related parties file for bankruptcy protection or become insolvent, our pro rata portion of the liability to the Combined Fund could increase, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operation and financial condition, sales, margins and profitability. We cannot sell or transfer our ISG shares until June 2004, and we cannot predict the value of those shares if we sell them after that time. We currently own approximately 5.5 million shares of ISGs common stock (5.0 million owned directly and .5 million through pension fund investments), which currently represents approximately 5.7 percent of the outstanding ISG shares. As of January 30, 2004, the trading price for the ISG common stock was $35.10 per share. In connection with ISGs recent initial public offering, we and other significant ISG stockholders agreed not to sell or otherwise transfer our ISG shares before June 9, 2004. We cannot predict the trading price of the ISG shares following the expiration of the lock up period. Further, our ability to sell our ISG shares may continue to be restricted following the expiration of the lock up period by applicable federal securities laws. We cannot assure you that we will sell our ISG shares or that any sale of our ISG shares after the expiration of 43 Table of Contents the lock up period will result in a gain to us. If we do sell our ISG shares, we may sell only limited quantities of the shares. Our profitability could be negatively affected if we fail to maintain satisfactory labor relations. The USWA represents all hourly employees at our Empire, Hibbing, Tilden and United Taconite mines, as well as the Wabush mine in Canada. The collective bargaining agreements for the employees at the Empire, Hibbing, Tilden and United Taconite mines will expire on August 1, 2004, and the collective bargaining agreements for the employees at the Wabush mine will expire on March 1, 2004. Hourly employees at the railroads we own that transport products among our facilities are represented by multiple unions with labor agreements that expire at various dates. If the collective bargaining agreements relating to the employees at our mines are not successfully renegotiated in a timely manner, we could face work stoppages or labor strikes. The workforce at our Northshore mine is currently not represented by a union. If our Northshore operations were to become unionized, we would incur an increased risk of work stoppages, reduced productivity and higher labor costs. Our cost reduction efforts may not be successful. In an effort to improve our marginal sales profitability, we implemented a cost reduction strategy in 2003 designed to decrease annual costs by the end of 2004 by $35.0 million. We cannot assure you that our cost savings program will be successful. If we fail to successfully complete our cost reduction programs, our margins and profitability would be adversely affected. Our operating expenses could increase significantly if the price of electrical power, fuel or other energy sources increases. Operating expenses at our mining locations are sensitive to changes in electricity prices and fuel prices, including diesel fuel and natural gas prices. Prices for electricity, natural gas and fuel oils can fluctuate widely with availability and demand levels from other users. During periods of peak usage, supplies of energy may be curtailed and we may not be able to purchase them at historical market rates. While we have some long term contracts with electrical suppliers, we are exposed to fluctuations in energy costs that can affect our production costs. Although we enter into forward fixed price supply contracts for natural gas for use in our operations, those contracts are of limited duration and do not cover all of our fuel needs, and price increases in fuel costs could cause our profitability to decrease significantly.
