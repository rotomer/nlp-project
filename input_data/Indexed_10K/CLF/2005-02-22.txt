Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Two for One Stock Split On November 9, 2004, the Board of Directors of Cleveland Cliffs Inc approved a two for one stock split of its Common Shares. The record date for the stock split was December 15, 2004 with a distribution date of December 31, 2004. Accordingly, all Common Shares, per share amounts, stock compensation plans and preferred stock conversion rates have been adjusted retroactively to reflect the stock split. Additionally, all diluted per share amounts reflect the as if converted effect of the Companys convertible preferred stock as required by Emerging Issues Task Force Consensus 04 8. Overview Cleveland Cliffs Inc (including its consolidated subsidiaries, the Company or Cliffs) is the largest producer of iron ore pellets in North America and sells the majority of its pellets to integrated steel companies in the United States and Canada. The Company operates six iron ore mines located in Michigan, Minnesota, and Eastern Canada that currently have a rated capacity of 37.7 million tons of iron ore pellet production annually. The other iron ore mines in the U.S. and Canada have an aggregate rated capacity of 22.9 million tons and 21.2 million tons, respectively. Based on its percentage ownership in the mines it operates, Cliffs share of the rated pellet production capacity is currently 23.1 million tons per annum, representing approximately 28 percent of total North American pellet capacity. Prior to 2002, Cliffs principally held a minority interest in the mines it managed, with the majority interest in each mine held by various North American steel companies. Cliffs earnings were principally comprised of royalties and management fees paid by the partnerships, along with sales of its equity share of the mine pellet production. Faced with marked deterioration in the financial condition of many of its partners and customers, the Company embarked on a strategy to reposition itself from a manager of iron ore mines on behalf of steel company partners to primarily a merchant of iron ore through increasing its ownership interests in its mines. 21 Table of Contents The Companys increased mine ownerships combined with the explosive growth of steel and iron ore demand created by an expanding Chinese economy and consolidation of the North American steel industry has resulted in a most remarkable year in 2004. The Companys strategic redirection and acceptance of additional risks of increased mine ownerships followed by significant increases in iron ore demand and pricing culminated in record profits in 2004, solid financial condition, and a strong base for future growth. The Companys successful navigation through numerous customer and partner bankruptcies and corresponding consolidation of the North American steel industry has resulted in the Company emerging with new long term supply agreements, at more favorable pricing, with steel company partners and customers that are financially stronger than their predecessors. One premier example is International Steel Group, Inc. (ISG), which acquired and consolidated several bankrupt steel companies. In 2002, the Company invested $13.0 million in ISG to support its acquisition of idled LTV Corporation (LTV) steelmaking assets, receiving a seven percent stake in return. The Company also entered into a 15 year term supply agreement to supply all of ISGs pellet requirements for its Cleveland and Indiana Harbor plants. Later in 2002, the Company invested another $4.4 million to support ISGs acquisition of the steelmaking assets of Acme Metals Incorporated (Acme) and invested another $10.7 million of pension trust assets to support ISGs acquisition of Bethlehem Steel Corporations (Bethlehem Steel) assets in 2003. In conjunction with the acquisition of Bethlehem Steel, ISG acquired Bethlehems 62.3 percent equity interest in the Company managed Hibbing mine. Through its investments in ISG, the Company received 5.9 million shares (5.1 million shares directly held and .8 million shares held in its pension trust). In 2004, the Company realized a $152.7 million pre tax ($99.3 million after tax) gain on the sale of its 5.1 million shares of directly held ISG common stock. The Company continues to own .1 million shares of ISG common stock in its pension trusts. Also in 2004, ISG acquired the bankrupt assets of Weirton Steel Corporation (Weirton) and Georgetown Steel Corporation. In conjunction with its acquisition of Weirton, ISG assumed the Companys term supply agreement with Weirton with some modifications. ISG, currently the Companys largest customer, recently agreed to merge with Mittal Steel, the parent company of Ispat Inland Inc. (Ispat Inland), another significant customer and 21 percent partner in the Companys Empire mine. The merger is expected to close in the first quarter of 2005, creating the largest steel company in the world. Also in 2004, the Company dramatically improved its liquidity, initially through its January 2004 offering of $172.5 million of redeemable cumulative convertible perpetual preferred stock. The proceeds from the issuance were utilized to repay the Companys $25 million balance of its unsecured notes and to fund $76.1 million into its underfunded salaried and hourly pension plans and retiree healthcare accounts (VEBAs). Additionally, the proceeds from the sale of ISG stock and cash flow from operations provided the Company with the liquidity for required capital expenditures to maintain and expand its production capacity and to investigate opportunities to further its strategic growth objectives. In January 2005, the Company initiated an all cash offer to purchase the outstanding shares of Portman Limited, a Western Australia based iron ore mining and exploration company. If successful, the acquisition cost will be approximately U.S. $500 million. See Offer to Purchase Portman Limited. The Company also continues to investigate opportunities in North America, including Eastern Canadian and U.S. iron ore mines. The Companys share of production in 2004 was a record 21.7 million tons. Mine operating costs on a per ton basis in 2004 increased by about 3.5 percent versus 2003 primarily due to energy, supply and royalty escalation (much of which was recovered in or was due to our sales contract escalators) and cost related to the U.S. labor negotiations and the fixed cost effect of the 14 week labor stoppage at Wabush Mines in Canada where we have a 26.83 percent ownership. From a safety standpoint, 2004 was the safest year on record in the Companys 157 year history as measured by the Mine Safety and Health Administration total reportable incident frequency. The Companys operating objectives are to maximize production, efficiency and productivity at its existing North American mines. All of the mines and processing facilities have been in existence for several decades and are energy and labor intensive operations. Energy comprises approximately 25 percent of our mine production costs. We continue to strive for employment productivity improvements to offset rising energy and employee medical and legacy costs. In that regard, employees at the Empire and Tilden mines in Michigan and the Hibbing Taconite and United Taconite mines in Minnesota, represented by the United 22 Table of Contents Steelworkers of America (USWA), ratified new four year labor agreements that are comparable to other USWA contracts in the industry. The new agreements provide for wage increases and additional funding into employees pension plans and VEBAs in exchange for employees and future retirees sharing in healthcare insurance costs and certain other provisions that will continue to improve productivity. (See Labor Contracts.) Key Operating and Financial Indicators Following is a summary of the Companys key operating and financial indicators for the years 2004, 2003 and 2002: 2004 2003 2002 Pellet Sales (Million Tons) 22.6 19.2 14.7 Revenues from Iron Ore Sales and Services (Millions)* $ 998.6 $ 686.8 $ 510.8 Pellet Production (Million Tons) Total 34.4 30.3 27.9 Companys Share 21.7 18.1 14.7 Sales Margin (Loss) Amount (Millions) $ 149.9 $ (9.9 ) $ 3.7 Per Ton of Sales $ 6.63 $ (.53 ) $ .25 Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations Amount (Millions) $ 320.5 $ (34.9 ) $ (66.4 ) Per Share (Diluted) $ 11.69 $ (1.70 ) $ (3.29 ) Net Income (Loss) Amount (Millions) $ 323.6 $ (32.7 ) $ (188.3 ) Per Share (Diluted) $ 11.80 $ (1.60 ) $ (9.31 ) * The Company also received revenues of $208.1 million, $138.3 million and $75.6 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, related to freight and minority interest. Iron ore pellet sales in 2004 were a record 22.6 million tons, a 3.4 million ton or 18 percent, increase from the previous record 19.2 million tons sold in 2003. The sales increase primarily reflects the effect of new and revised agreements initiated in 2002 and 2003 consistent with the Companys increased mine ownerships. Iron ore pellet production for Cliffs account was 21.7 million tons in 2004 versus 18.1 million tons in 2003. The 3.6 million ton, or 20 percent, increase was largely due to the full year production of United Taconite, which was acquired in December 2003, and higher production at all mines except Wabush. The Companys increase in 2004 sales margin from 2003 was principally due to an increase in sales prices and volume and was partially offset by higher production costs. The increase in sales prices reflects the effect on term supply agreement escalators of higher steel prices and an approximate 20 percent increase in international pellet prices. Production costs were adversely affected by higher energy and supply pricing, costs associated with U.S. labor negotiations and Wabush work stoppage, and a $3.4 million unfavorable exchange rate effect reflecting the impact of a weaker U.S. dollar on the Companys share of Wabush costs. On a year over year basis, these factors were partly offset by the fixed cost impact of the five week production curtailment in 2003 at the Empire and Tilden mines relating to loss of electric power due to flooding in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. The Companys business is affected by a number of factors, which are described in detail below under Risks Relating to the Company. As the Company has increased its role as a merchant of iron ore to steel company customers, it has become more dependent on the revenues from its term supply agreements. Because its agreements are largely requirements contracts, those revenues are heavily dependent on customer consumption of iron ore. Customer requirements may be affected by increased use of iron ore substitutes, 23 Table of Contents including imported semi finished steel, customer rationalization or financial failure, and decreased North American steel production resulting from increased imports or lower steel consumption. Further, the Companys sales are concentrated with relatively few customers. Unmitigated loss of sales would have a significantly greater impact on operating results and cash flow than revenue, due to the high level of fixed costs in the iron ore mining business and the high cost to idle or close mines. In the event of a venture participants failure to perform, remaining solvent venturers, including the Company, may be required to assume additional fixed costs and record additional material obligations. The premature closure of a mine due to the loss of a significant customer or the failure of a joint venture participant would accelerate substantial employment and mine shutdown costs. Results of Operations Net income in 2004 was $323.6 million, including a $3.1 million after tax gain from a discontinued operation, compared with a net loss in 2003 of $32.7 million. Included in the 2003 net loss was an extraordinary gain of $2.2 million relating to the United Taconite acquisition of the Eveleth mine assets in Minnesota in December 2003. Income in 2004 was $11.80 per diluted share compared with a net loss of $1.60 per diluted share in 2003. Following is a summary of results: (In Millions) 2004 2003 2002 Income (loss) from continuing operations* $ 320.5 $ (34.9 ) $ (66.4 ) Income (loss) from discontinued operation** 3.1 (108.5 ) Income (loss) before extraordinary gain and cumulative effect of accounting changes** 323.6 (34.9 ) (174.9 ) Extraordinary gain** 2.2 Cumulative effect of accounting changes*** (13.4 ) Net income (loss) amount $ 323.6 $ (32.7 ) $ (188.3 ) per share basic**** $ 14.94 $ (1.60 ) $ (9.31 ) per share diluted $ 11.80 $ (1.60 ) $ (9.31 ) Average number of shares (in thousands) basic 21,308 20,512 20,234 diluted***** 27,421 20,512 20,234 * Includes charges for impairments of mining assets of $5.8 million in 2004, $2.6 million in 2003 and $52.7 million in 2002, and an after tax gain on sale of ISG common stock, $99.3 million in 2004. ** Net of tax and minority interest. *** Net of tax. **** Adjusted for preferred dividend effect of $5.3 million. ***** Includes 5.566 million shares for the weighted average of as if converted convertible preferred shares. 2004 Versus 2003 Net income for the year 2004 was $323.6 million, or $11.80 per diluted share, compared with a net loss of $32.7 million, or $1.60 per diluted share, for the year 2003. Excluding the after tax gain from a discontinued operation in 2004 of $3.1 million and the after tax extraordinary gain in 2003 of $2.2 million relating to the United Taconite acquisition of the Eveleth mine assets in December 2003 (See Extraordinary Gain). Income from continuing operations in 2004 was $320.5 million, versus a loss of $34.9 million in 2003. 24 Table of Contents The $355.4 million increase in income from continuing operations reflected improved pre tax results of $320.8 million and lower income taxes of $34.6 million. The lower taxes in 2004 reflected a $113.8 million reversal of deferred tax valuation allowance partly offset by the current years tax provision. Included in the pre tax increase of $320.8 million was $152.7 million relating to a gain on sale of directly held ISG common stock and higher sales margins of $159.8 million. Following is a summary of the sales margin: (In Millions) Increase (Decrease) 2004 2003 Amount Percent Iron ore pellet sales (tons) 22.6 19.2 3.4 18 % Revenues from iron ore sales and services* $ 998.6 $ 686.8 $ 311.8 45 % Cost of goods sold and operating expenses* Excluding production curtailments 843.5 685.6 157.9 23 Costs of production curtailments 5.2 11.1 (5.9 ) (53 ) Total Costs 848.7 696.7 152.0 22 Sales margin (loss) $ 149.9 $ (9.9 ) $ 159.8 N/M * The Company also received revenues and recognized expenses of $208.1 million and $138.3 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively, for freight charges paid on behalf of customers and cost reimbursement from minority interest partners for their share of mine costs. Revenues from Iron Ore Sales and Services Revenues from iron ore sales and services were $998.6 million in 2004, an increase of $311.8 million, or 45 percent, from revenues of $686.8 million in 2003. The increase was mainly due to higher sales prices and the 3.4 million ton, or 18 percent, increase in pellet sales volume in 2004. The increase in pellet sales in 2004 was due to higher demand by the integrated steel industry and increased production. The 22.6 million tons sold in 2004 was a record, surpassing the previous record of 19.2 million tons sold in 2003. The increase in sales price realization resulted from term supply agreement escalators, primarily higher steel prices and an approximate 20 percent increase in international pellet prices. Cost of Goods Sold and Operating Expenses Cost of goods sold and operating expenses totaled $848.7 million in 2004, an increase of $152.0 million, or 22 percent, from $696.7 million in 2003, principally due to higher sales and production volume of $122.8 million, increased energy and supply pricing of $19.9 million, the fixed cost effect of a 14 week labor stoppage at Wabush in third quarter 2004 of $5.2 million, a $3.4 million exchange rate effect due to the impact of a weaker U.S. dollar on the Companys share of Wabush production costs, and $3.0 million related to 2004 U.S. labor negotiations. Operating costs in 2003 included an $11.1 million fixed cost impact caused by a five week production curtailment at the Empire and Tilden mines relating to the loss of electric power due to flooding in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Sales Margin Sales margin in 2004 was $149.9 million versus a loss of $9.9 million in 2003. The sales margin improvement of $159.8 million in 2004 was principally due to an increase in sales prices and volume, and was partially offset by higher production costs. Royalties and Management Fees Royalties and management fees from partners were $11.3 million in 2004, an increase of $.7 million from 2003. The increase was principally attributed to management fees from United Taconite production. 25 Table of Contents Impairment of Mining Assets In 2004 and 2003, the Company recorded additional Empire impairment charges of $5.8 million and $2.6 million, respectively, for current years fixed asset additions. Empires long lived assets were impaired in 2002. Approximately $2.2 million of the 2004 Empire fixed asset additions were related to an increase in the asset retirement obligation reflecting a one year decrease in the estimated mine life due to a change in annual production levels. Administrative, Selling and General Expenses Administrative, selling and general expenses in 2004 were $33.1 million, an increase of $8.0 million from 2003. The increase primarily reflects higher stock based and incentive compensation of $8.5 million. Restructuring Charge In third quarter 2003, the Company initiated a salaried reduction program as part of its cost reduction initiatives. The action resulted in a reduction of 136 staff employees at its corporate, central services and various mining operations, which represented an approximate 20 percent decrease in salaried workforce at the Companys U.S. operations (prior to the acquisition of United Taconite). Accordingly, the Company recorded a restructuring charge of $8.7 million in 2003, which included non cash pension and OPEB obligations of $6.2 million and one time severance benefits of $2.5 million. Less than $1.6 million required cash funding in 2003 leaving a remaining severance liability of approximately $.9 million at December 31, 2003. In 2004, the Company expended $.7 million and recorded a credit of $.2 million in satisfaction of the obligation. Provision for Customer Bankruptcy Exposures The Company recorded $1.6 million in the first quarter 2004 for customer bankruptcy exposures compared with $7.5 million in 2003 ($2.6 million and $4.9 million in the second and third quarter, respectively) relating to the Weirton and WCI Steel Inc. (WCI) bankruptcies. (See Customers for further discussion.) Miscellaneous Expense (Income) Miscellaneous expense was $2.9 million in 2004, a decrease of $2.2 million from 2003 expenses of $5.1 million. The decrease primarily reflected lower coal retiree expense of $1.6 million, decreased business development costs of $1.0 million, and debt restructuring fees in 2003 of $.8 million partially offset by lower rental income of $.9 million. Other Interest expense was $.8 million in 2004, a decrease of $3.8 million from 2003 interest expense of $4.6 million. The decrease principally reflected the repayment of the Companys senior unsecured notes in January 2004. Other income of $4.2 million in 2004 was $2.9 million less than in 2003. The decrease primarily related to non strategic Michigan land sales in 2003. Income Taxes Through 2003, the Company maintained a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax asset in recognition of uncertainty regarding full utilization. In the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company determined, based on the existence of sufficient evidence, that it no longer required a valuation allowance other than $8.9 million, which may not be realized, related to net operating loss carryforwards of $25.4 million that will begin to expire in 2021, which are attributable to pre consolidation separate return years of one of its subsidiaries. As a result, a $113.8 million adjustment to reduce the valuation allowance was credited to income. Excluding the $113.8 million valuation reversal, income tax expense in 2004 of $78.9 million was $79.2 higher than 2003 principally reflecting higher pre tax income. 26 Table of Contents Extraordinary Gain Effective December 1, 2003, United Taconite, a newly formed company owned 70 percent by a subsidiary of the Company and 30 percent by a subsidiary of Laiwu Steel Group Limited (Laiwu) of China, purchased the assets of Eveleth Mines LLC in Minnesota. The purchase price was $3.0 million plus the assumption of certain liabilities, primarily mine closure related environmental obligations. As a result of this transaction, the assets acquired exceeded the cost of the acquisition, resulting in an extraordinary gain of $2.2 million, net of $.5 million tax and $1.2 million minority interest. 2003 Versus 2002 The net loss for the year 2003 was $32.7 million, or $1.60 per share, including the extraordinary gain of $2.2 million related to the United Taconite acquisition of the Eveleth mine assets in Minnesota in December 2003. The net loss in 2002 of $188.3 million, or $9.31 per share included a loss of $108.5 million from a discontinued operation, and a $13.4 million cumulative effect charge related to a change in the Companys accounting method for recognizing estimated future mine closure obligations. The loss from continuing operations was $34.9 million in 2003 versus a loss of $66.4 million in 2002. The $31.5 million lower loss reflected improved pre tax results of $22.1 million and lower income tax expense of $9.4 million principally due to establishing a deferred tax valuation allowance in 2002. The improvement in pre tax results was primarily due to the $52.7 million charge for the impairment of mining assets in 2002; the impairment charge was $2.6 million in 2003. Partially offsetting the lower impairment charge was a $13.6 million decrease in sales margin, summarized as follows: (In Millions) Increase (Decrease) 2003 2002 Amount Percent Iron ore pellet sales (tons) 19.2 14.7 4.5 31% Revenues from iron ore sales and services* $ 686.8 $ 510.8 $ 176.0 34% Cost of goods sold and operating expenses* Excluding production curtailment 685.6 486.5 199.1 41 Costs of production curtailments 11.1 20.6 (9.5 ) (46) Total costs 696.7 507.1 189.6 37% Sales margin (loss) $ (9.9 ) $ 3.7 $ (13.6 ) N/M * The Company also received revenues and recognized expenses of $138.3 million and $75.6 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively, for freight charges paid on behalf of customers and cost reimbursement from minority interest partners for their share of mine costs. Revenues from Iron Ore Sales and Services Revenues from iron ore sales and services were $686.8 million in 2003, an increase of $176.0 million, or 34 percent, from revenues of $510.8 million in 2002. The 4.5 million ton, or 31 percent, increase in pellet sales volume in 2003 was due to the combined effect of increased customer demand, new term supply agreements (including the full year effect of new agreements in 2002) and increased ownership interest in existing joint venture mines. The 19.2 million tons sold in 2003 was a record, surpassing the previous record of 14.7 million tons sold in 2002. The increase in revenue also reflected an increase in sales price realization, which resulted from favorable term supply agreement price provisions and the mix of agreements. Cost of Goods Sold and Operating Expenses Cost of goods sold and operating expenses totaled $696.7 million in 2003, an increase of $189.6 million, or 37 percent, from $507.1 million in 2002. Excluding fixed costs related to production curtailments, 2003 costs and expenses were $199.1 million, or 41 percent, higher than 2002, principally due to increased production and 27 Table of Contents sales volume and higher production costs. The production cost increase reflected higher energy rates, increased pension and medical costs, throughput difficulties at the Michigan mines, an equipment outage at the Tilden operations in Michigan in December 2003, and the impact of the decreased U.S. exchange rate with Canada. Increased energy rates resulted in an approximate $17 million aggregate increase in costs in 2003 versus 2002. Similarly, increases in pension expense (excluding restructuring charges) per ton of production accounted for a cost increase in 2003 versus 2002 of more than $8 million, and higher medical costs (including OPEB increases) per ton of production contributed almost $5 million to the cost increase. The pension and OPEB increases are net of approximately $7 million of 2003 expense decreases related to the salaried plan modifications for certain U.S. salaried employees and retirees, which became effective July 1, 2003. On May 15, 2003, the failure of a dam in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan resulted in flood conditions, which caused production curtailments at the Empire and Tilden mines for approximately five weeks. While the flooding did not directly damage the mines, the mines were idled when Wisconsin Energy Corporation, which supplies electricity to the mines, was forced to shutdown its power plant in Marquette, Michigan. The mines returned to full production by the end of June; however, approximately 1.0 million tons of production was lost (Companys share .8 million tons). The Companys share of fixed costs related to the lost production was $11.1 million. The Company is pursuing a business interruption claim under its property insurance program. Production curtailments in 2002, due to market conditions, had a $20.6 million fixed cost effect. On November 26, 2003, the Tilden mine experienced a crack in a kiln riding ring that required the shutdown of its Unit #2 furnace in the pelletizing plant. As a result of the failure, Tildens production in 2003 decreased by ..3 million tons resulting in a 2003 loss of approximately $6 million, including the cost of the repair and the cost of accelerating planned 2004 maintenance into December 2003 to coincide with the riding ring repair. Year 2004 production was not significantly affected by the failure. Sales Margin (Loss) The decrease in 2003 sales margin of $13.6 million reflected an increase in cost of goods sold and operating expenses (net of freight and minority interest) of approximately $73 million offset by the effect of higher production and sales volume of approximately $40 million and higher average sales revenue per ton of approximately $20 million. Our sales volume increased by 4.5 million tons or 31 percent. Production increased by 3.4 million tons or 23 percent. Royalties and Management Fees Royalties and management fees from partners were $10.6 million in 2003, a decrease of $1.6 million from 2002. The decrease was principally due to the whole year effect of the Companys increased ownership in mines in 2002, partially offset by increased production. Impairment of Mining Assets As a result of increasing production costs at Empire mine, revised economic mine planning studies were completed in the fourth quarter of 2002 and updated in the fourth quarter of 2003. Based on the outcome of these studies, the ore reserve estimates at Empire were reduced from 116 million tons at December 31, 2001 to 63 million tons at December 31, 2002 and 29 million tons at December 31, 2003. The Company concluded that the assets of Empire were impaired as of December 31, 2002, based on an undiscounted probability weighted cash flow analysis. The Company recorded an impairment charge of $52.7 million to write off the carrying value of the long lived assets of Empire. In 2003, the Company recorded an additional impairment charge of $2.6 million for current year fixed asset additions. Administrative, Selling and General Expenses Administrative, selling and general expenses in 2003 were $25.1 million, an increase of $1.3 million from 2002. The increase primarily reflects higher professional fees related to financing and business development activities and higher stock based compensation partially offset by lower employment costs and incentive 28 Table of Contents compensation. The increase in stock based compensation of $4.3 million principally reflected the increase in the Companys common share price in 2003. Restructuring Charge In the third quarter of 2003, the Company initiated a salaried reduction program as part of its cost reduction initiatives. The action resulted in a reduction of 136 staff employees at its corporate, central services and various mining operations, which represented an approximate 20 percent decrease in salaried workforce at the Companys U.S. operations (prior to the acquisition of United Taconite). Accordingly, the Company recorded a restructuring charge of $8.7 million in 2003. The charge is principally related to severance, pension and healthcare benefits with less than $1.6 million requiring cash funding in 2003. Provision for Customer Bankruptcy Exposures As noted in the Risks Relating to the Company, three of the Companys significant customers petitioned for protection under chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in 2003. As a result, the Company recorded reserves totaling $7.5 million in the second and third quarters of 2003 related to its bankruptcy exposures. Miscellaneous Expense (Income) Miscellaneous expense was $5.1 million in 2003, an increase of $1.2 million from 2002. The increase primarily reflected higher coal retiree expense of $2.0 million, an increase in litigation reserves of $.5 million and higher state and local taxes of $.4 million partially offset by lower debt restructuring fees of $1.9 million. Other Interest income of $10.6 million in 2003 was $5.8 million above 2002 interest income of $4.8 million. The increase primarily reflected interest on the long term receivables from Ispat Inland and Rouge Industries Inc. (Rouge). Interest expense was $4.6 million in 2003, a decrease of $2.0 million from 2002 interest expense of $6.6 million. The decrease principally reflected lower average borrowing due to the repayment and cancellation of the Companys $100 million revolving credit facility in October 2002 and repayment of a portion of the senior unsecured notes. The Company made senior unsecured note repayments of $15 million in December 2002, $5 million in June 2003, $25 million in December 2003 and the $25 million balance early in 2004. Other income of $7.1 million in 2003 was $.9 million higher than 2002. The increase primarily reflected higher sales of non strategic assets in 2003 of $.8 million. Income Taxes In the third quarter of 2002, the Company recorded a valuation allowance to fully reserve its net deferred tax assets in recognition of uncertainty regarding their realization. In 2003, the Company increased its deferred tax valuation allowance by $2.1 million to $122.7 million to offset increases in the deferred tax assets. The Company recorded an income tax credit of $.3 million, which was attributable to qualifying for a special refund of taxes paid in prior years, of $.9 million, partially offset by foreign, state and local taxes. The $9.1 million net tax expense in 2002 reflected the recognition of the valuation allowance net of a $4.4 million favorable adjustment of prior years tax liabilities. Discontinued Operation In the fourth quarter of 2002, Cliffs exited the ferrous metallics business and abandoned its 82 percent investment in Cliffs and Associates Limited (CAL), an HBI facility located in Trinidad and Tobago. For the year 2002, Cliffs reported a loss from discontinued operation of $108.5 million, consisting of $97.4 million 29 Table of Contents ($95.7 million in the third quarter) of impairment charges and $11.1 million of idle expense. No expense was recorded in 2003. On July 23, 2004, Cliffs and Outokumpu Technology GmbH (the 18 percent co owner of CAL) sold the assets of CALs HBI facility to ISG. Terms of the sale include a purchase price of $8.0 million plus assumption of liabilities. The Company recorded after tax income of approximately $3.1 million related to this contract in 2004. The gain is classified under Discontinued Operation in the Statement of Consolidated Operations. CAL may receive up to $10 million in future payments contingent on HBI production and shipments. Cumulative Effect of Accounting Changes Effective January 1, 2002, the Company implemented Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 143, Asset Retirement Obligations. The statement requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period incurred. As a result of the change in accounting method, the Company recorded a cumulative effect non cash charge of $13.4 million, recognized on January 1, 2002, to provide for contractual and legal obligations associated with the eventual closure of its mining operations. Cash Flow and Liquidity At December 31, 2004, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $216.9 million. Following is a summary of 2004 cash flow activity: (In Millions) Proceeds from sale of ISG common stock $ 170.1 Proceeds from issuance of preferred stock net 165.9 Net cash from operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities 75.3 Higher payables and accrued expenses 20.4 Proceeds from stock options exercised 17.9 Proceeds from repayment of long term note receivable 10.0 Contributions by minority interest 9.7 Investment in short term marketable securities (182.7 ) Capital expenditures (60.7 ) Increased trade receivables (44.6 ) Repayment of long term debt (25.0 ) Repurchases of common stock (6.5 ) Dividends common and preferred stock (6.1 ) Other (1.3 ) Increase in cash and cash equivalents from continuing operations 142.4 Cash from discontinued operation 6.7 Increase in cash and cash equivalents $ 149.1 30 Table of Contents Following is a summary of key liquidity measures: At December 31 (In Millions) 2004 2003 2002 Cash and cash equivalents $ 216.9 $ 67.8 $ 61.8 Marketable securities (short term) $ 182.7 $ $ Debt $ $ (25.0 ) $ (55.0 ) Working capital $ 476.7 $ 97.2 $ 106.8 Included in net cash from operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities is $76.1 million of contributions to pension plans and post retirement benefits trusts and $57.1 million of income tax payments. The $182.7 million increase in marketable securities reflects the Companys investment of surplus cash in highly liquid short term securities with put options. The increase in trade receivables of $44.6 million included supplemental term sales contract revenue based on annual steel pricing, on which payments are due in the first half of 2005. At December 31, 2004, there were 3.3 million tons of pellets in inventory, .7 million tons less than December 31, 2003, at a cost of $108.2 million, or a decrease of $21.5 million from December 31, 2003. The Company repaid the remaining principal balance on its senior unsecured notes of $25 million in January 2004. On April 30, 2004, the Company entered into a $30 million unsecured revolving credit agreement, which expires on April 29, 2005. There have been no borrowings under the facility. The Company realized $17.9 million from the exercise of stock options in 2004 and issued a total of 719,780 shares from treasury stock. The Company also repurchased 170,000 shares at a cost of $6.5 million relating to its two million share stock repurchase program; the repurchase program was suspended in January 2005. The Company anticipates that its share of capital expenditures related to the iron ore business, which was $60.7 million in 2004, will increase to approximately $135 million in 2005. The Company expects to fund its capital expenditures from available cash and current operations. The anticipated increase in capital expenditures is primarily due to capacity expansion projects at its United Taconite and Northshore mines in Minnesota. The United Taconite expansion project was brought on line with the restart of its idle pellet furnace in the fourth quarter of 2004 at a total cost of approximately $35 million, with 2004 expenditure of $13.3 million. The expansion will add approximately 1.0 million tons (Company share .7 million tons) to United Taconites annual production capacity. The Company also plans to re start an idled furnace at its wholly owned Northshore mine in the first quarter of 2005 at an estimated cost of approximately $30 million. The expansion will increase Northshores annual production capacity by approximately .8 million tons. A further expansion at United Taconite is being evaluated. In the third and fourth quarters of 2004, the Company sold 5.1 million shares of its directly held ISG common stock in market transactions totaling $170.1 million. The sales resulted in a gain of $152.7 million pre tax ($99.3 million after tax). The Company continues to own ..1 million shares of ISG stock through pension fund investments. Issuance of Preferred Stock In January 2004, the Company completed an offering of $172.5 million of redeemable cumulative convertible perpetual preferred stock, without par value, issued at $1,000 per share. The preferred stock pays quarterly cash dividends at a rate of 3.25 percent per annum, has a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share and is convertible into the Companys common shares at an adjusted rate of 32.3354 common shares per share of preferred stock, which is equivalent to an adjusted conversion price of $30.93 per share at December 31, 2004, subject to further adjustment in certain circumstances. Each share of preferred stock may be converted by the holder: (1) if during any fiscal quarter ending after March 31, 2004 the closing sale price of the 31 Table of Contents Companys common stock for at least 20 trading days in a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the preceding quarter exceeds 110 percent of the applicable conversion price on such trading day ($34.02 at December 31, 2004; this threshold was met as of December 31, 2004); (2) if during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per share of preferred stock for each day of that period was less than 98 percent of the product of the closing sale price of the Companys common stock and the applicable conversion rate on each such day; (3) upon the occurrence of certain corporate transactions; or (4) if the preferred stock has been called for redemption. On or after January 20, 2009, the Company, at its option, may redeem some or all of the preferred stock at a redemption price equal to 100 percent of the liquidation preference, plus accumulated but unpaid dividends, but only if the closing price exceeds 135 percent of the conversion price, subject to adjustment, for 20 trading days within a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the trading day before the date the Company gives the redemption notice. The Company may also exchange the preferred stock for convertible subordinated debentures in certain circumstances. The Company has reserved approximately 5.6 million common treasury shares for possible future issuance for the conversion of the preferred stock. The Companys shelf registration statement with respect to the resale of the preferred stock, the convertible subordinated debentures that we may issue in exchange for the preferred stock and the common shares issuable upon conversion of the preferred stock and the convertible subordinated debentures was declared effective by the SEC on July 22, 2004. The preferred stock is classified for accounting purposes as temporary equity reflecting certain provisions of the agreement that could, under remote circumstances, require the Company to redeem the preferred stock for cash. The net proceeds after offering expenses were approximately $166 million. A portion of the proceeds was utilized to repay the remaining outstanding $25.0 million in principal amount of the Companys senior unsecured notes in the first quarter of 2004. The Company has also used approximately $63.0 million to fund its underfunded pension plans and contributed $13.1 million to its VEBAs in 2004. Operations and Customers Sales The Companys pellet sales for the year 2004 were a record 22.6 million tons versus the previous record of 19.2 million tons sold in 2003. The increase in pellet sales in 2004 was due to higher demand by the integrated steel industry and increased production. The higher production primarily reflects production from United Taconite which was acquired in December 2003. The Company ended the year 2004 with 3.3 million tons of iron ore pellet inventory, a decrease of .7 million tons from 2003, reflecting the Companys increased sales. The Companys 2005 sales volume is projected to be a record 24 million tons, a seven percent increase from 2004. The Company is largely committed under term supply agreements, which are subject to changes in customer requirements. Revenue per ton from iron ore sales and services is dependent upon several price adjustment factors included in the Companys term supply agreements, primarily the percentage change from 2004 to 2005 in the international pellet price for blast furnace pellets and Producers Price Indices (PPI), and one customers hot rolled coil price realizations from a number of its operations. Following is the estimated impact to the Companys average revenue per ton from iron ore sales and services (excluding freight and minority interest cost reimbursements) based on 2004 sales realization of $44.19 per ton: 2005 Revenue Effect (Change from 2004) Price Per Percent Ton Potential Increase (Decrease): Each 10 Percent Change in International Pellet Price 2.1 % $ .93 Each 1 Percent Change in PPI All Commodities .4 .18 Each $10 Per Ton Change from $470 Per Ton Average Hot Rolled Coil Price Realization* .6 .27 Known Year Over Year Increase** 3.6 1.59 * Valid for decreases through $400 per ton; decrease of .1 percent per ton for each $10 from $400 to $380. No upper limit. 32 Table of Contents ** Increase represents a combination of contractual base price increase, lag year adjustments and capped pricing on one contract. One of the Companys term supply agreements contains price collars, which limits the percentage increase or decrease in prices for our iron ore pellets during any one year to seven percent of the previous years contract price. Customers On October 23, 2003, Rouge, a significant pellet sales customer of the Company, filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. On January 30, 2004, Rouge sold substantially all of its assets to Severstal North America, Inc. (Severstal). Severstal, as part of the acquisition of assets of Rouge, assumed the Companys term supply agreement with Rouge with minimal modifications. The contract provides that the Company will be the sole supplier of iron ore pellets through 2012. The Company sold 3.3 million tons to Severstal/Rouge in 2004 and 3.0 million tons in 2003. Additionally, in the first quarter of 2004, Rouge repaid a $10 million secured loan balance outstanding plus accrued interest. On September 16, 2003, WCI petitioned for protection under chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. At the time of the filing, the Company had a trade receivable exposure of $4.9 million, which was reserved in the third quarter of 2003. WCI purchased 1.7 million tons, or 8 percent of total tons sold in 2004, and purchased 1.5 million tons, or 8 percent of total tons sold in 2003. WCI continues to operate and purchase pellets from the Company. On October 14, 2004, the Company and the current owners of WCI reached tentative agreement that the Company would supply 1.4 million tons of iron ore pellets in 2005 and, in 2006 and thereafter, would supply one hundred percent of WCIs annual requirements up to a maximum of two million tons of iron ore pellets. The new agreement, which is for a 10 year term beginning in 2005 and provides for the Companys recovery of its $4.9 million pre petition receivable plus $.9 million of subsequent pricing adjustment over time, was approved by the Bankruptcy Court on November 16, 2004. The agreement provides the Company with a right to terminate the agreement after 2005 if a plan of reorganization is not confirmed before June 30, 2005 and consummated by July 31, 2005; in that event, the $5.8 million receivable would be due at the end of 2005. On May 19, 2003, Weirton filed for protection under chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Weirton, a significant customer of the Company, purchased approximately ..5 million tons in 2004 through May 17, or 2 percent of all tons sold in 2004, and 2.8 million tons, or 14 percent of tons sold in 2003. On April 22, 2004, the Bankruptcy Court issued an order approving the sale of Weirtons assets to a subsidiary of ISG, and on May 18, 2004, ISG completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets, including the power related leased assets (discussed below), of Weirton. As part of the acquisition, ISG assumed the Companys term supply agreement with Weirton with some modifications. The contract term is for 15 years with the Company supplying the majority of pellets required for the ISG Weirton facility in 2004 and 2005 and all of ISG Weirtons pellet requirements thereafter. The Company sold 1.4 million tons to ISG Weirton in 2004 under the assumed contract. The Company is a 40.5 percent participant in a joint venture that acquired certain power related assets from FW Holdings, Inc. (FW Holdings), a subsidiary of Weirton, in 2001, in a purchase leaseback arrangement. On February 26, 2004, FW Holdings filed a petition for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. In connection with its bankruptcy filing, FW Holdings filed an adversary complaint against the joint venture members for declaratory relief and the return of assets acquired in the purchase leaseback transaction. In that complaint, FW Holdings asserted that the lease transaction should be recharacterized as a secured loan. As a result, FW Holdings did not make its quarterly lease payment due on March 31, 2004, of which the Companys share was $.5 million. In conjunction with ISGs purchase of the Weirton assets, a settlement agreement was reached between Weirton, ISG and the joint venture. As a result of the settlement agreement, the Company wrote down its investment to $6.1 million as of March 31, 2004 from $10.3 million. An additional $1.6 million charge was included in the Provision for customer bankruptcy exposures in the first quarter 2004; the Company had previously recorded a $2.6 million reserve for Weirton bankruptcy exposures in May 2003. The sale of Weirtons assets to ISG resulted in a $10 million payment to the joint venture on 33 Table of Contents closing (Company share $4.0 million), which was made on May 18, 2004, and annual payments of $.5 million (Company share $.2 million) including interest at the rate of five percent over the next 15 years. The joint venture members also received a release from Weirton and FW Holdings of bankruptcy claims, such as preference actions, upon the closing of the sale to ISG. On October 25, 2004, the acquisition of LNM Holdings N.V. and ISG by Ispat International, N.V., the parent of Ispat Inland, was announced. On December 17, 2004, Ispat International, N.V. completed its acquisition of LNM Holdings N.V. to form Mittal Steel Company N.V. (Mittal). The merger with ISG, subject to shareholder approvals, is expected to be completed by the end of the first quarter of 2005, resulting in the worlds largest steel company. In December 2004, ISG and the Company amended their sales agreement, which runs through 2016, to increase the base price and moderate the supplemental steel price sharing provisions. ISG is currently the Companys largest customer with total pellet purchases in 2004 of 8.9 million tons. Additionally, ISG is a 62.3 percent equity participant in Hibbing. The Companys pellet sales to Ispat Inland in 2004 totaled 2.6 million tons. Ispat Inland is a 21 percent equity partner in Empire. The Companys sales to ISG and Ispat Inland are under agreements which are not scheduled to expire for at least ten years. For 2004, the combined sales to ISG and Ispat Inland accounted for 51 percent of the Companys sales volume and, including their equity share of Empire and Hibbing production, accounted for 52 percent of the Companys managed production. The Company currently does not expect the merger to affect its relationships with ISG and Ispat Inland for the foreseeable future. On January 29, 2004, Stelco Inc. (Stelco) applied and obtained Bankruptcy Court protection from creditors in Ontario Superior Court under the Companies Creditors Arrangement Act. Pellet sales to Stelco totaled 1.2 million tons in 2004 and .1 million tons in 2003. Stelco is a 44.6 percent participant in Wabush, and U.S. subsidiaries of Stelco (which have not filed for bankruptcy protection) own 14.7 percent of Hibbing and 15 percent of Tilden. At the time of the filing, the Company had no trade receivable exposure to Stelco. Additionally, Stelco has continued to operate and has met its cash call requirements at the mining ventures to date. The Court has extended the deadline for the submittal of bids to purchase Stelco until February 14, 2005. Stelco has received an extension of the stay period under its Court ordered restructuring from February 11, 2005 to April 29, 2005. Production Following is a summary of 2004, 2003 and 2002 mine production and Company ownership: Production Companys Ownership (Million Tons) December 31 Companys Share Total Production 2004 2003 2002 2004 2003 2002 2004 2003 2002 Mine Empire 79.0 % 79.0 % 79.0 % 4.3 4.0 1.1 5.4 5.2 3.6 Tilden 85.0 85.0 85.0 6.6 6.0 6.7 7.8 7.0 7.9 Hibbing 23.0 23.0 23.0 1.9 1.8 1.5 8.3 8.0 7.7 Northshore 100.0 100.0 100.0 5.0 4.8 4.2 5.0 4.8 4.2 United Taconite* 70.0 70.0 2.9 .1 4.1 1.6 4.2 Wabush 26.8 26.8 26.8 1.0 1.4 1.2 3.8 5.2 4.5 Total Production** 21.7 18.1 14.7 34.4 30.3 27.9 * Production in 2002 and 1.5 million tons produced during the first five months of 2003 occurred under the management of the previous mine owners and prior to the acquisition by United Taconite in December 2003. ** Excludes United Taconite production under previous mine ownership. The Company preliminarily expects total mine production in 2005 to be approximately 37 million tons; the Companys share of production is currently estimated to be approximately 23 million tons. The increase in 2005 estimated production principally reflects higher production levels at all mines including capacity 34 Table of Contents expansion projects at United Taconite and Northshore mines. Production schedules are subject to change in pellet demand. Production costs per ton are expected to increase between four percent and five percent from the 2004 cost of goods sold and operating expenses (excluding freight and minority interest) of $37.56 per ton. As discussed in Cash Flow and Liquidity, the Company commenced a capacity expansion program in the fourth quarter of 2004 at United Taconite that is expected to add approximately 1.0 million tons (Companys share .7 million tons) to United Taconites annual production capacity and plans to re start an idled furnace at its wholly owned Northshore mine in the third quarter of 2005, which will increase Northshores annual production capacity by approximately .8 million tons. A further expansion at United Taconite is being evaluated. Increased Mine Ownership United Taconite Effective December 1, 2003, United Taconite purchased the ore mining and pelletizing assets of Eveleth Mines. Eveleth Mines had ceased mining operations in May 2003 after filing for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on May 1, 2003. Under the terms of the purchase agreement, United Taconite purchased all of Eveleth Mines assets for $3 million in cash and the assumption of certain liabilities, primarily mine closure related environmental obligations. As a result of this transaction, the Company, after assigning appropriate values to assets acquired and liabilities assumed, was required to record an extraordinary gain of $2.2 million, net of $.5 million tax and $1.2 million minority interest. In conjunction with this transaction, the Company and its Wabush Mines venture partners entered into pellet sales and trade agreements with Laiwu to optimize shipping efficiency. Sales to Laiwu under these contracts totaled .2 million tons and .1 million tons in 2004 and 2003, respectively. Empire Mine Effective December 31, 2002, the Company increased its ownership in Empire from 46.7 percent to 79 percent in exchange for assumption of all mine liabilities. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company indemnified Ispat Inland from obligations of Empire in exchange for certain future payments to Empire and to the Company by Ispat Inland of $120.0 million, recorded at a present value of $64.1 million at December 31, 2004 ($61.3 million at December 31, 2003) with $52.1 million classified as Long term receivable with the balance current, over the 12 year life of the supply agreement. A subsidiary of Ispat Inland has retained a 21 percent ownership in Empire, which it has a unilateral right to put to the Company in 2008. The Company is the sole outside supplier of pellets purchased by Ispat Inland for the term of the supply agreement. Sales to Ispat Inland by the Company (over and above Ispat Inlands equity share of Empire production) totaled 2.6 million tons and 1.4 million tons in 2004 and 2003, respectively. Tilden Mine On January 31, 2002, the Company increased its ownership in Tilden from 40 percent to 85 percent with the acquisition of Algomas interest in Tilden for assumption of mine liabilities associated with the interest. The acquisition increased the Companys share of the annual production capacity by 3.5 million tons. Concurrently, a term supply agreement was executed that made the Company the sole supplier of iron ore pellets purchased by Algoma for a 15 year period. Hibbing Mine In July 2002, the Company acquired (effective retroactive to January 1, 2002) an eight percent interest in Hibbing from Bethlehem Steel for the assumption of mine liabilities associated with the interest. The acquisition increased the Companys ownership of Hibbing from 15 percent to 23 percent. This transaction reduced Bethlehem Steels ownership interest in Hibbing to 62.3 percent. In October 2001, Bethlehem Steel filed for protection under chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. At the time of the filing, the Company had a trade receivable of approximately $1.0 million, which has been written off. In May 2003, ISG purchased the assets of Bethlehem Steel, including Bethlehem Steels 62.3 percent interest in Hibbing. 35 Table of Contents Wabush Mines In August 2002, Acme Steel Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of Acme Metals Incorporated, which had been under chapter 11 bankruptcy protection since 1998, rejected its 15.1 percent interest in Wabush. As a result, the Companys interest increased to 26.83 percent. Acme had discontinued funding its Wabush obligations in August 2001. Effect of Mine Ownership Increases While none of the increases in mine ownerships during 2002 required cash payments, the ownership changes resulted in the Company recognizing net obligations of approximately $93 million at December 31, 2002. Additional consolidated obligations assumed totaled approximately $163 million at December 31, 2002, primarily related to employment and legacy obligations at the Empire and Tilden mines, partially offset by non capital non current assets, principally the $58.8 million Ispat Inland long term receivable. United Taconites acquisition of the Eveleth mine assets in December 2003 was for $3 million cash and assumption of certain liabilities, primarily mine closure related environmental obligations. Labor Contracts In August 2004, employees at the Empire and Tilden mines in Michigan and the Hibbing Taconite and United Taconite mines in Minnesota, represented by the United Steelworkers of America (USWA), ratified new four year labor agreements that are comparable to other USWA contracts in the industry. The new agreements provide employees a nine percent wage increase over the next four years and for the Company and its partners to fund an estimated $220 million into pension plans and VEBAs during the term of the contracts. Accelerated funding of these plans will better secure employee post employment benefits and reduce the Companys future years employment legacy costs. The agreements also provide that employees and future retirees share in healthcare insurance cost, with the Companys share of future retirees healthcare premiums capped at 2008 levels for 2009 and beyond. In addition, the union agreed to certain workforce flexibility provisions and other work rule modifications that will improve productivity. On October 10, 2004, a new five year labor agreement was ratified by the USWA, representing hourly employees at Wabush Mines in Canada. The new agreement provides for increases in wages and benefits that are expected to be partially offset by improved productivity associated with increased worker flexibility provisions. On July 5, 2004, the USWA initiated a strike that idled Wabush mining and concentrating facilities in Labrador, Newfoundland and pelletizing and shipping facilities in Pointe Noire, Quebec. As a result of the work stoppage, Wabush lost approximately 1.7 million tons of production (Company share .5 million tons). Operations resumed on October 11, 2004. Other Related Items The iron ore industry has been identified by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (the EPA) as an industrial category that emits pollutants established by the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments. These pollutants included over 200 substances that are now classified as hazardous air pollutants (HAP). The EPA is required to develop rules that would require major sources of HAP to utilize Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) standards for their emissions. Pursuant to this statutory requirement, the EPA published a final rule on October 30, 2003 imposing emission limitations and other requirements on taconite iron ore processing operations. We must comply with the new requirements by no later than October 30, 2006. Our projected capital expenditures in 2005 and 2006 to meet the proposed MACT standards are approximately $20 million, including $4 million related to the restart of Line 1 at United Taconite. Mesabi Nugget Project In 2002, the Company agreed to participate in Phase II of the Mesabi Nugget Project. Other participants include Kobe Steel, Ltd. (Kobe Steel), Steel Dynamics, Inc., Ferrometrics, Inc. and the State of Minnesota. Construction of a $16 million pilot plant at the Companys Northshore Mine, to test and develop 36 Table of Contents Kobe Steels technology for converting iron ore into nearly pure iron in nugget form, was completed in May 2003. The high iron content product could be utilized to replace steel scrap as a raw material for electric steel furnaces and blast furnaces or basic oxygen furnaces of integrated steel producers or as feed stock for the foundry industry. A third operating phase of the pilot plant test in 2004 confirmed the commercial viability of this technology. The pilot plant ended operations August 3, 2004. The product has been used by four electric furnace producers and one foundry with favorable results. The Companys contribution to the project through the pilot plant testing and development phase was $5.3 million, primarily contributions of in kind facilities and services. Preliminary construction engineering and environmental permitting activities have been initiated for two potential commercial plant locations (one in Butler, Indiana near Steel Dynamics steelmaking facilities and one at the Companys Cliffs Erie site in Hoyt Lakes, Minnesota) with earliest environmental approval expected in the first half of 2005. A decision to proceed on construction of a commercial plant could be made in the first half of 2005; the Company would be the supplier of iron ore and have a minority interest in the first commercial plant. Venezuela Technical Assistance In March 2004, a subsidiary of the Company entered into an agreement to provide technical assistance to C.V.G. Ferrominera Orinoco C.A. of Venezuela. Under the agreement, the Company is assisting Ferrominera in achieving stable and sustainable production at its iron ore pellet plant located in the State of Bolivar, Venezuela. Ferrominera Orinoco is a government owned company responsible for the development of Venezuelas iron ore industry. Ferrominera Orinoco owns a 3.3 million metric ton pellet plant located in Puerto Ordaz, Venezuela, where it processes high grade ores produced from its main iron ore deposits in Ciudad Piar. Production from the mine and pellet plant is for both domestic consumption and sale in the international markets. Under terms of the agreement, the Company is providing technical assistance from the U.S., including a team residing in Venezuela and working at the pellet plant on a full time basis. The objective of the contract is to assist current management in various operational functions including operations and process control, maintenance, safety, environmental, training, and quality control. The Company is receiving a fixed fee with additional amounts based on the level of production achieved. The agreement was effective April 1, 2004 and is for an initial term of five years. PolyMet Option On February 16, 2004, the Company entered into an option agreement with PolyMet Mining Inc., a U.S. subsidiary of PolyMet Mining Corporation (collectively PolyMet), that grants PolyMet the exclusive right to acquire certain land, crushing, concentrating and other ancillary facilities located at the Companys Cliffs Erie site in Minnesota. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company received $500,000 and one million common shares of PolyMet for maintaining certain identified components of the Cliffs Erie facility, while PolyMet conducts a feasibility study on the development of its Northmet PolyMetallic non ferrous ore deposit located near the Cliffs Erie site. PolyMet will have until June 30, 2006 to exercise its option and acquire the assets covered under the agreement for additional consideration. PolyMet is a non ferrous mining company located in Vancouver, B.C. Canada. Its stock trades Over The Counter in the U.S. under the symbol POMGF.OB. Its stock closed at $.23 per share on February 13, 2004. The Company is recognizing the $500,000 option payment and one million common shares (valued at $230,000 on the agreement date) under the deposit method. The shares are classified as available for sale with mark to market changes recognized in equity as other comprehensive income. At December 31, 2004, the market value of the shares was $515,000. 37 Table of Contents Strategic Investments The Company intends to continue to pursue investment and management opportunities to broaden its scope as a supplier of iron ore pellets to the integrated steel industry through the acquisition of additional mining interests to strengthen its market position. The Company is particularly focused on expanding its international investments to leverage its expertise in mining and processing iron ore to capitalize on global demand for steel and iron ore in areas such as China. The Companys innovative United Taconite joint venture with Laiwu is one example of its ability to expand geographically by supplying pellets from Wabush Mines in Eastern Canada in exchange for Laiwus United Taconite pellets, and the Company intends to continue to pursue similar opportunities in other regions. In addition, the Company will continue to investigate opportunities in North America including Eastern Canadian and U.S. mines. In the event of any future acquisitions or joint venture opportunities, the Company may consider using available liquidity or other sources of funding to make investments. Offer to Purchase Portman Limited On January 11, 2005, the Company, through a wholly owned subsidiary incorporated for the sole purpose of making an acquisition offer, announced an all cash offer for the outstanding shares of Portman Limited (Portman), a Western Australia based independent iron ore mining and exploration company. The Companys offer (Offer) consisted of A$3.40 per share, or US$2.65 per share (assuming an exchange rate of A$1.28 equal to US$1.00), which will result in a total acquisition price of approximately US $500 million. The Offer has the support of Portmans Board of Directors. If successful, the Company expects to fund the acquisition with existing cash and borrowings under its revolving credit facility. The Company has hedged its potential foreign exchange exposure through the acquisition of a put option. The Company has a commitment from its bankers to increase its revolving credit facility from $30 million to $100 million and extend its term through January 6, 2006; the Company is working on a longer term $250 million revolving credit facility to replace the existing facility. Portman supplies iron ore to the Chinese and Japanese markets, with approximately 75 percent of the product exported to China and 25 percent exported to Japan. Portman currently has approximately six million tons of annual iron ore capacity, which will be expanded to eight million tons by late 2005. Environmental and Closure Obligations At December 31, 2004, the Company had environmental and closure obligations, including its share of the obligations of unconsolidated ventures, of $99.0 million ($97.8 million at December 31, 2003), of which $6.0 million is current. Payments in 2004 were $6.4 million ($7.5 million in 2003). The obligations at December 31, 2004 include certain responsibilities for environmental remediation sites, $13.0 million, closure of LTV Steel Mining Company (LTVSMC), $33.8 million, and obligations for closure of the Companys six operating mines, $52.2 million, reflecting implementation of SFAS No. 143, Asset Retirement Obligations effective January 1, 2002. The LTVSMC closure obligation resulted from an October 2001 transaction where subsidiaries of the Company received a net payment of $50.0 million and certain other assets and assumed environmental and certain facility closure obligations of $50.0 million, which obligations have declined to $33.8 million at December 31, 2004, as a result of expenditures totaling $16.2 million since 2001. In September 2002, the Company received a draft of a proposed Administrative Order by Consent (Consent Order) from the EPA for cleanup and reimbursement of costs associated with the Milwaukee Solvay coke plant site in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The plant was operated by a predecessor of the Company from 1973 to 1983, which predecessor was acquired by the Company in 1986. In January 2003, the Company completed the sale of the plant site and property to a third party. Following this sale, a Consent Order was entered into with the EPA by the Company, the new owner and another third party who had operated on the site. In connection with the Consent Order, the new owner agreed to take responsibility for the removal action and agreed to indemnify the Company for all costs and expenses in connection with the removal action. In the third quarter of 2003, the new owner, after completing a portion of the removal, experienced financial 38 Table of Contents difficulties. In an effort to continue progress on the removal action, the Company expended approximately $.9 million in the second half of 2003 and $2.1 million in 2004. At this time, the Company believes the requirements of the removal action have been substantially completed. On August 26, 2004, the Company received a Request for Information pursuant to Section 104(e) of CERCLA relative to the investigation of additional contamination below the ground surface at the Milwaukee Solvay site. The Request for Information was also sent to 13 other potentially responsible parties (PRPs). At this time, the nature and extent of the contamination, the required remediation, the total cost of the cleanup and the cost sharing responsibilities of the PRPs cannot be determined. The Company increased its environmental reserve for Milwaukee Solvay by $.8 million in 2004 for potential additional exposure. Summary of Contractual Obligations Following is a summary of the Companys contractual obligations at December 31, 2004: Payments due by Period(1) (Millions) Less than More than Contractual Obligations Total 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years 5 Years Capital Lease Obligations $ 9.1 $ 2.6 $ 5.2 $ 1.3 Operating Leases 51.1 16.0 21.2 11.1 $ 2.8 Purchase Obligations Open Purchase Orders 47.1 46.0 .6 .5 Minimum Take or Pay Purchase Commitments(2) 182.2 59.5 68.6 29.1 25.0 Total Purchase Obligations 229.3 105.5 69.2 29.6 25.0 Other Long Term Liabilities Pension Funding Minimums 158.4 33.9 82.0 42.5 OPEB Claim Payments 145.8 35.2 66.9 43.7 Mine Closure Obligations 86.0 3.2 14.9 13.8 54.1 Coal Industry Retiree Health Benefits 7.4 .8 1.6 1.4 3.6 Personal Injury 11.3 3.4 4.4 1.6 1.9 Other(3) 59.3 Total Other Long Term Liabilities 468.2 76.5 169.8 103.0 59.6 Total $ 757.7 $ 200.6 $ 265.4 $ 145.0 $ 87.4 (1) Includes the Companys consolidated obligations and the Companys ownership share of unconsolidated ventures obligations. (2) Includes minimum electric power demand charges, minimum coal and natural gas obligations, and minimum railroad transportation obligations. (3) Primarily includes deferred income taxes payable and other contingent liabilities for which payment timing is non determinable. Market Risk The Company is subject to a variety of market risks, including those caused by changes in market value of equity investments, commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Company has established policies and procedures to manage risks; however, certain risks are beyond the control of the Company. 39 Table of Contents The Companys investment policy relating to its short term investments (classified as cash equivalents) is to preserve principal and liquidity while maximizing the return through investment of available funds. The carrying value of these investments approximates fair value on the reporting dates. The rising cost of energy is an important issue for us. Energy costs account for approximately 25 percent of our production costs. Recent trends indicate that electric power, natural gas and oil costs can be expected to increase over time, although the direction and magnitude of short term changes are difficult to predict. Our strategy to address increasing energy rates includes improving efficiency in energy usage and utilizing the lowest cost alternative fuel. We also use forward purchases of natural gas to stabilize fluctuations in near term natural gas prices. The Companys mining ventures enter into forward contracts for certain commodities, primarily natural gas, as a hedge against price volatility. Such contracts, which are in quantities expected to be delivered and used in the production process, are a means to limit exposure to price fluctuations. At December 31, 2004, the notional amounts of the outstanding forward contracts were $28.3 million (Company share $23.9 million), with an unrecognized fair value loss of $3.2 million (Company share $2.7 million) based on December 31, 2004 forward rates. The contracts mature at various times through December 2005. If the forward rates were to change 10 percent from the year end rate, the value and potential cash flow effect on the contracts would be approximately $2.5 million (Company share $2.1 million). Our Wabush mine operation in Canada represented approximately five percent of the Companys pellet production. This operation is subject to currency exchange fluctuations between the U.S. and Canadian dollars; however, we do not hedge our exposure to this currency exchange fluctuation. During 2003 and 2004, the value of the Canadian dollar rose against the U.S. dollar from $.64 U.S. dollar per Canadian dollar at the beginning of 2003 to $.83 U.S. dollars per Canadian dollar at December 31, 2004, an increase of 30 percent. The average exchange rate increased to $.77 U.S. dollar per Canadian dollar in 2004 from an average of $.72 U.S. dollar per Canadian dollar for 2003, an increase of seven percent. The Company does not believe that the recent increase in the U.S./ Canadian exchange rate is a trend that will continue in the long term; however, short term fluctuations cannot reasonably be predicted. Critical Accounting Policies Managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on the Companys consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). Preparation of financial statements requires management to make assumptions, estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses, and the related disclosures of contingencies. Management bases its estimates on various assumptions and historical experience, which are believed to be reasonable; however, due to the inherent nature of estimates, actual results may differ significantly due to changed conditions or assumptions. Management believes that the following critical accounting policies and practices incorporate estimates and judgments that have the most significant impact on the Companys financial statements. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenue on the sale of products when title to the product has transferred to the customer in accordance with the specified terms of each term supply agreement. Generally, our term supply agreements provide that title transfers to the customer when payment is received. Under some term supply agreements, we deliver the product to ports on the lower Great Lakes and or to the customers facilities prior to the transfer of title. Most of the Companys term supply agreements contain provisions for annual pricing adjustments. These provisions vary from agreement to agreement but typically include adjustments based upon changes in specified PPI including those for all commodities, industrial commodities, energy and steel, as well as changes in international pellet prices. In most cases, these adjustment factors have not been finalized at the time our product is sold; the Company routinely estimates these adjustment factors for purposes of revenue recognition. Certain supply agreements with one customer include provisions for supplemental revenue or refunds based on the customers annual steel pricing at the time the product is 40 Table of Contents consumed in the customers blast furnaces. The Company estimates these amounts for recognition at the time of sale. The Companys 2004 revenues included $6.6 million of supplemental revenue on 2004 sales based on estimates of the customers 2005 steel pricing. Our rationale for delivering iron ore products to customers in advance of payment for the products is to more closely relate timing of payment by customers to consumption, which also provides additional liquidity to our customers. Title and risk of loss do not pass to the customer until payment for the pellets is received. This is a revenue recognition practice utilized to reduce our financial risk to customer insolvency. This practice is not believed to be widely used throughout the balance of the industry. Revenue is recognized on the sale of services when the services are performed. Where we are joint venture participants in the ownership of a mine, our contracts entitle us to receive royalties and management fees, which we earn as the pellets are produced. Iron Ore Reserves The Company regularly evaluates its economic iron ore reserves and updates them as required in accordance with SEC Industry Guide 7. The estimated ore reserves could be affected by future industry conditions, geological conditions and ongoing mine planning. Maintenance of effective production capacity or the ore reserve could require increases in capital and development expenditures. Generally as mining operations progress, haul lengths and lifts increase. Alternatively, changes in economic conditions or the expected quality of ore reserves could decrease capacity or ore reserves. Technological progress could alleviate such factors, or increase capacity or ore reserves. Remaining Empire mine ore reserves (23 million tons at December 31, 2004) were previously decreased to 29 million tons at December 31, 2003 from 63 million tons at December 31, 2002 and 116 million tons at December 31, 2001. The reduction in ore reserves reflected increasing production and processing costs in recent years as the Empire mine approaches the latter portion of its economic life. Additionally, economic ore reserves at Wabush Mines (57 million tons at December 31, 2004) were previously reduced to 61 million tons at December 31, 2003 from 94 million tons at December 31, 2002 and 244 million tons at December 31, 2001. The decrease in ore reserves at Wabush reflects increased operating costs, the impact of currency exchange rates, and a reduction in the maximum mining depth in one critical mining area due to assessment of dewatering capabilities based on a recently completed hydrologic evaluation, partially offset by higher Eastern Canadian pellet pricing and an increase in Wabush production to its capacity of six million tons per year. The Company uses its ore reserve estimates to determine the mine closure dates utilized in recording the fair value liability for asset retirement obligations. See Note 5 Environmental and Mine Closure Obligations Mine Closure in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Since the liability represents the present value of the expected future obligation, a significant change in ore reserves would have a substantial effect on the recorded obligation. The Company also utilizes economic ore reserves for evaluating potential impairments of mine assets and in determining maximum useful lives utilized to calculate depreciation and amortization of long lived mine assets. Decreases in ore reserves could significantly affect these items. Asset Retirement Obligations The accrued mine closure obligations for the Companys active mining operations reflect the adoption of SFAS No. 143 effective January 1, 2002 to provide for contractual and legal obligations associated with the eventual closure of the mining operations. The Companys obligations are determined based on detailed estimates adjusted for factors that an outside party would consider (i.e., inflation, overhead and profit), which were escalated (at an assumed three percent) to the estimated closure dates, and then discounted using a credit adjusted risk free interest rate (12.0 percent for United Taconite and 10.25 percent for all others). The closure date for each location was determined based on the exhaustion date of the remaining iron ore reserves. The estimated obligations are particularly sensitive to the impact of changes in mine lives given the difference between the inflation and discount rates. Changes in the base estimates of legal and contractual closure costs due to changed legal or contractual requirements, available technology, inflation, overhead or profit rates 41 Table of Contents would also have a significant impact on the recorded obligations. See Note 5 Environmental and Mine Closure Obligations Mine Closure in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Asset Impairment The Company monitors conditions that indicate that the carrying value of an asset or asset group may be impaired. The Company determines impairment based on the assets ability to generate cash flow greater than its carrying value, utilizing an undiscounted probability weighted analysis. If the analysis indicates the asset is impaired, the carrying value is adjusted to fair value. The impairment analysis and fair value determination can result in significantly different outcomes based on critical assumptions and estimates including the quantity and quality of remaining economic ore reserves, and future iron ore prices and production costs. See Note 1 Operations and Customers Empire Mine and Wabush Mines and Note 3 Discontinued Operation in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Environmental Remediation Costs The Company has a formal code of environmental protection and restoration. The Companys obligations for known environmental problems at active and closed mining operations and other sites have been recognized based on estimates of the cost of investigation and remediation at each site. If the estimate can only be estimated as a range of possible amounts, with no specific amount being most likely, the minimum of the range is accrued. Management reviews its environmental remediation sites quarterly to determine if additional cost adjustments or disclosures are required. The characteristics of environmental remediation obligations, where information concerning the nature and extent of clean up activities is not immediately available, or changes in regulatory requirements, result in a significant risk of increase to the obligations as they mature. Expected future expenditures are not discounted to present value. Potential insurance recoveries are not recognized until realized. Employee Retirement Benefit Obligations The Company and its mining ventures sponsor defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all employees. These plans are largely noncontributory, and except for U.S. salaried employees, benefits are generally based on employees years of service and average earnings for a defined period prior to retirement. Additionally, the Company and its ventures provide post retirement medical and life insurance benefits (OPEBs) to most full time employees who meet certain length of service and age requirements. The Companys pension and medical costs (including OPEBs) have increased substantially over the past several years. Lower interest rates, lower asset returns and continued escalation of medical costs have been the predominant causes of the increases. The Company has taken actions to control pension and medical costs. Effective July 1, 2003, the Company implemented changes to U.S. salaried employee plans to reduce costs by more than an estimated $8.0 million on an annualized basis. Benefits under the current defined benefit formula were frozen for affected U.S. salaried employees and a new cash balance formula was instituted. Increases in affected U.S. salaried retiree healthcare co pays became effective for retirements after June 30, 2003. A cap on the Companys share of annual medical premiums was also implemented for existing and future U.S. salaried retirees. Pursuant to the new four year U.S. labor agreements reached with the USWA, effective August 1, 2004, OPEB expense for 2004 and the accumulated post retirement benefit obligation (APBO) has decreased $4.9 million and $48.0 million, respectively, to reflect negotiated plan changes, which capped the Companys share of future bargaining unit retirees healthcare premiums at 2008 levels for the years 2009 and beyond. The new agreements also provide that the Company and its partners fund an estimated $220 million into bargaining unit pension plans and VEBAs during the term of the contracts. Year 2004 OPEB expense also reflects an estimated cost reduction of $4.1 million due to the effect of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003. The Company elected to adopt the retroactive transition method for recognizing the OPEB cost reduction in the second quarter of 2004. 42 Table of Contents Accordingly, first quarter 2004 results have been re stated to reduce the previously reported net loss by $.6 million or $.05 per share. Additionally, the APBO decreased $25.1 million. Year 2004 OPEB expense also reflects a cost reduction for the Canadian OPEB plan of $.4 million due to the net effect of favorable claims and demographic experience, offset by moderate benefit improvements negotiated with the USWA effective March 1, 2004. Following is a summary of the Companys defined benefit pension and OPEB funding and expense for the years 2002 through 2005: (In Millions) Pension OPEB Funding Expense Funding Expense 2002 $ 1.1 $ 7.2 $ 16.8 $ 21.5 2003 6.4 32.0 17.0 29.1 2004 63.0 23.1 30.9 28.5 2005 (Estimated) 33.9 19.1 35.2 21.8 Assumptions used in determining the benefit obligations and the value of plan assets for defined benefit pension plans and post retirement benefit plans (primarily retiree healthcare benefits) offered by the Company and its unconsolidated ventures are evaluated periodically by management in conjunction with outside actuaries. Critical assumptions, such as the discount rate used to measure the benefit obligations, the expected long term rate of return on plan assets, and the medical care cost trend are reviewed annually. At December 31, 2004, the Company reduced its discount rate for U.S. plans to 5.75 percent from 6.25 percent at December 31, 2003, and reduced its discount rate for Canadian plans to 5.75 percent from 6.00 percent at December 31, 2003. Following are sensitivities on estimated 2005 pension and OPEB expense of potential further changes in these key assumptions: Increase in 2005 Expense (In Millions) Pension OPEB Decrease discount rate .25 percent $ 1.2 $ .6 Decrease return on assets 1 percent 4.5 .5 Increase medical trend rate 1 percent N/A 2.6 Changes in actuarial assumptions, including discount rates, employee retirement rates, mortality, compensation levels, plan asset investment performance, and healthcare costs, are selected by the Company after consulting with outside actuaries. Changes in actuarial assumptions and or investment performance of plan assets can have a significant impact on the Companys financial condition due to the magnitude of the Companys retirement obligations. See Note 8 Retirement Related Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Risks Relating to the Company Excess global capacity and the availability of competitive substitute materials may result in intense competition in the steel industry, which may reduce steel prices and decrease steel production and our customers demand for iron ore products. More than 95 percent of our revenues are derived from the North American integrated steel industry, which is highly competitive. From time to time, global overcapacity in steel manufacturing has a negative impact on North American steel sales and reduces the production of steel and consequently the demand for iron ore. Further, production of steel by North American integrated steel manufacturers may be replaced to a certain extent by production of substitute materials by other manufacturers. In the case of certain product applications, North American steel manufacturers compete with manufacturers of other materials, including plastic, aluminum, graphite composites, ceramics, glass, wood and concrete. Most of our term supply agreements for the sale of iron ore products are requirements based or provide for flexibility of volume above a 43 Table of Contents minimum level. Reduced demand for and consumption of iron ore products by North American integrated steel producers have had and may continue to have a significant negative impact on our sales, margins and profitability. Increased imports of steel into the United States could adversely impact North American steel sales, which could adversely affect demand for our products and our sales, margins and profitability. From time to time, global overcapacity in steel manufacturing and a weakening of certain foreign economies, particularly in Eastern Europe, Asia and Latin America, may negatively impact steel prices in those foreign economies and result in high levels of steel imports from those countries into the United States at depressed prices. Based on the American Iron and Steel Institutes Apparent Steel Supply (excluding semi finished steel products), imports of steel into the United States constituted 22.1 percent (estimated), 16.5 percent and 21.1 percent of the domestic steel market supply for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Significant imports of steel into the United States could substantially reduce sales, margins and profitability of North American steel producers, and consequently, reduce demand for iron ore. The purchase by North American steel producers of semi finished steel products from foreign suppliers could also decrease demand for our iron ore products. The North American steel industry continues to undergo a restructuring process that has resulted in industry consolidation that could result in a reduction of integrated steelmaking capacity over time, and thereby reduce iron ore consumption. The North American steel industry has undergone consolidation, and that consolidation is likely to continue as evidenced by the recently announced acquisition of ISG by Mittal. Consolidation of the North American steel industry will result in fewer customers for iron ore. The restructuring process may reduce integrated steelmaking capacity, which would reduce demand for our iron ore products and may adversely affect our sales. Further, if the steel producers that have captive iron ore mines obtain a larger share of North American steel production, they may obtain their iron ore from their own mines, if they have excess capacity, rather than from us. These factors could adversely affect our sales, margins and profitability. Our sales and earnings are subject to significant fluctuations as a result of the cyclical nature of the North American steel industry. In 2003 and 2004, 18.6 million and 22.2 million tons, respectively, of the iron ore pellets we produced were sold to North American steel manufacturers, while only .6 million and .4 million tons, respectively, of our pellets were sold outside of North America. The North American steel industry has been highly cyclical in nature, influenced by a combination of factors, including periods of economic growth or recession, strength or weakness of the U.S. dollar, worldwide production capacity, the strength of the U.S. automotive industry, levels of steel imports and applicable tariffs. The demand for steel products is generally affected by macroeconomic fluctuations in North America and the global economies in which steel companies sell their products. For example, future economic downturns, stagnant economies or currency fluctuations in the United States or globally could decrease the demand for steel products or increase the amount of imports of steel or iron ore into the United States. In addition, a disruption or downturn in the oil and gas, gas transmission, construction, commercial equipment, rail transportation, appliance, agricultural, automotive or durable goods industries, all of which are significant markets for steel products and are highly cyclical, could negatively impact sales of steel by North American producers. These trends could decrease the demand for iron ore products and significantly adversely affect our sales, margins and profitability. 44 Table of Contents If North American steelmakers use methods other than blast furnace production to produce steel, or if their blast furnaces shut down or otherwise reduce production, the demand for our iron ore products may decrease, which would adversely affect our sales, margins and profitability. Demand for our iron ore products is determined by the operating rates for the blast furnaces of North American steel companies. However, not all finished steel is produced by blast furnaces; finished steel also may be produced by other methods that do not require iron ore products. For example, steel mini mills, which are steel recyclers, generally produce steel by using scrap steel, not iron ore pellets, in their electric furnaces. Production of steel by steel mini mills was approximately 50 percent of North American total finished steel production in 2004. Steel producers also can produce steel using imported iron ore or semi finished steel products, which eliminates the need for domestic iron ore. Environmental restrictions on the use of blast furnaces also may reduce our customers use of their blast furnaces. Maintenance of blast furnaces can require substantial capital expenditures. Our customers may choose not to maintain their blast furnaces, and some of our customers may not have the resources necessary to adequately maintain their blast furnaces. If our customers use methods to produce steel that do not use iron ore products, demand for our iron ore products will decrease, which could adversely affect our sales, margins and profitability. Natural disasters, equipment failures and other unexpected events may lead our steel industry customers to curtail production or shut down their operations. Operating levels at our steel industry customers are subject to conditions beyond their control, including raw material shortages, weather conditions, natural disasters, interruptions in electrical power or other energy services, equipment failures, and other unexpected events. Any of those events could also affect other suppliers to the North American steel industry. In either case, those events could cause our steel industry customers to curtail production or shut down a portion or all of their operations, which could reduce their demand for our iron ore products. For example, in late 2003, a fire occurred in a mine of a major coal supplier to U.S. Steel, which supplies a majority of the coke, a processed form of coal, used by our steel industry customers to operate their blast furnaces. The fire caused U.S. Steel to curtail its production of coke, and to reduce its coke shipments to at least two of our steel industry customers. As a result, one of our steel industry customers had to curtail its steel production, and its demand for our iron ore products decreased. Decreased demand for our iron ore products could adversely affect our sales, margins and profitability. If the rate of steel consumption in China slows, the demand for iron ore could decrease. Although we do not have significant international sales, the price of iron ore is strongly influenced by international demand. The current growing level of international demand for iron ore and steel is largely due to the rapid industrial growth in China. A large quantity of steel is currently being used in China to build roads, bridges, railroads and factories. If the economic growth rate in China slows, which may be difficult to forecast, less steel will be used in construction and manufacturing, which would decrease demand for iron ore. According to the China Daily newspaper, China imported 29.3 million tons of steel products in 2004, down 7.9 million tons from 2003. This slowdown in Chinese steel demand began in March 2004 when Chinese banks restricted lending in the steel sector and the Chinese government withdrew import duty rebates for equipment used in steel plants and ended discounts on electricity consumption by steel factories. This could adversely impact the world iron ore market, which would impact the North American iron ore market, and also adversely impact our United Taconite joint venture with Laiwu. A slowing of the economic growth rate in China could also result in greater exports of steel out of China, which if imported into North America could decrease demand for domestically produced steel, thereby decreasing the demand for iron ore produced in North America. We operate in a very competitive industry. The iron mining business is highly competitive, with producers in all iron producing regions. Some of our competitors may have greater financial resources than we have and may be better able to withstand changes in conditions within the North American steel industry than we are. In the future, we may face increasing 45 Table of Contents competition. As a result, we may face pressures on sales prices and volumes of our products from competitors and large customers. Our sales and competitive position depend on our ability to transport our products to our customers at competitive rates and in a timely manner. Our competitive position requires the ability to transport iron ore to our markets at competitive rates. Disruption of the lake freighter and rail transportation services because of weather related problems, including ice and winter weather conditions on the Great Lakes, strikes, lock outs or other events, could impair our ability to supply iron ore pellets to our customers at competitive rates or in a timely manner and, thus, could adversely affect our sales and profitability. Further, increases in transportation costs, or changes in such costs relative to transportation costs incurred by our competitors, could make our products less competitive, restrict our access to certain markets and have an adverse effect on our sales, margins and profitability. If a substantial portion of our term supply agreements terminate and are not renewed, and we are unable to find alternate buyers willing to purchase our products on terms comparable to those in our existing term supply agreements, our sales, margins and profitability will suffer. A substantial majority of our sales are made under term supply agreements, which are important to the stability and profitability of our operations. In 2004, more than 96 percent of our sales volume was sold under term supply agreements. If a substantial portion of our term supply agreements were modified or terminated, we could be materially adversely affected to the extent that we are unable to renew the agreements or find alternate buyers for our iron ore at the same level of profitability. We cannot assure you that we will be able to renew or replace existing term supply agreements at the same prices or with similar profit margins when they expire. A loss of sales to our existing customers could have a substantial negative impact on our sales, margins and profitability. We depend on a limited number of customers, and the loss of, or significant reduction in, purchases by our largest customers would adversely affect our sales. The following seven customers together accounted for a total of 94 percent of Product sales and services revenues for the years 2004 and 2003: Percent of Sales Revenues* Year Ended December 31, Customer 2004 2003 ISG 44 % 29 % Algoma 14 17 Severstal/Rouge 13 16 Ispat Inland/ Mittal 10 8 WCI 6 7 Stelco 5 1 Weirton 2 16 Total 94 % 94 % * Excluding freight and minority interest cost reimbursements. If one or more of these customers were to significantly reduce their purchases of iron ore products from us, or if we were unable to sell iron ore products to them on terms as favorable to us as the terms under our current term supply agreements, our sales, margins and profitability could suffer materially due to the high level of fixed costs and the high costs to idle or close mines. We are a merchant mine producer of iron ore products, 46 Table of Contents not a captive producer owned by a steel manufacturer, and therefore rely on sales to our joint venture partners and other third party customers for our revenues. In addition, WCI and Stelco have petitioned for protection under bankruptcy or similar laws, and the bankruptcy or reorganization of our customers could affect our sales, margins and profitability. Changes in demand for our products by our customers could cause our sales, margins and profitability to fluctuate. Our term supply agreements generally are requirements contracts, the majority of which have no minimum requirement provisions, and some of which provide for flexibility of volume above minimum levels. A decrease in one or more of our customers requirements could cause our sales to decline, as we may not be able to find other customers to purchase our iron ore pellets. In addition, if our customers requirements decline, since many of our production costs are fixed, our production costs per ton may rise, which may affect our margins and profitability. Unmitigated loss of revenues would have a greater impact on margins and profitability than sales, due to the high level of fixed costs in the iron ore mining business and the high cost to idle or close mines. The provisions of our term supply agreements could cause our sales, margins and profitability to fluctuate. Our term supply agreements typically contain force majeure provisions allowing temporary suspension of performance by the customer during specified events beyond the customers control, including raw material shortages, power failures, equipment failures, adverse weather conditions and other events. For example, one of our large customers notified us in January 2004 that it was reducing its requirements for iron ore pellets in the first quarter of 2004 by 180,000 long tons pursuant to the force majeure provisions of its term supply agreement with us. That customer invoked the force majeure provision due to a failure of U.S. Steel to ship the quantity of coke that the customer had ordered due to shortages caused by a fire at a mine that supplied coal to U.S. Steel. Price escalators in our term supply agreements also expose us to short term price volatility, which can adversely affect our margins and profitability. Our term supply agreements also contain provisions requiring us to deliver iron ore pellets meeting quality thresholds for certain characteristics, such as chemical makeup. Failure to meet these specifications could result in economic penalties. All of these contractual provisions could adversely affect our sales, margins and profitability. Mine closures entail substantial costs, and if we close one or more of our mines sooner than anticipated, our results of operations and financial condition may be significantly and adversely affected. If we close any of our mines, our revenues would be reduced unless we were able to increase production at any of our other mines, which may not be possible. The closure of an open pit mine involves significant fixed closure costs, including accelerated employment legacy costs, severance related obligations, reclamation and other environmental costs, and the costs of terminating long term obligations, including energy contracts and equipment leases. We base our assumptions regarding the life of our mines on detailed studies we perform from time to time, but those studies and assumptions do not always prove to be accurate. We accrue for the costs of reclaiming open pits, stockpiles, tailings ponds, roads and other mining support areas over the estimated mining life of our property. If we were to reduce the estimated life of any of our mines, the fixed mine closure costs would be applied to a shorter period of production, which would increase production costs per ton produced and could significantly and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Further, if we were to close one or more of our mines prematurely, we would incur significant accelerated employment legacy costs, severance related obligations, reclamation and other environmental costs, as well as asset impairment charges, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition. A mine closure would significantly increase employment legacy costs, including our expense and funding costs for pension and other post retirement benefit obligations. First, retirement eligible employees would be eligible for enhanced pension benefits under certain pension plans upon a mine closure. Second, the number of 47 Table of Contents employees who are eligible for retirement under the pension plans would increase under special eligibility rules that apply upon a mine closure. Third, all employees eligible for retirement under the pension plans at the time of the mine closure also would be eligible for post retirement health and life insurance benefits, thereby accelerating our obligation to provide these benefits. Fourth, a closure of the Empire or Tilden mine likely would trigger withdrawal liability to the pension plan covering hourly employees there. Finally, a mine closure could trigger significant severance related obligations, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Applicable statutes and regulations require that mining property be reclaimed following a mine closure in accordance with specified standards and an approved reclamation plan. The plan addresses matters such as removal of facilities and equipment, regrading, prevention of erosion and other forms of water pollution, revegetation and post mining land use. We may be required to post a surety bond or other form of financial assurance equal to the cost of reclamation as set forth in the approved reclamation plan. The establishment of the final mine closure reclamation liability is based upon permit requirements and requires various estimates and assumptions, principally associated with reclamation costs and production levels. Although our management believes, based on currently available information, we are making adequate provisions for all expected reclamation and other costs associated with mine closures for which we will be responsible, our business, results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected if such accruals were later determined to be insufficient. We have significantly reduced our ore reserve estimates for the Empire mine and may close the Empire mine sooner than we had anticipated, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We significantly decreased our ore reserve estimates for the Empire mine from 116 million tons at December 31, 2001 to 63 million tons at December 31, 2002 and further to 29 million tons at December 31, 2003. Our Empire ore reserves were approximately 23 million tons at December 31, 2004, with the decrease in 2004 resulting from production. The 2003 reduction was due to our inability to develop effective mine plans to produce cost effective combinations of production volume, ore quality and stripping requirements. We may reduce the annual production at the Empire mine as a result of these decreased ore reserve estimates. If the ore reserves at Empire are insufficient to sustain our operations there, we may be required to close the mine. We have taken significant asset impairment charges relating to the Empire mine. If we were to close the Empire mine, we would incur significant mine closure costs, employment legacy costs, severance related obligations, reclamation and other environmental costs and the costs of terminating long term obligations, including energy contracts and equipment leases. A closure of the Empire mine sooner than we anticipate could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We rely on the estimates of our recoverable reserves, and if those estimates are inaccurate, our financial condition may be adversely affected. We regularly evaluate our economic iron ore reserves based on expectations of revenues and costs and update them as required in accordance with Industry Guide 7 promulgated by the SEC. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of reserves of our mines, many of which have been in operation for several decades, including many factors beyond our control. Estimates of reserves and future net cash flows necessarily depend upon a number of variable factors and assumptions, such as historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas, the assumed effects of regulations by governmental agencies and assumptions concerning future prices for iron ore, assumptions regarding future industry conditions and operating costs, severance and excise taxes, development costs and costs of extraction and reclamation costs, all of which may in fact vary considerably from actual results. For these reasons, estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of reserves attributable to any particular group of properties, classifications of such reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of future net cash flows expected therefrom prepared by different engineers or by the same engineers at different times may vary substantially. Estimated reserves could be affected by future industry conditions, geological conditions and ongoing mine planning. Actual production, revenues and expenditures with respect to our reserves will likely vary from 48 Table of Contents estimates, and if such variances are material, our sales and profitability could be adversely affected. For example, based on revised economic mine planning studies that we completed in the fourth quarter of 2002, we reduced the estimates of the ore reserves at the Empire mine from 116 million tons to 63 million tons due to increasing mining and processing costs. Based on an update to those studies completed in the fourth quarter of 2003, we further significantly reduced the ore reserve estimates to 29 million tons. The reduction was due to the inability to develop effective mine plans to produce cost effective combinations of production volume, ore quality and stripping requirements with the 2003 reserve base. We also completed revised economic mine planning studies in the fourth quarter of 2002 for Wabush Mines, and reduced the estimate of ore reserves at the Wabush mine from 244 million tons to 94 million tons due to increasing mining and processing costs. Based on an update to those studies completed in the fourth quarter of 2003, we further significantly reduced the Wabush mine ore reserve estimate to 61 million tons. Our reserves at Wabush Mines were approximately 57 million tons at December 31, 2004, with the reduction from 2003 attributable to 2004 production. The revised Wabush estimate is largely a reflection of increased operating costs, the impact of currency exchange rates and a reduction in maximum mining depth due to dewatering capabilities based on a recently completed hydrologic evaluation. The price adjustment provisions of our term supply agreements may prevent us from increasing our prices to match international ore contract prices or to pass increased costs of production on to our customers. Our term supply agreements contain a number of price adjustment provisions, or price escalators, including adjustments based on general industrial inflation rates, the price of steel and the international price of iron ore pellets, among other factors, that allow us to adjust the prices under those agreements generally on an annual basis. Our price adjustment provisions are weighted and some are subject to annual collars, which limit our ability to raise prices to match international levels and fully capitalize on strong demand for iron ore. Most of our term supply agreements do not allow us to increase our prices and to directly pass through higher production costs to our customers. An inability to increase prices or pass along increased costs could adversely affect our margins and profitability. Our ability to collect payments from our customers depends on their creditworthiness. Our ability to receive payment for iron ore products sold and delivered to our customers depends on the creditworthiness of our customers. Generally, we deliver iron ore products to our customers yard in advance of payment for those products. Our rationale for delivering iron ore products to customers in advance of payment for the product is to more closely relate timing of payment to consumption, thereby providing additional liquidity to our customers, and to reduce our financial risk to customer insolvency as title and risk of loss with respect to those products does not pass to the customer until payment for the pellets is received. Accordingly, there is typically a period of time in which pellets, as to which we have reserved title, are within our customers control. Several of our customers have petitioned for protection under bankruptcy or other similar laws, and most of our North American customers have below investment grade or no credit rating. Failure to receive payment from our customers for products that we have delivered could adversely affect our results of operations. Our change in strategy from a manager of iron ore mines on behalf of steel company owners to primarily a merchant of iron ore to steel company customers has increased our obligations with respect to those mines and has made our revenues, earnings and profit margins more dependent on sales of iron ore products and more susceptible to product demand and pricing fluctuations. Historically, we have acted as a manager of iron ore mines on behalf of steel company owners, and in that capacity have been generally entitled to management fees, royalties on reserves that we have leased or subleased to the Empire and Tilden mines, and income from our sales of iron ore products to our customers, including the other mine owners. Our revised business strategy is to increase our ownership in our co owned mines. In accordance with that revised strategy, in fiscal year 2002 we increased our ownership in (1) the Empire mine from 47 percent to 79 percent, (2) the Tilden mine from 40 percent to 85 percent, (3) the Hibbing mine from 15 percent to 23 percent, and (4) the Wabush mine from 23 percent to 27 percent. While 49 Table of Contents we have gained greater control of the mines we operate, we have also increased our share of the operating costs, employment legacy costs and financial obligations associated with those mines. Our increased ownership of those mines has caused the management fees and royalties due to us from our partners in the mines to decline from $29.8 million in 2001 to $11.3 million in 2004. The decline in royalties and management fees has made our revenues, earnings and profit margins more volatile and more dependent on sales of our iron ore products to third party customers. We rely on our joint venture partners in our mines to meet their payment obligations, and the inability of a joint venture partner to do so could significantly affect our operating costs. We co own five of our six mines with various joint venture partners that are integrated steel producers or their subsidiaries, including Dofasco, ISG, Ispat Inland, Laiwu and Stelco. While we are the manager of each of the mines we co own, we rely on our joint venture partners to make their required capital contributions and to pay for their share of the iron ore pellets that we produce. Most of our venture partners are also our customers and are subject to the creditworthiness risks described above. If one or more of our venture partners fail to perform their obligations, the remaining venturers, including ourselves, may be required to assume additional material obligations, including significant pension and post retirement health and life insurance benefit obligations. On January 29, 2004, Stelco applied and obtained bankruptcy court protection from creditors in Ontario Superior Court under the Companies Creditors Arrangement Act. Stelco is a 44.6 percent participant in the Wabush Mines joint venture, and U.S. subsidiaries of Stelco (which have not filed for bankruptcy protection) own 14.7 percent of Hibbing Taconite Company Joint Venture and 15 percent of Tilden Mining Company L.C. Stelco has met its cash call requirements at the mining ventures to date. The premature closure of a mine due to the failure of a joint venture partner to perform its obligations could result in significant fixed mine closure costs, including severance, employment legacy costs and other employment costs, reclamation and other environmental costs, and the costs of terminating long term obligations, including energy contracts and equipment leases. Unanticipated geological conditions and natural disasters could increase the cost of operating our business. A portion of our production costs are fixed regardless of current operating levels. Our operating levels are subject to conditions beyond our control that can delay deliveries or increase the cost of mining at particular mines for varying lengths of time. These conditions include weather conditions (for example, extreme winter weather, floods and availability of process water due to drought) and natural disasters, pit wall failures, unanticipated geological conditions, including variations in the amount of rock and soil overlying the deposits of iron ore, variations in rock and other natural materials and variations in geologic conditions and ore processing changes. These conditions could impair our ability to fulfill our plan to operate all of our mines at full capacity, which could materially adversely affect our ability to meet the expected demand for our iron ore products. In the second and third quarters of 2003, pellet production at the Tilden mine was adversely affected by approximately ..3 million tons as a result of unexpected variations in the composition of the iron ore in one area of the mining pit, which made the ore difficult to process, causing low throughput and recovery rates. Many of our mines are dependent on a single source energy supplier, and interruption in energy services may have a significant adverse effect on our sales, margins and profitability. Many of our mines are dependent on one source for electric power and for natural gas. For example, Minnesota Power is the sole supplier of electric power to our Hibbing and United Taconite mines; Wisconsin Energy Corporation is the sole supplier of electric power to our Tilden and Empire mines; and our Northshore mine is largely dependent on its wholly owned power facility for its electrical supply. A significant interruption in service from our energy suppliers due to terrorism or any other cause can result in substantial losses that may not be fully covered by our business interruption insurance. For example, in May 2003, we incurred approximately $11.1 million in fixed costs relating to lost production when our Empire and Tilden mines were idled for approximately five weeks due to loss of power stemming from the failure of a dam in the Upper 50 Table of Contents Peninsula of Michigan. One natural gas pipeline serves all of our Minnesota and Michigan mines, and a pipeline failure may idle those operations. Any substantial unmitigated interruption of our business due to these conditions could materially adversely affect our sales, margins and profitability. Our mines and processing facilities have been in operation for several decades. Equipment failures and other unexpected events at our facilities may lead to production curtailments or shutdowns. Interruptions in production capabilities will inevitably increase our production costs and reduce our profitability. We do not have meaningful excess capacity for current production needs, and we are not able to quickly increase production at one mine to offset an interruption in production at another mine. In addition to equipment failures, our facilities are also subject to the risk of loss due to unanticipated events such as fires, explosions or adverse weather conditions. The manufacturing processes that take place in our mining operations, as well as in our crushing, concentrating and pelletizing facilities, depend on critical pieces of equipment, such as drilling and blasting equipment, crushers, grinding mills, pebble mills, thickeners, separators, filters, mixers, furnaces, kilns and rolling equipment, as well as electrical equipment, such as transformers. This equipment may, on occasion, be out of service because of unanticipated failures. In addition, many of our mines and processing facilities have been in operation for several decades, and the equipment is aged. For example, in November 2003, our Tilden facility experienced a crack in a kiln riding ring that required the shutdown of that kiln in its pelletizing plant, resulting in a production loss of approximately .3 million tons in 2003. In the future, we may experience additional material plant shutdowns or periods of reduced production because of equipment failures. Material plant shutdowns or reductions in operations could materially adversely affect our sales, margins and profitability. Further, remediation of any interruption in production capability may require us to make large capital expenditures that could have a negative effect on our profitability and cash flows. Our business interruption insurance would not cover all of the lost revenues associated with equipment failures. Further, longer term business disruptions could result in a loss of customers, which could adversely affect our future sales levels, and therefore our profitability. We are subject to extensive governmental regulation, which imposes, and will continue to impose, significant costs and liabilities on us, and future regulation could increase those costs and liabilities or limit our ability to produce iron ore products. We are subject to various federal, provincial, state and local laws and regulations on matters such as employee health and safety, air quality, water pollution, plant and wildlife protection, reclamation and restoration of mining properties, the discharge of materials into the environment, and the effects that mining has on groundwater quality and availability. Numerous governmental permits and approvals are required for our operations. We cannot assure you that we have been or will be at all times in complete compliance with such laws, regulations and permits. If we violate or fail to comply with these laws, regulations or permits, we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators. Prior to commencement of mining, we must submit to, and obtain approval from, the appropriate regulatory authority of plans showing where and how mining and reclamation operations are to occur. These plans must include information such as the location of mining areas, stockpiles, surface waters, haul roads, tailings basins and drainage from mining operations. All requirements imposed by any such authority may be costly and time consuming and may delay commencement or continuation of exploration or production operations. See Item 2. Properties. Environment. In addition, new legislation and or regulations and orders, including proposals related to the protection of the environment, to which we would be subject or that would further regulate and or tax our customers, namely the North American integrated steel producer customers, may also require us or our customers to reduce or otherwise change operations significantly or incur costs. Such new legislation, regulations or orders (if enacted) could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or profitability. In particular, we are subject to the new rules promulgated by the EPA that will require us to utilize MACT standards for our air emissions by 2006. The costs, including capital expenditures, that we will incur in order to meet the new MACT standards may be substantial. See Item 2. Properties. Environment. 51 Table of Contents Further, we are subject to a variety of potential liability exposures arising at certain sites where we do not currently conduct operations. These sites include sites where we formerly conducted iron ore mining or processing or other operations, inactive sites that we currently own, predecessor sites, acquired sites, leased land sites and third party waste disposal sites. While we believe our liability at sites where claims have been asserted will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations, we may be named as a responsible party at other sites in the future, and we cannot assure you that the costs associated with these additional sites will not be material. See Item 2. Properties. Environment. We also could be held liable for any and all consequences arising out of human exposure to hazardous substances used, released or disposed of by us or other environmental damage, including damage to natural resources. In particular, we and certain of our subsidiaries are involved in various claims relating to the exposure of asbestos and silica to seamen who sailed on the Great Lakes vessels formerly owned and operated by certain of our subsidiaries. The full impact of these claims, as well as whether insurance coverage will be sufficient and whether other defendants named in these claims will be able to fund any costs arising out of these claims, continues to be unknown. Based on currently available information, however, we believe the resolution of currently pending claims in the aggregate would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings. Our expenditures for post retirement benefit and pension obligations could be materially higher than we have predicted if our underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect, if there are mine closures or our joint venture partners fail to perform their obligations that relate to employee pension plans. We provide defined benefit pension plans and OPEB benefits to eligible union and non union employees, including our share of expense and funding obligations with respect to unconsolidated ventures. Our pension expense and our required contributions to our pension plans are directly affected by the value of plan assets, the projected rate of return on plan assets, the rate of return on plan assets and the actuarial assumptions we use to measure our defined benefit pension plan obligations, including the rate that future obligations are discounted to a present value (discount rate). We decreased the discount rate to 5.75 percent at December 31, 2004 from 6.25 percent at December 31, 2003, 6.90 percent at December 31, 2002 and 7.50 percent at December 31, 2001. For pension accounting purposes, we assumed a 8.5 percent rate of return on pension plan assets (9 percent for all periods prior to 2004). Based on these assumptions, our actual funding levels and pension expense for 2002, 2003 and 2004 and our estimated funding obligations and pension expense for 2005, including our share of expense and funding obligations with respect to unconsolidated ventures are as follows: Pension (In Millions) Year Expense Funding 2002 $ 7.2 $ 1.1 2003 32.0 6.4 2004 23.1 63.0 2005 (estimate) 19.1 33.9 We cannot predict whether changing market or economic conditions, regulatory changes or other factors will increase our pension expenses or our funding obligations, diverting funds we would otherwise apply to other uses. Further, our minimum funding projections in 2005 reflect our new four year agreements with the USWA to fund the multi employee pension plan covering hourly employees at the Empire and Tilden mines based on the significantly higher single employer plan formula for the duration of the contract. We calculate our total accumulated post retirement benefit obligation (APBO) for our OPEB benefits under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106, Employers Accounting for Post retirement Benefits Other Than Pensions. The unfunded APBO obligation had a present value of $242.7 million at December 31, 2004. We have calculated the unfunded obligation based on a number of assumptions. Discount 52 Table of Contents rate and return on plan asset assumptions parallel those utilized for pensions. We increased our assumed rate of annual increase in the cost of healthcare benefits to 10 percent for 2003 (from 7.50 percent in 2002) and assumed a one percent decrease per year for the following five years to five percent in 2008 and thereafter. We increased the assumed rate of annual increase in the cost of healthcare benefits again to 10 percent for 2004 and again assume a one percent decrease per year for the following five years, thereby delaying the decrease to five percent until 2009. We also contribute annually to trusts for certain mining ventures that are available to fund these liabilities, and we assume a 8.50 percent rate of return on the assets held in these trusts. We expect to contribute approximately $15.2 million to these trusts in 2005, based on production at the Empire, Hibbing, Tilden and United Taconite mines in 2004 and accelerated funding pursuant to bargaining agreements. We also implemented a cap on the amounts that we would pay per retiree annually for existing and future U.S. salaried retirees. Pursuant to the new four year labor agreements with the USWA, effective August 1, 2004, OPEB expense for 2004 decreased $4.9 million to reflect negotiated plan changes, which capped the Companys share of future bargaining unit retirees healthcare premiums at 2008 levels in 2009 and beyond. The agreements also provide that the Company and its partners fund an estimated $220 million into bargaining unit pension and retiree healthcare accounts during the four year term of the contracts. Year 2004 expense also reflects an estimated cost reduction of $4.1 million due to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003. Based on these assumptions and plan provisions, our actual expenses and funding for these benefits for 2002, 2003 and 2004 and estimated expense and funding requirements for 2005, including our share of expense and funding obligations with respect to unconsolidated ventures are as follows: OPEB (In Millions) Year Expense Funding* 2002 $ 21.5 $ 16.8 2003 29.1 17.0 2004 28.5 30.9 2005 (estimate) 21.8 35.2 * Includes direct benefit payments. If our assumptions do not materialize as expected, cash expenditures and costs that we incur could be materially higher. Moreover, we cannot assure that regulatory changes will not increase our obligations to provide these or additional benefits. These obligations also may increase substantially in the event of adverse medical cost trends or unexpected rates of early retirement, particularly for bargaining unit employees for whom there is no retiree healthcare cost cap. Early retirement rates likely would increase substantially in the event of a mine closure. Additionally, our pension and post retirement health and life insurance benefits obligations, expenses and funding costs would increase significantly if one or more of the mines in which we have invested is closed, or if one or more of our joint venturers at one or more mines is unable to perform its obligations. A mine closure would trigger accelerated pension and OPEB obligations, and the failure of a joint venturer to perform its obligations could shift additional pension and OPEB liabilities to us. Any of these events could significantly adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We are a related person to certain companies that were operators and are required under the Coal Industry Retiree Health Benefit Act of 1992 (the Coal Retiree Act) to make premium payments to the United Mine Workers Association Combined Benefit Fund (the Combined Fund), and our obligations to the Combined Fund could increase if other coal mine operators file for bankruptcy protection or become insolvent. We are a related party to certain companies that were coal mine operators. As a result we are subject to the Coal Retiree Act and are obligated to make premium payments to the Combined Fund for health and death benefits paid by the Combined Fund to retired coal miners. At December 31, 2004, the net present value 53 Table of Contents of our estimated liability to the Combined Fund was $6.4 million. We are assessed premiums for unassigned or orphan retirees on a pro rata basis with other coal mine operators and related parties. If other coal mine operators and related parties file for bankruptcy protection or become insolvent, our pro rata portion of the liability to the Combined Fund could increase, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operation and financial condition, sales, margins and profitability. Our profitability could be negatively affected if we fail to maintain satisfactory labor relations. The USWA represents all hourly employees at our Empire, Hibbing, Tilden and United Taconite mines, as well as Wabush Mines in Canada. A new four year labor agreement was reached in August 2004 with our U.S. labor force and a five year agreement that runs through March 2009 was reached with our Canadian work force. Hourly employees at the railroads we own that transport products among our facilities are represented by multiple unions with labor agreements that expire at various dates. If the collective bargaining agreements relating to the employees at our mines or railroads are not successfully renegotiated prior to this expiration, we could face work stoppages or labor strikes. The workforce at our Northshore mine is currently not represented by a union. Our operating expenses could increase significantly if the price of electrical power, fuel or other energy sources increases. Operating expenses at our mining locations are sensitive to changes in electricity prices and fuel prices, including diesel fuel and natural gas prices. Prices for electricity, natural gas and fuel oils can fluctuate widely with availability and demand levels from other users. During periods of peak usage, supplies of energy may be curtailed and we may not be able to purchase them at historical market rates. While we have some long term contracts with electrical suppliers, we are exposed to fluctuations in energy costs that can affect our production costs. Although we enter into forward fixed price supply contracts for natural gas for use in our operations, those contracts are of limited duration and do not cover all of our fuel needs, and price increases in fuel costs could cause our profitability to decrease significantly.
