Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview Cleveland Cliffs Inc (the Company, we, us, our, and Cliffs) is the largest producer of iron ore pellets in North America. We sell the majority of our pellets to integrated steel companies in the United States and Canada. We manage and operate six North American iron ore mines located in Michigan, Minnesota, and Eastern Canada that currently have a rated capacity of 37.5 million tons of iron ore pellet production annually, representing 45.9 percent of the current North American pellet production capacity. The other iron ore mines in the U.S. and Canada have an aggregate rated capacity of 22.9 million tons and 21.2 million tons, respectively. Based on our percentage ownership in the mines we operate, our share of the rated pellet production capacity is currently 23.0 million tons annually, representing approximately 28 percent of total North American annual pellet capacity. 36 Table of Contents On April 19, 2005, Cleveland Cliffs Australia Pty Limited (Cliffs Australia), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, completed the acquisition of 80.4 percent of Portman Limited (Portman), the third largest iron ore mining company in Australia. The acquisition was initiated on March 31, 2005 by the purchase of approximately 68.7 percent of the outstanding shares of Portman. Portman serves the Asian iron ore markets with direct shipping fines and lump ore from two iron ore projects, both located in Western Australia. Portmans full year 2005 production (excluding its .6 million metric ton (tonne) share of the 50 percent owned Cockatoo Island joint venture) was approximately 6.0 million tonnes. Portman currently has a $61 million project underway that is expected to increase its wholly owned production capacity to eight million tonnes per year by the end of the first quarter of 2006. The production is committed to steel companies in China and Japan for approximately four years. The Portman acquisition represents another significant milestone in our long term strategy to seek additional iron ore mine investment opportunities and to transition our Company from primarily a mine management company and mineral holder to an international merchant mining company. The purchase price for the 80.4 percent interest in Portman was $433.1 million, including $12.4 million of acquisition costs. Additionally, we incurred $9.8 million of foreign currency hedging costs related to the transaction, which were charged to operations in the first quarter of 2005. The acquisition and related costs were financed with existing cash and marketable securities and $175 million of interim borrowings under a new three year $350 million revolving credit facility. The outstanding balance was repaid in full on July 5, 2005. Our statement of consolidated financial position as of December 31, 2005, reflects the acquisition of Portman, effective March 31, 2005, under the purchase method of accounting. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed have been recorded at estimated fair values as of the acquisition date as determined by our management based on the information currently available. An appraisal of assets and liabilities has not yet been finalized, and is expected to be complete by March 31, 2006. While we do not expect any material changes, the purchase price allocation remains subject to revision through the allocation period ending in the first quarter of 2006. A significant portion of the purchase price was allocated to iron ore reserves, which will be depleted on a unit of production basis over the productive life of the reserve. As a result of the Portman acquisition, we now operate in two reportable segments: the North American segment and the Australian segment, also referred to as Portman. Prior to 2002, we primarily held a minority interest in the mines we managed, with the majority interest in each mine held by various North American steel companies. Our earnings were principally comprised of royalties and management fees paid by the partnerships, along with sales of our equity share of the mine pellet production. Faced with marked deterioration in the financial condition of many of our partners and customers, we embarked on a strategy to reposition ourselves from a manager of iron ore mines on behalf of steel company partners to primarily a merchant of iron ore through increasing our ownership interests in our managed mines. Our successful navigation of numerous customer and partner bankruptcies and the corresponding consolidation of the industry in recent years have resulted in our emerging with new long term supply agreements, at more favorable pricing, with steel company partners and customers that are financially stronger than their predecessors. One premier example is the former International Steel Group, Inc. (ISG), which consolidated several bankrupt steel companies. In 2002, we invested $13.0 million in ISG to support its acquisition of bankrupt LTV Corporations idled steelmaking assets, receiving a seven percent stake in return. We also entered into a 15 year term sales agreement to supply all of ISGs pellet requirements for its Cleveland and Indiana Harbor plants. Later in 2002, we invested another $4.4 million to support ISGs acquisition of the steelmaking assets of Acme Metals Incorporated (Acme) and invested another $10.7 million of pension trust assets in 2003 to support ISGs acquisition of Bethlehem Steel Corporations (Bethlehem) assets. In conjunction with its acquisition of Bethlehem, ISG acquired Bethlehems 62.3 percent equity interest in the Hibbing Taconite Company Joint Venture (Hibbing). Through these investments, we received 5.9 million shares (5.1 million shares of directly held and .8 million shares held in 37 Table of Contents our pension trust) in return for our original investment. In 2004, we realized a $152.7 million pre tax ($99.3 million after tax) gain on the sale of our 5.1 million shares of directly held ISG common stock. Also in 2004, ISG acquired the bankrupt assets of Weirton Steel Corporation (Weirton) and Georgetown Steel Corporation. In conjunction with its acquisition of Weirton, ISG assumed our term supply agreement with Weirton with some modifications. ISG agreed to merge with Mittal Steel Company N.V. (Mittal), the parent company of Ispat Inland Inc. (Ispat), in 2005, resulting in the worlds largest steel company. Effective January 3, 2006, Ispat was merged with and into Mittal Steel USA ISG Inc. and renamed Mittal Steel USA Inc. (Mittal Steel USA). In 2004, we also significantly improved our liquidity initially through our January, 2004 offering of $172.5 million of redeemable cumulative convertible perpetual preferred stock. The proceeds from the issuance were utilized to repay the remaining $25 million balance of our unsecured notes and to fund $76.1 million into our underfunded salaried and hourly pension funds and retiree healthcare accounts (VEBAs). Additionally, the proceeds from the sale of ISG stock and cash flow from operations provided us with the liquidity for capital expenditures to maintain and expand our production capacity and to complete the acquisition of Portman. We intend to continue to pursue investment and operations management opportunities to broaden our scope as a supplier of iron ore to the integrated steel industry through the acquisition of additional mining interests to strengthen our market position. We are particularly focused on expanding our international investments to capitalize on global demand for steel and iron ore. Our strategic redirection and acceptance of additional risks of increased mine ownership followed by significant increases in iron ore demand and pricing culminated in record operating income in 2004 and again in 2005, solid financial condition, and a strong base for future growth. Our share of North American production in 2005 was a record 22.1 million tons. Mine operating costs on a per ton basis increased by approximately 14 percent in 2005 versus 2004 primarily due to higher energy, supply pricing and royalties. From a safety standpoint, 2005 was the second best safety performance in the companys 158 year history at 2.56 per 200,000 employee hours worked as defined by the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) for total reportable incidents. According to MSHA, the industry frequency rate for total reportable incidents for U.S. mines, mills and shops (excluding coal) was 3.96 per 200,000 employee hours worked in 2005. Our frequency rate for lost time incidents in 2005 was the best in company history at 1.3 per 200,000 employee hours worked. Unfortunately, during the year a tragic accident occurred at one of the Michigan mining operations when an employee was fatally injured while working at the production plant. At the Koolyanobbing operation, the Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (LTIFR) for the year was 4.0, which is slightly below the Australian metalliferous open pit mining industry average of 4.1. During 2005, four Lost Time Injuries (LTIs) were recorded at the Koolyanobbing operation, regrettably including one fatality. At Cockatoo Island, two LTIs were incurred, resulting in a LTIFR of 7.29 for the year. Portmans safety statistics include employees and contractors. Our operating objectives are to maximize safe production, efficiency and productivity at our mines. All of the mines and processing facilities have been in existence for several decades and are energy and labor intensive operations. Energy comprises approximately 27 percent of our mine production costs. We continue to strive for employment productivity improvements to offset rising energy and employee medical and legacy costs. Employees at the Empire Iron Mining Partnership (Empire) and Tilden Mining Company L.C. (Tilden) in Michigan and Hibbing Taconite and United Taconite mines in Minnesota, represented by the United Steelworkers of America (USWA), ratified four year labor agreements that are comparable to other USWA contracts in the industry. The agreements provide for wage increases and additional funding into employee pension plans and VEBAs in exchange for employees and future retirees sharing in healthcare insurance costs and certain other provisions that will continue to improve productivity. (See Labor Contracts.) 38 Table of Contents Two for One Stock Split On November 9, 2004, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a two for one stock split of its Common Shares with a corresponding decrease in par value from $1.00 to $.50. The record date for the stock split was December 15, 2004 with a distribution date of December 31, 2004. Accordingly, all Common Shares, per share amounts, stock compensation plans and preferred stock conversion rates have been adjusted retroactively to reflect the stock split. Additionally, all diluted per share amounts reflect the as if converted effect of the Companys convertible preferred stock as required by Emerging Issues Task Force Consensus 04 8, The Effect of Contingently Convertible Instruments on Dilute Earnings per Share. Key Operating and Financial Indicators Following is a summary of the Companys key operating and financial indicators for the years 2005, 2004 and 2003: 2005 2004 2003 North American Pellet Sales (Million Tons) 22.3 22.6 19.2 Australian Iron Ore Sales (Million Tonnes) 4.9 Revenues from Iron Ore Sales and Services (Millions)* $ 1,512.2 $ 995.0 $ 686.8 Pellet Production (Million Tons) Total 35.9 34.4 30.3 Companys Share 22.1 21.7 18.1 Australian Iron Ore Production (Million Tonnes) 5.2 Sales Margin (Loss) (Millions) North America $ 358.6 $ 149.5 $ (9.9 ) Australia $ 30.4 Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations Amount (Millions) $ 273.2 $ 320.2 $ (34.9 ) Per Share (Diluted) $ 9.81 $ 11.68 $ (1.70 ) Net Income (Loss) Amount (Millions) $ 277.6 $ 323.6 $ (32.7 ) Per Share (Diluted) $ 9.97 $ 11.80 $ (1.60 ) * The Company also received revenues of $227.3 million, $208.1 million and $138.3 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, related to freight and venture partners cost reimbursements. North American iron ore pellet sales decreased .3 million tons from the previous record of 22.6 million tons sold in 2004. The sales decrease primarily reflected a slowdown in the North American steel industry in mid 2005 brought on by production reductions at North American steel companies undertaken to mitigate lower global steel pricing. Iron ore pellet production for our account increased .4 million tons largely due to the full year production at United Taconite, which was acquired in December 2003, and higher production at all mines except Empire and Northshore. Our increase in 2005 North American sales margin from 2004 was principally due to an increase in sales prices partially offset by higher production costs and lower volume. The increase in sales prices reflected the effect on term sales contract escalators of higher steel prices, an increase in international pellet prices, and higher Producers Price Indices (PPI). Production costs were adversely affected by higher energy and supply pricing, increased maintenance costs and higher royalty rates due to increased pellet sales pricing. On a year over year basis, these factors were partly offset by the fixed cost effect of a 14 week labor stoppage at Wabush Mines (Wabush) in the third quarter of 2004, the impact of a weaker U.S. dollar on our share of Wabush production costs, and costs incurred related to 2004 U.S. labor negotiations. Portmans sales of lump ore and fines were 4.9 million tonnes since the acquisition. Iron ore production was 4.7 million tonnes, excluding .5 million tonnes at Cockatoo Island, since the acquisition. 39 Table of Contents Our business is affected by a number of factors, which are described in detail under Item 1A. Risk Factors. As we have increased our role as a merchant of iron ore to steel company customers, we have become more dependent on the revenues from our term supply agreements. Because our agreements are largely requirements contracts, those revenues are heavily dependent on customer consumption of iron ore. Customer requirements may be affected by increased use of iron ore substitutes, including imported semi finished steel, customer rationalization or financial failure, and decreased North American steel production resulting from increased imports or lower steel consumption. Further, our North American sales are concentrated with relatively few customers. Unmitigated loss of sales would have a significantly greater impact on operating results and cash flow than revenue, due to the high level of fixed costs in the iron ore mining business and the high cost to idle or close mines. In the event of a venture participants failure to perform, remaining solvent venturers, including us, may be required to assume additional fixed costs and record additional material obligations. The premature closure of a mine due to the loss of a significant customer or the failure of a joint venture participant would accelerate substantial employment and mine shutdown costs. Results of Operations Following is a summary of results for 2005, 2004 and 2003: (In Millions) 2005 2004 2003 Income (loss) from continuing operations(a) $ 273.2 $ 320.2 $ (34.9 ) Income (loss) from discontinuing operations(b) (.8 ) 3.4 Income (loss) before extraordinary gain and cumulative effect of accounting changes(b) 272.4 323.6 (34.9 ) Extraordinary gain(b) 2.2 Cumulative effect of accounting changes(c) 5.2 Net income (loss) amount $ 277.6 $ 323.6 $ (32.7 ) per share basic(d) $ 12.52 $ 14.94 $ (1.60 ) per share diluted $ 9.97 $ 11.80 $ (1.60 ) Average number of shares (in thousands) basic 21,728 21,308 20,512 diluted(e) 27,836 27,421 20,512 (a) Includes charges for impairments of mining assets of $5.8 million in 2004 and $2.6 million in 2003, an after tax gain on sale of ISG common stock, $99.3 million in 2004, and reversals of deferred tax asset valuation allowances of $8.9 million and $113.8 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively. (b) Net of tax and minority interest. (c) Net of tax. (d) Adjusted for preferred dividend effect of $5.6 million and $5.3 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively. (e) Includes 5.578 and 5.566 million shares in 2005 and 2004, respectively for the weighted average of as if converted convertible preferred. 2005 Versus 2004 The decrease in net income primarily reflected last years after tax gain of $99.3 million ($152.7 million pre tax) on the sale of all directly held ISG stock and the fourth quarter 2004 reversal of $113.8 million of deferred tax asset valuation allowance, largely offset by higher North American sales margins and the inclusion of earnings from Portman since March 31, 2005, when we acquired a controlling interest. 40 Table of Contents The $47.0 million decrease in income from continuing operations reflected higher income taxes of $119.8 and $10.1 million of income attributable to the minority interest owners of Portman, partially offset by higher income before income taxes and minority interest of $82.9 million. The pre tax earnings increase from 2004 principally reflected higher North American sales margins of $209.1 million and the inclusion of Portmans sales margin of $30.4 million since the March 31, 2005 acquisition partially offset by last years gain on the sale of ISG common stock of $152.7 million. Following is a summary of the sales margin: (In Millions) Increase (Decrease) 2005 2004 Amount Percent North American iron ore pellet sales (tons) 22.3 22.6 (.3 ) (1.3 )% Australian iron ore sales (tonnes) 4.9 4.9 N/M Revenues from iron ore sales and services $ 1,512.2 $ 995.0 $ 517.2 52.0 % Cost of goods sold and operating expenses Excluding production curtailments 1,123.2 840.3 282.9 33.7 Costs of production curtailments 5.2 (5.2 ) (100.0 ) Total Costs 1,123.2 845.5 277.7 32.8 Sales margin $ 389.0 $ 149.5 $ 239.5 160.2 % North American Iron Ore Revenues from Iron Ore Sales and Services Sales revenue (excluding freight and venture partners cost reimbursements) increased $312.7 million or 31 percent. The increase in sales revenue was due to higher sales prices, $328.0 million, partially offset by a sales volume decrease of $15.3 million. The 33 percent increase in sales prices primarily reflected the effect on Cliffs term sales contract price adjustment factors of an approximate 86 percent increase in international pellet pricing, higher steel pricing, higher PPI and other contractual increases, including base price increases and lag year adjustments. Included in 2005 revenues was approximately ..9 million tons of 2005 sales at 2004 contract prices and $2.4 million of price adjustments on 2004 sales. Cost of Goods Sold and Operating Expenses Cost of goods sold and operating expenses (excluding freight and venture partners costs) increased $103.6 million from 2004. The increase primarily reflected higher unit production costs of $116.6 million. Lower sales volume reduced costs $13.0 million. The increases in unit production costs included higher energy pricing, $50.4 million; increased maintenance costs, $18.7 million; higher supply prices, $16.6 million; and higher royalty rates, $13.2 million, due to increased pellet sales pricing. Production costs in 2004 were impacted by the labor stoppage at Wabush in the third quarter of 2004 of $5.2 million, a $3.4 million exchange rate effect due to the impact of a weaker U.S. dollar on our share of Wabush production costs, and $3.0 million related to 2004 U.S. labor negotiations. Sales Margin The sales margin improvement of $209.1 million in 2005 was principally due to an increase in sales price, partially offset by lower volume and higher production costs. Australian Iron Ore Revenues from Iron Ore Sales and Services Sales revenue of $204.5 million on 4.9 million tonnes of Portmans sales reflects results since the March 31, 2005, acquisition. Sales revenues for the nine month period represent a record for Portman. At 41 Table of Contents acquisition, Portman had currency derivatives used to hedge its currency exposure for a portion of its sales receipts denominated in U.S. dollars. Although Portman carried a hedge reserve, the reserve was not recognized in the allocation of purchase price. Pre acquisition contracts, with a fair value of $13.0 million, therefore, are expensed upon delivery. Through December 31, 2005, $9.8 million of hedge contracts were settled and recognized as a reduction of revenues. Cost of Goods Sold and Operating Expenses Cost of goods sold and operating expenses of $174.1 million for the nine month period reflected the recognition of $38.6 million of basis adjustments to inventory and mineral rights due to the preliminary allocation of the $433.1 million purchase price. We continue to refine our purchase accounting developed with the assistance of an outside consultant. The current allocation of the 80.4 percent interest in Portman allocated $23.1 million to product and work in process inventories, of which approximately $19.9 million has been included in cost of goods sold through December 31, 2005. Most of the $3.2 million remaining inventory step up is expected to be expensed prior to the end of 2006. The $18.7 million balance of the basis adjustments principally reflected increased depletion of mineral rights. Sales Margin The sales margin of $30.4 million on 4.9 million tonnes of Portmans sales reflects results since the March 31, 2005 acquisition. Other Operating Income The pre tax earnings changes for 2005 versus the comparable 2004 period also included: A business interruption insurance recovery of $12.3 million related to a five week production curtailment at the Empire and Tilden mines in 2003 due to the loss of electric power as a result of flooding in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Future recoveries may be forthcoming from a claim for reimbursement of insurance deductibles through subrogation. Higher royalties and management fee revenue of $1.8 million, primarily reflecting higher Wabush management fees due to the approximate 86 percent increase in Eastern Canadian pellet prices. Higher administrative, selling and general expense of $14.8 million reflecting higher stock based compensation and the inclusion of $5.5 million of Portmans 2005 expense since the March 31, 2005 acquisition. Lower impairment of mining asset charges, $5.8 million. Due primarily to the significant increase in 2005 pellet pricing, we have determined, based on a cash flow analysis, that our Empire mine is no longer impaired; accordingly, capital additions at Empire in 2005 were not charged to expense. Provision for customer bankruptcy exposures, $3.6 million. Results for 2005 included a $1.9 million recovery from WCI Steel Inc. (WCI). Results for 2004 included a first quarter charge related to a subsidiary of Weirton, $1.6 million. Miscellaneous net expense, $9.1 million higher than the same period last year. Miscellaneous net includes $5.2 million to clean a PCB spill at the Tilden mine in November 2005, and $1.9 million of expense at Portman since the March 31 acquisition. Other Income (Expense) Last years results included a $152.7 million gain on the sale of directly held ISG common stock. A 2005 gain of $9.5 million on the sale of certain assets to PolyMet Mining Inc. (PolyMet). (See Other Related Items PolyMet). Increased interest income of $2.4 million reflecting higher average cash and short term marketable securities balances and slightly higher rates. 42 Table of Contents Increased interest expense of $3.7 million includes $2.0 million of interest expense at Portman since the March 31 acquisition, and interim borrowings in 2005 under Cliffs new $350 million revolving credit facility to supplement funds required for the Portman acquisition. Higher other net expense of $11.5 million primarily reflected $9.8 million of currency hedging costs associated with the Portman acquisition. Income Taxes We entered 2005 with a valuation allowance to reduce a deferred tax asset related to $25.4 million of net operating losses attributable to pre consolidation separate return years of one of our subsidiaries. In the fourth quarter of 2005, we determined, based on the existence of sufficient evidence, that we no longer required this valuation allowance. During 2005, an $8.9 million adjustment to reverse this valuation allowance was recognized. However, through our acquisition of Portman, we acquired a deferred tax asset of $11.1 million related to capital loss carryforwards with a corresponding $11.1 million deferred tax asset valuation allowance due to uncertainty about utilization of these carryforwards. In the fourth quarter of 2004, we determined, based on the existence of sufficient evidence, that we no longer required a valuation allowance other than $8.9 million related to net operating loss carryforwards described above. During 2004, a $113.8 million adjustment to reduce the valuation allowance was recognized. Excluding the $8.9 million and $113.8 million valuation reversals in 2005 and 2004, respectively, income tax expense of $93.7 million in 2005 was $14.9 million higher than the comparable amount last year. The increase was due to higher pre tax income in 2005, partially offset by a lower effective tax rate. Discontinued Operations Our arrangements with C.V.G. Ferrominera Orinoco C.A. of Venezuela (Ferrominera), a government owned company responsible for the development of Venezuelas iron ore industry, to provide technical assistance in support of improving operations of a 3.3 million tonne per year pelletizing facility were terminated in the third quarter of 2005. We recorded after tax expense of $1.7 million related to this contract in 2005. On July 23, 2004, Cliffs and Associates Limited (CAL), an affiliate of the Company jointly owned by a subsidiary of the Company (82.3945 percent) and Outokumpu Technology GmbH (17.6055 percent), a German company (formerly known as Lurgi Metallurgie GmbH), completed the sale of CALs Hot Briquette Iron (HBI) facility located in Trinidad and Tobago to ISG. Terms of the sale included a purchase price of $8.0 million plus assumption of liabilities. CAL may receive up to $10 million in future payments contingent on HBI production and shipments. In 2005, we received payments totaling $.6 million and at December 31, 2005, we have a receivable balance of $.5 million. Mittal Steel USA closed this facility at the end of 2005 and it is unlikely we will receive further payments related to this transaction. We recorded after tax income of approximately $.9 million in 2005. 2004 Versus 2003 The increase in net income reflected higher North American sales margins and a $152.7 million pre tax gain on the sale of directly held ISG common stock. The increase in net income also included a $3.4 million increase in after tax income related to discontinued operations and a $2.2 million after tax extraordinary gain related to the United Taconite acquisition of the Eveleth mine assets in December 2003. 43 Table of Contents The $355.1 million increase in income from continuing operations reflected improved pre tax results of $320.4 million and an increase in the income tax credit of $34.7 million. The increased tax credit in 2004 reflected a $113.8 million reversal of deferred tax valuation allowance partly offset by the current years tax provision. Included in the pre tax increase of $320.4 million was $152.7 million relating to a gain on sale of directly held ISG common stock and higher sales margins of $159.4 million. Following is a summary of the sales margin: (In Millions) Increase (Decrease) 2004 2003 Amount Percent Iron ore pellet sales (tons) 22.6 19.2 3.4 18% Revenues from iron ore sales and services* $ 995.0 $ 686.8 $ 308.2 45% Cost of goods sold and operating expenses* Excluding production curtailments 840.3 685.6 154.7 22.6 Costs of production curtailments 5.2 11.1 (5.9 ) (53.2) Total Costs 845.5 696.7 148.8 21.4 Sales margin (loss) $ 149.5 $ (9.9 ) $ 159.4 N/M * The Company also received revenues and recognized expenses of $208.1 million and $138.3 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively, for freight charges paid on behalf of customers and cost reimbursement from venture partners. Revenues from Iron Ore Sales and Services Sales revenue (excluding freight and venture partners cost reimbursements) increased $308.2 million or 45 percent. The increase in sales revenue was due to higher sales prices and the 3.4 million ton, or 18 percent, increase in pellet sales volume in 2004. The 22.6 million tons sold in 2004 was a record, surpassing the previous record of 19.2 million tons sold in 2003. The increase in sales price realization resulted from term sales contract escalators, primarily higher steel prices and an approximate 20 percent increase in international pellet prices. Cost of Goods Sold and Operating Expenses Cost of goods sold and operating expenses increased $148.8 million, or 21 percent, from 2003, principally due to higher sales and production volume of $122.8 million, increased energy and supply pricing of $19.9 million, the fixed cost effect of a 14 week labor stoppage at Wabush in third quarter 2004 of $5.2 million, a $3.4 million exchange rate effect due to the impact of a weaker U.S. dollar on our share of Wabush production costs, and $3.0 million related to 2004 U.S. labor negotiations. Operating costs in 2003 included an $11.1 million fixed cost impact caused by a five week production curtailment at the Empire and Tilden mines relating to the loss of electric power due to flooding in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Sales Margin The sales margin improvement of $159.4 million in 2004 was principally due to an increase in sales prices and volume, and was partially offset by higher production costs. Other Operating Income The pre tax earnings changes for 2004 versus the comparable 2003 period also included: Higher royalties and management fee revenue of $.7 million, primarily reflecting higher Wabush management fees and management fees from United Taconite production. 44 Table of Contents Higher administrative, selling and general expense of $8.0 million reflecting higher stock based and incentive compensation of $8.5 million. Higher impairment of mining asset charges, $3.2 million. Empires long lived assets were impaired in 2002. Approximately $2.2 million of the 2004 Empire fixed asset additions were related to an increase in the asset retirement obligation reflecting a one year decrease in the estimated mine life due to a change in annual production levels. Lower provision for customer bankruptcy exposures, $5.9 million, related to the Weirton and WCI Steel Inc. bankruptcies. Miscellaneous net expense, $2.2 million lower than the same period last year. The decrease primarily reflected lower coal retiree expense of $1.6 million, decreased business development cost of $1.0 million, and debt restructuring fees in 2003 of $.8 million partially offset by lower rental income of $.9 million. Restructuring Charge In third quarter 2003, we initiated a salaried reduction program as part of our cost reduction initiatives. The action resulted in a reduction of 136 staff employees at our corporate, central services and various mining operations, which represented an approximate 20 percent decrease in salaried workforce at our U.S. operations (prior to the acquisition of United Taconite). Accordingly, we recorded a restructuring charge of $8.7 million in 2003, which included non cash pension and OPEB obligations of $6.2 million and one time severance benefits of $2.5 million. Less than $1.6 million required cash funding in 2003, leaving a remaining severance liability of approximately $.9 million at December 31, 2003. In 2004, we expended $.7 million and recorded a credit of $.2 million in satisfaction of the obligation. Other Income (Expense) Interest expense decreased $3.8 million from 2003. The decrease principally reflected the repayment of our senior unsecured notes in January 2004. Other income of $4.2 million in 2004 was $2.9 million less than in 2003. The decrease primarily related to non strategic Michigan land sales in 2003. Income Taxes Through the third quarter of 2004, we maintained a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax asset in recognition of uncertainty regarding utilization. In the fourth quarter of 2004, we determined, based on the existence of sufficient evidence, that we no longer required a valuation allowance other than $8.9 million related to net operating loss carryforwards of $25.4 million that will begin to expire in 2021, which are attributable to pre consolidation separate return years of one of our subsidiaries. As a result, a $113.8 million adjustment to reduce the valuation allowance was recognized. Excluding the $113.8 million valuation reversal, income tax expense in 2004 of $78.9 million was $79.2 higher than 2003 principally reflecting higher pre tax income. Discontinued Operations We recorded after tax income of $3.1 million related to CAL in 2004. The gain is classified under Discontinued Operations in the Statement of Consolidated Operations. Income in 2004 from Ferrominera, whose operations were terminated in the third quarter of 2005, was $.3 million. 45 Table of Contents Cash Flow and Liquidity At December 31, 2005, we had cash and cash equivalents of $192.8 million, including $54.7 million at Portman. Following is a summary of 2005 cash flow activity: (In Millions) Investment in Portman (net of $24.1 million cash acquired) $ (409.0 ) Capital expenditures (106.3 ) Dividends common and preferred stock (18.7 ) Payment of currency hedges (9.8 ) Net cash from operating activities 514.6 Other 7.3 Decrease in cash and cash equivalents from continuing operations (21.9 ) Cash used by discontinued operations (2.2 ) Decrease in cash and cash equivalents $ (24.1 ) Following is a summary of key liquidity measures: At December 31 (In Millions) 2005 2004 2003 Cash and cash equivalents $ 192.8 $ 216.9 $ 67.8 Marketable securities trading $ 9.9 $ 182.7 Debt $ (7.7 ) $ (25.0 ) Working capital $ 273.3 $ 474.3 $ 97.2 Net cash from operating activities of $514.6 million included $68.3 million related to Portman. Included in net cash from operating activities is a $172.8 million net decrease in short term marketable securities, classified as trading, which we utilize to increase our rate of return on short term funds. The $172.8 million net decrease in marketable securities primarily reflects the proceeds from the sale of $182.7 million of highly liquid marketable securities used in connection with our acquisition of Portman, net of $9.9 million purchases of investments with 35 day auction reset dates. The Company invests in auction rate securities to provide higher short term returns than traditional money market investments with minimal risk of loss of capital. Cash flow from operations also reflects $86.2 million of income tax payments, $55.8 million of contributions to pension plans and VEBAs and $70.6 million of excess electric power company payments pending the outcome of an arbitration of our dispute with Wisconsin Electric Power Companys (WEPCO) unilateral increase in the electric power energy rates it charges to the Empire and Tilden mines under the terms of existing electric power agreements between the parties. Approximately $67.6 million of power payments are recoverable in early 2006; however, we have been advised by WEPCO that they will oppose any release of these recoverable amounts from the escrow until completion of the arbitration. (See Wisconsin Electric Power Company Dispute.) At December 31, 2005, there were 3.3 million tons of pellets in inventory, approximately the same as last year, at a cost of $105.3 million, or a decrease of $3.0 million from December 31, 2004. At December 31, 2005, Portman had .6 million tonnes of finished product inventory at a cost of $13.8 million. On March 28, 2005, we entered into a $350 million unsecured credit agreement with a syndicate of 13 financial institutions. The new facility provides $350 million in borrowing capacity under a revolving credit line, with a choice of interest rates and maturities subject to the three year term of the agreement. The $350 million credit agreement replaced an existing $30 million unsecured revolving credit facility, which was scheduled to expire on April 29, 2005. The new facility has various financial covenants based on earnings, debt, total capitalization, and fixed cost coverage. Interest rates range from LIBOR plus 1.25 percent to 46 Table of Contents LIBOR plus 2.0 percent, based on debt and earnings, or the prime rate. We were in compliance with the covenants in the credit agreement as of December 31, 2005. Portman is party to a A$40 million credit agreement. The facility has various covenants based on earnings, asset ratios and fixed cost coverage. The floating interest rate is 80 basis points over the 90 day bank bill swap rate in Australia. Under this facility, Portman has remaining borrowing capacity of A$29.0 million at December 31, 2005, after reduction of A$11.0 million for commitments under outstanding performance bonds. Portman was in compliance with its debt covenants as of December 31, 2005. Portman secured five year financing from its customers in China as part of its long term supply agreements to assist with the funding of the expansion of its Koolyanobbing mining operation. The borrowings, totaling $7.7 million, accrue interest annually at five percent. The borrowings require a $.8 million principal payment plus accrued interest to be made each January 31 for the next four years with the remaining balance due in full in January 2010. We anticipate that our share of capital expenditures related to the iron ore business, which was $107.9 million in 2005, will increase to approximately $174 million in 2006. We expect to fund our capital expenditures from available cash and current operations. The anticipated increase in capital expenditures is primarily due to the capacity expansion to eight million tonnes at the Koolyanobbing operation, $41.3 million and approximately $15 million for the Mesabi Nugget Project. (See Other Related Items Mesabi Nugget Project). Issuance of Preferred Stock In January 2004, we completed an offering of $172.5 million of redeemable cumulative convertible perpetual preferred stock, without par value, issued at $1,000 per share. The preferred stock pays quarterly cash dividends at a rate of 3.25 percent per annum, has a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share and is convertible into our common shares at an adjusted rate of 32.3354 common shares (32.6652 at February 17, 2006) per share of preferred stock, which is equivalent to an adjusted conversion price of $30.93 per share at December 31, 2005 ($30.61 at February 17, 2006), subject to further adjustment in certain circumstances. Each share of preferred stock may be converted by the holder if during any fiscal quarter ending after March 31, 2004 the closing sale price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days in a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the preceding quarter exceeds 110 percent of the applicable conversion price on such trading day ($34.02 at December 31, 2005; this threshold was met as of December 31, 2005). The satisfaction of this condition allows conversion of the preferred stock during the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2006 only. Holders of preferred stock may also convert: (1) if during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per share of preferred stock for each day of that period was less than 98 percent of the product of the closing sale price of our common stock and the applicable conversion rate on each such day; (2) upon the occurrence of certain corporate transactions; or (3) if the preferred stock has been called for redemption. On or after January 20, 2009, we, at our option, may redeem some or all of the preferred stock at a redemption price equal to 100 percent of the liquidation preference, plus accumulated but unpaid dividends, but only if the closing price exceeds 135 percent of the conversion price, subject to adjustment, for 20 trading days within a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the trading day before the date we give the redemption notice. We may also exchange the preferred stock for convertible subordinated debentures in certain circumstances. We have reserved approximately 5.6 million common treasury shares for possible future issuance for the conversion of the preferred stock. Our shelf registration statement with respect to the resale of the preferred stock, the convertible subordinated debentures that we may issue in exchange for the preferred stock and the common shares issuable upon conversion of the preferred stock and the convertible subordinated debentures was declared effective by the SEC on July 22, 2004. The Company is no longer contractually obligated to maintain the effectiveness of the registration statement due to the expiration of the effectiveness period. Accordingly, on February 14, 2006, the Company deregistered 92,655 shares of Preferred Stock, $172,500,000 in aggregate principal amount of debentures and approximately 5.6 million common shares that have not been resold. The preferred stock is classified as temporary equity reflecting certain provisions of the agreement that could, under remote circumstances, require us to redeem the preferred stock for cash. The net proceeds after offering 47 Table of Contents expenses were approximately $166 million. A portion of the proceeds was utilized to repay the remaining outstanding $25.0 million in principal amount of our senior unsecured notes in the first quarter of 2004. We also used approximately $63.0 million to fund our underfunded pension plans and contributed $13.1 million to our VEBAs in 2004. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations Other than operating leases primarily utilized for certain equipment and office space, we do not have any off balance sheet financing. Following is a summary of our contractual obligations at December 31, 2005: Payments due by Period(1) (Millions) Less than More than Contractual Obligations Total 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years 5 Years Long term debt $ 7.7 $ .8 $ 1.5 $ 5.4 $ Capital Lease Obligations 41.2 5.9 10.1 7.0 18.2 Operating Leases 41.3 14.8 15.8 8.4 2.3 Purchase Obligations Open Purchase Orders 94.6 93.5 .8 .3 Minimum Take or Pay Purchase Commitments(2) 460.9 124.7 134.7 106.6 94.9 Total Purchase Obligations 555.5 218.2 135.5 106.9 94.9 Other Long Term Liabilities Pension Funding Minimums 180.2 46.0 80.7 21.0 32.5 OPEB Claim Payments 231.7 37.6 58.3 57.6 78.2 Mine Closure Obligations 95.1 3.5 19.9 3.7 68.0 Coal Industry Retiree Health Benefits 6.5 .6 1.4 1.2 3.3 Personal Injury 16.5 4.9 5.9 1.9 3.8 Other(3) 192.8 Total Other Long Term Liabilities 722.8 92.6 166.2 85.4 185.8 Total $ 1,368.5 $ 332.3 $ 329.1 $ 213.1 $ 301.2 (1) Includes our consolidated obligations and our ownership share of unconsolidated ventures obligations. (2) Includes minimum electric power demand charges, minimum coal and natural gas obligations, and minimum railroad transportation obligations. (3) Primarily includes deferred income taxes payable and other contingent liabilities for which payment timing is non determinable. Operations and Customers Sales Our pellet sales for the year 2005 were 22.3 million tons which is the second highest volume ever, surpassed only by last years record sales of 22.6 million tons. The decrease in pellet sales was primarily due to a slowdown in the North American steel industry in the middle of 2005. We ended the year 2005 with 3.3 million tons of iron ore pellet inventory, approximately the same as last year. Our 2006 North American sales volume is projected to be approximately 21 million tons. We are largely committed under term supply agreements, which are subject to changes in customer requirements. Portman sold 4.9 million tonnes of lump and fine ore since the acquisition and ended the year with .6 million tonnes of finished goods inventory. Portmans 2006 sales volume is projected to be 7.9 million tonnes, reflecting the project to increase capacity at the wholly owned Koolyanobbing operation to eight million tonnes per annum. The production is fully committed to steel companies in China and Japan for 48 Table of Contents approximately four years. Revenue per tonne is driven under annual benchmark prices between the major seaborne suppliers and the Chinese and Japanese steel mills. Customers Mittal Steel USA On December 17, 2004, Ispat International N.V. completed its acquisition of LNM Holdings N.V. to form Mittal. On April 13, 2005, Mittal completed its acquisition of ISG, subsequently renamed Mittal Steel USA. At the time of the acquisition of ISG, the Company had three different sales contracts with steel companies that became part of Mittal Steel USA: Ispat. Ispat was a wholly owned subsidiary of Ispat International N.V. On December 31, 2002, we entered into a Pellet Sale and Purchase Agreement with Ispat (the Ispat Contract), which provides that we are the sole outside supplier of iron ore pellets to Ispat. The Ispat Contract runs through January 2015. Mittal ISG. We entered into a Pellet Sale and Purchase Agreement with ISG on April 10, 2002, which runs through 2016 (the ISG Contract), under which we are the sole supplier of iron ore pellets for the former ISGs Cleveland and Indiana Harbor Works. The ISG Contract was subsequently amended in December 2004. Mittal Steel Weirton (formerly Weirton). Prior to the acquisition of ISG by Mittal, ISG had acquired Weirton, which was in chapter 11 bankruptcy at the time. The Company was one of two suppliers of iron ore pellets to Weirton. At the time of ISGs acquisition of Weirton, we entered into an Amended and Restated Pellet Sale and Purchase Agreement dated May 17, 2004, with both ISG and Weirton (the Weirton Contract). The Weirton Contract runs through 2018. In December 2005, Mittal merged Ispat into Mittal Steel USA and Mittal Steel USA assumed Ispats obligations under the Ispat Contract. Mittal Steel USA is a 62.3 percent equity participant in Hibbing and a 21 percent equity partner in Empire. During 2005, our North American pellet sales totaled approximately 22.3 million tons, with pellet sales to Mittal Steel USA representing approximately 48 percent of North American sales volume. Currently, 2006 pellet sales are projected to be approximately 21 million tons, not including any sales to Mittal Steel Weirton. In 2005 Mittal Steel USA shut down Mittal Steel Weirtons blast furnace. The Weirton Contract has a minimum annual purchase obligation and requires Mittal Steel Weirton to purchase for the years 2004 and 2005 the greater of 67 percent of Mittal Steel Weirtons total annual iron ore pellet requirements, or 1.5 million tons and, for the years 2006 through and including 2018, a tonnage amount equal to Mittal Steel Weirtons total annual iron ore pellet tonnage requirements, with a minimum annual purchase obligation of 2.0 million tons per year, required for consumption in Mittal Steel Weirtons iron and steel making facilities in any year at Mittal Steel Weirton. Over the past few months we have been in discussions with Mittal Steel USA regarding the terms of the Weirton Contract in response to Mittal Steel USAs request for relief from the minimum purchase obligation. These discussions have resulted in no agreement between the Company and Mittal Steel USA as to the Mittal Steel Weirton minimum purchase obligation. Mittal Steel Weirton purchased approximately 325,000 tons of iron ore pellets less than its 1.5 million minimum purchase obligation for 2005, and as a result we invoiced Mittal Steel Weirton approximately $17 million for this remaining tonnage. The sale of this tonnage would be recorded in 2006. Payment for this tonnage was due on January 30, 2006 and has not been received. Mittal Steel USA has advised us that the Mittal Steel Weirton blast furnace has been permanently shut down and will not be restarted. Mittal Steel Weirton has also taken the position that it has no future obligation to purchase pellets under the Weirton Contract. Mittal Steel USA has also claimed that in 2004 it overpaid a supplemental steel price sharing provision (the Special Steel Payment) under the Weirton and ISG Contracts. Mittal claims that, prior to the acquisition of ISG by Mittal, surcharges were improperly included in the average annual unprocessed hot band 49 Table of Contents steel pricing for purposes of calculating the Special Steel Payment under both contracts, despite the fact that ISG itself calculated the amount of the Special Steel Payment, included surcharges in that calculation, and did not claim that it was making or had made any overpayment. Mittal Steel USA has claimed an overpayment of approximately $8.7 million with respect to the Weirton Contract and approximately $49.6 million with respect to the ISG Contract. We are confident that the Special Steel Payment calculation properly included all revenue including surcharges. We believe that Mittal Steel USAs positions with respect to the minimum purchase obligation and the Special Steel Payment are without merit. We are currently negotiating with Mittal Steel USA in an attempt to resolve the foregoing disputes. We are also currently reviewing all of our legal options, including the possible initiation of an arbitration proceeding under the Weirton Contract. Algoma We have a 15 year term supply agreement under which we are Algomas sole supplier of iron ore pellets through 2016. Algoma is Canadas third largest steelmaker. We sold 3.8 million tons and 3.3 million tons to Algoma in 2005 and 2004, respectively. Severstal On October 23, 2003, Rouge Industries, Inc. (Rouge), a significant pellet sales customer of ours, filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. On January 30, 2004, Rouge sold substantially all of its assets to Severstal North America, Inc. (Severstal). Severstal, as part of the acquisition of assets of Rouge, assumed our term supply agreement with Rouge with minimal modifications. On January 1, 2006, we entered into an amended and restated agreement whereby we will be the sole supplier of iron ore pellets through 2012, with certain minimum purchase requirements for certain years. We sold 3.6 million tons, 3.3 million tons and 3.0 million tons to Severstal in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. WCI On September 16, 2003, WCI petitioned for protection under chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. At the time of the filing, we had a trade receivable exposure of $4.9 million, which was fully reserved in the third quarter of 2003. On October 14, 2004, the Company and the current owners of WCI reached agreement (the 2004 Pellet Agreement) for us to supply 1.4 million tons of iron ore pellets in 2005 and, in 2006 and thereafter, to supply 100 percent of WCIs annual requirements up to a maximum of two million tons of iron ore pellets. The 2004 Pellet Agreement is for a ten year term, which commenced on January 1, 2005 and provides for full recovery of our $4.9 million receivable plus $.9 million of subsequent pricing adjustments. The 2004 Pellet Agreement was approved by the Bankruptcy Court on November 16, 2004. The receivable and subsequent pricing adjustments are to be paid in three equal annual installments of approximately $1.9 million. The first payment, due on November 16, 2005, was timely received and classified as Customer bankruptcy recoveries on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. We sold 1.4 million tons and 1.7 million tons to WCI in 2005 and 2004, respectively. Previously, the Bankruptcy Court denied confirmation of both of two competing plans of reorganization filed by (i) WCI, jointly with its current owner (which plan was supported by the USWA, the union representing WCIs hourly employees, and (ii) a group of WCIs secured noteholders. Subsequently, the secured noteholders amended their plan of reorganization (the New Noteholder Plan) and obtained the support of the USWA for the New Noteholder Plan. Under the terms of the New Noteholder Plan, an entity controlled by the secured noteholders would acquire the steelmaking assets and business of WCI and assume the 2004 Pellet Agreement, including the obligation to cure the remaining unpaid pre bankruptcy trade receivable owed to the Company by WCI. A hearing before the Bankruptcy Court on the confirmation of the New Noteholder Plan is scheduled to commence on March 13, 2006. WCIs current owner and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation oppose confirmation of the New Noteholder Plan. 50 Table of Contents Stelco On January 29, 2004, Stelco Inc. (Stelco) applied and obtained Bankruptcy Court protection from creditors in Ontario Superior Court under the Companies Creditors Arrangement Act (CCAA). Pellet sales to Stelco totaled 1.4 million tons, 1.2 million tons, and ..1 million tons in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Stelco is a 44.6 percent participant in Wabush, and U.S. subsidiaries of Stelco (which have not filed for bankruptcy protection) own 14.7 percent of Hibbing and 15 percent of Tilden. At the time of the filing, we had no trade receivable exposure to Stelco. Additionally, Stelco has continued to operate and has met its cash call requirements at the mining ventures to date. Throughout the fall of 2005, Stelco worked to come to agreement with key stakeholders on a reorganization plan. On December 9, 2005, the Third Amended and Restated Plan of Compromise and Arrangement (the Plan) was agreed to. On December 10, the creditors affected by the Plan (the Affected Creditors) approved the Plan by substantially more than the statutorily mandated minimum approval levels. On January 20, 2006, on motion by Stelco, the Honorable Mr. Justice Farley of the Superior Court of Ontario sanctioned the Plan as being fair and reasonable in all the circumstances. On February 14, 2006, Justice Farley issued an order approving the proposed reorganization. Stelco is now in the process of reorganizing pursuant to the Plan so as to be in a position to emerge from bankruptcy protection shortly. The current stay of proceedings against Stelco expires on March 31, 2006. The Company, by agreement with Stelco, is not an Affected Creditor under the Plan. We did not vote on the approval of the Plan, and our claim against Stelco will not be released when Stelco emerges from bankruptcy protection. However, the Plan contemplates that $350 million (Canadian) of new financing will be invested in Stelco. The investor may require, as a condition of such financing, that Stelco be reorganized into limited partnership operating subsidiaries, one of which would be a mining subsidiary. Such a reorganization may affect the nature of the contractual and joint venture relationship between Stelco and the Company, and may require changes to those relationships. To date, we have not been approached by Stelco in this regard, but continue to monitor the situation closely. North American Production Following is a summary of 2005, 2004 and 2003 mine production and our ownership: Production (Million Tons) Companys Share Total Production Companys Mine Ownership* 2005 2004 2003 2005 2004 2003 Empire 79.0 % 3.8 4.3 4.0 4.8 5.4 5.2 Tilden 85.0 6.7 6.6 6.0 7.9 7.8 7.0 Hibbing 23.0 2.0 1.9 1.8 8.5 8.3 8.0 Northshore 100.0 4.9 5.0 4.8 4.9 5.0 4.8 United Taconite** 70.0 3.4 2.9 0.1 4.9 4.1 1.6 Wabush 26.8 1.3 1.0 1.4 4.9 3.8 5.2 Total Production*** 22.1 21.7 18.1 35.9 34.4 30.3 * Represents the Companys ownership at December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003. ** 1.5 million tons produced during the first five months of 2003 occurred under the management of the previous mine owners and prior to the acquisition by United Taconite in December 2003. *** Excludes United Taconite production under previous mine ownership. We preliminarily expect total mine production in 2006 to be approximately 35 million tons; our share of production is currently estimated to be approximately 22 million tons. The decrease in 2006 estimated production principally reflects slightly lower production levels at all mines, except United Taconite and Wabush, based upon expected customer demand, which is subject to change. Production costs per ton are 51 Table of Contents expected to increase approximately 15 percent from the 2005 cost of goods sold and operating expenses (excluding freight and venture partners cost reimbursements) of $42.65 per ton. During 2004, we initiated capacity expansion projects at our United Taconite and Northshore mines in Minnesota. An idled pellet furnace at United Taconite was restarted in the fourth quarter of 2004 to add approximately 1.0 million tons (our share .7 million tons) to annual production capacity. Our plan to restart an idled furnace to increase capacity by ..8 million tons at our wholly owned Northshore mine in mid 2005 was deferred until market conditions warrant increased pellet production. As a result of a 2004 work stoppage (See Labor Contracts), Wabush lost approximately 1.7 million tons of production (our share .5 million tons). Operations resumed on October 11, 2004. Australian Production Portmans production totaled 5.2 million tonnes (including its .5 million tonne share of the Cockatoo Island joint venture) since the acquisition. Portmans current estimate of total year 2006 production is 8.0 million tonnes (.6 million tonnes from Cockatoo Island). Portman currently has a $61 million project underway to increase its wholly owned production capacity to eight million tonnes per year by the end of the first quarter of 2006. Increased North American Mine Ownership United Taconite Effective December 1, 2003, United Taconite purchased the ore mining and pelletizing assets of Eveleth Mines, LLC. Eveleth Mines had ceased mining operations in May 2003 after filing for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on May 1, 2003. Under the terms of the purchase agreement, United Taconite purchased all of Eveleth Mines assets for $3 million in cash and the assumption of certain liabilities, primarily mine closure related environmental obligations. As a result of this transaction, we, after assigning appropriate values to assets acquired and liabilities assumed, were required to record an extraordinary gain of $2.2 million, net of $.5 million tax and $1.2 million minority interest. In conjunction with this transaction, the Company and its Wabush Mines venture partners entered into pellet sales and trade agreements with Laiwu to optimize shipping efficiency. Sales to Laiwu under these contracts totaled .3 million tons and ..2 million tons in 2005 and 2004, respectively. Empire Mine Effective December 31, 2002, we increased our ownership in Empire from 46.7 percent to 79 percent in exchange for assumption of all mine liabilities. Under the terms of the agreement, we indemnified Ispat from obligations of Empire in exchange for certain future payments to Empire and to us by Ispat of $120.0 million, recorded at a present value of $59.8 million at December 31, 2005 ($64.1 million at December 31, 2004) with $47.8 million classified as Long term receivable with the balance current, over the 12 year life of the supply agreement. A subsidiary of Mittal Steel USA has retained a 21 percent ownership in Empire, which it has a unilateral right to put to us in 2008. We are the sole outside supplier of pellets purchased under the Ispat agreement, assumed by Mittal Steel USA, for the term of the supply agreement. Tilden Mine On January 31, 2002, we increased our ownership in Tilden from 40 percent to 85 percent with the acquisition of Algomas interest in Tilden for assumption of mine liabilities associated with the interest. The acquisition increased our share of the annual production capacity by 3.5 million tons. Concurrently, a term supply agreement was executed that made us the sole supplier of iron ore pellets purchased by Algoma for a 15 year period. 52 Table of Contents Hibbing Mine In July 2002, we acquired (effective retroactive to January 1, 2002) an eight percent interest in Hibbing from Bethlehem for the assumption of mine liabilities associated with the interest. The acquisition increased our ownership of Hibbing from 15 percent to 23 percent. This transaction reduced Bethlehems ownership interest in Hibbing to 62.3 percent. In October 2001, Bethlehem filed for protection under chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. At the time of the filing, we had a trade receivable of approximately $1.0 million, which has been written off. In May 2003, ISG purchased the assets of Bethlehem, including Bethlehems 62.3 percent interest in Hibbing. Wabush Mines In August 2002, Acme Steel Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of Acme, which had been under chapter 11 bankruptcy protection since 1998, rejected its 15.1 percent interest in Wabush. As a result, our interest increased to 26.83 percent. Acme had discontinued funding its Wabush obligations in August 2001. Effect of Mine Ownership Increases While none of the increases in mine ownerships during 2002 required cash payments, the ownership changes resulted in our recognizing net obligations of approximately $93 million at December 31, 2002. Additional consolidated obligations assumed totaled approximately $163 million at December 31, 2002, primarily related to employment and legacy obligations at the Empire and Tilden mines, partially offset by non capital non current assets, principally the $58.8 million Ispat long term receivable. United Taconites acquisition of the Eveleth mine assets in December 2003 was for $3 million cash and assumption of certain liabilities, primarily mine closure related environmental obligations. Labor Contracts In August 2004, employees at the Empire and Tilden mines in Michigan and the Hibbing Taconite and United Taconite mines in Minnesota, represented by the USWA, ratified four year labor agreements that are comparable to other USWA contracts in the industry. The agreements provide employees a nine percent wage increase over the four year term and for us and our partners to increase funding into pension plans and VEBAs during the term of the contracts. Accelerated funding of these plans will better secure employee retiree benefits and reduce our future years employment legacy costs. The agreements also provide that employees and future retirees share in healthcare insurance cost, with our share of future retirees healthcare premiums capped at 2008 levels for 2009 and beyond. In addition, the union agreed to certain workforce flexibility provisions and other work rule modifications that will improve productivity. On July 5, 2004, the USWA initiated a strike that idled Wabush mining and concentrating facilities in Labrador, Newfoundland and pelletizing and shipping facilities in Pointe Noire, Quebec. As a result of the work stoppage, Wabush lost approximately 1.7 million tons of production (our share ..5 million tons). On October 10, 2004, a five year labor agreement was ratified by the USWA, representing hourly employees at Wabush. The agreement provides for increases in wages and benefits that are expected to be partially offset by improved productivity associated with increased worker flexibility provisions. Operations resumed on October 11, 2004. Other Related Items The iron ore industry has been identified by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as an industrial category that emits pollutants established by the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments. These pollutants included over 200 substances that are now classified as hazardous air pollutants (HAP). The EPA is required to develop rules that would require major sources of HAP to utilize Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) standards for their emissions. Pursuant to this statutory requirement, the EPA published a final rule on October 30, 2003 imposing emission limitations and other requirements on taconite iron ore processing operations. We must comply with the new requirements not later 53 Table of Contents than October 30, 2006. Our projected capital expenditures in 2006 to meet the proposed MACT standards are approximately $4.4 million. Mesabi Nugget Project In 2002, we agreed to participate in Phase II of the Mesabi Nugget Project (Project). Other participants include Kobe Steel, Ltd., Steel Dynamics, Inc., Ferrometrics, Inc. and the State of Minnesota. Construction of a $16 million pilot plant at our Northshore mine, to test and develop Kobe Steels technology for converting iron ore into nearly pure iron in nugget form, was completed in May 2003. The high iron content product could be utilized to replace steel scrap as a raw material for electric steel furnaces and blast furnaces or basic oxygen furnaces of integrated steel producers or as feedstock for the foundry industry. A third operating phase of the pilot plant test in 2004 confirmed the commercial viability of this technology. The pilot plant ended operations August 3, 2004. The product was used by four electric furnace producers and one foundry with favorable results. Preliminary construction engineering and environmental permitting activities have been initiated for two potential commercial plant locations (one in Butler, Indiana near Steel Dynamics steelmaking facilities and one at our Cliffs Erie site in Hoyt Lakes, Minnesota). A non binding term sheet for a commercial plant was executed in March 2005, and a decision to proceed with construction engineering was made in April. On July 26, 2005, the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency Citizens Board unanimously approved environmental permitting for the Cliffs Erie site. We would be the supplier of iron ore and have a minority interest in the first commercial plant. Our contribution to the project to date has totaled $6.3 million ($1.0 million in 2005), including significant contributions of in kind facilities and services. In January 2006, our board of directors authorized $50 million in capital expenditures for the project, subject to the Project obtaining non recourse financing for its capital requirements in excess of equity investments made by the Project participants and the Project participants reaching mutually agreed upon terms. Our equity interest in the venture is expected to be approximately 23 percent. Included in our boards authorization is $21 million for construction and operation of the commercial nugget plant, $25 million to expand the Northshore concentrator to provide the iron ore concentrate, and $4.4 million for railroad improvements to transport the concentrate. Negotiations are continuing. PolyMet On February 16, 2004, we entered into an option agreement with PolyMet that granted PolyMet the exclusive right to acquire certain land, crushing and concentrating and other ancillary facilities located at our Cliffs Erie site (formerly owned by LTV Steel Mining Company (LTVSMC)). The iron ore mining and pelletizing operations were permanently closed in January 2001. PolyMet is a non ferrous mining company located in Vancouver, B.C. Canada. Its stock trades Over The Counter in the U.S. under the symbol POMGF.OB. Under terms of the agreement, we received $.5 million and one million shares of PolyMet for maintaining certain identified components of the facility, while PolyMet conducted a feasibility study on the development of its Northmet PolyMetallic non ferrous ore deposits located near the Cliffs Erie site. PolyMet had until June 30, 2006 to exercise its option and acquire the assets covered under the agreement for additional consideration. We recorded the $.5 million option payment and one million common shares (valued at approximately $.2 million on the agreement date) under the deposit method and deferred recognition of the gain. We classified the PolyMet shares as available for sale and recorded mark to market changes in the value of the shares to other comprehensive income. On November 15, 2005, we reached an agreement with PolyMet regarding the terms for the early exercise of PolyMets option to acquire the assets under the agreement and closed the sales transaction resulting in a $9.5 million pre tax gain. Under the terms of the agreement, we received cash of $1.0 million and approximately 6.2 million common shares of PolyMet, which closed that day at $1.25 per share. The additional PolyMet shares received in this transaction are classified as available for sale in Other Assets. We intend to hold our shares of PolyMet indefinitely. We expect to receive additional cash proceeds of $2.4 million in quarterly installments by and according to the terms of the contract for deed executed by the 54 Table of Contents parties. As a final component of the purchase price, PolyMet will assume certain on going site related environmental and reclamation obligations. Wisconsin Electric Power Company Dispute Two of our mines, Tilden and Empire (the Mines), currently purchase their electric power from WEPCO pursuant to the terms of special contracts specifying prices based on WEPCO actual costs. Effective April 1, 2005, WEPCO unilaterally changed its method of calculating the energy charges to the Mines. It is the Mines contention that WEPCOs new billing methodology is inconsistent with the terms of the parties contracts and a dispute has arisen between WEPCO and the Mines over the pricing issue. Pursuant to the terms of the relevant contracts, the undisputed amounts are being paid to WEPCO, while the disputed amounts are being deposited into an interest bearing escrow account maintained by a bank. The dispute has been submitted to binding arbitration under the terms of the contracts. For the period ending December 31, 2005, the Mines have deposited $75.8 million into an escrow account of which $5.3 million was deposited in January 2006. An amount of $73.0 million, of which $61.3 million was included in the escrow deposits and $11.7 million has been paid to WEPCO, will be recovered in early 2006; however, we have been advised by WEPCO that they will oppose any release of these recoverable amounts from the escrow until completion of the arbitration. Additionally, WEPCO is disputing whether we have complied with the notification provisions related to Tildens annual pellet production in excess of seven million tons. Strategic Investments We intend to continue to pursue investment and operations management opportunities to broaden our scope as a supplier of iron ore and other raw materials to the integrated steel industry through the acquisition of additional mining interests to strengthen our market position. We are particularly focused on expanding our international investments to capitalize on global demand for steel and iron ore. Our innovative United Taconite joint venture with Laiwu Steel Group, Ltd. and our Portman acquisition are examples of our ability to expand geographically, and we intend to continue to pursue similar opportunities in other regions. In the event of any future acquisitions or joint venture opportunities, we may consider using available liquidity or other sources of funding to make investments. Portman Acquisition On April 19, 2005, Cliffs Australia completed the acquisition of 80.4 percent of the outstanding shares of Portman, a Western Australia based independent iron ore mining and exploration company. The acquisition was initiated on March 31, 2005 by the purchase of approximately 68.7 percent of the outstanding shares of Portman. The assets consist primarily of iron ore inventory, land, mineral rights and iron ore reserves. The purchase price of the 80.4 percent interest was $433.1 million, including $12.4 million of acquisition costs. Additionally, we incurred $9.8 million of foreign currency hedging costs related to this transaction, which were charged to first quarter 2005 operations. The acquisition increased our customer base in China and Japan and established our presence in the Australian mining industry. Portmans full year 2005 production (excluding its .6 million tonne share of the 50 percent owned Cockatoo Island joint venture) was approximately 6.0 million tonnes. Portman currently has a $61 million project underway that is expected to increase its wholly owned production capacity to eight million tonnes per year by the end of the first quarter of 2006. The production is fully committed to steel companies in China and Japan for approximately four years. Portmans reserves total approximately 89 million tonnes at December 31, 2005, and it has an active exploration program underway to increase its reserves. The acquisition and related costs were financed with existing cash and marketable securities and $175 million of interim borrowings under a new three year $350 million revolving credit facility. The outstanding balance was repaid in full on July 5, 2005. See NOTE 7 Credit facilities. The statement of consolidated financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2005 reflects the acquisition of Portman, effective March 31, 2005, under the purchase method of accounting. Assets acquired 55 Table of Contents and liabilities assumed have been recorded at estimated fair values as of the March 31, 2005 initial acquisition date as determined by preliminary results of an appraisal, which is substantially complete. We continue to refine our purchase accounting to reflect a preliminary allocation developed with the assistance of an outside consultant. The current allocation increased Portmans iron ore inventory values by $49.1 million to reflect a market based valuation. Of the $49.1 million inventory basis adjustment, $23.1 million was allocated to product and work in process inventories, of which approximately $19.9 million has been included in cost of goods sold through December 31, 2005. Most of the $3.2 million remaining inventory basis adjustment is expected to be expensed prior to the end of 2006. Additionally, a long term lease was classified as a capital lease resulting in an increase in property, plant and equipment, and capital lease obligations, of $26.7 million. The valuation also resulted in assignment of goodwill, $8.8 million, and a $20.2 million increase in the value of our 50 percent interest in Cockatoo Island. The increase in value of Cockatoo Island was based upon a discounted cash flow analysis over the remaining two year life of its iron ore reserves. These changes reduced the value assigned to Portmans iron ore reserves by $90.8 million. Such amounts are subject to adjustment based on the finalization of the valuations and appraisals prior to March 31, 2006. Accordingly, the revised preliminary purchase price is subject to further revision. A comparison of the revised purchase price allocation to the initial allocation is as follows: (In Millions) Revised Initial Allocation Allocation Change ASSETS Current Assets Cash $ 24.1 $ 24.1 $ Iron Ore Inventory 54.8 29.0 25.8 Other 35.3 35.3 Total Current Assets 114.2 88.4 25.8 Property, Plant and Equipment Iron Ore Reserves 413.5 504.3 (90.8 ) Other 69.1 34.7 34.4 Total Property Plant and Equipment 482.6 539.0 (56.4 ) Long term Stockpiles 38.7 15.4 23.3 Investment in Cockatoo Island 24.8 4.6 20.2 Other Assets 5.8 6.7 (.9 ) Goodwill 8.8 8.8 Total Assets $ 674.9 $ 654.1 $ 20.8 LIABILITIES Current Liabilities $ 35.8 $ 34.7 $ 1.1 Long Term Liabilities 178.8 158.1 20.7 Total Liabilities 214.6 192.8 21.8 Net Assets 460.3 461.3 (1.0 ) Minority Interest (27.2 ) (27.5 ) .3 Purchase Price $ 433.1 $ 433.8 $ (.7 ) Environmental and Closure Obligations At December 31, 2005, we had environmental and closure obligations, including our share of the obligations of ventures, of $113.0 million ($99.0 million at December 31, 2004), of which $13.4 million is 56 Table of Contents current. Payments in 2005 were $5.6 million ($6.4 million in 2004). The obligations at December 31, 2005 include certain responsibilities for environmental remediation sites, $17.8 million, closure of LTVSMC, $30.4 million, and obligations for closure of our six North American operating mines, $59.3 million, and $5.5 million for Portman. The LTVSMC closure obligation resulted from an October 2001 transaction where our subsidiaries received a net payment of $50 million and certain other assets and assumed environmental and certain facility closure obligations of $50.0 million, which obligations have declined to $30.4 million at December 31, 2005, as a result of expenditures totaling $19.6 million since 2001. Milwaukee Solvay In September 2002, we received a draft of a proposed Administrative Order by Consent from the EPA, for clean up and reimbursement of costs associated with the Milwaukee Solvay coke plant site in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The plant was operated by a predecessor of the Company from 1973 to 1983, which predecessor was acquired by the Company in 1986. In January 2003, we completed the sale of the plant site and property to a third party. Following this sale, an Administrative Order by Consent (Consent Order) was entered into with the EPA by the Company, the new owner and another third party who had operated on the site. In connection with the Consent Order, the new owner agreed to take responsibility for the removal action and agreed to indemnify us for all costs and expenses in connection with the removal action. In the third quarter of 2003, the new owner, after completing a portion of the removal, experienced financial difficulties. In an effort to continue progress on the removal action, we expended approximately $1.8 million in the second half of 2003, $2.1 million in 2004 and $.4 million in 2005. In September 2005, we received a notice of completion from the EPA documenting that all work has been fully performed in accordance with the Consent Order. On August 26, 2004, we received a Request for Information pursuant to Section 104(e) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) relative to the investigation of additional contamination below the ground surface at the Milwaukee Solvay site. The Request for Information was also sent to 13 other potentially responsible parties (PRPs). On July 14, 2005, we received a General Notice Letter from the EPA notifying us that the EPA believes we may be liable under CERCLA and requesting that we, along with other PRPs, voluntarily perform clean up activities at the site. We have responded to the General Notice Letter indicating that there had been no communications with other PRPs but also indicating our willingness to begin the process of negotiation with the EPA and other interested parties regarding a Consent Order. Subsequently, on July 26, 2005, we received correspondence from the EPA with a proposed Consent Order and informing us that three other PRPs had also expressed interest in negotiating with the EPA. At this time, the nature and extent of the contamination, the required remediation, the total cost of the clean up and the cost sharing responsibilities of the PRPs cannot be determined, although the EPA has advised us that it has incurred $.5 million in past response costs, which the EPA will seek to recover from us and the other PRPs. We increased our environmental reserve for Milwaukee Solvay by $.5 million in 2005 for potential additional exposure. On December 23, 2005, we entered into a letter of intent with Kinnickinnic Development Group LLC (KK Group) pursuant to which the KK Group would acquire and redevelop the Milwaukee Solvay Site. Under the terms of the letter of intent, KK Group would acquire our mortgage on the site in consideration for the assumption of all our environmental obligations with respect to the site and a cash payment of approximately $2.3 million. In addition, KK Group would be required to deposit $4 million into an escrow account to fund any remaining environmental clean up activities on the site and to purchase insurance coverage with a $5 million limit. We are currently drafting definitive agreements documenting this agreement. Closing of the transaction would occur within 61 days of signing definitive agreements. Rio Tinto The Rio Tinto Mine Site is a historic underground copper mine located near Mountain City, NV, where tailings were placed in Mill Creek, a tributary to the Owyhee River. Remediation work is being conducted in accordance with a Consent Order between the Nevada Department of Environmental Protection (NDEP) 57 Table of Contents and the Rio Tinto Working Group (RTWG) composed of the Company, Atlantic Richfield Company, Teck Cominco American Incorporated, and E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company. The Consent Order provides for technical review by the U.S. Department of the Interior Bureau of Indian Affairs, the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service, the NDEP and the Shoshone Paiute Tribes of the Duck Valley Reservation (collectively, Rio Tinto Trustees) located downstream on the Owyhee River. The Consent Order is currently projected to continue through 2006 with the objective of supporting the selection of the final remedy for the Site. Costs are shared pursuant to the terms of a Participation Agreement between the parties of the RTWG, who have reserved the right to renegotiate any future participation or cost sharing following the completion of the Consent Order. The Rio Tinto Trustees have made available for public comment their plans for the assessment of Natural Resource Damages (NRD). The RTWG commented on the plans and also are in discussions with the Rio Tinto Trustees informally about those plans. The notice of plan availability is a step in the damage assessment process. The studies presented in the plan may lead to a NRD claim under CERCLA. There is no monetized NRD claim at this time. During 2005, the focus of the RTWG has been on development of alternatives for remediation of the mine site. A draft of an alternatives study has recently been reviewed with the Rio Tinto Trustees and the alternatives have essentially been reduced to three: (1) no action; (2) long term water treatment, and (3) removal of the tailings. The estimated costs range from approximately $1 million to $27 million. In recognition of the potential for an NRD claim, the parties are exploring the possibility of a global settlement that would encompass both the site decision and the NRD issues and thereby avoid the lengthy litigation typically associated with NRD. The Companys recorded reserve of approximately $1.2 million reflects its estimated costs for completion of the existing Consent Order and the minimum no action alternative based on the current Participation Agreement. Northshore Notice of Violation On February 10, 2006, our Northshore mine received a Notice of Violation (Notice) from the EPA. The Notice cites four alleged violations: (1) that Northshore violated the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) requirements of the Clean Air Act in the 1990 restart of Furnaces 11 and 12; (2) that Northshore mine violated the PSD Regulations in the 1995 restart of Furnace 6; (3) Title V operating permit violations for not including in the Title V permit all applicable requirements (including a compliance schedule for PSD and Best Available Control Technology (BACT) requirements associated with the furnace restarts); and (4) failure to comply with calibration of monitoring equipment as required under Northshores Title V permit. The alleged violations relating to the restart of Furnaces 11 and 12 occurred prior to our acquisition of Northshore (formerly Cyprus Northshore Mining Company) in a share purchase in 1994. We are currently investigating the allegations contained in the Notice. Market Risk We are subject to a variety of market risks, including those caused by changes in market value of equity investments, commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. We have established policies and procedures to manage risks; however, certain risks are beyond our control. Our investment policy relating to cash and cash equivalents is to preserve principal and liquidity while maximizing the return through investment of available funds. The carrying value of these investments approximates fair value on the reporting dates. We hold investments in highly liquid auction rate securities (ARS) in order to generate higher than typical money market investments. ARS typically are high credit quality, generally achieved with municipal bond insurance. Credit risks are eased by the historical track record of bond insurers, which back a majority of this market. Although rare, sell orders for any security traded through a Dutch auction process could exceed bids. Such instances are usually the result of a drastic deterioration of issuer credit quality. Should there be a failed auction, we may be unable to liquidate our position in the securities in the near term. 58 Table of Contents The rising cost of energy is an important issue for us as it comprises approximately 27 percent of our North American production costs. Our North American mining ventures consumed approximately 13.6 million mmbtus (million btus) of natural gas and 26.5 million gallons of diesel fuel (Company share 9.6 million mmbtus and 16.6 million gallons of diesel fuel) in 2005. In 2005, the average price paid by the North American mining ventures was $8.00 per mmbtu for natural gas and $1.95 per gallon for diesel fuel. Recent trends indicate that electric power, natural gas and oil costs can be expected to increase over time, although the direction and magnitude of short term changes are difficult to predict. Our strategy to address increasing energy rates includes improving efficiency in energy usage and utilizing the lowest cost alternative fuel. We also use forward purchases of natural gas and diesel fuel to stabilize fluctuations in near term prices. For 2006, we purchased or have forward purchase contracts for 7.8 million mmbtus of natural gas at an average price of $9.86 per mmbtu and 3.2 million gallons of diesel fuel at $2.05 per gallon for our North American mining ventures. Our mining ventures enter into forward contracts for certain commodities, primarily natural gas and diesel fuel, as a hedge against price volatility. Such contracts, which are in quantities expected to be delivered and used in the production process, are a means to limit exposure to price fluctuations. At December 31, 2005, the notional amounts of the outstanding forward contracts were $28.6 million (our share $24.7 million), with an unrecognized fair value loss of $5.2 million (our share $4.4 million) based on December 31, 2005 forward rates. The contracts mature at various times through December 2006. If the forward rates were to change 10 percent from the year end rate, the value and potential cash flow effect on the contracts would be approximately $2.0 million (our share $1.7 million). Our share of Wabush Mines operation in Canada represented approximately six percent of our North American pellet production. This operation is subject to currency exchange fluctuations between the U.S. and Canadian dollars; however, we do not hedge our exposure to this currency exchange fluctuation. Between 2003 and 2005, the value of the Canadian dollar rose against the U.S. dollar from $.64 U.S. dollar per Canadian dollar at the beginning of 2003 to $.86 U.S. dollars per Canadian dollar at December 31, 2005, an increase of 34 percent. The average exchange rate increased to $.83 U.S. dollar per Canadian dollar in 2005 from an average of $.77 U.S. dollar per Canadian dollar for 2004, an increase of eight percent. We do not believe that the recent increase in the U.S./ Canadian exchange rate is a trend that will continue in the long term; however, short term fluctuations cannot reasonably be predicted. We are subject to changes in foreign currency exchange rates in Australia as a result of our operations at Portman, which could impact our financial condition. Foreign exchange risk arises from our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates because our reporting currency is the United States dollar. We do not hedge our exposure to this currency exchange fluctuation. A 10 percent movement in quoted foreign currency exchange rates could result in a fair value change of approximately $44 million in our net investment. Portman hedges a portion of its United States currency denominated sales in accordance with a formal policy. The primary objective for using derivative financial instruments is to reduce the earnings volatility attributable to changes in Australian and United States currency fluctuations. The instruments are subject to formal documentation, intended to achieve qualifying hedge treatment, and are tested at inception and at each reporting period as to effectiveness. Changes in fair value for highly effective hedges are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income. Ineffective portions are charged to operations. At December 31, 2005, Portman had outstanding A$370.1 million in the form of call options, collars, convertible collars and forward exchange contracts with varying maturity dates ranging from January 2006 to October 2008, and a fair value loss based on the December 31, 2005 exchange rate of A$.9 million. A one percent increase in rates from the month end rate would increase the fair value and cash flow by approximately A$2.0 million and a one percent decrease would decrease the fair value and cash flow by approximately A$3.6 million. Outlook Although production schedules are subject to change, most operations are expected to operate at or near capacity in 2006 and total North American pellet production is expected to be approximately 35 million tons with our share representing approximately 21 million tons. 59 Table of Contents Our 2006 North American sales volume is projected to be approximately 21 million tons, compared with 22.3 million tons in 2005. Revenue per ton from iron ore sales and services is dependent upon several price adjustment factors included in our term sales contracts, primarily the percentage change from 2005 to 2006 in the international pellet price for blast furnace pellets, PPI and actual revenue for steel sales for one of our customers. Following is the estimated impact to our average North American revenue per ton from iron ore sales and services (excluding freight and venture partners cost reimbursements) based on 2005 realization of $58.77 per ton: 2006 Revenue Effect (Change from 2005) Price Per Percent Ton Potential Increase (Decrease): Each 10 Percent Change in International Pellet Price 3.5 % $ 2.05 Each 10 Percent Change in PPI Industrial Commodities less Fuel 2.1 1.25 Each 10 Percent Change in PPI Fuel and Related Products 1.1 .64 Each $10 Per Ton Change from $520 Per Ton Average Hot Rolled Coil Price Realization* .5 .29 Known Year Over Year Increase** 5.6 3.28 * Valid for decreases through $400 per ton; no upper limit. ** Increase represents a combination of contractual base price increase, lag year adjustments and capped pricing on one contract. Portmans estimate of 2006 sales is 7.9 million tonnes. Portmans estimate of 2006 production is 8.0 million tonnes, including .6 million from Cockatoo Island. North American production costs per ton are expected to increase approximately 15 percent from the 2005 cost of goods sold and operating expenses (excluding freight and venture partners cost reimbursements) of $42.65 per ton. As we look forward to 2006, we are concerned about the rising costs of much of our purchased energy and materials. While PPI escalation factors in our North American sales contracts will recover some of the expected inflation, we will need continued levels of solid steel pricing and an improved international iron ore price in order to maintain our sales margins. Critical Accounting Policies Managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). Preparation of financial statements requires management to make assumptions, estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses, and the related disclosures of contingencies. Management bases its estimates on various assumptions and historical experience, which are believed to be reasonable; however, due to the inherent nature of estimates, actual results may differ significantly due to changed conditions or assumptions. On a regular basis, management reviews the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are fairly presented in accordance with GAAP. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material. Management believes that the following critical accounting estimates and judgments have a significant impact on the Companys financial statements. 60 Table of Contents Revenue Recognition See Accounting Policies in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for a complete discussion of our revenue recognition policy. Most of our term supply agreements contain provisions for annual pricing adjustments. These provisions vary from agreement to agreement but typically include adjustments based upon changes in specified PPI including those for all commodities, industrial commodities, energy and steel, as well as changes in international pellet prices. For example, one of our term supply agreements contains a price adjustment provision that is based on changes in the world pellet price, as well as the PPI for all commodities and for steel. Each component constitutes one third of the price adjustment. Other term supply agreements contain different adjustment factors, such as the PPI for fuel and related products, the Eastern Canadian Pellet Prices and steel prices. The adjustments generally operate in the same manner, with each factor typically comprising a portion of the price adjustment, although the weighting of each factor differs from agreement to agreement. One of our term supply agreements contains price collars, which typically limit the percentage increase or decrease in prices for our iron ore pellets during any one year. In most cases, these adjustment factors have not been finalized at the time our product is sold; we routinely estimate these adjustment factors for purposes of revenue recognition. Certain supply agreements with one customer include provisions for supplemental revenue or refunds based on the customers annual steel pricing at the time the product is consumed in the customers blast furnaces. We estimate these amounts for recognition at the time of sale. Our 2005 revenues included $9.0 million of supplemental revenue on 2005 sales based on estimates of the customers 2006 steel pricing. Estimated supplemental payments, totaling $9.2 million, related to sales to one of the customers indefinitely idled facilities, have not been included in revenue. The pellets sold to this facility in 2005 have not been consumed and no definitive timetable for consumption or other disposition of these pellets has been determined. Our rationale for shipping North American iron ore products to some customers in advance of payment for the products is to more closely relate timing of payment by customers to consumption, which also provides additional liquidity to our customers. Generally, our North American term supply agreements specify that title and risk of loss pass to the customer when payment for the pellets is received. This is a revenue recognition practice utilized to reduce our financial risk to customer insolvency. This practice is not believed to be widely used throughout the balance of the industry. Revenue is recognized on services when the services are performed. Where we are joint venture participants in the ownership of a North American mine, our contracts entitle us to receive royalties and management fees, which we earn as the pellets are produced. Portmans sales revenue is recognized at the F.O.B. point, which is generally when the product is loaded into the vessel. Foreign currency revenues are converted to Australian dollars at the currency exchange rate in effect at the time of the transaction. Self Insurance/Deductible Reserves We are largely self insured with respect to employee non occupational medical claims, and maintain workers compensation and general liability insurance programs where we retain an obligation for a portion of the claims through self insured retentions or deductibles. We maintain an accrual for the estimated cost to settle open claims as well as incurred but not reported claims. These estimates take into consideration valuations provided by third party actuaries and administrators, historical claims experience and current trends in claim costs, applicable deductible or retention levels under insured programs, changes in our business and workforce, and general economic factors and other assumptions that are reasonable to the circumstances. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be affected if future occurrences and claims differ from assumptions used and historical trends. These accruals are reviewed on a quarterly basis, or more frequently if factors dictate a more frequent review is warranted. 61 Table of Contents Litigation Accruals We are subject to proceedings, lawsuits and other claims. We are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as the potential ranges of probable losses. A determination of the amount of accrual required, if any, for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each matter. The required accrual may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach, such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters. We do not believe that any such matter will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Tax Contingencies Domestic and foreign tax authorities periodically audit our income tax returns. These audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. At any time, multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various tax authorities. In evaluating the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions, we record reserves for exposures on a probable basis. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter, for which we have established a reserve, is audited and fully resolved. When the actual results of a settlement with tax authorities differs from our established reserve for a matter, we adjust our tax contingencies reserve and income tax provision in the period in which the income tax matter is resolved. Iron Ore Reserves We regularly evaluate our economic iron ore reserves and update them as required in accordance with SEC Industry Guide 7. The estimated ore reserves could be affected by future industry conditions, geological conditions and ongoing mine planning. Maintenance of effective production capacity or the ore reserve could require increases in capital and development expenditures. Generally as mining operations progress, haul lengths and lifts increase. Alternatively, changes in economic conditions, or the expected quality of ore reserves could decrease capacity or ore reserves. Technological progress could alleviate such factors, or increase capacity or ore reserves. Based on revised economic mine planning studies, we reduced the estimates of the ore reserves at the Empire mine from 116 million tons at December 31, 2001 to 63 million tons at December 31, 2002 and further to 29 million tons at December 31, 2003. There was no change in 2004 except for production of 5.4 million tons, but in 2005, the estimated ore reserves were decreased to approximately 17 million tons. The 2005 reduction was due to production of 4.8 million tons and 2.0 million tons for the elimination of the remaining reserve in the CD II deposit because these ores were found to be too difficult to process and had high incremental costs. We also completed revised economic mine planning studies in the fourth quarter of 2002 for Wabush, and reduced the estimate of ore reserves at Wabush from 244 million tons to 94 million tons due to increasing mining and processing costs. Based on an update to those studies completed in the fourth quarter of 2003, we further significantly reduced the Wabush mine ore reserve estimate to 61 million tons. Our reserves at Wabush were approximately 51 million tons at December 31, 2005, with the reduction since 2003 primarily attributable to production and increased operating costs. The revised Wabush estimate is largely a reflection of increased operating costs, especially due to dewatering, and the impact of currency exchange rate changes. We use our ore reserve estimates to determine the mine closure dates utilized in recording the fair value liability for asset retirement obligations. See Note 6 Environmental and Mine Closure Obligations Mine Closure in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Since the liability represents the present value of the expected future obligation, a significant change in ore reserves would have a substantial effect on the recorded obligation. We also utilize economic ore reserves for evaluating potential impairments of mine assets and in determining maximum useful lives utilized to calculate depreciation and amortization of long lived mine assets. Decreases in ore reserves could significantly affect these items. Asset Retirement Obligations The accrued mine closure obligations for our active mining operations reflect the adoption of SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, effective January 1, 2002 to provide for 62 Table of Contents contractual and legal obligations associated with the eventual closure of the mining operations. Our obligations are determined based on detailed estimates adjusted for factors that an outside party would consider (i.e., inflation, overhead and profit), which were escalated (at an assumed three percent) to the estimated closure dates, and then discounted using a credit adjusted risk free interest rate of 10.25 percent (12.0 percent for United Taconite and 5.5 percent for Portman). The estimates at December 31, 2005 were revised using a three percent escalation factor and a six percent credit adjusted risk free discount rate for the incremental increases in the closure cost estimates. The closure date for each location was determined based on the exhaustion date of the remaining iron ore reserves. The estimated obligations are particularly sensitive to the impact of changes in mine lives given the difference between the inflation and discount rates. Changes in the base estimates of legal and contractual closure costs due to changed legal or contractual requirements, available technology, inflation, overhead or profit rates would also have a significant impact on the recorded obligations. See Note 6 Environmental and Mine Closure Obligations Mine Closure in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Asset Impairment We monitor conditions that indicate that the carrying value of an asset or asset group may be impaired. We determine impairment based on the assets ability to generate cash flow greater than its carrying value, utilizing an undiscounted probability weighted analysis. If the analysis indicates the asset is impaired, the carrying value is adjusted to fair value. Fair value can be determined by market value and also comparable sales transactions or using a discounted cash flow method. The impairment analysis and fair value determination can result in significantly different outcomes based on critical assumptions and estimates including the quantity and quality of remaining economic ore reserves, and future iron ore prices and production costs. See Note 1 Operations and Customers Empire Mine and Wabush Mines and Note 4 Discontinued Operation in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Environmental Remediation Costs We have a formal code of environmental protection and restoration. Our obligations for known environmental problems at active and closed mining operations and other sites have been recognized based on estimates of the cost of investigation and remediation at each site. If the estimate can only be estimated as a range of possible amounts, with no specific amount being most likely, the minimum of the range is accrued. Management reviews its environmental remediation sites quarterly to determine if additional cost adjustments or disclosures are required. The characteristics of environmental remediation obligations, where information concerning the nature and extent of clean up activities is not immediately available, or changes in regulatory requirements, result in a significant risk of increase to the obligations as they mature. Expected future expenditures are not discounted to present value. Potential insurance recoveries are not recognized until realized. Employee Retirement Benefit Obligations The Company and its mining ventures sponsor defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all employees. These plans are largely noncontributory, and except for U.S. salaried employees, benefits are generally based on employees years of service and average earnings for a defined period prior to retirement. Additionally, the Company and its ventures provide postretirement medical and life insurance benefits (OPEBs) to most full time employees who meet certain length of service and age requirements. Our pension and medical costs (including OPEB) have increased substantially over the past several years. Lower interest rates, lower asset returns and continued escalation of medical costs have been the predominant causes of the increases. We have taken actions to control pension and medical costs. Effective July 1, 2003, we implemented changes to U.S. salaried employee plans to reduce costs by more than an estimated $8.0 million on an annualized basis. Benefits under the current defined benefit formula were frozen for affected U.S. salaried employees and a new cash balance formula was instituted. Increases in affected U.S. salaried retiree healthcare co pays became effective for retirements after June 30, 2003. A cap on our share of annual 63 Table of Contents medical premiums was also implemented for existing and future U.S. salaried retirees. Pursuant to the four year U.S. labor agreements reached with the USWA, effective August 1, 2004, OPEB expense for 2004 and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (APBO) decreased $4.9 million and $48.0 million, respectively, to reflect negotiated plan changes, which capped our share of future bargaining unit retirees healthcare premiums at 2008 levels for the years 2009 and beyond. OPEB expense decreased $10.6 million in 2005 as a result of the agreement. The new agreements also provide that the Company and its partners fund an estimated $220 million into bargaining unit pension plans and VEBAs during the term of the contracts. On December 8, 2003, Congress passed the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (Medicare Act). In May 2004, FASB issued Staff Position No. 106 2 (FSP 106 2), Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, which supersedes FSP 106 1. FSP 106 2 provides guidance on the accounting for the effects of the Medicare Act for employers that sponsor postretirement health care plans that provide prescription drug benefits and requires certain disclosures regarding the effect of the subsidy provided by the Medicare Act. We adopted FSP 106 2 in the second quarter of 2004 and applied the retroactive transition method. As a result, annual OPEB expense reflected annual pre tax cost reductions of approximately $3.6 million and $4.1 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively. Following is a summary of our defined benefit pension and OPEB funding and expense for the years 2003 through 2006: (In Millions) Pension OPEB Funding Expense Funding Expense 2003 $ 6.4 $ 32.0 $ 17.0 $ 29.1 2004 63.0 23.1 30.9 28.5 2005 40.6 20.7 31.8 17.9 2006 (Estimated) 46.2 23.1 37.6 16.6 Assumptions used in determining the benefit obligations and the value of plan assets for defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefit plans (primarily retiree healthcare benefits) offered by the Company and its unconsolidated ventures are evaluated periodically by management in conjunction with outside actuaries. Critical assumptions, such as the discount rate used to measure the benefit obligations, the expected long term rate of return on plan assets, and the medical care cost trend are reviewed annually. At December 31, 2005 we reduced our discount rate for U.S. plans to 5.50 percent from 5.75 percent at December 31, 2004, and reduced our discount rate for Canadian plans to 5.00 percent from 5.75 percent at December 31, 2004. Additionally, at December 31, 2005, we adopted the 1994 Group Annuity Mortality (GAM) table to determine the expected life of our plan participants, replacing the 1983 GAM table. Following are sensitivities on estimated 2006 pension and OPEB expense of potential further changes in these key assumptions: Increase in 2006 Expense (In Millions) Pension OPEB Decrease discount rate .25 percent $ 1.8 $ .5 Decrease return on assets 1 percent 5.7 1.1 Increase medical trend rate 1 percent N/A 4.8 Changes in actuarial assumptions, including discount rates, employee retirement rates, mortality, compensation levels, plan asset investment performance, and healthcare costs, are selected by the Company after consulting with outside actuaries. Changes in actuarial assumptions and or investment performance of plan assets can have a significant impact on our financial condition due to the magnitude of our retirement obligations. See Note 9 Retirement Related Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 64 Table of Contents Accounting for Business Combinations During 2005, we completed the acquisition of 80.4 percent of Portman. We allocated the purchase price to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their relative fair value at the date of acquisition, pursuant to SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations. In estimating the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, we consider information obtained during our due diligence process and utilize various valuation methods, including market prices, where available, appraisals, comparisons to transactions for similar assets and liabilities and present value of estimated future cash flows. We are required to make subjective estimates in connection with these valuations and allocations.
