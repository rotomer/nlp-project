Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview Cleveland Cliffs Inc is the largest producer of iron ore pellets in North America. We sell the majority of our pellets to integrated steel companies in the United States and Canada. We manage and operate six North American iron ore mines located in Michigan, Minnesota, and Eastern Canada that currently have a rated capacity of 37.0 million tons of iron ore pellet production annually, representing approximately 46 percent of the current North American pellet production capacity. The other iron ore mines in the U.S. and Canada have an aggregate rated capacity of 44.1 million tons. Based on our percentage ownership in the mines we operate, our share of the rated pellet production capacity is currently 22.9 million tons annually, representing approximately 28 percent of total North American annual pellet capacity. On April 19, 2005, Cliffs Asia Pacific, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, completed the acquisition of 80.4 percent of Portman, an iron ore mining company in Australia. The acquisition was initiated on March 31, 2005, by the purchase of 68.7 percent of the outstanding shares of Portman. As a result of the acquisition, we operate in two reportable segments: the North America segment and the Australia segment, also referred to as Portman. Portman serves the Asian iron ore markets with direct shipping fines and lump ore from two iron ore projects, both located in Western Australia. Portmans full year 2006 production (excluding its .7 million tonne share of the 50 percent owned Cockatoo Island Joint Venture) was 7.0 million tonnes. Portman completed a $62 million project to increase its wholly owned production capacity to eight million tonnes per year in the first half of 2006. The production is committed to steel companies in China and Japan through 2009. The Portman acquisition represents a significant milestone in our long term strategy to pursue investment and management opportunities to broaden our scope as a supplier of iron ore or other raw materials to the integrated steel industry through the acquisition of additional mining interests to strengthen our market position. We are particularly focused on expanding our international investments to capitalize on global demand for steel and iron ore. The global mining environment is changing to meet the needs of todays market. While this is an environment that has allowed Cliffs to reach record sales and earnings over the past several years, it also highlights challenges to our traditional business and the limited growth potential of the North American market. We have developed and are executing strategies to capitalize on the new trends, to grow the business and to deliver competitive returns to our shareholders in a changing environment for mining and iron ore. On March 5, 2007, we acquired a 30 percent interest in MMX Amapa Mineracao LTDA., a Brazilian company developing an iron ore project (Amapa Project), through the acquisition of 100 percent of the shares of Centennial Amapa. The remaining 70 percent of the Amapa Project is owned by MMX Mineracao e Metallicos S.A., which is providing corporate and institutional support, while we will supply technical support for construction and operations. The purchase price for our 30 percent interest was $133 million, paid with cash on hand. Total capital expenditures are estimated to be $357 million, of which approximately $268 million will be funded with project debt. Capital contributions of $89.3 million were paid by Cliffs and MMX to fund the project; Cliffs 30 percent share was $26.8 million. We may be responsible for 30 percent of any additional capital contributions. The Amapa Project consists of a significant iron ore deposit, a 192 kilometer railway connecting the mine location to an existing port facility and 71 hectares of real estate on the banks of the Amazon River, reserved for a loading terminal. The Amapa Project is currently under construction and is expected to produce 6.5 million tonnes of iron ore concentrate annually once fully operational. Iron ore concentrate is expected to be sold, pursuant to a long term supply agreement, to an operator of an iron oxide pelletizing plant in the Kingdom of Bahrain. Production is expected to begin in late 2007. On April 18, 2007, we completed the acquisition of an effective 45 percent interest in the Sonoma Coal Project in Queensland, Australia. As of May 3, 2007, we invested $15.6 million toward the purchase of mining tenements and $19.4 million toward the construction of a washplant. We will operate and own 100 percent of the washplant and 8.3 percent of the mining leases, resulting in a 45 percent economic interest in Sonoma. 46 Table of Contents The Sonoma Coal Project is expected to initially produce two million tonnes of marketable coal annually, beginning late in 2007. Production from Sonoma will include an approximately equal mix of hard coking coal and thermal coal. Plans call for annual production to increase to between three million and four million tonnes during 2008. The Sonoma Coal Project has a current resource estimate of 107 million tonnes. We have also realigned our management roles and have created a business unit corporate structure to support our ongoing growth strategy. Under this new organizational model, each unit will be responsible for its own operational activities with shared support from our central service and corporate groups. As we continue our growth, this structure will provide the flexibility to align the organization to potential new opportunities. In North America, we are engaged with expanding our leadership position in the industry by focusing on high product quality, technical excellence, superior relationships with our customers and partners and improved operational efficiency through cost saving initiatives. We operate a fully equipped research and development facility in Ishpeming, Michigan. Our research and development group is staffed with experienced engineers and scientists and is organized to support the geological interpretation, process mineralogy, mine engineering, mineral processing, pyrometallurgy, advanced process control and analytical service disciplines. Our research and development group is also utilized by iron ore pellet customers for laboratory testing and simulation of blast furnace conditions. We will continue to investigate opportunities to expand our leadership position in the North American iron ore market. We were not able to reach agreement on terms with the other participants in the Mesabi Nugget Project to move forward with the construction of a reduced iron plant. However, we are evaluating opportunities with Kobe Steel to proceed with the development of a commercial scale reduced iron plant, which will convert taconite into nearly pure iron in nugget form utilizing Kobe Steels ITmk3 technology. See Strategic Investments Mesabi Nugget Project for further information. A consequence of the expanding industry has been significant increases in capital, supply, energy and employment costs as suppliers attempt to meet increasing demand. Rising costs could threaten our margins and limit our strategic flexibility. Our challenge is to improve performance at all of our mining operations. To minimize the threat of increasing mining costs, we have developed initiative teams to focus on business improvement, asset productivity, energy usage, alternative fuels and strategic sourcing. We have also initiated comprehensive personnel plans that will address current talent needs, meet future hiring requirements and identify specific succession plans for key management positions. We have taken a balanced approach to allocation of our capital resources and free cash flow. We have made strategic investments both domestically and internationally, increased our capital expenditures, strengthened our balance sheet, increased funding of our employee benefit obligations, increased our common stock dividends, repurchased our common stock and increased our borrowing capacity. Our strategic redirection and acceptance of additional risks of increased mine ownership followed by significant increases in iron ore demand and pricing culminated in record operating income in 2004, 2005 and 2006, solid financial condition, and a strong base for future growth. In the last five years, our revenues have increased over 220 percent from $.6 billion in 2002 to $1.9 billion in 2006. Our net income increased to $280 million in 2006 from a loss of $188 million in 2002. Our operating objectives are to maximize safe production, efficiency and productivity at our mines. Unfortunately, during the year we experienced three very serious incidents resulting in fatalities. We achieved a reportable incident rate, as defined by MSHA, of 2.26 in North America. According to MSHA, the industry frequency rate for total reportable incidents for U.S. mines, mills and shops (excluding coal) was 3.35 per 200,000 employee hours worked in 2006. Our frequency rate for lost time incidents in 2006 was 1.40 per 200,000 employee hours worked, compared with an MSHA lost time incident rate of 2.20. At the Koolyanobbing operation, the LTIFR for the year was 3.5, which is slightly below the Western Australian Metalliferous surface mining industry average of 3.8 incidents per million man hours. During 2006, five LTIs were recorded at the Koolyanobbing operation. At Cockatoo Island, two LTIs were incurred, resulting in a LTIFR of 7.87 for the year. Portmans safety statistics include employees and contractors. 47 Table of Contents Recent Accounting Pronouncements Refer to NOTE 1 BUSINESS SUMMARY AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES of the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of recent accounting pronouncements, including the respective dates of adoption and effects on results of operations and financial condition. Two for One Stock Splits On June 30, 2006 and December 31, 2004, the Company completed two for one stock splits of its common shares with corresponding decreases in par value from $.50 to $.25 and from $1.00 to $.50, respectively. Accordingly, all common shares, per share amounts, stock compensation plans and preferred stock conversion rates have been adjusted retroactively to reflect the stock splits. Additionally, all diluted per share amounts reflect the as if converted effect of our convertible preferred stock as required by EITF 04 8, The Effect of Contingently Convertible Instruments on Diluted Earnings per Share. Key Operating and Financial Indicators Following is a summary of our key operating and financial indicators for the years 2006, 2005 and 2004: (In Millions, Except EPS) 2006 2005 2004 North American pellet sales (tons) 20.4 22.3 22.6 Australian iron ore sales (tonnes) 7.4 4.9 North American pellet production (tons) Total 33.6 35.9 34.4 Companys share 20.8 22.1 21.7 Australian iron ore production (tonnes) 7.7 5.2 Revenues from iron ore sales and services* $ 1,921.7 $ 1,739.5 $ 1,203.1 Operating income 365.7 356.5 117.6 Income from continuing operations Amount 279.8 273.2 320.2 Per diluted share 5.19 4.92 5.84 Income (loss) from discontinued operations Amount .3 (.8 ) 3.4 Per diluted share .01 (.02 ) .06 Cumulative effect of accounting change Amount 5.2 Per diluted share .09 Net income Amount 280.1 277.6 323.6 Per diluted share 5.20 4.99 5.90 * Includes revenues of $252.6 million, $227.3 million and $208.1 million in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively, related to freight and venture partners cost reimbursements. 2006 Versus 2005 North American Iron Ore Following is a summary of North American sales margin for 2006 versus 2005: (In Millions) Increase (Decrease) Due To: 2006 2005 Rate Volume Total Sales revenue* $ 1,308.1 $ 1,307.7 $ 111.6 $ (111.2 ) $ .4 Cost of goods sold and operating expenses* 980.7 949.1 112.3 (80.7 ) 31.6 Sales margin* $ 327.4 $ 358.6 $ (.7 ) $ (30.5 ) $ (31.2 ) * Excludes freight and venture partners cost reimbursements. 48 Table of Contents Revenues from Iron Ore Sales and Services Sales revenue increased $.4 million. The increase in sales revenue was due to higher sales prices, $111.6 million, partially offset by a sales volume decrease of 1.9 million tons, or $111.2 million. The 9.3 percent increase in sales prices primarily reflected the effect of contractual base price increases, higher term supply agreement escalation factors including higher steel pricing, higher PPI and lag year adjustments, partially offset by the impact of lower international benchmark pellet prices. The price of blast furnace pellets for Eastern Canadian producers decreased 3.5 percent. Included in 2006 revenues were approximately 1.3 million tons of 2006 sales at 2005 contract prices and $21.6 million of revenue related to pricing adjustments on 2005 sales. Cost of Goods Sold and Operating Expenses Cost of goods sold and operating expenses increased $31.6 million or approximately three percent. The increase primarily reflected higher unit production costs of $112.3 million. Lower sales volume reduced costs $80.7 million. On a per ton basis, cost of goods sold and operating expenses increased approximately 13 percent, primarily due to higher maintenance activity, increased energy and supply pricing, increased stripping and higher employment costs. Production costs were also impacted by an approximate $15 million cost effect related to production curtailments caused by the October 12, 2006 explosions at the United Taconite processing plant. See Production and Sales Volume for further information regarding production volumes. Sales Margin The sales margin decrease of $31.2 million or approximately nine percent was primarily due to higher production costs and lower sales volume, partially offset by an increase in sales prices. Australia Iron Ore Following is a summary of Australia sales margin for 2006 versus 2005: (In Millions) Increase (Decrease) Due To: 2006 2005 Rate Volume* Total Sales revenue $ 361.0 $ 204.5 $ 51.5 $ 105.0 $ 156.5 Cost of goods sold and operating expenses 274.4 174.1 10.9 89.4 100.3 Sales margin $ 86.6 $ 30.4 $ 40.6 $ 15.6 $ 56.2 * Volume for 2005 includes Portmans results since the March 31, 2005 acquisition. Revenues from Iron Ore Sales and Services Sales revenue increased $156.5 million or approximately 77 percent. The increase in sales revenue was due to higher volume, $105.0 million and higher sales prices, $51.5 million. The 2.5 million tonne volume increase reflected the expansion of the Koolyanobbing operations in 2006 and the exclusion of sales prior to the March 31, 2005 acquisition. Portmans sales prices include the effects of a 19 percent increase in the international benchmark price of iron ore fines and lump. Cost of Goods Sold and Operating Expenses Cost of goods sold and operating expenses increased $100.3 million or approximately 58 percent. The increase primarily reflected the effect of higher volume and an increase in unit production costs, primarily higher contract labor. Sales Margin The sales margin increase of $56.2 million was primarily due to higher sales volume and prices, partially offset by higher unit production costs. 49 Table of Contents Other Operating Income The pre tax earnings changes for 2006 versus 2005 also included: A recovery in 2005 of $12.3 million related to a five week production curtailment at the Empire and Tilden mines in 2003 due to the loss of electric power as a result of flooding in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. We expect to recover a portion of our deductible in the second quarter of 2007, totaling $3.0 million; Higher administrative, selling and general expenses of $6.7 million reflecting increased outside professional services and full year expense at Portman, partially offset by lower incentive compensation; Higher customer bankruptcy recoveries in 2006 reflected complete recovery of our $3.9 million reserve related to WCIs 2003 bankruptcy filing. See Customers WCI in PART I for further information; and, Lower miscellaneous net expense of $2.6 million, primarily reflecting higher mark to market currency gains at Portman of $5.3 million, partially offset by the $3.0 million property damage insurance deductible associated with the electrical explosions at United Taconite. Other Income (Expense) Lower gain on sales of assets to PolyMet. We realized an $8.4 million gain on a 2006 sale, compared with a $9.5 million gain in 2005. See PolyMet for further information; Increased interest income of $3.3 million reflected higher average cash balances and higher interest rates; and, Lower other net expense of $6.7 million primarily reflected $9.8 million of currency hedging costs associated with the Portman acquisition in the first quarter of 2005, partially offset by $1.7 million of expense in 2006 related to the accelerated write off of debt issuance costs due to the replacement of our unsecured revolving credit facility. See NOTE 6 CREDIT FACILITIES for further information. Income Taxes During 2005, an $8.9 million adjustment to reverse a valuation allowance on net operating losses attributable to pre consolidated separate return years of one of our subsidiaries was recognized. Excluding the $8.9 million reversal in 2005, income tax expense of $90.9 million in 2006 was $2.8 million lower than the comparable amount last year. The decrease was due to a lower effective tax rate, partially offset by higher pre tax income in 2006. See NOTE 9 INCOME TAXES for further information. Minority Interest Minority interest increased $7.0 million, or almost 70 percent from the prior year. Minority interest represents the 19.6 percent minority interest in Portmans earnings. Discontinued Operations Our arrangements with Ferrominera, a government owned company responsible for the development of Venezuelas iron ore industry, to provide technical assistance in support of improving operations of a 3.3 million tonne per year pelletizing facility, were terminated in the third quarter of 2005. We recorded after tax income of $.2 million related to this contract in 2006, compared with 2005 after tax expense of $1.7 million, which included our exit costs. On July 23, 2004, CAL, an affiliate of the Company jointly owned by a subsidiary of the Company (82.3945 percent) and Outokumpu Technology GmbH (17.6055 percent), a German company (formerly known as Lurgi Metallurgie GmbH), completed the sale of CALs HBI facility located in Trinidad and Tobago to Mittal Steel USA. Terms of the sale included a purchase price of $8.0 million plus assumption of liabilities. Mittal Steel USA closed this facility at the end of 2005. We recorded after tax income of $.1 million in 2006, compared with after tax income of $.9 million in 2005. 50 Table of Contents The results of discontinued operations for CAL and Ferrominera were recorded under Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations in the Statements of Consolidated Operations. 2005 Versus 2004 North American Iron Ore Following is a summary of North American sales margin for 2005 versus 2004: (In Millions) Increase (Decrease) Due To: 2005 2004 Rate Volume Total Sales revenue* $ 1,307.7 $ 995.0 $ 328.0 $ (15.3 ) $ 312.7 Cost of goods sold and operating expenses* 949.1 845.5 116.6 (13.0 ) 103.6 Sales margin* $ 358.6 $ 149.5 $ 211.4 $ (2.3 ) $ 209.1 * Excludes freight and venture partners cost reimbursements. Revenues from Iron Ore Sales and Services Sales revenue increased $312.7 million or approximately 31 percent. The increase in sales revenue was due to higher sales prices, $328.0 million, partially offset by a sales volume decrease of $15.3 million. The 33 percent increase in sales prices primarily reflected the effect on Cliffs term supply agreement price adjustment factors of an approximate 86 percent increase in international pellet pricing, higher steel pricing, higher PPI and other contractual increases, including base price increases and lag year adjustments. Included in 2005 revenues was approximately .9 million tons of 2005 sales at 2004 contract prices and $2.4 million of price adjustments on 2004 sales. Cost of Goods Sold and Operating Expenses Cost of goods sold and operating expenses increased $103.6 million, or approximately 12 percent. The increase primarily reflected higher production costs of $116.6 million. Lower sales volume of .3 million tons reduced costs $13.0 million. The increase in unit production costs principally reflected higher energy pricing, increased maintenance costs, higher supply prices, and higher royalty rates due to increased pellet sales pricing. Sales Margin The sales margin improvement of $209.1 million in 2005 was principally due to an increase in sales price, partially offset by higher production costs and lower volume. Australia Iron Ore Revenues from Iron Ore Sales and Services Sales revenue of $204.5 million on 4.9 million tonnes of Portmans sales reflected results since the March 31, 2005 acquisition. Cost of Goods Sold and Operating Expenses Cost of goods sold and operating expenses of $174.1 million for the nine month period included $38.6 million of basis adjustments to inventory and mineral rights due to the preliminary allocation of the $433.1 million purchase price. Sales Margin The sales margin of $30.4 million on 4.9 million tonnes of Portmans sales reflected results since the March 31, 2005 acquisition. 51 Table of Contents Other Operating Income The pre tax earnings changes for 2005 versus 2004 also included: The previously noted business interruption insurance recovery in 2005 of $12.3 million; Higher royalties and management fee revenue of $1.8 million, primarily reflecting higher Wabush management fees due to the approximate 86 percent increase in Eastern Canadian pellet prices; Higher administrative, selling and general expense of $14.8 million reflecting higher stock based compensation and the inclusion of $5.5 million of Portmans expense since the acquisition; Lower impairment of mining asset charges, $5.8 million. Due primarily to the significant increase in 2005 pellet pricing, we determined, based on a cash flow analysis, that our Empire mine was no longer impaired; accordingly, capital additions at Empire in 2005 were not charged to expense; Lower provision for customer bankruptcy exposures, $3.6 million. Results for 2005 included a $1.9 million recovery from WCI. Results for 2004 included a first quarter charge related to a subsidiary of Weirton, $1.6 million; and Miscellaneous net expense, $9.1 million higher than the same period in 2004. Miscellaneous net included $5.2 million to clean a PCB spill at the Tilden mine in November 2005, and $1.9 million of expense at Portman since the acquisition. Other Income (Expense) Year 2004 results included a $152.7 million gain on the sale of directly held ISG common stock; A 2005 gain of $9.5 million on the sale of certain assets to PolyMet. See PolyMet for further information; Increased interest income of $2.4 million reflecting higher average cash and short term marketable securities balances and slightly higher rates; Increased interest expense of $3.7 million included $2.0 million of interest expense at Portman since the acquisition and interim borrowings (repaid within 100 days) under Cliffs $350 million revolving credit facility to supplement funds required for the Portman acquisition; and Higher other net expense of $11.5 million primarily reflected $9.8 million of currency hedging costs associated with the Portman acquisition. Income Taxes We entered 2005 with a valuation allowance to reduce a deferred tax asset related to $25.4 million of net operating losses attributable to pre consolidation years of one of our subsidiaries. In the fourth quarter of 2005, we determined, based on the existence of sufficient evidence, that we no longer required this valuation allowance. During 2005, an $8.9 million adjustment to reverse this valuation allowance was recognized. In the fourth quarter of 2004, we determined, based on the existence of sufficient evidence that we no longer required a previously established valuation allowance other than $8.9 million related to net operating loss carryforwards described above. During 2004, a $113.8 million adjustment to reduce the valuation allowance was recognized. Excluding the $8.9 million and $113.8 million valuation reversals in 2005 and 2004, respectively, income tax expense of $93.7 million in 2005 was $14.9 million higher than the comparable amount in 2004. The increase was due to higher pre tax income in 2005, partially offset by a lower effective tax rate. Minority Interest Minority interest was $10.1 million for 2005 and represented the 19.6 percent minority interest in Portmans earnings. 52 Table of Contents Discontinued Operations We recorded after tax income of $.9 million related to CAL in 2005, compared with after tax income of $3.1 million in 2004. We recorded after tax expense of $1.7 million related to our contract with Ferrominera in 2005, compared with after tax income of $.3 million in 2004. Cash Flow and Liquidity Following is a summary of our cash flows for 2006, 2005 and 2004: (In Millions) 2006 2005 2004 Net cash from (used by) operating activities $ 428.5 $ 514.6 $ (141.4 ) Capital expenditures (132.9 ) (106.3 ) (60.7 ) Investment in Portman (net of $24.1 million cash acquired) (409.0 ) Proceeds from sale of ISG common stock 170.1 Repurchases of common stock (121.5 ) Dividends on common and preferred stock (25.8 ) (18.7 ) (6.1 ) Proceeds from convertible preferred stock 172.5 Other 10.3 (2.5 ) 7.7 Increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents from continuing operations 158.6 (21.9 ) 142.1 Cash from (used by) discontinued operations .3 (2.2 ) 7.0 Increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 158.9 $ (24.1 ) $ 149.1 Net cash from operating activities (operating cash flows) included $79.2 million and $68.3 million related to Portman in 2006 and 2005, respectively. The decrease in operating cash flows in 2006 compared with 2005 was primarily due to lower cash provided from changes in operating assets and liabilities. Operating cash flows in 2006 include $62.6 million relating to 1.2 million tons of pellets purchased by two customers for which revenue has been deferred until the product is delivered in 2007. Operating cash flows in 2005 included the proceeds from the sale of $182.7 million of highly liquid marketable securities used in connection with our acquisition of Portman, net of $9.9 million purchases of ARS. Operating cash flows in 2006 compared with 2005 also reflected higher cash flows resulting from higher payables and accrued expenses. At December 31, 2006, there were 3.8 million tons of pellets in inventory at a cost of $129.5 million, ..5 million tons higher than last year, an increase of $24.2 million. The increase in pellet inventory was primarily due to lower sales volume, partially offset by lower production. See Production and Sales Volume for further information regarding North American production. At December 31, 2006, Portman had .9 million tonnes of finished product inventory at a cost of $20.8 million, .3 million tonnes higher than last year, or an increase of $7.0 million. The increase in inventory is primarily due to increased production attributable to the expansion of the Koolyanobbing operations. Net cash from operating activities in 2006 and 2005 also reflected $95.7 million and $86.2 million of income tax payments and $64.2 million and $55.8 million of contributions to pension plans and VEBAs, respectively. In 2006, we received a $67.5 million refund from the WEPCO escrow account. See Wisconsin Electric Power Company Dispute for further information. Capital expenditures included $39.6 million and $37.2 million related to Portman in 2006 and 2005, respectively. We anticipate that total cash used for investments and capital expenditures in 2007 will be approximately $460 million, including $240 million associated with the Amapa Project and $96 million with the Sonoma Coal Project. The Amapa Project investment is comprised of the $133 million initial investment, $26.8 million for our share of Amapas 2007 capital expenditures and $84 million of construction expenditures financed by project level debt. Capital expenditures at our North American and Portman operations are estimated 53 Table of Contents at $123 million. Included in the 2007 capital spending estimate is $19 million related to the .8 million ton capacity expansion at the Northshore mine. We expect to fund our capital expenditures from available cash, current operations and borrowings under our credit facility. Common stock repurchases in 2006 reflected the purchase of 3.2 million shares of 4.5 million shares authorized under two 2006 repurchase programs. Also, we increased our quarterly common share dividend to $.125 per share from $.10 per share effective on June 1, 2006 and to $.10 per share from $.05 per share effective on September 1, 2005. Following is a summary of key liquidity measures: At December 31 (In Millions) 2006 2005 2004 Cash and cash equivalents $ 351.7 $ 192.8 $ 216.9 Marketable securities trading $ 9.9 $ 182.7 Debt $ (6.9 ) $ (7.7 ) Working capital $ 407.4 $ 273.3 $ 474.3 Cash and cash equivalents included $97.6 million and $54.7 million at Portman in 2006 and 2005, respectively. In June 2006, we entered into a five year unsecured credit agreement with a syndicate of 16 financial institutions. The new facility provides $500 million in borrowing capacity under a revolving credit line, with no scheduled maturities other than the five year term of the agreement; loans are made with a choice of interest rates and maturities, subject to the terms of the agreement. The new credit agreement replaced an existing $350 million unsecured revolving credit facility, which was scheduled to expire in March 2008. The current facility has financial covenants based on earnings, debt and fixed cost coverage. Interest rates are either (1) a range from LIBOR plus .75 to LIBOR plus 1.50 percent, based on debt and earnings, or (2) the prime rate. Borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement were $135 million at May 16, 2007. We were in compliance with the covenants in the credit agreement as of December 31, 2006 and March 31, 2007. Per the terms of the credit agreement, we are required to deliver annual financial statements to the lenders within 90 days of fiscal year end. On April 18, 2007, we received a waiver extending the requirement to 180 days following fiscal year end. During the fourth quarter of 2006, Portman reduced its A$40 million multi option credit facility to A$11.8 million, which represents the outstanding commitments under performance bonds. Portman entered into a new A$40 million multi option credit facility in April 2007. Borrowings outstanding under Portmans facility totaled A$13.3 million at March 31, 2007. In 2005, Portman secured five year financing from its customers in China to assist with the funding of the expansion of its Koolyanobbing mining operation. The borrowings, totaling $6.9 million at December 31, 2006, accrue interest annually at five percent. The borrowings require an approximate $.8 million principal payment plus accrued interest to be made each January 31 for the next three years with the remaining balance due in full on January 31, 2010. 54 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Other than operating leases primarily utilized for certain equipment and office space, we do not have any off balance sheet financing.

Production and Sales Volume Production Following is a summary of production tonnage for 2006, 2005 and 2004: Production (In Millions) Company Share Total Production Mine 2006 2005 2004 2006 2005 2004 North America (1) Empire 3.8 3.8 4.3 4.9 4.8 5.4 Tilden 5.9 6.7 6.6 6.9 7.9 7.8 Hibbing 1.9 2.0 1.9 8.3 8.5 8.3 Northshore 5.1 4.9 5.0 5.1 4.9 5.0 United Taconite 3.0 3.4 2.9 4.3 4.9 4.1 Wabush 1.1 1.3 1.0 4.1 4.9 3.8 Total 20.8 22.1 21.7 33.6 35.9 34.4 Australia (2) Koolyanobbing 7.0 4.7 Cockatoo Island .7 .5 Total 7.7 5.2 (1) Long tons of pellets of 2,240 pounds. (2) Metric tonnes of 2,205 pounds. Totals reflect production since the March 31, 2005 acquisition. Cockatoo production reflects our 50 percent share. 55 Table of Contents Production at Tilden in 2006 was lower than the previous year due to unplanned equipment repairs and a change in mix to produce more magnetite pellets to fulfill customer requirements. Magnetite pellets have lower productivity than hematite pellets. The decrease in United Taconite production was due to the electrical explosions at the United Taconite processing plant on October 12, 2006. Production at the United Taconite plant was temporarily curtailed as a result of the loss of electrical power resulting from the explosions. Repairs to the plants Line 2 were completed and full production resumed in January 2007. The decrease in Wabush production in 2006 was due to continued mining difficulties. Crude ore mining was significantly impacted by pit de watering difficulties, which adversely impacted production and costs. Wabush successfully completed actions that increased annual pellet production to a 4.9 million ton rate by the end of 2006. Additionally, a C$1.4 million project was approved in 2006 to install a manganese reduction test circuit on one processing line in the Wabush concentrator. Successful operations of the test circuit could lead to the installation of manganese reduction on all Wabush processing lines. The capability to remove manganese from crude ore could allow the processing of ores previously classified as waste and potentially extend the life of the mine. Production at Wabush for 2007 is estimated at 4.8 million tons of pellets. During 2004, we initiated capacity expansion projects at our United Taconite and Northshore mines in Minnesota. An idled pellet furnace at United Taconite was restarted in the fourth quarter of 2004, which added approximately 1.0 million tons (our share .7 million tons) to annual production capacity. In 2006, we reinitiated construction activity to restart an idled furnace at Northshore. The project, which will increase Northshores capacity by ..8 million tons, is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2008. The furnace, idled since 1982, initially was scheduled to restart in late 2005; however the restart had been put on hold due to market conditions. Portmans 2005 production reflects results since the March 31, 2005 acquisition. An expansion of the Koolyanobbing facility was completed in 2006 that increased the Portmans wholly owned production capacity from six to eight million tonnes per annum. Sales Our pellet sales for the year 2006 were 20.4 million tons, compared with 22.3 million tons in 2005. The decrease in pellet sales was primarily due to lower consignment sales as a result of customers inventory requirements and programmed contractual changes with customers. Our sales are largely committed under term supply agreements, which are subject to changes in customer requirements. Portman sold 7.4 million tonnes of fines and lump ore in 2006, compared with 4.9 million tonnes in 2005. The increase in fines and lump ore sales principally reflect nine months of sales in 2005 since the acquisition. Production is fully committed to steel companies in China and Japan through 2009. Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits Defined benefit pension expense totaled $26.4 million and $20.7 million for 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in defined benefit pension expense was due primarily to a decrease in discount rates. OPEB expense totaled $11.2 million and $17.9 million for 2006 and 2005, respectively. The decrease in OPEB expense was due to higher expected asset returns and lower loss amortization. The higher asset returns mainly reflect additional VEBA contributions agreed to under the existing labor agreement with the USW. The decrease in loss amortization is due to longer amortization periods reflecting increased remaining service lives of employees. See Employee Retirement Benefit Obligations under Critical Accounting Policies in Item 7 and NOTE 8 RETIREMENT RELATED BENEFITS for further information. Wisconsin Electric Power Company Dispute Two of our mines, Tilden and Empire (the Mines), currently purchase their electric power from WEPCO pursuant to the terms of special contracts specifying prices based on WEPCOs actual costs. Effective April 1, 56 Table of Contents 2005, WEPCO unilaterally changed its method of calculating the energy charges to the Mines. It was the Mines contention that WEPCOs new billing methodology was inconsistent with the terms of the parties contracts and on September 20, 2005, the Mines filed a Demand for Arbitration with the American Arbitration Association with respect to the dispute. Pursuant to the terms of the relevant contracts, disputed amounts were deposited into an interest bearing account maintained by a bank. An interim agreement was entered into effective May 5, 2006, between WEPCO and the Mines. Under the terms of the agreement, we received a net amount of $67.5 million, representing a rebate of amounts in excess of certain contractual caps paid either to WEPCO or placed in escrow. The agreement also temporarily adjusted the billing and payment provisions of the contracts during the pendency of the arbitration, without affecting the final outcome of the dispute. As of December 31, 2006, a total of approximately $32 million remained in the escrow accounts which represents a portion of WEPCOs 2005 and 2006 billings, plus accrued interest. On May 3, 2007, the Mines and WEPCO settled their dispute. Under the terms of the Settlement Agreement and Release (the Settlement), the Mines received $32.5 million from escrow and paid $9.0 million to WEPCO. Additionally, WEPCO paid the Mines a rebate for over the cap payments of $2.6 million. As a result of the settlement, we will recognize a $10.3 million pre tax gain in the second quarter of 2007. In addition, under the Settlement, the Mines will be billed for electric service from April 1, 2007 at the same rate as provided in the interim agreement. Upon termination of the special contracts on December 31, 2007, the Mines will be subject to the then applicable tariffs approved by the Michigan Public Service Commission. In anticipation of the termination of these two power supply contracts, on September 8, 2006, the Mines filed a Complaint and Application for Emergency Relief with the Michigan Public Service Commission (the Commission), Case No. U 15039 (the Application), under which the Mines requested a special transitional rate equivalent to the midpoint between the rates payable under the current power agreements and the applicable industrial tariff rate. The Mines requested that the special transitional rate be available for ten years. On September 28, 2006, prior to the Commission taking any action on the Application, WEPCO filed a rate case with the Commission, MPCS Case no. U 15071 (the Rate Case), which included an industrial rate that would be applicable to the Mines. Subsequently, on October 12, 2006, the Commission issued an Order Combining Dockets, under which the Mines Application was combined with WEPCOs rate case. The Order Combining Dockets also established a nine month schedule for the combined proceedings, with a final order to be issued in July 2007. On April 30, 2007, the Mines and WEPCO entered into a Settlement Agreement for Final Rate Relief and Tariff Approvals (the Tariff Agreement). Under the Tariff Agreement, the Mines and WEPCO reached an agreement as to the tariff rate to be charged to the Mines under the industrial tariff. Any impact from the results of the combined proceeding will not occur until 2008, when the Power Supply Contracts terminate and it is anticipated that the Mines will be on an industrial tariff. Environmental and Mine Closure Obligations The iron ore industry has been identified by the EPA as an industrial category that emits pollutants established by the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments. These pollutants included over 200 substances that are now classified as HAP. EPA is required to develop rules that would require major sources of HAP to utilize MACT standards for their emissions. Pursuant to this statutory requirement, the EPA published a final rule on October 30, 2003 imposing emission limitations and other requirements on taconite iron ore processing operations. We complied with the new requirements by the October 31, 2006 deadline. Our capital expenditures in 2006 to meet the MACT standards were $4.3 million. At December 31, 2006, we had environmental and mine closure obligations, including our share of the obligations of ventures, of $122.2 million ($115.4 million at December 31, 2005), of which $13.6 million is current. Payments in 2006 were $15.6 million ($5.6 million in 2005). The obligations at December 31, 2006 include certain responsibilities for environmental remediation sites, $12.9 million, closure of LTVSMC, $28.2 million, and obligations for closure of our six North American operating mines, $68.3 million, and $12.8 million for Portman. See NOTE 5 ENVIRONMENTAL AND MINE CLOSURE OBLIGATIONS for more information. 57 Table of Contents Strategic Investments We intend to continue to pursue investment and operations management opportunities to broaden our scope as a supplier of iron ore and other raw materials to the integrated steel industry through the acquisition of additional mining interests to strengthen our market position. We are particularly focused on expanding our investments to capitalize on global demand for steel, iron ore and coal. Our innovative United Taconite joint venture with Laiwu and our Portman acquisition are examples of our ability to expand geographically, and we continue to pursue similar opportunities in other regions. In the event of any future acquisitions or joint venture opportunities, we may consider using available liquidity or other sources of funding to make investments. Sonoma Coal Project On April 18, 2007, we completed the acquisition of an effective 45 percent interest in the Sonoma Coal Project in Queensland, Australia. As of May 3, 2007, we invested $15.6 million toward the purchase of mining tenements and $19.4 million toward the construction of a washplant. We will operate and own 100 percent of the washplant and 8.3 percent of the mining leases, resulting in a 45 percent economic interest in Sonoma. The Sonoma Coal Project is expected to initially produce two million tonnes of marketable coal annually, beginning late in 2007. Production from Sonoma will include an approximately equal mix of hard coking coal and thermal coal. Plans call for annual production to increase to between three million and four million tonnes during 2008. The Sonoma Coal Project has a current resource estimate of 107 million tonnes. Centennial Amapa On March 5, 2007, we acquired a 30 percent interest in MMX Amapa Mineracao LTDA., a Brazilian company developing an iron ore project (Amapa Project), through the acquisition of 100 percent of the shares of Centennial Amapa. The remaining 70 percent of the Amapa Project is owned by MMX Mineracao e Metallicos S.A., which is providing corporate and institutional support, while we will supply technical support for construction and operations. The purchase price for our 30 percent interest was $133 million, paid with cash on hand. Total capital expenditures are estimated to be $357 million, of which approximately $268 million will be funded with project debt. Capital contributions of $89.3 million were paid by Cliffs and MMX to fund the project; Cliffs 30 percent share was $26.8 million. We may be responsible for 30 percent of any future capital contributions. The Amapa Project consists of a significant iron ore deposit, a 192 kilometer railway connecting the mine location to an existing port facility and 71 hectares of real estate on the banks of the Amazon River, reserved for a loading terminal. The Amapa Project is currently under construction and is expected to produce 6.5 million tonnes of iron ore concentrate annually once fully operational. Iron ore concentrate is expected to be sold, pursuant to a long term supply agreement, to an operator of an iron oxide pelletizing plant in the Kingdom of Bahrain. Production is expected to begin in late 2007. Mesabi Nugget Project In November 2006, we announced that the participants, principally Cliffs, Steel Dynamics and Kobe Steel, were unable to reach agreement on terms necessary to move forward with construction of a reduced iron plant. Cliffs and the other principal parties suspended efforts to jointly develop the Mesabi Nugget Project at our Cliffs Erie site in Hoyt Lakes, Minnesota. However, the Company and Kobe Steel are evaluating opportunities to proceed with development of a commercial scale reduced iron plant, which will convert taconite into nearly pure iron in nugget form utilizing Kobe Steels ITmk3 technology. The high iron content product could be utilized to replace steel scrap as a raw material for electric steel furnaces or basic oxygen furnaces of integrated steel producers or as feedstock for the foundry industry. Portman Acquisition On April 19, 2005, Cliffs Asia Pacific completed the acquisition of 80.4 percent of the outstanding shares of Portman, a Western Australia based independent iron ore mining and exploration company. The acquisition was 58 Table of Contents initiated on March 31, 2005 by the purchase of approximately 68.7 percent of the outstanding shares of Portman. The assets consist primarily of iron ore inventory, land, mineral rights and iron ore reserves. The purchase price of the 80.4 percent interest was $433.1 million, including $12.4 million of acquisition costs. Additionally, we incurred $9.8 million of foreign currency hedging costs related to this transaction, which were included in Other net in the first quarter 2005 Statements of Consolidated Operations. The acquisition increased our customer base in China and Japan and established our presence in the Australian mining industry. Portmans full year 2006 and 2005 production (excluding its share of the 50 percent owned Cockatoo Island joint venture) was 7.0 million tonnes and 6.0 million tonnes, respectively. Portman completed a $62 million project that increased its wholly owned production capacity to eight million tonnes per year in the first half of 2006. The production is fully committed to steel companies in China and Japan through 2009. Portmans reserves total approximately 88 million tonnes at December 31, 2006, and it has an active exploration program underway to increase its reserves. The acquisition and related costs were financed with existing cash and marketable securities and $175 million of interim borrowings under a three year $350 million revolving credit facility. The outstanding balance was repaid in full in July 2005. See NOTE 6 CREDIT FACILITIES. The Statements of Consolidated Financial Position of the Company as of December 31, 2006 and 2005 reflect the acquisition of Portman, effective March 31, 2005, under the purchase method of accounting. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed have been recorded at estimated fair values as of the March 31, 2005 initial acquisition date as determined by the results of an appraisal, which was finalized in the first quarter of 2006. See NOTE 2 PORTMAN ACQUISITION for further information regarding the final purchase price allocation. PolyMet On November 15, 2005, we reached an agreement with PolyMet regarding the terms for the early exercise of PolyMets 2004 option to acquire land, crushing and concentrating and other ancillary facilities located at our Cliffs Erie site (formerly owned by LTVSMC) and closed the sales transaction resulting in a $9.5 million pre tax gain. PolyMets parent company, Polymet Mining Corporation (PolyMet Corp) is a non ferrous mining company located in Vancouver, B.C. Canada. PolyMet Corps stock trades on the AMEX in the U.S. under the symbol PLM. Under the terms of the agreement, we received cash of $1.0 million and approximately 6.2 million common shares of PolyMet Corp, which closed that day at $1.25 per share. ($3.14 per share at December 31, 2006). The $9.5 million gain included recognition of a $.7 million deferred gain from 2004. The additional PolyMet Corp shares received in this transaction are classified as available for sale in Other assets on our Statements of Consolidated Financial Position. We expect to receive additional cash proceeds of $2.4 million in quarterly installments of $.25 million by and according to the terms of the contract for deed executed by the parties, which installments will be recognized as received. In December 2006, Cliffs Erie sold to PolyMet additional owned or leased real property, various mining, railroad and service facilities and associated service permits. The sale included, but is not limited to, a 120 car rail fleet, locomotive fueling and railway maintenance buildings, railway track and rights, an administration building, pump houses, pipelines, power lines and support equipment. Proceeds from the transaction were: $1.0 million in cash; Two million shares of the common stock of PolyMet Corp, valued at $3.09 per common share at December 20, 2006, which are valued at $3.14 at December 31, 2006; $7.0 million in cash payable in quarterly installments of $.25 million commencing December 31, 2006, with the balance payable upon receipt of PolyMets commercial finance. Interest will be payable quarterly from December 31 at the Wall Street Journal Prime Rate; and $7.0 million in cash payable in quarterly installments of $.25 million commencing on December 31, 2009, with a balloon payment of the remaining amount due December 31, 2011, plus interest on the unpaid balance from December 31, 2009, which installment will be recognized as received. We recognized a $7.4 million pre tax gain in the fourth quarter of 2006 as a result of the December 2006 transaction. As a final component of the purchase price, PolyMet will assume from Cliffs certain on going site 59 Table of Contents related environmental and reclamation obligations. See Mine Closure in NOTE 5 ENVIRONMENTAL AND MINE CLOSURE OBLIGATIONS. We also recognized a $1.0 million pre tax gain resulting from the 2006 receipt of four quarterly installments of $.25 million associated with the November 2005 PolyMet transaction. Cliffs now owns 9.2 million shares of PolyMet Corp common stock, representing 7.7 percent of issued shares. We intend to hold our shares of PolyMet Corp indefinitely. Cliffs has the right to participate in up to 7.7 percent of any future financing and PolyMet has the first right to acquire or place Cliffs shares should it choose to sell. The two million shares received in the December 2006 transaction could not be sold, transferred or traded in Canada until April 21, 2007. Sales of the unregistered shares in the United States are subject to the trading volume restrictions outlined in Rule 144 of the Securities Act of 1933. It has been determined that the shares are appropriately classified as Marketable securities on the Statements of Consolidated Financial Position and valued (marked to market) at the current trading price. There are no restrictions related to the 7.2 million shares previously owned. Market Risk We are subject to a variety of market risks, including those caused by changes in market value of equity investments, commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. We have established policies and procedures to manage risks; however, certain risks are beyond our control. Our investment policy relating to cash and cash equivalents is to preserve principal and liquidity while maximizing the return through investment of available funds. The carrying value of these investments approximates fair value on the reporting dates. At December 31, 2005, we held investments in highly liquid auction rate securities in order to generate higher than typical money market investments. ARS typically are high credit quality, generally achieved with municipal bond insurance. Credit risks are eased by the historical track record of bond insurers, which back a majority of this market. Although rare, sell orders for any security traded through a Dutch auction process could exceed bids. Such instances are usually the result of a drastic deterioration of issuer credit quality. Should there be a failed auction, ARS holders may be unable to liquidate their positions in the securities in the near term. The rising cost of energy is an important issue for us as it comprises approximately 25 percent of our North American production costs. Our North American mining ventures consumed approximately 15.1 million mmbtus of natural gas and 25.2 million gallons of diesel fuel (our share 11.0 million mmbtus and 15.9 million gallons of diesel fuel) in 2006. In 2006, the average price paid by the North American mining ventures was $8.32 per mmbtu for natural gas and $2.15 per gallon for diesel fuel. Recent trends indicate that electric power, natural gas and oil costs can be expected to increase over time, although the direction and magnitude of short term changes are difficult to predict. Our strategy to address increasing energy rates includes improving efficiency in energy usage and utilizing the lowest cost alternative fuel. We also use forward purchases of natural gas and diesel fuel to stabilize fluctuations in near term prices. Our mining ventures enter into forward contracts for certain commodities, primarily natural gas and diesel fuel, as a hedge against price volatility. Such contracts, which are in quantities expected to be delivered and used in the production process, are a means to limit exposure to price fluctuations. At December 31, 2006, the notional amounts of the outstanding natural gas and diesel forward contracts were $80.0 million (our share $72.5 million), with an unrecognized fair value loss of $12.6 million (our share $11.3 million) based on December 31, 2006 forward rates. The natural gas contracts mature at various times through October 2007 and the diesel fuel contracts mature at various times through December 31, 2009. For 2007, we purchased or have forward purchase contracts for 6.3 million mmbtus of natural gas at an average price of $8.69 per mmbtu and 8.7 million gallons of diesel fuel at $2.07 per gallon for our North American mining ventures. If the forward rates were to change 10 percent from the year end rate, the value and potential cash flow effect on the contracts would be approximately $6.7 million (our share $6.1 million). Our share of Wabush Mines operation in Canada represented approximately five percent of our North American pellet production. This operation is subject to currency exchange fluctuations between the U.S. and Canadian dollars; however, we do not hedge our exposure to this currency exchange fluctuation. Between 2003 and 2006, the value of the Canadian dollar rose against the U.S. dollar from $.64 U.S. dollar per Canadian dollar 60 Table of Contents at the beginning of 2003 to $.86 U.S. dollars per Canadian dollar at December 31, 2006, an increase of 34 percent. The average exchange rate increased to $.88 U.S. dollar per Canadian dollar in 2006 from an average of $.77 U.S. dollar per Canadian dollar for 2004, an increase of 14 percent. We are subject to changes in foreign currency exchange rates in Australia as a result of our operations at Portman, which could impact our financial condition. Foreign exchange risk arises from our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates because our reporting currency is the United States dollar. We do not hedge our exposure to this currency exchange fluctuation. A hypothetical 10 percent movement in quoted foreign currency exchange rates could result in a fair value change of approximately $55 million in our net investment. Portman hedges a portion of its United States currency denominated sales in accordance with a formal policy. The primary objective for using derivative financial instruments is to reduce the earnings volatility attributable to changes in Australian and United States currency fluctuations. The instruments are subject to formal documentation, intended to achieve qualifying hedge treatment, and are tested at inception and at each reporting period as to effectiveness. Changes in fair value for highly effective hedges are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income. Ineffective portions are charged to operations. At December 31, 2006, Portman had outstanding hedges totaling A$268.2 million in the form of call options, collar options, convertible collar options and forward exchange contracts. The contracts have varying maturity dates ranging from January 2007 to June 2009, and a fair value gain based on the December 31, 2006 exchange rate of A$9.9 million. A one percent increase in rates from the month end rate would increase the fair value and cash flow by A$1.9 million and a one percent decrease would decrease the fair value and cash flow by A$1.5 million. Outlook North America Although production schedules are subject to change, all of our operations are expected to operate at or near capacity in 2007, with the exception of Hibbing. In late February 2007, Hibbing was forced to shut down production operations due to severe weather conditions that caused significant buildup of ice in the basin supplying water to the processing facility. The operation resumed limited production in late March, with full production in early April. Production loss totaled approximately .8 million tons (Company share .2 million tons). Cliffs total North American pellet production is expected to be approximately 35 million tons with our share approximately 22 million tons. Our 2007 North American sales volume is projected to be approximately 22 million tons. Revenue per ton from iron ore sales and services (excluding freight and venture partners cost reimbursements), which is expected to increase approximately two percent per ton for full year 2007, is dependent upon several price adjustment factors included in our term sales contracts, primarily the percentage change from 2006 to 2007 in the international pellet price for blast furnace pellets, PPI and actual 2007 steel pricing for one of our customers. Following is the estimated impact to our average North American revenue per ton from iron ore sales and services (excluding freight and venture partners cost reimbursements) based on 2006 realization of $64.25 per ton: The settlement of the World Pellet Price in 2007 is expected to increase our average pellet sales realization by $.63 per ton; Each one percent change in the PPI Industrial Commodities less fuel and PPI Fuel and Related Products indices is anticipated to result in $.12 per ton and $.07 per ton, respectively; Each $10 increase from $560 per ton in the average hot rolled steel price at certain steelmaking facilities will result in a $.26 per ton increase in our 2007 average realization; and Known year over year increases representing a combination of contractual base price increases, lag year adjustments and capped pricing on one contract will result in a $.92 per ton increase in our 2007 average realization. In March 2007, Eastern Canadian 2007 pellet prices, which are the predominant international prices affecting our North American contracts, increased 5.80 percent. 61 Table of Contents We are currently in a contractual dispute with Algoma over the timing of the price reopener in our 15 year term supply agreement. Algoma maintains that the price reopener is effective for 2007 sales, while our position is that the reopener is effective in 2008. We have agreed to resolve the issue through binding arbitration, which is anticipated to be completed in 2008. Resolution of this issue could adversely affect our revenues related to sales to Algoma in 2007. North American production costs per ton are expected to increase approximately two percent from the 2006 cost of goods sold and operating expenses (excluding freight and venture partners cost reimbursements) of $48.17 per ton. Australia Portmans estimate of 2007 production is 8.4 million tonnes, including .6 million from Cockatoo Island. Feasibility studies have concluded that mining and shipments from the current operations at Cockatoo Island can be continued until late 2007. Portmans estimate of 2007 sales is 8.2 million tonnes, compared with 7.4 million tonnes in 2006. In December 2006, settlements between a number of the major sea borne iron ore producers and the Chinese steel industry resulted in a 9.5 percent increase for 2007. Sales of lump and fines ore from Portman will reflect that negotiated increase, and combined with other factors, is expected to result in an approximate six percent increase on a Cliffs basis. Unit production costs are expected to increase approximately eight percent from 2006, due primarily to higher contract labor. Critical Accounting Policies Managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. Preparation of financial statements requires management to make assumptions, estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses, and the related disclosures of contingencies. Management bases its estimates on various assumptions and historical experience, which are believed to be reasonable; however, due to the inherent nature of estimates, actual results may differ significantly due to changed conditions or assumptions. On a regular basis, management reviews the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are fairly presented in accordance with GAAP. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material. Management believes that the following critical accounting estimates and judgments have a significant impact on our financial statements. Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized on the sale of products when title to the product has transferred to the customer in accordance with the specified terms of each term supply agreement and all applicable criteria for revenue recognition have been satisfied. Generally, our North American term supply agreements provide that title transfers to the customers when payment is received. In December 2006, two customers purchased and paid for 1.2 million tons of pellets in upper lakes stockpiles to meet 2006 contractual requirements. At the request of the customers, the ore was not shipped. The Company considered whether revenue should be recognized on these sales under the bill and hold guidance discussed in SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101 Topic No. 13, but because a fixed shipment schedule was not established prior to year end, revenue recognition on these transactions, totaling $62.6 million, has been deferred until the product is delivered. Most of our North American long term supply agreements are comprised of a base price with annual price adjustment factors. These price adjustment factors vary from agreement to agreement but typically include adjustments based upon changes in international pellet prices, changes in specified Producers Price Indices including those for all commodities, industrial commodities, energy and steel. The adjustments generally operate in the same manner, with each factor typically comprising a portion of the price adjustment, although the weighting of each factor varies from agreement to agreement. One of our term supply agreements contains price collars, which typically limit the percentage increase or decrease in prices for our iron ore pellets during any one year. In most cases, these adjustment factors have not been finalized at the time our product is sold; we routinely 62 Table of Contents estimate these adjustment factors. The price adjustment factors have been evaluated as embedded derivatives. We evaluated the embedded derivatives in the supply agreements in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. The price adjustment factors share the same economic characteristics and risks as the host contract and are integral to the host contract as inflation adjustments; accordingly they have not been separately valued as derivative instruments. Certain supply agreements with one customer include provisions for supplemental revenue or refunds based on the customers annual steel pricing for the year the product is consumed in the customers blast furnaces. We account for this provision as derivative instruments at the time of sale and record this provision at fair value until the year the product is consumed and the amounts are settled as an adjustment to revenue. Under some North American term supply agreements, we ship the product to ports on the Great Lakes and or to the customers facilities prior to the transfer of title. Our rationale for shipping iron ore products to some customers in advance of payment for the products is to more closely relate timing of payment by customers to consumption, which also provides additional liquidity to our customers. Generally, our North American term supply agreements specify that title and risk of loss pass to the customer when payment for the pellets is received. This is a practice utilized to reduce our financial risk to customer insolvency. This practice is not believed to be widely used throughout the balance of the industry. Revenue is recognized on services when the services are performed. Where we are joint venture participants in the ownership of a North American mine, our contracts entitle us to receive royalties and management fees, which we earn as the pellets are produced. Portmans sales revenue is recognized at the F.O.B. point, which is generally when the product is loaded into the vessel. Foreign currency revenues are converted to Australian dollars at the currency exchange rate in effect at the time of the transaction. See Accounting Policies in Item 8 for a complete discussion of our revenue recognition policy. Litigation Accruals We are subject to proceedings, lawsuits and other claims. We are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as the potential ranges of probable losses. A determination of the amount of accrual required, if any, for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each matter. The required accrual may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach, such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters. We do not believe that any such matter will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Tax Contingencies Domestic and foreign tax authorities periodically audit our income tax returns. These audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. At any time, multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various tax authorities. In evaluating the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions, we record reserves for exposures on a probable basis. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter, for which we have established a reserve, is audited and fully resolved. When facts change or the actual results of a settlement with tax authorities differs from our established reserve for a matter, we adjust our tax contingencies reserve and income tax provision in the period in which the facts changed or the income tax matter is resolved. Iron Ore Reserves We regularly evaluate our economic iron ore reserves and update them as required in accordance with SEC Industry Guide 7. The estimated ore reserves could be affected by future industry conditions, geological conditions and ongoing mine planning. Maintenance of effective production capacity or the ore reserve could require increases in capital and development expenditures. Generally as mining operations progress, haul lengths and lifts increase. Alternatively, changes in economic conditions, or the expected quality of ore reserves could decrease capacity or ore reserves. Technological progress could alleviate such factors, or increase capacity or ore reserves. 63 Table of Contents We use our ore reserve estimates combined with our estimated annual production levels, to determine the mine closure dates utilized in recording the fair value liability for asset retirement obligations. See NOTE 5 ENVIRONMENTAL AND MINE CLOSURE OBLIGATIONS for further information. Since the liability represents the present value of the expected future obligation, a significant change in ore reserves or mine lives would have a substantial effect on the recorded obligation. We also utilize economic ore reserves for evaluating potential impairments of mine assets and in determining maximum useful lives utilized to calculate depreciation and amortization of long lived mine assets. Decreases in ore reserves or mine lives could significantly affect these items. Asset Retirement Obligations The accrued mine closure obligations for our active mining operations provides for contractual and legal obligations associated with the eventual closure of the mining operations. Our obligations are determined based on detailed estimates adjusted for factors that an outside party would consider (i.e., inflation, overhead and profit), which were escalated (at an assumed three percent) to the estimated closure dates, and then discounted using a credit adjusted risk free interest rate of 10.25 percent (12.0 percent for United Taconite and 5.5 percent for Portman) for the initial estimates. The estimates at December 31, 2006 and 2005 were revised using incremental increases in the closure cost estimates and minor changes in estimates of mine lives. The closure date for each location was determined based on the exhaustion date of the remaining iron ore reserves. The estimated obligations are particularly sensitive to the impact of changes in mine lives given the difference between the inflation and discount rates. Changes in the base estimates of legal and contractual closure costs due to changed legal or contractual requirements, available technology, inflation, overhead or profit rates would also have a significant impact on the recorded obligations. See NOTE 6 ENVIRONMENTAL AND MINE CLOSURE OBLIGATIONS for further information. Asset Impairment We monitor conditions that indicate that the carrying value of an asset or asset group may be impaired. We determine impairment based on the assets ability to generate cash flow greater than its carrying value, utilizing an undiscounted probability weighted analysis. If the analysis indicates the asset is impaired, the carrying value is adjusted to fair value. Fair value can be determined by market value and also comparable sales transactions or using a discounted cash flow method. The impairment analysis and fair value determination can result in significantly different outcomes based on critical assumptions and estimates including the quantity and quality of remaining economic ore reserves, future iron ore prices and production costs. Environmental Remediation Costs We have a formal policy for environmental protection and restoration. Our obligations for known environmental problems at active and closed mining operations and other sites have been recognized based on estimates of the cost of investigation and remediation at each site. If the estimate can only be estimated as a range of possible amounts, with no specific amount being most likely, the minimum of the range is accrued. Management reviews its environmental remediation sites quarterly to determine if additional cost adjustments or disclosures are required. The characteristics of environmental remediation obligations, where information concerning the nature and extent of clean up activities is not immediately available, or changes in regulatory requirements, result in a significant risk of increase to the obligations as they mature. Expected future expenditures are not discounted to present value unless the amount and timing of the cash disbursements are readily known. Potential insurance recoveries are not recognized until realized. Employee Retirement Benefit Obligations The Company and its mining ventures sponsor defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all North American employees. These plans are largely noncontributory, and benefits are generally based on employees years of service and average earnings for a defined period prior to retirement. Portman does not have employee retirement benefit obligations. 64 Table of Contents Additionally, the Company and its ventures provide postretirement medical and OPEBs to most full time employees who meet certain length of service and age requirements. For several years prior to 2003, our pension and medical costs (including OPEB) had increased substantially. Lower interest rates, lower asset returns and continued escalation of medical costs had been the predominant causes of the increases. We have since taken actions to control pension and medical costs which have helped to maintain current pension expense levels and decrease postretirement welfare expense amounts. On July 1, 2003, we implemented changes to U.S. salaried employee plans that reduced costs by more than an estimated $8.0 million on an annualized basis. Benefits under the current defined benefit formula were frozen for affected U.S. salaried employees and a new cash balance formula was instituted. Increases in affected U.S. salaried retiree healthcare co pays became effective for retirements after June 30, 2003. A cap on our share of annual medical premiums was also implemented for existing and future U.S. salaried retirees. Pursuant to the four year U.S. labor agreements reached with the USW, effective August 1, 2004, OPEB expense for 2004 and the APBO decreased $4.9 million and $48.0 million, respectively, to reflect negotiated plan changes, which capped our share of future bargaining unit retirees healthcare premiums at 2008 levels for the years 2009 and beyond. The agreements also provide that the Company and its partners fund an estimated $220 million into bargaining unit pension plans and VEBAs during the term of the contracts. On September 12, 2006, the Companys Board of Directors approved modifications to the pension benefits provided to salaried participants. The modifications retroactively reinstated the final average pay benefit formula (previously terminated and replaced with a cash balance formula in July 2003) to allow for additional accruals through June 30, 2008 or the continuation of benefits under an improved cash balance formula, whichever is greater. The change increased the PBO by $15.1 million and pension expense by $1.1 million in 2006. Following is a summary of our defined benefit pension and OPEB funding and expense for the years 2004 through 2007: (In Millions) Pension OPEB Funding Expense Funding Expense 2004 $ 63.0 $ 23.1 $ 30.9 $ 28.5 2005 40.6 20.7 31.8 17.9 2006 46.2 26.4 33.1 11.2 2007 (Estimated) 39.2 23.3 23.9 8.2 Assumptions used in determining the benefit obligations and the value of plan assets for defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefit plans (primarily retiree healthcare benefits) offered by the Company and its unconsolidated ventures are evaluated periodically by management. Critical assumptions, such as the discount rate used to measure the benefit obligations, the expected long term rate of return on plan assets, and the medical care cost trend are reviewed annually. At December 31, 2006, we increased our discount rate for U.S. plans to 5.75 percent from 5.50 percent at December 31, 2005, and kept our discount rate for Canadian plans at 5.00 percent, unchanged from December 31, 2005. Additionally, on December 31, 2005, we adopted the 1994 GAM table to determine the expected life of our plan participants, replacing the 1983 GAM table. Following are sensitivities on estimated 2007 pension and OPEB expense of potential further changes in these key assumptions: Increase in 2007 Expense (In Millions) Pension OPEB Decrease discount rate .25 percent $ 1.9 $ .6 Decrease return on assets 1 percent 6.3 1.3 Increase medical trend rate 1 percent N/A 4.2 65 Table of Contents Changes in actuarial assumptions, including discount rates, employee retirement rates, mortality, compensation levels, plan asset investment performance, and healthcare costs, are selected by us. Changes in actuarial assumptions and or investment performance of plan assets can have a significant impact on our financial condition due to the magnitude of our retirement obligations. See NOTE 8 RETIREMENT RELATED BENEFITS for further information. Accounting for Business Combinations During 2005, we completed the acquisition of 80.4 percent of Portman. We allocated the purchase price to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their relative fair value at the date of acquisition, pursuant to SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations. In estimating the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, we consider information obtained during our due diligence process and utilize various valuation methods, including market prices, where available, appraisals, comparisons to transactions for similar assets and liabilities and present value of estimated future cash flows. We are required to make subjective estimates in connection with these valuations and allocations.
