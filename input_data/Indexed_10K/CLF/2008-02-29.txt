Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview The year 2007 was filled with progress and transition for Cleveland Cliffs Inc and is expected to be looked upon as a watershed in our transition to an international mining entity. Specifically, we made our entry into South America through the acquisition of a 30 percent interest in the Amap&aacute; Project; began mineral diversification with an acquisition of a 45 percent economic interest in the Australian Sonoma Coal project; and continued this diversification with the acquisition of PinnOak, a U.S. based producer of metallurgical coal. In addition to these strategic accomplishments, our core business, North American Iron Ore, achieved record sales margin. We also achieved record shipments in our Asia Pacific Iron Ore segment that allowed it to take advantage of unprecedented seaborne pricing for iron ore. Safety remains the No. 1 priority within Cleveland Cliffs. Our continuous improvement efforts in this area resulted in a reportable incident rate, as defined by MSHA, of 1.93 in North America, or 38 basis points below last years result of 2.31. Unfortunately, despite continued progress, we did experience a fatality at our United Taconite mine resulting from the mechanical failure of a drill. Our newly acquired North American Coal operations achieved a 6.09 reportable incident rate since the July 31, 2007 acquisition. The MSHA reportable incident rate at underground bituminous coal mines was 7.36 for 2006. At our Asia Pacific Iron Ore operations, Koolyanobbings LTIFR for the year was 4.14, which is higher than last years result of 3.5. During 2007, six LTIs were recorded at the Koolyanobbing operation. At Cockatoo Island, three LTIs were incurred, resulting in a LTIFR of 6.1 for the year, compared with two LTIs, resulting in a LTIFR of 7.87 in 2006. Asia Pacific Iron Ore safety statistics include employees and contractors. We continued to deliver strong financial performance in 2007. Revenues increased to $2.3 billion, with net income of $5.14 per diluted share. This compares with revenues of $1.9 billion and net income of $5.20 per diluted share in 2006. Global crude steel growth, a significant driver of our business, was up approximately seven percent from 2006 with supply and demand of steel raw materials extremely tight. In North America, the relining of two of our customers blast furnaces, as well as softness in steel pricing over the summer, did not prevent us from reaching 22 million sales tons of iron ore in North America. Reasonable industry fundamentals returned in the fall and most producers reacted to lower service center inventories by achieving multiple rounds of price increases. Steelmakers in China continue their strong demand for iron ore as our Asia Pacific Iron Ore segment produced near capacity with over eight million sales tonnes. World wide demand for metallurgical coal increased throughout the year as port constraints in Australia and production problems at large mines in the United States continued to place upward pressure on pricing. During the year we reorganized our financial reporting into operating segments according to product category and geographic location. The three reportable segments are North American Iron Ore, North American Coal and Asia Pacific Iron Ore. North American Iron Ore is comprised of our interests in three iron ore mines in Minnesota, two in Michigan and one in eastern Canada; North American Coal is made up of our July 2007 acquisition of PinnOak Resources and its two metallurgical coal mines in West Virginia and one metallurgical coal mine in Alabama. Asia Pacific Iron Ore includes our interests in Portman Limited, and its iron ore assets in Western Australia. We report revenues and sales margin separately for each of these three segments. In addition, we have two segments that do not meet disclosure requirements. Our Asia Pacific Coal operating segment is comprised of our 45 percent economic interest in the Sonoma Coal Project, and our Latin America Iron Ore operating segment is comprised of our 30 percent interest in the Amap&aacute; Project located in Brazil. 40 Table of Contents Below is a brief performance discussion for each of the reportable segments: North American Iron Ore North American Iron Ore pellet sales volume for 2007 was 22.3 million tons, a nine percent increase from the 20.4 million tons sold last year. The year over year increase in sales volume is attributed to increased production, deliveries and our customers fulfilling their minimum purchase obligations. North American Iron Ore revenue per ton was up three percent versus last year. As a result of our strategic procurement, maintenance and other business improvement programs, as well as the implementation of Six Sigma and Lean Sigma at our North American mines, North American Iron Ore cost per ton was flat in comparison to last year. This compares with a PPI increase of 4.1 percent, which is a measurement of industrial company cost inflation. Principally, as a result this cost containment, North American Iron Ore sales margin per ton increased 11 percent from 2006. In North America, we are engaged with expanding our leadership position in the industry by focusing on high product quality, technical excellence, superior relationships with our customers and partners and improved operational efficiency through cost saving initiatives. We operate a fully equipped research and development facility in Ishpeming, Michigan. Our research and development group is staffed with experienced engineers and scientists and is organized to support the geological interpretation, process mineralogy, mine engineering, mineral processing, pyrometallurgy, advanced process control and analytical service disciplines. Our research and development group is also utilized by iron ore pellet customers for laboratory testing and simulation of blast furnace conditions. North American Coal Our North American Coal segment is comprised of the PinnOak acquisition completed on July 31, 2007. PinnOak was a privately owned U.S. producer of high quality, low volatile metallurgical coal. The acquisition furthers our growth strategy and expands our diversification of products for the integrated steel industry. North American Coal operations include two complexes comprising three underground mines the Pinnacle and Green Ridge mines in southern West Virginia and the Oak Grove mine near Birmingham, Alabama. Combined, the mines have rated capacity to produce 6.5 million short tons of premium quality metallurgical coal annually. During the five months that we have owned the assets, metallurgical coal sales volume was 1.2 million short tons. In August, production at the Pinnacle mine in West Virginia slowed as a result of sandstone intrusions encountered within the coal panel being mined at the time. This slowdown prompted the decision in late September to move the mines longwall plow system to another panel. In mid October, the plow system was brought back into production. In addition, we have invested in business improvement initiatives and safety activities designed to improve future production. These investments reduced our 2007 production. The slowdown, and resulting lack of leverage over fixed costs, such as labor, energy and administration, contributed to a loss of sales margin and unusually high per ton costs of goods sold. However, as we build production volumes at the metallurgical coal mines through 2008, our cost per ton is expected to steadily and significantly decrease. Asia Pacific Iron Ore Asia Pacific Iron Ore sales volume for 2007 increased 10 percent to 8.1 million tonnes, compared with 7.4 million tonnes in 2006. Increased production capacity has allowed Asia Pacific to supply higher sales volumes at increased price realizations driven by intense demand from the Asian steel industry, particularly in China. 41 Table of Contents As a result of this demand, revenues per tonne increased 12 percent from the prior year. Per tonne costs in Asia Pacific Iron Ore, which increased 16 percent, continue to be negatively impacted by foreign exchange rates, as the U.S. dollar weakened relative to the Australian dollar, as well as higher maintenance and contract labor expenditures. Our Asia Pacific Iron Ore management team has put in place a new contractor for mine operations that has cost control incentives. This is expected to result in better cost control in 2008. Strategic Transactions In 2007, we continued our strategic transformation to an international mining company through the following acquisitions and partnerships: On March 5, 2007, we acquired a 30 percent interest in Amap&aacute;, a Brazilian iron ore project, through the acquisition of 100 percent of the shares of Centennial Amap&aacute; for approximately $133 million. The remaining 70 percent of the Amap&aacute; Project is owned by MMX, which is managing the construction and operations of the Amap&aacute; Project while we are supplying supplemental technical support. In January 2008, Anglo American plc entered into a period of exclusive discussions with the controlling shareholder of MMX to purchase controlling interest in MMXs 51 percent interest in the Minas Rio iron ore project and its 70 percent interest in the Amap&aacute; Project. The proposed transaction is subject to a number of terms and conditions, including MMX board and regulatory approvals and the negotiation of definitive transaction documents. In addition, MMX will be required to obtain security holder approval for the completion of the transaction. Total project funding requirements are estimated to be between $550 and $650 million (our share $165 million to $195 million), including approximately $415 million to $490 million (our share $125 million to $147 million) to be funded with project debt, and approximately $135 million to $160 million (our share $40 million to $48 million) to be funded with equity contributions. As of December 31, 2007, Amap&aacute; had debt outstanding of approximately $419 million, with approximately $83 million representing loans from MMX. These loans will be converted to permanent financing under existing third party credit facilities during 2008. We are committed to funding 30 percent of the equity contributions and have guaranteed 30 percent of the third party project level debt until the project meets certain performance criteria. As of December 31, 2007, approximately $101 million of project debt was guaranteed by Cliffs. Capital contributions through December 31, 2007 have totaled approximately $89 million (our share $26.7 million). Amap&aacute; was in compliance with its debt covenant requirements at December 31, 2007. The Amap&aacute; Project consists of a significant iron ore deposit, a 192 kilometer railway connecting the mine location to an existing port facility and 71 hectares of real estate on the banks of the Amazon River, reserved for a loading terminal. The Amap&aacute; Project began production of sinter fines in late December 2007. It is expected that completion of construction of the concentrator and ramp up of production will occur in 2008. Once fully operational, production is targeted at 6.5 million tonnes of fines products annually. On April 18, 2007, we executed agreements to participate in the Sonoma Coal Project, a coking and thermal coal project located in Queensland, Australia. As of December 31, 2007, we invested $120.1 million to acquire and develop mining tenements and related infrastructure including the construction of a washplant, which will produce coal to meet the growing global demand. Our total investment in Sonoma is estimated to be $127.7 million. Immediately preceding our investment in Sonoma, QCoal owned exploration permits and applications for mining leases for the real estate that is involved in the Sonoma Project (Mining Assets); however, development of the Mining Assets requires significant infrastructure including the construction of a rail loop and related equipment (Non Mining Assets) and a facility that prepares the extracted coal for sale (the Washplant). Pursuant to a combination of interrelated agreements creating a structure whereby Cliffs owns 100 percent of the Washplant, 8.33 percent of the Mining Assets and 45 percent of the Non Mining Assets of Sonoma, we obtained a 45 percent economic interest in the collective operations of Sonoma. Mining operations reached a milestone in December 2007, when the first coal was extracted from the mine. The Washplant is currently undergoing commissioning and is expected to be fully operational by the end of the first quarter of 2008. Severe flooding at the mine in mid February 2008 has caused a delay in previously 42 Table of Contents scheduled shipments. Incorporating the effects of the flooding, we expect total production of 2.0 million tonnes for 2008 and three to four million tonnes annually in 2009 and beyond. Production will include a mix of hard coking coal and thermal coal. On June 19, 2007, we entered into an alliance whereby Kobe Steel agreed to license its patented ITmk3&reg; iron making technology to us. The alliance, which has a 10 year term, covers use of the proprietary process in the United States and Canada, Australia and Brazil, and may be expanded to include other geographic regions. Used for the production of high purity iron nuggets containing more than 96 percent iron, the ITmk3&reg; process provides the means to create high quality raw materials for EAFs. Steel producers utilizing EAFs currently account for 60 percent of North Americas steelmaking capacity. On August 22, 2007, IronUnits LLC and its joint venture partner, Kobe Iron Nugget LLC formed Michigan Iron Nugget LLC. This new entity is the first manifestation of the Cliffs/Kobe alliance and will oversee the feasibility stage of building a commercial iron nugget plant in Marquette County, Michigan. In November 2007, we acquired a 70 percent controlling interest in Renewafuel. Founded in 2005, Renewafuel produces high quality, dense fuel cubes made from renewable and consistently available components such as corn stalks, switch grass, grains, soybean and oat hulls, wood, and wood byproducts. This is a strategic investment that provides an opportunity to utilize a green solution for further reduction of emissions consistent with our objective to contain costs and enhance efficiencies in a socially responsible manner. In addition to the potential use of Renewafuels biofuel cubes in our production process, the cubes will be marketable to other organizations as a potential substitute for Western coal and natural gas. Renewafuels biofuel cubes about the size of a coal briquette generate about the same amount of energy as coal from the Western United States; however, the green fuel emits 90 percent less sulfur dioxide, 35 percent less particulate matter and 30 percent less acid gases than coal. In addition, the cubes are made from feedstocks that are considered biogenic carbon meaning they are already part of the natural carbon balance and will not add to atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide. Combustion of the cubes is considered greenhouse neutral under most existing carbon dioxide registry and trading programs. The energy cubes can be used as a carbon neutral stand alone fuel or a green supplement blended with existing fuels in industrial furnaces and boilers. The energy cubes generate more than 40 times the energy required to produce and transport them. Capital Resources We have taken a balanced approach to allocation of our capital resources and free cash flow. We have made strategic investments both domestically and internationally, increased our capital expenditures, strengthened our balance sheet, increased funding of our employee benefit obligations and increased our borrowing capacity.

Sales volume in 2007 included 1.5 million tons of pellets purchased and paid for by customers at year end under take or pay provisions of existing long term supply agreements. First half shipments in 2007 included 1.2 million tons of pellets purchased in upper Great Lakes stockpiles and paid for in 2006. Revenue recognition related to the December 2006 stockpile transaction totaling $62.6 million was deferred until the product was delivered in 2007. Sales prices per ton increased 2.8 percent, reflecting the effect of contractual base price increases, higher term supply agreement escalation factors including higher steel pricing, higher PPI and lag year adjustments. The increase in cost of goods sold and operating expenses primarily reflected higher volume, $91.8 million. On a per ton basis, cost of goods sold and operating expenses were flat in comparison to last year, as a result of our strategic procurement, maintenance and other business improvement programs, as well as the implementation of Six Sigma and Lean Sigma. Production Following is a summary of North American Iron Ore production tonnage for 2007 versus 2006: (In Millions) (1) Company Share Total Mine 2007 2006 2007 2006 Empire 3.9 3.8 4.9 4.9 Tilden 6.1 5.9 7.2 6.9 Hibbing 1.7 1.9 7.4 8.3 Northshore 5.2 5.1 5.2 5.1 United Taconite 3.7 3.0 5.3 4.3 Wabush 1.2 1.1 4.6 4.1 Total 21.8 20.8 34.6 33.6 (1) Long tons of pellets of 2,240 pounds. The decrease in Hibbings production was a result of the shutdown in late February 2007 due to severe weather conditions that caused significant buildup of ice in the basin supplying water to the processing facility. Year over year production at Tilden benefited from major maintenance work and operating improvements performed in the prior year, and United Taconite production increased due to its recovery from last years electrical accident. Production at Wabush was higher as a result of pit design improvements to mitigate dewatering issues. We reinitiated construction activity to restart an idled pellet furnace at the Northshore facility that will increase capacity by approximately 0.6 million tons of pellets in 2008 and 0.8 million tons to our annual capacity thereafter. Production at Empire for 2008 is expected to slow to 3.6 million tons in order to extend the life of the mine. Negotiations to sell Wabash are currently in process but have not been finalized. There is a possibility that this transaction may not be consummated. North American Coal Sales Margin Following is a summary of North American Coal sales margin since the July 31, 2007 acquisition: (In Millions, except tonnage) Five Months EndedDecember 31, 2007 Revenues from product sales and services $ 85.2 Cost of goods sold and operating expense (116.9 ) Sales margin $ (31.7 ) Sales tons (in thousands) 1,171 45 Table of Contents In August, production at our Pinnacle mine in West Virginia slowed as a result of sandstone intrusions encountered within the coal panel being mined at the time. This slowdown prompted the operating decision in late September to move the mines longwall plow system to another panel. In mid October, the plow system was brought back into production. In addition, we have invested in business improvement initiatives and safety activities designed to enhance future production at our Oak Grove mine. These investments reduced our 2007 production. The net impact of these factors contributed to a $31.7 million loss of sales margin. As production volumes build through 2008, our per ton costs are anticipated to steadily and significantly decrease each quarter.

Portmans sales prices reflected the effects of the 9.5 percent increase in the international benchmark price of iron ore fines and lump. The 0.7 million tonne volume increase reflected the completion of the two million tonne per annum expansion at Koolyanobbing in late 2006. The increase in cost of goods sold and operating expenses primarily reflected changes in foreign currency rates, changeover costs associated with a new mining contractor, increased selling and shipping costs and the effect of higher volume. Production Following is a summary of Asia Pacific Iron Ore production tonnage for 2007 versus 2006: (In Millions) (1) Total Mine 2007 2006 Koolyanobbing 7.7 7.0 Cockatoo Island 0.7 0.7 Total 8.4 7.7 (1) Metric tons of 2,205 pounds. 46 Table of Contents The increase in production primarily reflected the completion of the expansion at Koolyanobbing in late 2006. Production at Cockatoo Island is expected to continue into the second quarter of 2008, with shipments to end in the third quarter of 2008. In July 2007, Portman was notified that its exploration and mining rights under two leases would not be extended beyond July 3, 2007. The mining leases permit Portman to explore for and mine iron ore on mining tenements north of Portmans Koolyanobbing operations, including the rights to 4.5 million tonnes of iron ore reserves. Portman has since negotiated an in principle agreement to transfer these rights to the other party in exchange for additional mining rights to new leases. A formal agreement to this effect is expected to be ratified in the first quarter of 2008. Other Operating Income (Expense) Selling, general and administrative expense of $114.2 million increased $41.8 million compared with the prior year, primarily reflecting higher employment costs related to our expanding business, including expenses at North American Coal and our Asia Pacific locations; increased outside professional service fees and higher legal fees. Gain on sale of assets of $18.4 million primarily reflected the fourth quarter 2007 gain on the sale of portions of the former LTVSMC site. The sale included cash proceeds of approximately $18 million. Miscellaneous net expense of $2.3 million increased $14.7 million compared with last year, primarily reflecting increased mark to market hedging losses at our Asia Pacific Iron Ore business. Other Income (Expense) Interest income of $20.0 million increased $2.8 million compared with the prior year, reflecting average higher cash and investment balances and higher average interest rates in our Asia Pacific iron ore business. Interest expense of $22.6 million increased $17.3 million compared with the prior year, primarily reflecting borrowings from the credit facility to fund the acquisition of PinnOak. Income Taxes Income tax expense of $84.1 million in 2007 was $6.8 million lower than the comparable amount in 2006. The decrease was due to lower pre tax income in 2007 and a lower effective tax rate. See NOTE 9 INCOME TAXES in Item 8 for further information. Minority Interest Minority interest decreased $1.5 million, or nine percent from the prior year. Minority interest represents the 19.6 percent minority interest related to Asia Pacific iron ore earnings. Equity Loss in Ventures The equity loss in ventures, $11.2 million, represents the results from the Companys investment in Amap&aacute;, primarily pre production costs, $7.2 million and operating losses from the railroad, $4.0 million. 47 Table of Contents 2006 Versus 2005 North American Iron Ore Sales Margin Following is a summary of North American Iron Ore sales margin for 2006 versus 2005: (In Millions) Change due to 2006 2005 Salesprice andrate Salesvolume Freight andreimbursements Totalchange Revenue from product sales and services $ 1,560.7 $ 1,535.0 $ 111.6 $ (111.2 ) $ 25.3 $ 25.7 Cost of goods sold and operating expenses (1,233.3 ) (1,176.4 ) (112.3 ) 80.7 (25.3 ) (56.9 ) Sales margin $ 327.4 $ 358.6 $ (0.7 ) $ (30.5 ) $ $ (31.2 ) Sales tons 20.4 22.3 Production tons total 33.6 35.9 Production tons Cliffs share 20.8 22.1 The increase in sales revenue was due to higher sales prices, $111.6 million and higher freight and venture partners reimbursements, partially offset by a sales volume decrease of 1.9 million tons, or $111.2 million. The 9.3 percent increase in sales prices primarily reflected the effect of contractual base price increases, higher term supply agreement escalation factors including higher steel pricing, higher PPI and lag year adjustments, partially offset by the impact of lower international benchmark pellet prices. The price of blast furnace pellets for Eastern Canadian producers decreased 3.5 percent. Included in 2006 revenues were approximately 1.3 million tons of 2006 sales at 2005 contract prices and $21.6 million of revenue related to pricing adjustments on 2005 sales. Cost of goods sold and operating expenses increased $56.9 million or approximately five percent. The increase reflected higher unit production costs of $112.3 million and higher freight and venture partners cost reimbursements, $25.3 million. Lower sales volume reduced costs $80.7 million. On a per ton basis, cost of goods sold and operating expenses increased approximately 13 percent, primarily due to higher maintenance activity, increased energy and supply pricing, increased stripping and higher employment costs. Production costs were also impacted by an approximate $15 million cost effect related to production curtailments caused by the October 12, 2006 explosion at the United Taconite processing plant.

Magnetite pellets have lower productivity than hematite pellets. 48 Table of Contents The decrease in United Taconite production was due to the electrical explosion at the United Taconite processing plant on October 12, 2006. Production at the United Taconite plant was temporarily curtailed as a result of the loss of electrical power resulting from the explosion. Repairs to the plants Line 2 were completed and full production resumed in January 2007. Crude ore mining at Wabush was significantly impacted by pit de watering difficulties, which adversely impacted production and costs.

Sales revenue increased $156.5 million or approximately 77 percent. The increase in sales revenue was due to higher volume, $105.0 million and higher sales prices, $51.5 million. The 2.5 million tonne volume increase reflected the expansion of the Koolyanobbing operations in 2006 and the exclusion of sales prior to the March 31, 2005 acquisition. Asia Pacific iron ore sales prices include the effects of a 19 percent increase in the international benchmark price of iron ore fines and lump. Cost of goods sold and operating expenses increased $100.3 million or approximately 58 percent. The increase primarily reflected the effect of higher volume and an increase in unit production costs, primarily higher contract labor. Production Following is a summary of Asia Pacific Iron Ore production tonnage for 2006 versus 2005: (In Millions) (1) Total Mine 2006 2005 Koolyanobbing 7.0 4.7 Cockatoo Island 0.7 0.5 Total 7.7 5.2 (1) Metric tons of 2,205 pounds. Asia Pacific Iron Ore 2005 production reflects results since the March 31, 2005 acquisition. An expansion of the Koolyanobbing facility was completed in 2006 that increased the Portmans wholly owned production capacity from six to eight million tonnes per annum. Other Operating Income (Expense) Casualty recoveries in 2005 of $12.3 million related to a five week production curtailment at the Empire and Tilden mines in 2003 due to the loss of electric power as a result of flooding in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. We recovered a portion of our deductible in 2007, totaling $3.2 million; 49 Table of Contents Selling, general and administrative expenses of $72.4 million increased $10.3 million compared with the prior year, reflecting increased outside professional services and full year expense at our Asia Pacific iron ore business and a $3.0 million property damage insurance deductible associated with the electrical explosion at United Taconite, partially offset by lower incentive compensation; Miscellaneous net income of $12.4 million was $8.2 million higher than the prior year, primarily reflecting higher mark to market currency gains at Portman and higher customer bankruptcy recoveries related to WCIs 2003 bankruptcy filing. Other Income (Expense) Interest income of $17.2 million was $3.3 million higher than the prior year, reflecting higher average cash balances and higher interest rates. Income Taxes During 2005, an $8.9 million adjustment to reverse a valuation allowance on net operating losses attributable to pre consolidated separate return years of one of our subsidiaries was recognized. Excluding the $8.9 million reversal in 2005, income tax expense of $90.9 million in 2006 was $2.8 million lower than the comparable amount last year. The decrease was due to a lower effective tax rate, partially offset by higher pre tax income in 2006. See NOTE 9 INCOME TAXES for further information. Minority Interest Minority interest increased $7.0 million, or almost 70 percent from the prior year. Minority interest represents the 19.6 percent minority interest related to our Asia Pacific iron ore earnings. Discontinued Operations Our arrangements with Ferrominera, a government owned company responsible for the development of Venezuelas iron ore industry, to provide technical assistance in support of improving operations of a 3.3 million tonne per year pelletizing facility, were terminated in the third quarter of 2005. We recorded after tax income of $0.2 million related to this contract in 2006, compared with 2005 after tax expense of $1.7 million, which included our exit costs. On July 23, 2004, CAL, an affiliate of the Company jointly owned by a subsidiary of the Company (82.3945 percent) and Outotec (17.6055 percent), a German company (formerly known as Lurgi Metallurgie GmbH), completed the sale of CALs HBI facility located in Trinidad and Tobago to ArcelorMittal USA. Terms of the sale included a purchase price of $8.0 million plus assumption of liabilities. ArcelorMittal USA closed this facility at the end of 2005. We recorded after tax income of $0.1 million in 2006, compared with after tax income of $0.9 million in 2005. The results of discontinued operations for CAL and Ferrominera were recorded under Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations in the Statements of Consolidated Operations. 50 Table of Contents Cash Flow and Liquidity Following is a summary of our cash flows for 2007, 2006 and 2005: (In Millions) 2007 2006 2005 Acquisition of PinnOak (net of $2.6 million of cash acquired) $ (343.8 ) $ $ Capital expenditures (199.5 ) (119.5 ) (97.8 ) Investment in ventures (180.6 ) (13.4 ) (8.5 ) Repayment of PinnOak debt (159.6 ) Net purchase of marketable securities (44.7 ) Dividends on common and preferred stock (26.4 ) (25.8 ) (18.7 ) Repurchases of common stock (2.2 ) (121.5 ) Net borrowings under credit facility 440.0 Net cash from operating activities 288.9 428.5 514.6 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 11.8 5.9 (2.2 ) Investment in Portman (net of $24.1 million cash acquired) (409.0 ) Other 21.5 4.4 (0.3 ) Increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents from continuing operations (194.6 ) 158.6 (21.9 ) Cash from (used by) discontinued operations 0.3 (2.2 ) Increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ (194.6 ) $ 158.9 $ (24.1 ) See NOTE 2 ACQUISITIONS AND OTHER INVESTMENTS for information regarding the PinnOak acquisition and repayment of debt as well as our investments in ventures. Capital expenditures included the acquisition and development of mining tenements and related infrastructure including the construction of a washplant at Sonoma; the 0.8 million capacity expansion at Northshore and the re build of the substation at United Taconite resulting from the October 2006 explosion. We anticipate that total cash used for investments and capital expenditures in 2008 will be approximately $200 million. We expect to fund our capital expenditures from available cash, current operations and borrowings under our credit facility. Common stock repurchases in 2007 and 2006 reflected the purchase of 45,000 shares and 3.2 million shares, respectively, of 4.5 million shares authorized under two 2006 repurchase programs. Also, we increased our quarterly common share dividend to $.175 per share from $.125 per share effective with the quarterly dividend payable on March 3, 2008 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on February 15, 2008. The decrease in operating cash flows in 2007 compared with 2006 was primarily due to changes in operating assets and liabilities. A summary of cash due to changes in operating assets and liabilities is as follows: (In Millions) 2007 2006 2005 Net proceeds of short term marketable securities $ $ 9.9 $ 172.8 Changes in product inventories 3.2 (29.9 ) 9.8 Changes in receivables and other assets 18.0 73.0 (64.8 ) Changes in deferred revenues (34.2 ) 62.4 0.2 Changes in payables and accrued expenses (14.8 ) 3.4 73.3 Cash (used by) from changes in operating assets and liabilities $ (27.8 ) $ 118.8 $ 191.3 51 Table of Contents Our product inventory balances at December 31, 2007 and 2006 were as follows: (In Millions) 2007 2006 Amount Tons* Amount Tons* North American Iron Ore $ 114.3 3.4 $ 129.5 3.8 North American Coal 8.3 0.1 Asia Pacific Iron Ore 30.2 1.1 20.8 0.9 Total $ 152.8 $ 150.3 * North American Iron Ore tons are long tons of pellets of 2,240 pounds North American Coal tons are short tons of 2,000 pounds Asia Pacific Iron Ore tons are metric tons of 2,205 pounds The decrease in North American Iron Ore pellet inventory was primarily due to higher sales volume, partially offset by higher production. The increase in Asia Pacific Iron Ore inventory is primarily due to increased production attributable to the expansion of the Koolyanobbing operations and higher opening inventory compared with the prior year, partially offset by higher sales. Operating cash flows in 2005 included the proceeds from the sale of $182.7 million of highly liquid marketable securities used in connection with our acquisition of Portman, net of $9.9 million purchases of ARS. Net cash from operating activities in 2007, 2006 and 2005 also reflected $123.9 million, $95.7 million and $86.2 million of income tax payments and $37.7 million, $56.1 million and $55.8 million of contributions to pension plans and VEBAs, respectively. In 2006, we received a $67.5 million refund from the WEPCO escrow account. Following is a summary of key liquidity measures: (In Millions) At December 31, 2007 2006 Cash and cash equivalents $ 157.1 $ 351.7 Debt $ (446.2 ) $ (6.9 ) Working capital $ 355.0 $ 407.4 Cash and cash equivalents included $127.8 million and $97.6 million at our Asia Pacific Iron Ore operations at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. On August 17, 2007, we entered into a five year unsecured credit facility with a syndicate of 13 financial institutions, which replaced a $500 million credit facility scheduled to expire in 2011 and a $150 million credit facility scheduled to expire in 2008. The new facility provides $800 million in borrowing capacity, comprised of $200 million in term loans and $600 million in revolving loans, swing loans and letters of credit. Loans are drawn with a choice of interest rates and maturities, subject to the terms of the agreement. Interest rates are either (1) a range from LIBOR plus 0.45 percent to LIBOR plus 1.125 percent based on debt and earnings or (2) the prime rate or the prime rate plus 1.125 percent based on debt and earnings. The credit facility has two financial covenants: (1) debt to earnings ratio and (2) interest coverage ratio. As of December 31, 2007, we were in compliance with the covenants in the credit agreement. As of December 31, 2007, $240 million was drawn in revolving loans and the principal amount of letter of credit obligations totaled $16.2 million under the new credit facility. We also had $200 million drawn in term loans. We had $343.8 million of borrowing capacity available under the $800 million credit facility at December 31, 2007. The weighted average annual interest rate for outstanding revolving and term loans under the credit facility was 5.81 percent as of December 31, 2007. After the effect of interest rate hedging, the weighted average annual borrowing rate was 5.68 percent. 52 Table of Contents Portman is party to a A$40 million multi option credit facility, which was finalized in April 2007. The floating interest rate is 20 basis points over the 90 day bank bill swap rate in Australia. At December 31, 2007, the outstanding bank commitments were A$12.5 million, reducing borrowing capacity to A$27.5 million. The facility has two covenants: (1) debt to earnings ratio and (2) interest coverage ratio. As of December 31, 2007, Portman was in compliance with the covenants in the credit facility. In 2005, Portman secured five year financing from its customers in China as part of its long term sales agreements to assist with the funding of the expansion of its Koolyanobbing mining operations. The borrowings, totaling $6.2 million at December 31, 2007, accrue interest annually at five percent. The borrowings require principal payments of approximately $0.8 million plus accrued interest to be made each January 31 for the next two years, with the balance due in full on January 31, 2010. Contractual Obligations and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Other than operating leases primarily utilized for certain equipment and office space, we do not have any off balance sheet financing. Following is a summary of our contractual obligations at December 31, 2007: Payments Due by Period (1) (In Millions) Contractual Obligations Total Less Than1 Year 1 3Years 3 5Years More Than5 Years Long term debt $ 555.0 $ 0.8 $ 114.2 $ 440.0 $ Interest on debt (2) 122.7 23.9 48.8 50.0 Capital lease obligations 77.4 9.7 18.8 17.1 31.8 Operating leases 77.9 18.2 31.5 16.8 11.4 Purchase obligations Open purchase orders 227.0 180.5 28.6 17.9 Minimum take or pay purchase commitments (3) 517.0 144.3 177.3 130.1 65.3 Total purchase obligations 744.0 324.8 205.9 148.0 65.3 Other long term liabilities Pension funding minimums 87.9 24.0 34.8 29.1 OPEB claim payments 125.6 16.9 24.0 22.8 61.9 Mine closure obligations 118.5 3.5 0.8 15.6 98.6 FIN 48 obligations (4) 18.7 8.3 10.4 Personal injury 16.5 3.6 4.3 1.3 7.3 PinnOak contingent consideration 99.5 99.5 Other (5) 201.0 Total other long term liabilities 667.7 56.3 173.8 68.8 167.8 Total $ 2,244.7 $ 433.7 $ 593.0 $ 740.7 $ 276.3 (1) Includes our consolidated obligations. (2) Interest calculated using a variable rate of 5.2 percent in 2008 and 2009 for the $200 million term debt and 5.8 percent from 2010 to 2012. Interest calculated using a variable rate of 5.6 percent from 2008 to 2012 for the $240 million revolving debt. (3) Includes minimum electric power demand charges, minimum coal, diesel and natural gas obligations, minimum railroad transportation obligations, minimum port facility obligations and minimum water pipeline access obligations for the Sonoma washplant. (4) Includes accrued interest. (5) Primarily includes income taxes payable and deferred income tax amounts for which payment timing is non determinable. 53 Table of Contents Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits Defined benefit pension expense totaled $17.4 million, $23.0 million and $18.9 million for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The decrease in defined benefit pension expense was due primarily to the effects of greater than expected asset returns, demographic gains and an increase in the assumed discount rate used to determine plan obligations. OPEB expense totaled $4.5 million, $9.8 million and $13.7 million for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The decrease in OPEB expense was due primarily to the effects of contributions made to the VEBAs during 2006, demographic gains, greater than expected asset returns and an increase in the assumed discount rate used to determine plan obligations. See Employee Retirement Benefit Obligations under Critical Accounting Policies below and NOTE 8 RETIREMENT RELATED BENEFITS in Item 8 for further information. Point Beach Nuclear Power Plant On December 19, 2006 WEPCO entered into an Asset Sale Agreement to sell its Point Beach Nuclear Plant. In conjunction with the sale, the parties to the transaction also negotiated a long term Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) whereby WEPCO would purchase the capacity, energy, and ancillary services from Point Beach. On September 25, 2007, the MPSC issued its Opinion and Order and determined that all of WEPCOs Michigan customers, including the Empire and Tilden mines, should share in the distribution of proceeds resulting from the sale. The MPSC directed WEPCO to calculate an equal mills per kWh credit to be applied to customers bills for 18 monthly billing cycles following the close of the Point Beach Nuclear Plant sale. WEPCO estimates a total of $882 million in net proceeds resulting from the transfer of ownership. The funds will be applied based on future consumption by its customers beginning in December 2007 through a $0.01581/kWh credit. Based on WEPCOs proposal on projected electricity usage, the 2008 distribution to us would be approximately $32 million and will be reflected as a reduction in Cost of goods sold and operating expenses. Sale of Wabush On June 6, 2007, Consolidated Thompson Iron Mines Ltd. (traded on the TSX Venture Exchange under the symbol CLM) made a conditional offer to acquire the 71.4 percent of Wabush owned directly or indirectly by the Company (26.8 percent) and U.S. Steel Canada (44.6 percent) for cash plus warrants for the purchase of CLM common shares and the assumption by CLM of employee and asset retirement obligations. The offer was non binding upon the Company and U.S. Steel Canada except for the grant to CLM of limited exclusivity and was conditional upon various matters including the negotiation and finalization of the definitive agreement and the Dofasco right of first refusal referred to below. As part of the transaction, if completed, we would enter into an agreement whereby CLM would sell a pro rata share to us annually from 4.8 million tons of expected annual Wabush production from the date of the closing through December 31, 2009. In 2007, Wabush produced 4.6 million tons of pellets with our share totaling 1.2 million tons. Dofasco, a subsidiary of ArcelorMittal, holds the remaining 28.6 percent of Wabush. The notification to Dofasco of the conditional acceptance of CLMs offer by the Company and U.S. Steel Canada on June 8, 2007, triggered a 90 day right of first refusal option by Dofasco under terms of the joint venture agreement. On August 30, 2007, Dofasco provided notice to the Company and U.S. Steel Canada that it was exercising its right of first refusal to purchase the Companys and U.S. Steel Canadas interest in Wabush. Negotiations have not been finalized and it is possible that the transaction may not be consummated. Market Risk We are subject to a variety of market risks, including those caused by changes in market value of equity investments, commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. We have established policies and procedures to manage risks; however, certain risks are beyond our control. 54 Table of Contents Our investment policy relating to cash and cash equivalents is to preserve principal and liquidity while maximizing the return through investment of available funds. The carrying value of these investments approximates fair value on the reporting dates. Interest for borrowings under our credit facility is a floating rate, dependent in part on the LIBOR rate, as such we are exposed to the effects of interest rate changes. Based on $440 million in outstanding revolving and term loans at December 31, 2007, a 100 basis point change to the LIBOR rate would result in a change of $4.5 million to interest expense on an annual basis. In October 2007, we entered into a $100 million fixed rate swap to convert a portion of this floating rate into a fixed rate. With the swap agreement, we pay a fixed three month LIBOR rate for $100 million of our floating rate borrowings. The interest rate swap terminates in October 2009 and qualifies as a cash flow hedge. Approximately 6 percent of our U.S. pension trust assets and 2.5 percent of VEBA assets are exposed to sub prime risk, all of which is investment grade and fully collateralized by properties. These investments primarily include Mortgage Backed Securities and the Home Equity subset of the Asset Backed Securities sector with AAA and AA credit quality ratings. While these structures have experienced spread widening in conjunction with the recent market volatility and re pricing of risk, over collateralization of the deals lessens the potential for principal loss in these tranches and the securities held have not been subject to ratings downgrades to date. The U.S. pension and VEBA trusts have no allocations to mortgage related collateralized debt obligations. The rising cost of energy is an important issue for us as it comprises approximately 24 percent of our North American Iron Ore production costs. Our strategy to address increasing energy rates includes improving efficiency in energy usage and utilizing the lowest cost alternative fuel. We also use forward purchases of natural gas and diesel fuel to stabilize fluctuations in near term prices. Our North American Iron Ore mines, including our share of ventures, consumed 14.0 million mmbtus of natural gas at an average price of $7.95 per mmbtu and 23.9 million gallons of diesel fuel at an average price of $2.31 per gallon. Recent trends indicate that electric power, natural gas and oil costs can be expected to increase over time, although the direction and magnitude of short term changes are difficult to predict. As of December 31, 2007, we purchased or have forward purchase contracts for 3.8 million and 2.0 million mmbtus of natural gas for 2008 and 2009, respectively, at an average price of $8.48 per mmbtu and 6.2 million gallons of diesel fuel at $2.12 per gallon for our North American Iron Ore mining ventures. Our mining ventures enter into forward contracts for certain commodities, primarily natural gas and diesel fuel, as a hedge against price volatility. Such contracts, which are in quantities expected to be delivered and used in the production process, are a means to limit exposure to price fluctuations. At December 31, 2007, the notional amounts of the outstanding natural gas and diesel forward contracts were $52.5 million, with an unrecognized fair value gain of $5.7 million based on December 31, 2007 forward rates. The natural gas contracts mature at various times through September 2009 and the diesel fuel contracts mature at various times through December 2009. If the forward rates were to change 10 percent from the year end rate, the value and potential cash flow effect on the contracts would be approximately $5.8 million. Our share of the Wabush operation in Canada represented approximately six percent of our North American pellet production. This operation is subject to currency exchange fluctuations between the U.S. and Canadian dollars; however, we do not hedge our exposure to this currency exchange fluctuation. During 2007, the value of the Canadian dollar rose against the U.S. dollar from $0.86 U.S. dollar per Canadian dollar at the end of 2006 to $1.02 U.S. dollars per Canadian dollar at December 31, 2007, an increase of 19 percent. The average exchange rate increased to $0.94 U.S. dollar per Canadian dollar in 2007 from an average of $0.88 U.S. dollar per Canadian dollar for 2006, an increase of approximately seven percent. We are subject to changes in foreign currency exchange rates in Australia as a result of our operations at Portman and Sonoma, which could impact our financial condition. Foreign exchange risk arises from our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates because our reporting currency is the United States dollar. We do not hedge our exposure to this currency exchange fluctuation. A hypothetical one percent movement in quoted foreign currency exchange rates could result in a fair value change of approximately $11 million in our net investment. 55 Table of Contents Portman hedges a portion of its United States currency denominated sales in accordance with a formal policy. The primary objective for using derivative financial instruments is to reduce the earnings volatility attributable to changes in Australian and United States currency fluctuations. The instruments are subject to formal documentation, intended to achieve qualifying hedge treatment, and are tested at inception and at each reporting period as to effectiveness. Changes in fair value for highly effective hedges are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income. Ineffective portions are charged to operations. At December 31, 2007, Portman had outstanding hedges totaling $362.5 million in the form of call options, collar options, convertible collar options and forward exchange contracts. The contracts have varying maturity dates ranging from January 2008 to November 2010, and a fair value adjustment based on the December 31, 2007 exchange rate of $21.3 million. A one hundred basis point increase in rates from the month end rate would increase the fair value and cash flow by $3.0 million and a one hundred basis point decrease would decrease the fair value and cash flow by $2.5 million. Outlook Pricing There has been a reported settlement of a 65 percent increase in pricing for iron ore fines for 2008. We are incorporating this into our estimates for pricing projections for lump and pellets. However, negotiations are still underway and there may be changes to the pricing for fines. In addition, pellets and lump may settle at different pricing levels. North American Iron Ore Our North American Iron Ore operations continue to produce at or near capacity. In 2008, Cliffs managed iron ore pellet production in North America is expected to approximate 31.5 million tons Our share of this production is expected to be approximately 21 million tons. As we sell through current inventory, 2008 sales tons are estimated at 23 million tons. In estimating our revenue per ton for North American Iron Ore we made certain assumptions for the various factors included in our North American Iron Ore supply agreements. These include: A 65 percent increase in the World Pellet Price; Modest increases among producer price indices; Approximately 16 percent increase in factors related to steel pricing; and, A combination of contractual base price increases, lag year adjustments and capped pricing. The combination of these factors results in an estimated revenue per ton of $76 for 2008. Following is the estimated impact of changes in key assumptions on our North American Iron Ore revenue per ton: Each 10 percent change from the 65 percent increase in World Pellet Price is expected to change our average realization per ton by $0.66; and, Each $10 change from $650 per ton in the average hot rolled steel price at certain steelmaking facilities will result in a change in realization of $0.25 per ton. We expect 2008 North American Iron Ore unit production costs to increase approximately four percent to approximately $50.00 per ton. North American Coal North American Coal is expected to produce and sell 4.5 million tons of metallurgical coal in 2008. We expect sales per ton to be approximately $91 in 2008. Cost per ton for the year is expected to be approximately $77. This full year cost expectation assumes sequential quarterly improvement throughout the year as we ramp up production and execute business improvement initiatives at our coal mines. 56 Table of Contents Asia Pacific Iron Ore Asia Pacific Iron Ore 2008 production volume is expected to be 7.9 million tonnes, with expected sales volume of 8.0 million tonnes. We expect Asia Pacific revenue per tonne of approximately $88. This estimate assumes a 65 percent increase in the 2008 international settlement price for lumps and fines, which is subject to change, as well as consideration that in 2007 our Asia Pacific Iron Ore segment benefited from a $30 million revenue currency hedging benefit unlikely to repeat in 2008. We expect Asia Pacific Iron Ore costs of approximately $53 per tonne. This estimate includes an expanded $23 million exploration program at the Companys Koolyanobbing operations targeted at expanding our iron ore reserves in Australia. Sonoma Coal Project Our Sonoma Coal Project is scheduled to commence shipments in the first quarter of 2008. Severe flooding at the mine in mid February 2008, has caused a delay in previously scheduled shipments. Incorporating the effects of the flooding, we expect total production of 2.0 million tonnes for 2008 in nearly equal amounts of hard coking and thermal coal. Revenue per tonne at Sonoma is expected to average $82, with projected cost of $78 per tonne. Amap&aacute; Iron Ore Project MMX has management control over the venture and has indicated plans to complete construction of the concentrator and ramp up operations during 2008. Production and sales are expected to total three to four million tonnes in 2008. Based on start up delays and production levels, we expect to incur significant equity losses in 2008. MMX expects Amap&aacute; to produce at the 6.5 million tonne design level in 2009. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses and Other Expectations As we continue to invest in management infrastructure related to our rapid growth and increased business development, selling, general and administrative expenses are anticipated to be approximately $150 million in 2008. We anticipate an effective tax rate in the range of 24 to 26 percent for the year. We also expect 2008 capital expenditures of approximately $200 million and depreciation and amortization of approximately $170 million. Critical Accounting Estimates Managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. Preparation of financial statements requires management to make assumptions, estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses, and the related disclosures of contingencies. Management bases its estimates on various assumptions and historical experience, which are believed to be reasonable; however, due to the inherent nature of estimates, actual results may differ significantly due to changed conditions or assumptions. On a regular basis, management reviews the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are fairly presented in accordance with GAAP. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material. Management believes that the following critical accounting estimates and judgments have a significant impact on our financial statements. Revenue Recognition North American Iron Ore Revenue is recognized on the sale of products when title to the product has transferred to the customer in accordance with the specified terms of each term supply agreement and all applicable criteria for revenue recognition have been satisfied. Generally, our North American term supply agreements provide that title transfers to the customers when payment is received. 57 Table of Contents We recorded revenue, cost of goods sold and sales margin of $87 million, $74 million and $13 million, respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2007 related to sales to customers under minimum purchase requirements of supply agreements, who have paid for the iron ore and requested the Company to not ship the iron ore until the spring of 2008, when the Great Lakes waterways re open for shipping. These bill and hold sales were made pursuant to long term contracts that include annual take or pay arrangements. In December 2006, two customers purchased and paid for 1.2 million tons of pellets in upper lakes stockpiles to meet 2006 contractual requirements. At the request of the customers, the ore was not shipped. We considered whether revenue should be recognized on these sales under the collect and hold guidance discussed in SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104 Topic 13, but because a fixed shipment schedule was not established prior to year end, revenue recognition on these transactions, totaling $62.6 million, was deferred until the product was delivered in 2007. Most of our North American Iron Ore long term supply agreements are comprised of a base price with annual price adjustment factors. These price adjustment factors vary from agreement to agreement but typically include adjustments based upon changes in international pellet prices, changes in specified Producers Price Indices including those for all commodities, industrial commodities, energy and steel. The adjustments generally operate in the same manner, with each factor typically comprising a portion of the price adjustment, although the weighting of each factor varies from agreement to agreement. One of our term supply agreements contains price collars, which typically limit the percentage increase or decrease in prices for our iron ore pellets during any one year. In most cases, these adjustment factors have not been finalized at the time our product is sold; we routinely estimate these adjustment factors. The price adjustment factors have been evaluated as embedded derivatives. We evaluated the embedded derivatives in the supply agreements in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended by SFAS 138, Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133. The price adjustment factors share the same economic characteristics and risks as the host contract and are integral to the host contract as inflation adjustments; accordingly they have not been separately valued as derivative instruments. Certain supply agreements with one customer include provisions for supplemental revenue or refunds based on the customers annual steel pricing for the year the product is consumed in the customers blast furnaces. We account for this provision as derivative instruments at the time of sale and record this provision at fair value until the year the product is consumed and the amounts are settled as an adjustment to revenue. Under some North American term supply agreements, we ship the product to ports on the Great Lakes and or to the customers facilities prior to the transfer of title. Our rationale for shipping iron ore products to some customers in advance of payment for the products is to minimize credit risk exposure. Generally, our North American term supply agreements specify that title and risk of loss pass to the customer when payment for the pellets is received. This is a practice utilized to reduce our financial risk to customer insolvency. Revenue from product sales includes cost reimbursements from venture partners for their share of mine costs. The mining ventures function as captive cost companies; they supply product only to their owners effectively on a cost basis. Accordingly, the minority interests revenue amounts are stated at cost of production and are offset in entirety by an equal amount included in cost of goods sold resulting in no profits or losses reflected in minority interest participants. As we are responsible for product fulfillment, we have the risks and rewards of a principal in the transaction and accordingly we record revenue in this arrangement on a gross basis in accordance with EITF 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal Versus Net as an Agent, under the line item Freight and other reimbursements. Revenue from product sales also includes reimbursement for freight charges paid on behalf of customers in Freight and Venture Partners Cost Reimbursements separate from product revenue, in accordance with EITF 00 10, Accounting for Shipping and Handling Fees and Costs. Where we are joint venture participants in the ownership of a North American iron ore mine, our contracts entitle us to receive royalties and management fees, which we earn as the pellets are produced. 58 Table of Contents North American Coal For domestic coal sales, revenue is recognized when title passes to the customer. This generally occurs when coal is loaded into rail cars at the mine. For export coal sales, this generally occurs when coal is loaded into the vessel at the terminal. Asia Pacific Iron Ore Portmans sales revenue is recognized at the F.O.B. point, which is generally when the product is loaded into the vessel. Foreign currency revenues are converted to Australian dollars at the currency exchange rate in effect at the time of the transaction. See Accounting Policies in Item 8 for a complete discussion of our revenue recognition policy. Litigation Accruals We are subject to proceedings, lawsuits and other claims. We are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as the potential ranges of probable losses. A determination of the amount of accrual required, if any, for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each matter. The required accrual may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach, such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters. We do not believe that any such matter will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Tax Contingencies Domestic and foreign tax authorities periodically audit our income tax returns. These audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. At any time, multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various tax authorities. In evaluating the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions, we record reserves for exposures where a position taken has not met a more likely than not threshold. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter, for which we have established a reserve, is audited and fully resolved. When facts change or the actual results of a settlement with tax authorities differs from our established reserve for a matter, we adjust our tax contingencies reserve and income tax provision in the period in which the facts changed or the income tax matter is resolved. Prior to 2007, we recorded estimated tax liabilities to the extent they were probable and could be reasonably estimated. On January 1, 2007, we adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48). The effects of applying this Interpretation resulted in a decrease of $7.7 million to retained earnings as of January 1, 2007. FIN 48 prescribes a more likely than not threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken (or expected to be taken in a tax return). This Interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, accounting for income taxes in interim periods and income tax disclosures. Mineral Reserves We regularly evaluate our economic mineral reserves and update them as required in accordance with SEC Industry Guide 7. The estimated mineral reserves could be affected by future industry conditions, geological conditions and ongoing mine planning. Maintenance of effective production capacity or the mineral reserve could require increases in capital and development expenditures. Generally as mining operations progress, haul lengths and lifts increase. Alternatively, changes in economic conditions, or the expected quality of ore reserves could decrease capacity or ore reserves. Technological progress could alleviate such factors, or increase capacity or ore reserves. We use our mineral reserve estimates combined with our estimated annual production levels, to determine the mine closure dates utilized in recording the fair value liability for asset retirement obligations. See NOTE 5 ENVIRONMENTAL AND MINE CLOSURE OBLIGATIONS for further information. Since the liability 59 Table of Contents represents the present value of the expected future obligation, a significant change in mineral reserves or mine lives would have a substantial effect on the recorded obligation. We also utilize economic mineral reserves for evaluating potential impairments of mine assets and in determining maximum useful lives utilized to calculate depreciation and amortization of long lived mine assets. Decreases in mineral reserves or mine lives could significantly affect these items. Asset Retirement Obligations The accrued mine closure obligations for our active mining operations provide for contractual and legal obligations associated with the eventual closure of the mining operations. Our obligations are determined based on detailed estimates adjusted for factors that an outside party would consider (i.e., inflation, overhead and profit), which were escalated (at an assumed three percent) to the estimated closure dates, and then discounted using a credit adjusted risk free interest rate for the initial estimates. The estimate at December 31, 2007 and 2006 included incremental increases in the closure cost estimates and changes in estimates of mine lives. The closure date for each location was determined based on the exhaustion date of the remaining iron ore reserves. The estimated obligations are particularly sensitive to the impact of changes in mine lives given the difference between the inflation and discount rates. Changes in the base estimates of legal and contractual closure costs due to changed legal or contractual requirements, available technology, inflation, overhead or profit rates would also have a significant impact on the recorded obligations. See NOTE 6 ENVIRONMENTAL AND MINE CLOSURE OBLIGATIONS for further information. Asset Impairment We monitor conditions that indicate that the carrying value of an asset or asset group may be impaired. We determine impairment based on the assets ability to generate cash flow greater than its carrying value, utilizing an undiscounted probability weighted analysis. If the analysis indicates the asset is impaired, the carrying value is adjusted to fair value. Fair value can be determined by market value and also comparable sales transactions or using a discounted cash flow method. The impairment analysis and fair value determination can result in significantly different outcomes based on critical assumptions and estimates including the quantity and quality of remaining economic ore reserves, future iron ore prices and production costs. Environmental Remediation Costs We have a formal policy for environmental protection and restoration. Our obligations for known environmental problems at active and closed mining operations and other sites have been recognized based on estimates of the cost of investigation and remediation at each site. If the estimate can only be estimated as a range of possible amounts, with no specific amount being most likely, the minimum of the range is accrued. Management reviews its environmental remediation sites quarterly to determine if additional cost adjustments or disclosures are required. The characteristics of environmental remediation obligations, where information concerning the nature and extent of clean up activities is not immediately available, or changes in regulatory requirements, result in a significant risk of increase to the obligations as they mature. Expected future expenditures are not discounted to present value unless the amount and timing of the cash disbursements are readily known. Potential insurance recoveries are not recognized until realized. Employee Retirement Benefit Obligations The Company and its North American Iron Ore mining ventures sponsor defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all North American employees. These plans are largely noncontributory, and benefits are generally based on employees years of service and average earnings for a defined period prior to retirement. We do not provide OPEB for most U.S. salaried employees hired after January 1, 1993. Pursuant to a 2003 asset purchase agreement with the previous owner, PinnOak assumed postretirement benefits for certain employees who will vest more than five years after the asset purchase date of June 30, 2003. Postretirement benefits for vested employees and those that will vest within the five year period subsequent to the acquisition date remain obligations of the previous owner. PinnOak records a provision for estimated postretirement benefits for employees not covered by the asset purchase agreement with the former owner based upon annual valuations. 60 Table of Contents Portman does not have employee retirement benefit obligations. On September 12, 2006, the Companys Board of Directors approved modifications to the pension benefits provided to salaried participants. The modifications retroactively reinstated the final average pay benefit formula (previously terminated and replaced with a cash balance formula in July 2003) to allow for additional accruals through June 30, 2008 or the continuation of benefits under an improved cash balance formula, whichever is greater. The change increased the PBO by $15.1 million and pension expense by $1.1 million in 2006. Following is a summary of our defined benefit pension and OPEB funding and expense for the years 2005 through 2008: (In Millions) Pension OPEB Funding Expense Funding Expense 2005 $ 38.1 $ 18.9 $ 29.2 $ 13.7 2006 40.7 23.0 30.4 9.8 2007 32.5 17.4 23.0 4.5 2008 (Estimated) 24.4 15.4 16.0 3.9 Assumptions used in determining the benefit obligations and the value of plan assets for defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefit plans (primarily retiree healthcare benefits) offered by the Company are evaluated periodically by management. Critical assumptions, such as the discount rate used to measure the benefit obligations, the expected long term rate of return on plan assets, and the medical care cost trend are reviewed annually. At December 31, 2007, we increased our discount rate for U.S. plans to 6.00 percent from 5.75 percent at December 31, 2006. Additionally, we adopted the IRS static 2023/2015 (separate pre retirement and postretirement) table on December 31, 2007, to determine the expected life of our plan participants, replacing the 1994 GAM table. Following are sensitivities on estimated 2008 pension and OPEB expense of potential further changes in these key assumptions: Increase in 2008 Expense(In Millions) Pension OPEB Decrease discount rate .25 percent $ 1.5 $ 0.4 Decrease return on assets 1 percent 5.8 1.3 Increase medical trend rate 1 percent N/A 4.1 Changes in actuarial assumptions, including discount rates, employee retirement rates, mortality, compensation levels, plan asset investment performance, and healthcare costs, are determined by the Company based on analyses of actual and expected factors. Changes in actuarial assumptions and or investment performance of plan assets can have a significant impact on our financial condition due to the magnitude of our retirement obligations. See NOTE 8 RETIREMENT RELATED BENEFITS in Item 8 for further information. Accounting for Business Combinations In July 2007, we completed the acquisition of PinnOak. We allocated the purchase price to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their relative fair value at the date of acquisition, pursuant to SFAS 141, Business Combinations. The estimated purchase price allocation is preliminary and is subject to revision. Additional valuation work is being conducted on mineral reserves, black lung obligations, property, plant and equipment and real estate values. In estimating the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, we consider information obtained during our due diligence process and utilize various valuation methods, including market prices, where available, comparisons to transactions for similar assets and liabilities and present value of estimated future cash flows. We are required to make subjective estimates in connection with these valuations and allocations. 61 Table of Contents Forward Looking Statements This report contains statements that constitute forward looking statements.
