Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Overview Cliffs Natural Resources Inc. traces its corporate history back to 1847. Today, we are an international mining and natural resources company. We are the largest producer of iron ore pellets in North America, a major supplier of direct shipping lump and fines iron ore out of Australia, and a significant producer of metallurgical coal. Our company is organized according to product category and geographic location: North American Iron Ore, North American Coal, Asia Pacific Iron Ore, Asia Pacific Coal and Latin American Iron Ore. In North America, we operate six iron ore mines in Michigan, Minnesota and Eastern Canada, and two coking coal mine complexes located in West Virginia and Alabama. Our Asia Pacific operations include full ownership of Portman, which is comprised of two iron ore mining complexes in Western Australia, serving the Asian iron ore markets with direct shipping fines and lump ore, and a 45 percent economic interest in Sonoma, a coking and thermal coal mine located in Queensland, Australia. In Latin America, we have a 30 percent interest in Amap&aacute;, a Brazilian iron ore project, as well as a number of smaller greenfield projects not yet in production. Over recent years, we have been executing a strategy designed to achieve scale in the mining industry and focused on serving the worlds largest and fastest growing steel markets. Safety remains the No. 1 priority within our Company. Our North American Iron Ore segment had a total reportable incident rate, as defined by MSHA, of 2.29 in 2008, compared with the prior year result of 1.93. Our North American Coal operations had a total reportable incident rate of 8.44 compared with a rate of 6.66 in 2007. Although the total reportable injury rates in North America were slightly unfavorable, other recognized safety measures showed marked improvements from 2007. Our North American Iron Ore segment finished the year with a 13 percent decline in the all injury frequency rate from 2007, and our North American Coal segment recorded a 20 percent decline in injury severity rates from the prior year. We have developed close collaboration between our North American segments to drive further improvements in our safety results. At our Asia Pacific Iron Ore operations, Koolyanobbings total reportable incident rate for 2008 was 2.50, compared with the 2007 result of 0.83. Cockatoo Island reported a total reportable incident rate of 6.12 in 2008 compared with 2.61 in 2007. Asia Pacific Iron Ore safety statistics include employees and contractors. We continued to deliver strong financial performance in 2008 while continuing to execute on our strategic plan, which includes consolidating minority positions, exploring external and organic growth opportunities, and striving for operational excellence in each of our business segments. Consolidated revenues for 2008 increased to $3.6 billion, with net income of $4.76 per diluted share. This compares with revenues of $2.3 billion and net income of $2.57 per diluted share in 2007. Global crude steel growth, a significant driver of our business was down approximately two percent from 2007 with supply and demand of steel raw materials extremely tight. Worldwide demand for metallurgical coal increased throughout most of 2008 as supply side constraints, including flooding in the Bowen Basin, a major coal producing area of Australia, port congestion, and production problems at large mines in the United States continue to place upward pressure on pricing. However, the current volatility and uncertainty in global markets, coupled with the slowdown in the worlds major economies, has had a significant impact on commodity prices. The mining industry has seen a reduction in high cost operations, and the credit environment is expected to limit the funding and expansion capabilities of many mining companies. Based on these economic conditions, we continue to evaluate and assess our capital expenditures, in order to ensure we are positioned to face the challenges and uncertainties associated with the current environment. We reacted quickly to align production with lower demand for steel and steelmaking materials entering the fourth quarter of 2008. While remaining attuned to current macroeconomic challenges, we continue to seek low risk expansion opportunities and, at the same time, position ourselves to weather any difficult times that lie ahead. Results in 2008 were also impacted by considerable volatility in foreign currency exchange rates, which resulted in significant changes in the fair value of our derivative instruments. In particular, we use derivative financial instruments to reduce the volatility attributable to changes in Australian and United States currency 50 Table of Contents fluctuations related to our operations in Asia Pacific. We recorded unrealized losses of $188.2 million in our Statement of Consolidated Operations in 2008 as a result of substantial declines in the spot rates related to the depreciation of the Australian dollar relative to the United States dollar during the year. We are engaged with expanding our leadership position in the industry by focusing on high product quality, technical excellence, superior relationships with our customers and partners and improved operational efficiency through cost saving initiatives. We operate a fully equipped research and development facility in Ishpeming, Michigan. Our research and development group is staffed with experienced engineers and scientists and is organized to support the geological interpretation, process mineralogy, mine engineering, mineral processing, pyrometallurgy, advanced process control and analytical service disciplines. Our research and development group is also utilized by iron ore pellet customers for laboratory testing and simulation of blast furnace conditions. Segments We organize our business according to product category and geographic location: North American Iron Ore, North American Coal, Asia Pacific Iron Ore, Asia Pacific Coal and Latin American Iron Ore. The North American Iron Ore segment is comprised of our interests in six North American mines that provide iron ore to the integrated steel industry. The North American Coal segment is comprised of our two North American coking coal mining complexes that provide metallurgical coal to the integrated steel industry. The Asia Pacific Iron Ore segment, which is comprised of Portman, is located in Western Australia and provides iron ore to steel producers in China and Japan. There are no intersegment revenues. The Asia Pacific Coal operating segment is comprised of our 45 percent economic interest in Sonoma, located in Queensland, Australia, which is in the early stages of production. The Latin American Iron Ore operating segment is comprised of our 30 percent Amap&aacute; interest in Brazil, which is also in the early stages of production. As a result, the Asia Pacific Coal and Latin American Iron Ore operating segments do not meet reportable segment disclosure requirements and therefore are not separately reported. All North American business segments are headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio. Offices in Duluth, Minnesota, have shared services groups supporting the North American business segments. Our Technology Group is located in Ishpeming, Michigan. Our Asia Pacific headquarters are located in Perth, Australia, and our Latin American headquarters are located in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Cliffs International Minera&ccedil;&atilde;o Brasil, Ltda and Cliffs Natural Resources Pty Limited provide technical and administrative support for our assets in Latin America and Australia, respectively, as well as new business development services in these regions. See NOTE 6 SEGMENT REPORTING for further information. Growth Strategy and Strategic Transactions We expect to grow our business and presence as an international mining and natural resources company by expanding both geographically and through the minerals that we mine and market in order to achieve scale in our industry. Our growth domestically, combined with our investments in Australia and Latin America, as well as acquisitions in minerals outside of iron ore, such as coal, illustrate the execution of this growth strategy. While ever conscious of the challenges associated with the current economic environment, we continue to identify low risk opportunities to grow and at the same time position ourselves to address the uncertainties that lie ahead. In 2008, we continued our strategic growth and transformation to an international mining company through the following acquisitions, partnerships and re branding: Portman Share Repurchase and Off Market Takeover Investment in AusQuest United Taconite Purchase Michigan Expansion Projects Investment in Golden West Change in Corporate Name to Cliffs Natural Resources Inc. 51 Table of Contents Refer to Recent Developments within Item 1 Business, for additional information regarding each of these strategic transactions. Other Significant Developments Ratification of New Labor Agreement Hourly employees at our Michigan and Minnesota iron ore mining operations, excluding Northshore, are represented by the USW. On October 6, 2008, the USW ratified a new four year labor contract, which replaces the labor agreement that expired on September 1, 2008. The new agreement covers approximately 2,300 USW represented workers at our Empire and Tilden mines in Michigan, and our United Taconite and Hibbing mines in Minnesota. Termination of Merger with Alpha Natural Resources On November 17, 2008, we announced the termination of the definitive merger agreement with Alpha Natural Resources, Inc., under which we would have acquired all outstanding shares of Alpha, as previously announced on July 16, 2008. Both our Board of Directors and Alphas Board of Directors made the decision after considering various issues, including the current macroeconomic environment, uncertainty in the steel industry, shareholder dynamics, and the risks and costs of potential litigation. Considering these issues, each board determined that termination of the merger agreement was in the best interest of its equity holders. Results of Operations Consolidated 2008 Compared to 2007 For the year ended December 31, 2008, consolidated revenues increased to $3.6 billion, with net income of $4.76 per diluted share. This compares with revenues of $2.3 billion and net income of $2.57 per diluted share in 2007. Revenue from Product Sales and Services Sales revenue in 2008 increased $1.3 billion, or 59 percent, compared with 2007. The increase in sales revenue was primarily due to higher sales prices combined with increases in sales volume. Higher sales volume in 2008 was primarily due to increased demand and commitments under our long term pellet sales agreements, increased spot sales, and customer plant outages during the prior year. However, this increase was partially offset by declines in sales volumes to customers during the fourth quarter of 2008 as a result of the current volatility and uncertainty in global markets, which has led to production slowdowns in the steel industry. In addition, sales volume was negatively impacted throughout the year by adverse mining conditions and production delays at our North American Coal segment. Results for North American Coal in 2007 represent five months of operations since the July 31, 2007 acquisition. Revenues related to our North American Iron Ore segment increased approximately $624.2 million over the prior year primarily as a result of higher steel prices, renegotiated and new long term supply agreements with certain customers, which were negotiated at world pellet prices, and other contractual price adjustment factors. In 2008, revenue also included $225.5 million related to the supplemental steel payments compared with $98.3 million in 2007. In addition, the Australian benchmark prices for lump and fines settled at increases of 97 percent and 80 percent in 2008, thereby resulting in higher revenues from our Asia Pacific Iron Ore segment compared with prior year. Cost of Goods Sold Cost of goods sold was $2.4 billion in 2008, an increase of $636.2 million, or 35 percent compared with 2007. The increase in cost of goods sold in 2008 was primarily due to higher costs of production, higher royalty fees related to the increases in pellet pricing, and increased maintenance costs associated with the Michigan expansion project and major furnace repairs at Empire and United Taconite during the first quarter. In 2008, we continued to be challenged with adverse geological conditions across the mines at our North American Coal 52 Table of Contents segment and delays in delivery of new capital equipment, which contributed to overall equipment performance and availability issues, thereby resulting in production delays and increased costs in all operations. Results for North American Coal in 2007 represent five months of operations since the July 31, 2007 acquisition. Costs were also negatively impacted in 2008 by approximately $1.6 million related to unfavorable foreign exchange rates as well as higher fuel and energy costs primarily related to our North American and Asia Pacific iron ore operations, which together increased $42.5 million compared with 2007. In addition, the impact of the United Taconite and Portman step acquisitions also contributed to the increase from prior year. Other Operating Income (Expense) Following is a summary of other operating income (expense) for 2008 and 2007: (In Millions) 2008 2007 VarianceFavorable/(Unfavorable) Casualty recoveries $ 10.5 $ 3.2 $ 7.3 Royalties and management fee revenue 21.7 14.5 7.2 Selling, general and administrative expenses (188.6 ) (114.2 ) (74.4 ) Terminated acquisition costs (90.1 ) (90.1 ) Gain on sale of other assets net 22.8 18.4 4.4 Miscellaneous net 2.9 (2.3 ) 5.2 $ (220.8 ) $ (80.4 ) $ (140.4 ) The increase in selling, general and administrative expense of $74.4 million in 2008 compared with 2007 is primarily a result of $20.2 million in higher share based and incentive compensation, and higher wages and benefits related to an increase in the number of employees. We also incurred approximately $2.2 million in corporate severance costs during the fourth quarter of 2008. Outside professional service and legal fees associated with the expansion of our business increased approximately $15.1 million in 2008. Expenses at our Asia Pacific Iron Ore segment were $5.7 million higher than the prior year, reflecting higher employment costs and outside professional services to support business development and improvement efforts. The current year was also impacted by additional corporate development activities in Latin America, Asia Pacific, and other general business development, resulting in an increase of approximately $13.0 million. In addition, 2008 includes a full year of selling, general and administrative expenses from our North American Coal segment, compared with five months in 2007 based on a July 31, 2007 date of acquisition, resulting in an increase of $5.1 million. Selling, general and administrative expense in 2008 was also impacted by a charge in the first quarter of approximately $6.8 million in connection with a legal case as well as $4.3 million related to our interest in Sonoma acquired in 2007. On November 17, 2008, we announced the termination of the definitive merger agreement with Alpha Natural Resources, Inc., under which we would have acquired all outstanding shares of Alpha, as previously announced on July 16, 2008. Both our Board of Directors and Alphas Board of Directors made the decision after considering various issues, including the current macroeconomic environment, uncertainty in the steel industry, shareholder dynamics, and the risks and costs of potential litigation. Considering these issues, each board determined that termination of the merger agreement was in the best interest of its equity holders. Under the terms of the settlement agreement, we were required to pay Alpha a $70 million termination fee, which was financed through our revolving credit facility and paid in November 2008. As a result, $90.1 million in termination fees and associated acquisition costs were expensed in the fourth quarter of 2008 upon termination of the definitive merger agreement. The gain on sale of other assets of $22.8 million in 2008 primarily relates to the sale of our wholly owned subsidiary, Cliffs Synfuel Corp. (Synfuel), which was completed on June 4, 2008. Under the agreement, Oil Shale Exploration Company Skyline, LLC acquired 100 percent of Synfuel for $24 million. As additional consideration for the stock, a perpetual nonparticipating royalty interest was granted initially equal to $0.02 per barrel of shale oil and $0.01 per barrel of shale oil produced from lands covered by existing State of Utah oil 53 Table of Contents shale leases, plus 25 percent of royalty payments from conventional oil and gas operations. We recorded a gain of $19 million in the second quarter of 2008 upon completion of the transaction. The prior year gain on sale of assets of $18.4 million primarily reflected the fourth quarter 2007 gain on the sale of portions of the former LTVSMC site. The sale included cash proceeds of approximately $18 million. The increase in casualty recoveries in 2008 compared with 2007 is primarily attributable to a $9.2 million insurance recovery recognized in the current year related to a 2006 electrical explosion at our United Taconite facility. Other income (expense) Following is a summary of other income (expense) for 2008 and 2007: (In Millions) 2008 2007 VarianceFavorable/(Unfavorable) Changes in fair value of derivative instruments, net $ (188.2 ) $ $ (188.2 ) Impairment of investments (25.1 ) (25.1 ) Interest income 26.2 20.0 6.2 Interest expense (39.8 ) (22.6 ) (17.2 ) Other net 4.3 1.7 2.6 $ (222.6 ) $ (0.9 ) $ (221.7 ) The impact of changes in the fair value of derivative instruments on our Statement of Consolidated Operations in 2008 primarily relates to the de designation of the Portman cash flow hedges for accounting purposes. We are required to record on our Statements of Consolidated Financial Position the market value of our open derivative positions which do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. Previously, when the derivative instruments were designated as cash flow hedges, the mark to market adjustments related to the effective portions of the hedges were recorded as a component of Other comprehensive income. Upon de designation of the cash flow hedges, effective July 1, 2008, the instruments are prospectively marked to fair value, and the adjustments resulting from changes in the market value of these derivative instruments are recorded as an unrealized gain or loss each reporting period. The following table represents our foreign currency derivative contract position as of December 31, 2008: ($ in Millions) Contract Maturity Notional Amount Weighted AverageExchange Rate Spot Rate Fair Value Contract Portfolio (excluding AUD Call Options) (1): Contracts expiring in the next 12 months $ 537.0 0.81 0.69 $ (77.5 ) Contracts expiring in the next 13 to 24 months 202.5 0.74 0.69 (25.5 ) Contracts expiring in the next 25 to 36 months 55.0 0.77 0.69 (8.8 ) Total $ 794.5 0.79 0.69 $ (111.8 ) AUD Call Options (2) Contracts expiring in the next 12 months $ 33.0 0.87 0.69 $ 0.3 Contracts expiring in the next 13 to 24 months 41.5 0.90 0.69 0.6 Contracts expiring in the next 25 to 36 months Total $ 74.5 0.88 0.69 $ 0.9 Total Hedge Contract Portfolio $ 869.0 $ (110.9 ) (1) Includes collar options, convertible collar options and forward exchange contracts. (2) AUD call options are excluded from the weighted average exchange rate used for the remainder of the contract portfolio due to the unlimited downside participation associated with these instruments. 54 Table of Contents The significant unrealized mark to market fluctuations are related to the spot rate of A$0.69 as of December 31, 2008, which significantly decreased from the spot rate of A$0.96 as of June 30, 2008 upon de designation of the hedges. The changes in the spot rates are correlated to the depreciation of the Australian dollar relative to the United States dollar during the period. In addition, the amount of outstanding contracts in Portmans foreign exchange hedge book significantly increased from $559.2 million at June 30, 2008 to approximately $869.0 million as of December 31, 2008, primarily as a result of higher sales prices in the current year partially offset by the expiration of contracts upon maturity. In 2008, we recorded impairment charges of $25.1 million related to declines in the fair value of our available for sale securities which we concluded were other than temporary. As of December 31, 2008, our investments in PolyMet and Golden West had fair values totaling $6.2 million and $4.7 million, respectively, compared with a cost of $14.2 million and $21.8 million, respectively. The metals and mining industry and our investees are susceptible to changes in the U.S. and global economies and the industries of their customers. Their principal customers are part of the global steel industry, and their businesses have been adversely affected by the slowdown of the global economy, particularly during the last quarter of 2008 when our investments became impaired. The severity of the impairments in relation to the carrying amounts of the individual investments is consistent with the macroeconomic market and industry developments. However, we have evaluated the near term prospects of the issuers in relation to the severity and rapid decline in the fair value of each of these investments, and based upon that evaluation, we could not reasonably assert that the impairment period would be temporary primarily as a result of the global economic crisis and the corresponding uncertainties in the market. The increase in interest income in 2008 compared with 2007 is attributable to additional cash and investments held by Portman during the year coupled with higher overall average returns. However, investment returns were lower in the fourth quarter of 2008 as a result of market declines. Higher interest expense in 2008 reflected increased borrowings under our senior notes and interest accretion for the deferred payment related to the PinnOak acquisition. See NOTE 5 DEBT AND CREDIT FACILITIES for further information. Income Taxes Our tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 was $144.2 million and $84.1 million, respectively. The increase is primarily attributable to higher pre tax book income partially offset by a decrease in our effective tax rate. Our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 was 20.1 percent and 22.1 percent, respectively. The 2.0 percent decrease is primarily attributable to increased percentage depletion and release of the valuation allowance related to foreign net operating losses. See NOTE 10 INCOME TAXES for further information. Minority Interest Minority interest in consolidated income increased $5.6 million, or 36 percent, for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase is primarily driven by a corresponding increase in the operating results of Portman, a consolidated subsidiary in which we owned approximately 80.4 percent in 2007 and throughout the first half of 2008. In June 2008, we acquired an additional 4.8 percent interest in Portman through a share repurchase program offered by Portman. We subsequently made an off market offer to purchase the outstanding shares and proceeded with a compulsory acquisition of the remaining shares to obtain full ownership of Portman in the fourth quarter of 2008. In addition, effective July 1, 2008, we acquired the remaining 30 percent interest in United Taconite. Upon consummation of the purchase, our ownership interest increased from 70 percent to 100 percent. Each of these transactions constituted a step acquisition of a non controlling interest, thereby reducing minority interest in consolidated income on a prospective basis. In accordance with SFAS 141, Business Combinations, we accounted for the acquisition of the minority interests by the purchase method. As a result of each step acquisition, the then historical cost basis of the minority interest balance was reduced to the extent of the percentage interest sold, and the increased ownership obtained was accounted for by increasing the entitys basis from historical cost to fair value for the portion of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the additional ownership acquired. 55 Table of Contents Equity Loss in Ventures The equity loss in ventures for the year ended December 31, 2008 of $35.1 million primarily represents our share of the operating results of our equity method investment in Amap&aacute;. Such results mainly consist of start up and operating losses of $45.6 million, which includes operating losses from Amap&aacute;s railroad of $5.8 million. The loss was partially offset by foreign currency hedge gains of $10.5 million. This compares with a loss of $11.2 million in 2007, comprised of $7.2 million in pre production costs and $4.0 million of operating losses from the railroad. The negative operating results in the current year are mainly due to slower than anticipated ramp up of operations and product yields. We evaluate the loss in value of our equity method investments each reporting period to determine whether the loss is other than temporary. Based upon the increase in equity losses resulting from start up costs and production delays in 2008, we determined that indicators of impairment may exist relative to our investment in Amap&aacute;. Accordingly, we performed an assessment of the potential impairment of our investment during the fourth quarter of 2008 using a discounted cash flow model to determine the fair value of our investment in relation to its carrying value as of December 31, 2008. Based upon the analysis performed, we have determined that our investment is not impaired. In addition, we will continue to evaluate the results of our investment on a quarterly basis while monitoring the declines in pricing and the potential impact on our business as a result of the recent economic downturn in the industry. 2007 Compared to 2006 For the year ended December 31, 2007, consolidated revenues increased to $2.3 billion, with net income of $2.57 per diluted share. This compared with revenues of $1.9 billion and net income of $2.60 per diluted share in 2006. Revenue from Product Sales and Services Sales revenue in 2007 increased $353.5 million, or 18 percent, compared with 2006. The increase in sales revenue was primarily due to higher sales prices combined with increases in sales volume. In relation to our North American Iron Ore segment, sales volume in 2007 included 1.5 million tons of pellets purchased and paid for by customers at year end under take or pay provisions of existing long term supply agreements. First half shipments in 2007 included 1.2 million tons of pellets purchased in upper Great Lakes stockpiles and paid for in 2006. Revenue recognition related to the December 2006 stockpile transaction totaling $62.6 million was deferred until the product was delivered in 2007. The completion of a two million tonne per annum expansion at Koolyanobbing in late 2006 also resulted in increased sales volume in 2007 related to our Asia Pacific Iron Ore segment. Sales prices per ton increased year over year in relation to our iron ore business both domestically and abroad, reflecting the effect of contractual base price increases, higher term supply agreement escalation factors including higher steel pricing, higher PPI and lag year adjustments. In addition, 2007 included incremental revenue of $85.2 million related to our North American Coal segment acquired on July 31, 2007. Cost of Goods Sold Cost of goods sold was $1.8 billion in 2007, an increase of $305.5 million, or 20 percent compared with 2006. The increase in cost of goods sold and operating expenses primarily reflected higher volume in 2007. On a per ton basis, cost of goods sold and operating expenses for our North American Iron Ore segment were flat in comparison to 2006, as a result of our strategic procurement, maintenance and other business improvement programs, as well as the implementation of Six Sigma and Lean Sigma. Costs were also negatively impacted in 2007 by unfavorable foreign exchange rates as well as changeover costs associated with a new mining contractor at our Asia Pacific Iron Ore segment. In addition, cost of goods sold in 2007 included incremental expense of $116.9 million related to our North American Coal segment acquired on July 31, 2007. 56 Table of Contents Other Operating Income (Expense) Following is a summary of other operating income (expense) for 2007 and 2006: (In Millions) 2007 2006 VarianceFavorable/(Unfavorable) Casualty recoveries $ 3.2 $ $ 3.2 Royalties and management fee revenue 14.5 11.7 2.8 Selling, general and administrative expenses (114.2 ) (72.4 ) (41.8 ) Gain on sale of other assets net 18.4 18.4 Miscellaneous net (2.3 ) 12.4 (14.7 ) $ (80.4 ) $ (48.3 ) $ (32.1 ) Selling, general and administrative expense of $114.2 million increased $41.8 million compared with the prior year, primarily reflecting higher employment costs related to our expanding business, including expenses at North American Coal and our Asia Pacific locations; increased outside professional service fees and higher legal fees. Gain on sale of assets of $18.4 million primarily reflected the fourth quarter 2007 gain on the sale of portions of the former LTVSMC site. The sale included cash proceeds of approximately $18 million. Miscellaneous net expense of $2.3 million in 2007 increased $14.7 million compared with 2006, primarily reflecting increased mark to market hedging losses at our Asia Pacific Iron Ore business. Other Income (Expense) Following is a summary of other income (expense) for 2007 and 2006: (In Millions) 2007 2006 VarianceFavorable/(Unfavorable) Interest income $ 20.0 $ 17.2 2.8 Interest expense (22.6 ) (5.3 ) (17.3 ) Other net 1.7 10.2 (8.5 ) $ (0.9 ) $ 22.1 $ (23.0 ) Interest income of $20.0 million increased $2.8 million compared with the prior year, reflecting average higher cash and investment balances and higher average interest rates in our Asia Pacific iron ore business. Interest expense of $22.6 million increased $17.3 million compared with the prior year, primarily reflecting borrowings from the credit facility to fund the acquisition of PinnOak. Income Taxes Income tax expense of $84.1 million in 2007 was $6.8 million lower than the comparable amount in 2006. The decrease was due to lower pre tax income in 2007 and a lower effective tax rate. Our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 was 22.1 percent and 23.4 percent, respectively. The 1.3 percent decrease is attributable to lower pre tax book income offset by increased percentage depletion netted with increased contingent foreign income taxes. See NOTE 10 INCOME TAXES in Item 8 for further information. Minority Interest Minority interest decreased $1.5 million, or 9 percent from the prior year. Minority interest represented the 19.6 percent minority interest related to Asia Pacific Iron Ore earnings. 57 Table of Contents Equity Loss in Ventures The equity loss in ventures, $11.2 million, represented the results from the Companys investment in Amap&aacute;, primarily pre production costs, $7.2 million and operating losses from the railroad, $4.0 million. Results of Operations Segment Information Our company is organized and managed according to product category and geographic location. Segment information reflects our strategic business units, which are organized to meet customer requirements and global competition. We evaluate segment performance based on sales margin, defined as revenues less cost of goods sold identifiable to each segment. This measure of operating performance is an effective measurement as we focus on reducing production costs throughout the Company. 2008 Compared to 2007 North American Iron Ore Following is a summary of North American Iron Ore results for 2008 and 2007: (In Millions) Change due to 2008 2007 Salesprice andrate Salesvolume Freight andreimbursements Totalchange Revenues from product sales and services $ 2,369.6 $ 1,745.4 $ 596.1 $ 34.4 $ (6.3 ) $ 624.2 Cost of goods sold and operating expense (1,565.3 ) (1,347.5 ) (199.0 ) (25.1 ) 6.3 (217.8 ) Sales margin $ 804.3 $ 397.9 $ 397.1 $ 9.3 $ $ 406.4 Sales tons 22.7 22.3 The increase in sales revenue in 2008 was primarily due to higher sales prices combined with an increase in sales volume. Revenue per ton increased 33.3 percent in the current year primarily as a result of higher steel prices, renegotiated and new long term supply agreements with certain customers, which were negotiated at a time of higher world pellet prices, and other contractual price adjustment factors. In 2008, revenue included $225.5 million related to the supplemental steel payments compared with $98.3 million in 2007. The comparison of sales volume between 2008 and 2007 shows a slight increase year over year. However, in 2007, certain of our customers purchased and paid for approximately 1.5 million tons of iron ore pellets in stockpiles at the end of the year in order to comply with the take or pay provisions of their existing long term supply agreements. The customers requested via a fixed shipping schedule that we not ship the iron ore until the spring of 2008, when the Great Lakes waterways re opened for shipping. We recognized revenue on the 1.5 million tons in 2007. The following represents a comparison of sales volume in 2008, 2007 and 2006 as if the impact of the stockpile sales were excluded from the period reported and instead recognized in the period shipped: (In Millions) Actual SalesTonsRecognized Cash Received /Sales Tons NotRecognized Pro FormaSalesTons 2006 20.3 1.2 21.5 2007 22.3 (1.2 ) 21.1 2008 22.7 1.2 23.9 Absent the impact of the stockpile sales, the increase in sales volume in the current year is primarily due to increased demand during the first three quarters of 2008, commitments under our long term pellet sales agreements, and customer plant outages during 2007. However, this increase was partially offset by declines in sales volumes to customers during the fourth quarter of 2008 as a result of the current volatility and uncertainty in global markets, which has led to production curtailments in the steel industry. 58 Table of Contents The increase in 2008 revenue is also attributable to a $50.6 million favorable mark to market adjustment related to the unsold tons associated with our purchase of the remaining 30 percent interest in United Taconite. Refer to Derivative Financial Instruments within NOTE 1 BUSINESS SUMMARY AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, of our consolidated financial statements for further information on the derivative instrument associated with the provisions of this purchase agreement. The increase in cost of goods sold and operating expense in 2008 was primarily due to higher costs of production, higher royalty fees primarily related to the increases in pellet pricing, and increased maintenance costs associated with the Michigan expansion project. Fuel and energy costs increased $28.4 million compared with 2007. In addition, the impact of the United Taconite step acquisition also contributed to the increase year over year. Production Following is a summary of iron ore production tonnage for 2008 and 2007: (In Millions) (1) Company Share Total Mine 2008 2007 2008 2007 Empire 3.6 3.9 4.6 4.9 Tilden 6.5 6.1 7.6 7.2 Hibbing 1.9 1.7 8.2 7.4 Northshore 5.5 5.2 5.5 5.2 United Taconite 4.3 3.7 5.1 5.3 Wabush 1.1 1.2 4.2 4.6 Total 22.9 21.8 35.2 34.6 (1) Long tons of pellets (2,240 pounds). The decrease in production at Empire compared with the prior year is primarily due to Empire processing Tilden ore to produce 0.4 million tons of pellets under a test period. The corresponding increase is reflected at Tilden, bringing total 2008 production to 7.6 million tons compared with 7.2 million tons in 2007. The increase in Hibbings production in 2008 compared with 2007 was a result of the shutdown in late February 2007 due to severe weather conditions that caused significant buildup of ice in the basin supplying water to the processing facility. The full year production loss in 2007 totaled approximately 0.8 million tons (Company share 0.2 million tons). The increase in production in 2008 at Northshore was due to reactivation of one of the furnaces at the end of March 2008. Accordingly, production at Northshore benefited from an incremental increase of approximately 0.6 million tons in 2008 and is expected to benefit from an increase of 0.8 million tons of annual capacity thereafter. This increase was partially offset by production curtailments totaling 0.3 million tons in the fourth quarter from idling pellet furnaces in response to production slowdowns in the steel industry. The increase in our share of production at United Taconite is primarily related to the acquisition of the remaining 30 percent interest in July 2008. United Taconites 2008 production was reduced by 0.2 million tons in the fourth quarter from idling a pellet furnace in response to production slowdowns in the steel industry. In December 2008, we executed plans to reduce production at our six North American iron ore mines to approximately 15 million equity tons. This compares with 2008 production of 22.9 million equity tons. In order to implement the lower production levels, we have temporarily idled various pellet furnaces and initiated workforce adjustments at each of our North American Iron Ore mines. Based on current market uncertainties and corresponding blast furnace capacity utilization in North America, we continue to monitor the marketplace and will adjust our production plans for 2009 accordingly. 59 Table of Contents North American Coal Following is a summary of North American Coal results for 2008 and 2007: (In Millions, except tonnage) Twelve Months Five Months Change due to Ended December 31, Sales priceand rate Salesvolume Freight andreimbursements Totalchange 2008 2007 Revenues from product sales and services $ 346.3 $ 85.2 $ 70.5 $ 147.9 $ 42.7 $ 261.1 Cost of goods sold and operating expense (392.7 ) (116.9 ) (29.3 ) (203.8 ) (42.7 ) (275.8 ) Sales margin $ (46.4 ) $ (31.7 ) $ 41.2 $ (55.9 ) $ $ (14.7 ) Sales tons (in thousands) 3,241 1,171 Results for 2007 represent five month totals since the July 31, 2007 acquisition. We reported losses of $46.4 million and $31.7 million in sales margin for the year ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Sales volume and costs in 2008 continued to be negatively impacted by adverse mining conditions and production delays throughout the year. In addition, we declared force majeure on customer shipments from our Pinnacle mine in mid March 2008. Production at the mine slowed as a result of encountering a fault area within the coal panel being mined at the time. The force majeure was lifted in mid June. Despite completion of a longwall move in June 2008, our Oak Grove mine continued to experience delays and lower than planned production levels during the second half of 2008. The mine encountered lower than planned coal heights in the current mining panel and harsh geological conditions in the development areas. Additional costs have also been incurred for repairs and maintenance as a result of mechanical problems caused by adverse geological conditions, delays associated with equipment replacements and availability of experienced mining personnel. Oak Grove decreased production in the fourth quarter to enable continuous miners to prepare longwall panels. One of our Green Ridge facilities, located in the Pinnacle Complex, has shut down production in an effort to focus on mining the remaining other Green Ridge location, resulting in lower overall production for the facility. We continue to be challenged with adverse geological conditions across the mines and delays in delivery of new capital equipment, which have contributed to overall equipment performance and availability issues, which increased costs in all operations.

Production in 2008 was impacted by the extension of longwall development timing related to unplanned geological conditions, difficulty in obtaining additional equipment and personnel, and mechanical problems 60 Table of Contents experienced within the second half of 2008 at our Oak Grove Mine. Also impacting production in 2008 were adverse mining conditions at our Pinnacle Complex. In addition, as a result of the economic downturn and its impact on the global steel industry, we initiated operating plans to reduce production and commence workforce adjustments at our Pinnacle Mine in December 2008. Asia Pacific Iron Ore Following is a summary of Asia Pacific Iron Ore results for 2008 and 2007: (In Millions) Change due to 2008 2007 Sales priceand rate Salesvolume Totalchange Revenues from product sales and services $ 769.8 $ 444.6 $ 343.9 $ (18.7 ) $ 325.2 Cost of goods sold and operating expense (421.2 ) (348.8 ) (87.1 ) 14.7 (72.4 ) Sales margin $ 348.6 $ 95.8 $ 256.8 $ (4.0 ) $ 252.8 Sales tons 7.8 8.1 In 2008, the Australian benchmark prices for lump and fines settled at increases of 97 percent and 80 percent, respectively. As a result of the price settlement, sales from our Asia Pacific Iron Ore segment have been recorded at the higher 2008 prices, thereby resulting in record revenues. Cost of goods sold and operating expenses for the year to date increased primarily due to higher costs of production partially offset by lower volume and reduction of stockpiles. Increased costs of production were a result of higher fuel, maintenance and contract labor expenditures arising from inflationary pressures. Fuel and energy costs for the year to date increased approximately $14.1 million compared with 2007. Costs were also negatively impacted in 2008 by increased royalty payments due to higher revenues and approximately $1.6 million related to unfavorable foreign exchange rates. In addition, the current period was impacted by the step acquisition of the remaining ownership interest in Portman. Production Following is a summary of iron ore production tonnage for 2008 and 2007: (In Millions) (1) Total 2008 2007 Mine: Koolyanobbing 7.3 7.7 Cockatoo Island 0.4 0.7 Total 7.7 8.4 (1) Tonnes are metric tons (2,205 pounds). Cockatoo production reflects our 50 percent share. The decrease in production in 2008 compared with 2007 was primarily due to inventory stockpile reductions in an effort to improve working capital. In addition, production at Cockatoo declined as the second stage of the seawall reserves were exhausted. Construction on Phase 3 of the seawall is expected to be completed in May 2009, with sales continuing for approximately two years through June 2011. 61 Table of Contents 2007 Compared to 2006 North American Iron Ore Following is a summary of North American Iron Ore sales margin for 2007 versus 2006: (In Millions) Change due to 2007 2006 Sales priceand rate Salesvolume Freight andreimbursements Totalchange Revenue from product sales and services $ 1,745.4 $ 1,560.7 $ 39.3 $ 122.4 $ 23.0 $ 184.7 Cost of goods sold and operating expenses (1,347.5 ) (1,233.3 ) 0.6 (91.8 ) (23.0 ) (114.2 ) Sales margin $ 397.9 $ 327.4 $ 39.9 $ 30.6 $ $ 70.5 Sales tons 22.3 20.4 The increase in sales revenue was due to a sales volume increase of 1.9 million tons, or $122.4 million, higher sales prices, $39.3 million and higher freight and venture partners reimbursements, $23.0 million. Sales volume in 2007 included 1.5 million tons of pellets purchased and paid for by customers at year end under take or pay provisions of existing long term supply agreements. First half shipments in 2007 included 1.2 million tons of pellets purchased in upper Great Lakes stockpiles and paid for in 2006. Revenue recognition related to the December 2006 stockpile transaction totaling $62.6 million was deferred until the product was delivered in 2007. Sales prices per ton increased 2.8 percent, reflecting the effect of contractual base price increases, higher term supply agreement escalation factors including higher steel pricing, higher Producers Price Indices and lag year adjustments. The increase in cost of goods sold and operating expenses primarily reflected higher volume, $91.8 million. On a per ton basis, cost of goods sold and operating expenses were flat in comparison to last year, as a result of our strategic procurement, maintenance and other business improvement programs, as well as the implementation of Six Sigma and Lean Sigma. This compares with a Producers Price Indices increase of 4.1 percent, which is a measurement of industrial company cost inflation. Principally, as a result this cost containment, North American Iron Ore sales margin per ton increased 11 percent from 2006.

The decrease in Hibbings production was a result of the shutdown in late February 2007 due to severe weather conditions that caused significant buildup of ice in the basin supplying water to the processing facility. Year over year production at Tilden benefited from major maintenance work and operating improvements performed in the prior year, and United Taconite production increased due to its recovery from last years electrical accident. Production at Wabush was higher as a result of pit design improvements to mitigate dewatering issues. 62 Table of Contents We reinitiated construction activity to restart an idled pellet furnace at the Northshore facility that increased capacity by approximately 0.6 million tons of pellets in 2008 and 0.8 million tons to our annual capacity thereafter. North American Coal Following is a summary of North American Coal sales margin since the July 31, 2007 acquisition: (In Millions, except tonnage) Five Months EndedDecember 31, 2007 Revenues from product sales and services $ 85.2 Cost of goods sold and operating expense (116.9 ) Sales margin $ (31.7 ) Sales tons (in thousands) (1) 1,171 (1) Tons are short tons (2,000 pounds). In August 2007, production at our Pinnacle mine in West Virginia slowed as a result of sandstone intrusions encountered within the coal panel being mined at the time. This slowdown prompted the operating decision in late September to move the mines longwall plow system to another panel. In mid October, the plow system was brought back into production. In addition, we had invested in business improvement initiatives and safety activities designed to enhance future production at our Oak Grove mine. These investments reduced our 2007 production. The slowdown and resulting lack of leverage over fixed costs, such as labor and energy, contributed to a loss of sales margin and unusually high per ton costs of goods sold.

Portmans sales prices reflected the effects of the 9.5 percent increase in the international benchmark price of iron ore fines and lump. The 0.7 million tonne volume increase reflected the completion of the two million tonne per annum expansion at Koolyanobbing in late 2006. Increased production capacity has allowed Asia Pacific to supply higher sales volumes at increased price realizations driven by intense demand from the Asian steel industry, particularly in China. As a result of this demand, revenues per tonne increased 12 percent from the prior year. Per tonne costs in Asia Pacific Iron Ore, which increased 16 percent, continue to be negatively impacted by foreign exchange rates, as the U.S. dollar weakened relative to the Australian dollar, as well as higher maintenance and contract labor expenditures. In 2007, our Asia Pacific Iron Ore management team also put in place a new contractor for mine operations that has cost control incentives. Production Following is a summary of Asia Pacific Iron Ore production tonnage for 2007 versus 2006: (In Millions) (1) Total Mine 2007 2006 Koolyanobbing 7.7 7.0 Cockatoo Island 0.7 0.7 Total 8.4 7.7 (1) Metric tons (2,205 pounds). The increase in production primarily reflected the completion of the expansion at Koolyanobbing in late 2006. Production at Cockatoo Island remained steady and continued into 2008. However, in 2008, Cockatoo Island production began to decline, as the second stage of the seawall reserves were exhausted. Construction on a necessary extension of the existing seawall commenced in the third quarter 2008, with production anticipated to restart by the end of the second quarter 2009. This extension is expected to extend production for approximately two additional years, through June 2011. In July 2007, Portman was notified that its exploration and mining rights under two leases would not be extended beyond July 3, 2007. The mining leases permit Portman to explore for and mine iron ore on mining tenements north of Portmans Koolyanobbing operations, including the rights to 4.5 million tonnes of iron ore reserves. Portman has since negotiated an in principle agreement to transfer these rights to the other party in exchange for additional mining rights to new leases. Liquidity, Cash Flows and Capital Resources In 2008, we have taken a balanced approach to allocation of our capital resources and free cash flow. We have made strategic investments both domestically and internationally, increased our capital expenditures, strengthened our balance sheet, and increased our borrowing capacity. Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $853.2 million in 2008, compared with $288.9 million and $428.5 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively. Operating cash flows in 2008 were impacted by improved operating results, higher overall gains on our derivative instruments, and other changes in working capital. Investing Activities Net cash used for investing activities was $795.6 million in 2008, compared with $745.4 million in 2007 and $127.4 million in 2006. Capital expenditures were $182.5 million, $199.5 million and $119.5 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Other significant investing activities in 2008 included the purchases of the remaining minority interests in Portman and United Taconite and our investment in AusQuest. Investing activities in 2007 included the purchase of PinnOak as well as our investments in Sonoma and Amap&aacute;. 64 Table of Contents In addition, non cash investing activities in 2008 include the issuance of $165 million of unregistered common shares and the commitment to provide 1.2 million tons of iron ore pellets as part of the consideration paid to acquire the remaining 30 percent interest in United Taconite. Non cash investing activities during the year also include the issuance of four million of our common shares at a share price of $38.27 to the former owners of PinnOak to accelerate the deferred payment and settle the contingent earn out associated with the initial purchase agreement. Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities in 2008 was $32.4 million, compared with $250.1 million in 2007. In 2006, our net cash used in financing activities was $148.4 million. Consolidated long term debt at December 31, 2008 was $525 million, compared to $440 million at December 31, 2007. Cash flows from financing activities in 2008 primarily included borrowings under our revolving credit facility and senior notes of $865 million, partially offset by debt repayments of $780 million during the year.

Current Economic Environment and Future Outlook The current volatility and uncertainty in global markets, coupled with the slowdown in the worlds major economies, has had a significant impact on commodity prices. The mining industry has seen a reduction in high cost operations, and the credit environment is expected to limit the funding and expansion capabilities of many of 65 Table of Contents the junior mining companies. Based on these economic conditions, we continue to evaluate and assess our capital expenditures, in order to ensure we are positioned to face the challenges, uncertainties, as well as opportunities, associated with the current environment. In addition, recent deterioration in the securities markets has negatively impacted the value of the assets included in our defined benefit pension plans and postretirement welfare plans based upon the value of our plan assets and obligations at December 31, 2008. The decline in fair value of our plan assets, combined with negotiated plan changes, has resulted in increased total estimated pension and OPEB costs for 2009 of $71.5 million as compared to total benefit costs of $28.9 million in 2008. Further, the decline in fair value has resulted in estimated cash contributions for 2009 of $67.4 million in accordance with our current funding strategy, which is $22.8 million higher than our 2008 funding obligation. Refer to NOTE 9 PENSIONS AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We anticipate that total cash used for investments and capital expenditures in 2009 will be approximately $300 million, including approximately $100 million related to the funding of our investment in Amap&aacute;. We are evaluating funding options for our capital needs and expect to be able to fund these requirements through operations.

(2) Interest on the $200 million term debt is calculated using actual rates through April 2009 and is estimated using a 3 year Libor swap rate of 1.75 percent plus a margin of 0.50 from April 2009 through maturity in August 2012. The calculation includes a $100 million Libor interest rate swap fixed at 4.65 percent with an October 2009 maturity date. For the $325 million senior notes, interest is calculated for the $270 million five year senior notes using a fixed rate of 6.31 percent from 2009 to maturity in June 2013, and for the $55 million seven year senior notes, interest is calculated at 6.59 percent from 2009 to maturity in June 2015. 66 Table of Contents (3) Includes minimum electric power demand charges, minimum coal, diesel and natural gas obligations, minimum railroad transportation obligations, minimum port facility obligations and minimum water pipeline access obligations for the Sonoma washplant. (4) Relates to pellet delivery consideration for purchase of the remaining 30 percent interest in United Taconite. (5) Includes accrued interest. (6) Other contractual obligations of approximately $86.8 million primarily include income taxes payable and deferred income tax amounts for which timing of payment is non determinable. Refer to NOTE 16 COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our future purchase commitments and obligations. Capital Resources We expect to fund our business obligations from available cash, current operations and borrowings under our credit facility. The following represents a summary of key liquidity measures at December 31, 2008 and 2007: (In Millions) December 31,2008 December 31,2007 Cash and cash equivalents $ 179.0 $ 157.1 Credit facility $ 800.0 $ 800.0 Senior notes 325.0 Portman facilities 27.6 Senior notes drawn (325.0 ) Term loans drawn (200.0 ) (200.0 ) Revolving loans drawn (240.0 ) Letter of credit obligations and other commitments (40.3 ) (16.2 ) Borrowing capacity available $ 587.3 $ 343.8 Refer to NOTE 5 DEBT AND CREDIT FACILITIES of our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our debt and credit facilities. We expect meaningful cash flow from operations in 2009. Cash flows from operations are expected to fund all of our contractual obligations in 2009, as well as, expected capital expenditures, pension and OPEB contributions and dividends. Apart from cash generated by the business our primary source of funding is cash on hand, which totals $179.0 million as of December 31, 2008. We also have a $600 million revolving credit facility, which comes due in 2012. This facility has available borrowing capacity of $578.5 million as of December 31, 2008. The combination of cash and the credit facility give us over $750 million in liquidity entering 2009. As is the case each year, cash flows will be negatively impacted in the first two quarters of 2009 due to an inability to ship over the Great Lakes in the early part of the year. While this will have a detrimental impact on cash flow and earnings in those quarters, we do not expect it to create any liquidity issues, nor do we expect any adverse impact on our debt covenants. Assuming current projected volumes, our liquidity appears to be sufficient, and we will maintain ample room under our debt covenants for 2009. Several credit markets may provide additional capacity should that become necessary. The bank market may provide funding through a term loan or through exercising the $200 million accordion in our credit facility. In October 2008, we were able to obtain approximately $1.5 billion in commitments from the bank market as part of the funding for the proposed acquisition of Alpha Natural Resources. The risk associated with this market is that decreasing capacity has lead to significant increases in borrowing costs. In 2008, we went to the private placement market to fund $325 million senior notes which are due in 2013 and 2015. Capacity, as in all debt 67 Table of Contents markets, is a global issue in addition to the fact that our notes have been outstanding for less than one year. Capacity in the bond market appears to be rebounding slowly for investment grade companies. Longer term debt arrangements at current corporate bond rates must be aligned with our longer term capital structure needs. Finally, the equity market has begun to see some activity. Shareholder dilution is a significant determining factor in deciding whether to access this market, in addition to considering how this alternative would align with our longer term capital structure. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements An off balance sheet arrangement is any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which a company has: made guarantees, retained or held a contingent interest in transferred assets, undertaken an obligation under certain derivative instruments, or undertaken any obligation arising our of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to the company, or engages in leasing, hedging or research and development arrangements with the company. We have entered into certain agreements under which we have provided guarantees to an unconsolidated entity that are off balance sheet arrangements. In addition, we have operating leases, which are primarily utilized for certain equipment and office space. Aside from this, we do not have any other off balance sheet financing arrangements. Refer to NOTE 16 COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES for additional information regarding our guarantees. Market Risks We are subject to a variety of risks, including those caused by changes in the market value of equity investments, changes in commodity prices, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. We have established policies and procedures to manage such risks; however, certain risks are beyond our control. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk We are subject to changes in foreign currency exchange rates in Australia as a result of our operations at Portman and Sonoma, which could impact our financial condition. Foreign exchange risk arises from our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates because our reporting currency is the United States dollar. Portman hedges a portion of its United States currency denominated sales in accordance with a formal policy. The primary objective for using derivative financial instruments is to reduce the volatility attributable to changes in Australian and United States currency fluctuations. The instruments were subject to formal documentation, intended to achieve qualifying hedge treatment, and were tested at inception and at each reporting period as to effectiveness. Effective July 1, 2008, Portman discontinued hedge accounting for these derivatives, but continues to hold these instruments as economic hedges to manage currency risk. Upon de designation of the cash flow hedges, the instruments are prospectively marked to fair value each reporting period through Changes in fair value of derivative instruments, net on the Statement of Consolidated Operations. At December 31, 2008, Portman had approximately $869.0 million of outstanding exchange rate contracts in the form of call options, collar options, convertible collar options and forward exchange contracts with varying maturity dates ranging from January 2009 to August 2011. A 10 percent increase in the value of the Australian dollar from the month end rate would increase the fair value by approximately $65.4 million, and a 10 percent decrease would reduce the fair value by approximately $79.9 million. We are required to record on our Statements of Consolidated Financial Position the market value of our open derivative positions which do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. The gain or loss resulting from changes in the market value of these derivative instruments is recorded as an unrealized gain or loss each reporting period. These mark to market adjustments are recorded as non operating costs on the Statements of Consolidated Operations. 68 Table of Contents Our share of pellets produced at the Wabush operation in Canada represents approximately five percent of our North American iron ore pellet production. This operation is subject to currency exchange fluctuations between the United States and Canadian currency; however, we do not hedge our exposure to this currency exchange fluctuation. Under the majority ownership of MMX, Amap&aacute;s functional currency was previously determined to be the Brazilian real. The analysis performed to determine the functional currency at the time indicated a mixed outcome assessment of the pertinent determining economic factors as set forth under SFAS No. 52, Foreign Currency Translation (SFAS 52), including, for example, sales being priced in U. S. dollars and operating costs being largely incurred in Brazilian real. The change in control of Amap&aacute; to Anglo in August 2008 resulted in the review of financial, operating and treasury policies of the entity under new management. This, along with recent efforts to mitigate exposures related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates resulted in the reassessment of the accounting principles related to the determination of Amap&aacute;s functional currency during the fourth quarter of 2008. As a result, effective October 1, 2008, we changed the functional currency of Amap&aacute; from the local currency to the U.S. dollar reporting currency primarily due to changes in the debt structure under which the entity is financed as well as changes in the treasury, risk mitigation and financial reporting policies under which the entitys operations are managed, resulting in the U.S. dollar becoming the currency of the primary economic environment in which the business operates. Refer to NOTE 1 BUSINESS SUMMARY AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, of the consolidated financial statements for further information. Interest Rate Risk Interest for borrowings under our credit facility is at a floating rate, dependent in part on the LIBOR rate, which exposes us to the effects of interest rate changes. Based on $100 million in outstanding revolving and term loans at December 31, 2008, with a floating interest rate and no corresponding fixed rate swap, a 100 basis point change to the LIBOR rate would result in a change of $1.0 million to interest expense on an annual basis. In October 2007, we entered into a $100 million fixed rate swap to convert a portion of this floating rate into a fixed rate. With the swap agreement, we pay a fixed three month LIBOR rate for $100 million of our floating rate borrowings. The interest rate swap terminates in October 2009 and qualifies as a cash flow hedge. Pricing Risks The current global economic crisis has resulted in increasing downward pressure from customers, particularly in China, for a roll back of the 2008 price increases for seaborne iron ore and metallurgical coal in 2009. The 2008 record price increase was driven by high demand for iron ore and coking coal, global steel production at historically high levels, combined with production and logistics constraints for both iron ore and coking coal, resulting in tight supply conditions. With the current global economic crisis, none of these conditions exist in early 2009; and the market now is characterized by a collapse in steel demand and limited global demand for iron ore and coking coal. Reduced demand for iron ore and coking coal will likely result in decreased demand for our products and decreasing prices, resulting in lower revenue levels in 2009, and decreasing margins as a result of decreased production, adversely affecting our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Nonperformance and Liquidity Risks The current global economic crisis has adversely affected our business and could impact our financial results. All of our customers have announced curtailments of production, which has adversely affected the demand for our iron ore and coal products. Continuation or worsening of the current economic conditions, a prolonged global, national or regional economic recession or other events that could produce major changes in demand patterns, could have a material adverse effect on our sales, margins and profitability. We are not able to predict the impact the current global economic crisis will have on our operations and the industry in general going forward. 69 Table of Contents In addition, consolidations in some of the industries in which our customers operate have created larger customers, some of which are highly leveraged. These factors have caused some customers to be less profitable and increased our exposure to credit risk. Current credit markets are highly volatile, and some of our customers are highly leveraged. A significant adverse change in the financial and or credit position of a customer could require us to assume greater credit risk relating to that customer and could limit our ability to collect receivables. Failure to receive payment from our customers for products that we have delivered could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Our investment policy relating to short term investments is to preserve principal and liquidity while maximizing the short term return through investment of available funds. The carrying value of these investments approximates fair value on the reporting dates. We commonly use AAA rated money market funds for short term investments. On September 19, 2008, we received notice that one of the money market funds, in which we had $20 million invested, was suspending all cash redemptions and redeeming a combination of cash and in kind securities until December 12, 2008, when all of the funds securities matured. The investment was redeemed in cash for full value on December 12, 2008. All other money market funds we invested in maintained daily cash redemptions throughout 2008. Approximately 2.9 percent of our U.S. pension trust assets and 1.5 percent of VEBA assets are exposed to sub prime risk, all of which are investment grade and fully collateralized by properties. These investments primarily include Mortgage Backed Securities and the Home Equity subset of the Asset Backed Securities sector with AAA and AA credit quality ratings. Due to the continuing liquidity crisis in the U.S., the spreads of these structures have widened and, as a result, their market values have declined. However, the over collateralization of these arrangements is expected to mitigate the potential for principal loss in these tranches. As evidence, there has been no material impairment in these securities as of December 31, 2008. The U.S. pension and VEBA trusts have no allocations to mortgage related collateralized debt obligations. Volatile Energy and Fuel Costs The volatile cost of energy and supplies is an important issue affecting our production costs, primarily in relation to our iron ore operations. Recent trends have shown that although electric power, natural gas, and oil costs are declining, the direction and magnitude of short term changes are difficult to predict. Our consolidated North American iron ore mining ventures consumed approximately 13.5 million MMBtus of natural gas at an average delivered price of $9.18 per MMBtu, and 22.5 million gallons of diesel fuel at an average delivered price of $3.03 per gallon in 2008. Consumption of diesel fuel by our Asia Pacific Operations was approximately 10.6 million gallons for the same period. As of December 31, 2008 we have 3.5 million MMBtus of natural gas, representing approximately 38 percent of our 2009 natural gas requirements, purchased forward at an average price of $8.99 per MMBtu. We also have 6.4 million gallons of diesel fuel, representing approximately 31 percent of our 2009 requirements, purchased forward at $2.58 per gallon for our North American iron ore mining ventures. Such contracts are a means to limit our exposure to potential future market price increases. Our strategy to address increasing energy rates includes improving efficiency in energy usage and utilizing the lowest cost alternative fuels. Our North American Iron Ore mining ventures enter into forward contracts for certain commodities, primarily natural gas and diesel fuel, as a hedge against price volatility. Such contracts are in quantities expected to be delivered and used in the production process. At December 31, 2008, the notional amount of the outstanding forward contracts was $41.5 million, with an unrecognized fair value net loss of $8.4 million based on December 31, 2008 forward rates. The contracts mature at various times through December 2009. If the forward rates were to change 10 percent from the month end rate, the value and potential cash flow effect on the contracts would be approximately $3.3 million. Outlook Given the current macroeconomic environment and the impact on demand for steelmaking raw materials in the intermediate term, our priority in 2009 is to generate and preserve cash in order to maintain our high degree of financial flexibility. While our Companys management team has taken swift action to bring production levels at all of our businesses in line with current demand, a great deal of uncertainty remains in the marketplace. 70 Table of Contents North American Iron Ore Outlook For 2009, we have contractual obligations for approximately 18 million tons of sales volume. These commitments, combined with eventual revenue recognition of 1.2 million tons deferred in 2008, total approximately 19 million tons of sales volume for 2009. This sales volume total assumes we will recognize bill and hold sales, which are anticipated to occur in the fourth quarter of 2009. In addition, based on current market uncertainties and corresponding blast furnace capacity utilization in North America, we must continue to monitor the marketplace as well as the financial health of our customers. With annual price settlements for iron ore in 2009 not yet concluded, we are unable to provide guidance on average revenue per ton in our North American Iron Ore business segment. We previously indicated our average revenue per ton in 2009 will benefit from contractual base price adjustments, lag year adjustments and price caps and floors contained in most of our current supply agreements. Actual realized average revenue per ton will ultimately depend on sales volume levels, World Pellet Prices, production input costs and or steel prices, all of which are factors in our formula based pricing for the North American Iron Ore business segment. At the current annualized production rate for our North American Iron Ore business segment, 2009 cost per ton is expected to be between $70 and $80. The expected increase from 2008 cost per ton is the result of reduced leverage over fixed costs resulting from lower year over year production levels. North American Coal Outlook We begin 2009 with approximately 1.6 million tons of coal under contractual obligation, or approximately 45 percent of our current annualized production rate. This coal is priced at an average of $108 per ton, which includes production earmarks to fulfill obligations for tons deferred as a result of past production disruptions. With negotiations for international met coal contracts not yet concluded, we are unable to provide guidance for uncommitted 2009 production related to our North American Coal business segment. Currently there is no precise indication where prices will settle for the high quality, low volatility coal that we produce. In 2009, we will continue to execute our extended long term mine planning and development activities at our North American Coal mines designed to ultimately increase annual production and improve cost per ton. As a result, cost per ton for the year is expected to be approximately between $110 and $120. Asia Pacific Iron Ore Outlook Asia Pacific Iron Ore 2009 sales volume is expected to be 8.4 million tonnes, with production of 8.6 million tonnes. With annual price settlements for iron ore in 2009 not yet concluded, we are unable to provide guidance on average revenue per tonne for our Asia Pacific Iron Ore business segment. We expect Asia Pacific Iron Ore cost per tonne of approximately $50 to $60. Sonoma Coal Project Outlook We have a 45 percent economic interest in the Sonoma coal project and expect total production of approximately 3.5 million tonnes for 2009. Sonoma is expected to have sales volume of 3.3 million tonnes with an approximate 60/40 mix between thermal and metallurgical coal, respectively. Per tonne costs at Sonoma are expected to be between $85 and $95. The increase from 2008 cost per ton levels is the result of an anticipated special royalty payment under an agreement with our partner, QCoal, that occurs when the mine exceeds a certain performance threshold. Amap&aacute; Iron Ore Project Update In the third quarter of 2008, our new partner in the Amap&aacute; project, Anglo, closed its acquisition of MMXs 70 percent share of the project and assumed management control over the venture. Throughout the year, the ramp up of operations was significantly slower than previously anticipated, with annual production totaling 1.2 million tonnes. We, along with Anglo, continue to study all aspects of the project and are taking proactive steps to ensure production is ramped up to the design annual capacity of 6.5 tonnes. We expect to incur an equity loss related to the project of approximately $50 million to $60 million in 2009. 71 Table of Contents Selling, General and Administrative Expenses and Other Expectations As a result of limited headcount rationalization, including the elimination and combination of some executive and management positions, combined with tight cost controls, selling, general and administrative expenses are anticipated to be approximately flat to slightly down in 2009 from 2008 levels. We anticipate an effective tax rate of approximately 26 percent to 28 percent for the year. We also expect 2009 capital expenditures of approximately $200 million and depreciation and amortization of approximately $215 million. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Refer to NOTE 1 BUSINESS SUMMARY AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES of the consolidated financial statements for a description of recent accounting pronouncements, including the respective dates of adoption and effects on results of operations and financial condition. Critical Accounting Estimates Managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. Preparation of financial statements requires management to make assumptions, estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses, and the related disclosures of contingencies. Management bases its estimates on various assumptions and historical experience, which are believed to be reasonable; however, due to the inherent nature of estimates, actual results may differ significantly due to changed conditions or assumptions. On a regular basis, management reviews the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are fairly presented in accordance with GAAP. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material. Management believes that the following critical accounting estimates and judgments have a significant impact on our financial statements. Revenue Recognition North American Iron Ore Revenue is recognized on the sale of products when title to the product has transferred to the customer in accordance with the specified provisions of each term supply agreement and all applicable criteria for revenue recognition have been satisfied. Most of our North American Iron Ore term supply agreements provide that title and risk of loss transfer to the customer when payment is received. This is a practice utilized to reduce our financial risk to customer insolvency. Under some term supply agreements, we ship the product to ports on the lower Great Lakes or to the customers facilities prior to the transfer of title. Our rationale for shipping iron ore products to some customers and retaining title until payment is received for these products is to minimize credit risk exposure. We recorded revenue of $25.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 related to sales to customers under minimum purchase requirements of supply agreements, who had paid for the iron ore but requested that we not ship the product until the spring of 2009, when the Great Lakes waterways re open for shipping. This compares to $87 million of revenue recorded under similar arrangements in the fourth quarter of 2007. These bill and hold sales were made pursuant to long term contracts that include annual take or pay arrangements. Critical estimates and other factors related to the recognition of revenue on these stockpile sales include the freezing weather conditions on the Great Lakes and the existence of a fixed delivery schedule that is reflective of the customers historical stockpile shipment requests. In 2008, certain customers purchased and paid for 1.2 million tons of pellets in upper lakes stockpiles in order to meet minimum contractual purchase requirements. At the request of the customers, the ore was not shipped. We considered whether revenue should be recognized on these sales under the bill and hold guidance provided in SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104 Topic 13; however, since fixed shipment schedules were not established prior to year end, revenue recognition on these transactions, totaling $82.9 million, was deferred and will be recognized upon shipment in 2009. 72 Table of Contents Most of our North American Iron Ore long term supply agreements are comprised of a base price with annual price adjustment factors. These price adjustment factors vary based on the agreement but typically include adjustments based upon changes in international pellet prices, changes in specified Producers Price Indices including those for all commodities, industrial commodities, energy and steel. The adjustments generally operate in the same manner, with each factor typically comprising a portion of the price adjustment, although the weighting of each factor varies based upon the specific terms of each agreement. One of our term supply agreements contains price collars, which typically limit the percentage increase or decrease in prices for our iron ore pellets during any given year. In most cases, these adjustment factors have not been finalized at the time our product is sold; we routinely estimate these adjustment factors. The price adjustment factors have been evaluated to determine if they contain embedded derivatives. We evaluated the embedded derivatives in the supply agreements in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended by SFAS 138, Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133. The price adjustment factors share the same economic characteristics and risks as the host contract and are integral to the host contract as inflation adjustments; accordingly they have not been separately valued as derivative instruments. In addition, certain supply agreements with one customer include provisions for supplemental revenue or refunds based on the customers annual steel pricing for the year the product is consumed in the customers blast furnaces. We account for this provision as a derivative instrument at the time of sale and record this provision at fair value until the year the product is consumed and the amounts are settled as an adjustment to revenue. As part of the agreement to acquire the remaining 30 percent interest in United Taconite, effective July 1, 2008, we committed approximately 1.2 million tons of iron ore pellets, which are to be provided through September 2009. This commitment represents an obligation to deliver the pellets as additional consideration for the remaining interest in United Taconite. The pellets were initially valued at $181.3 million, based upon the 2008 Eastern Canadian pellet price at the time of acquisition, and the additional consideration is recorded as current Derivative liabilities on the Statement of Consolidated Financial Position until the pellets are delivered. The purchase agreement contains a penalty provision in the event the 1.2 million tons of pellets are not delivered by a specified date. The penalty provision, which is not a fixed amount or a fixed amount per unit, causes net settlement in this arrangement, and therefore causes the obligation to be accounted for as a derivative instrument, which is based on the future Eastern Canadian pellet price. The instrument is marked to fair value each reporting period until the pellets are delivered and the amounts are settled. In 2008, we recognized $24.2 million as Product revenues on the Statements of Consolidated Operations upon shipment of 0.16 million tons of iron ore pellets. The derivative liability associated with the undelivered pellets was reduced by a mark to market adjustment of $50.6 million through Product revenues, resulting in $106.5 remaining in current Derivative liabilities at December 31, 2008. Revenue from product sales includes cost reimbursements from venture partners for their share of mine costs. The mining ventures function as captive cost companies; they supply product only to their owners effectively on a cost basis. Accordingly, the minority interests revenue amounts are stated at cost of production and are offset in entirety by an equal amount included in cost of goods sold resulting in no profits or losses reflected in minority interest participants. As we are responsible for product fulfillment, we have the risks and rewards of a principal in the transaction, and accordingly, we record revenue in this arrangement on a gross basis in accordance with EITF, 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal Versus Net as an Agent, under the line item Freight and other reimbursements. Revenue from product sales also includes reimbursement for freight charges paid on behalf of customers in Freight and Venture Partners Cost Reimbursements separate from product revenue, in accordance with EITF 00 10, Accounting for Shipping and Handling Fees and Costs. Where we are joint venture participants in the ownership of a North American iron ore mine, our contracts entitle us to receive royalties and management fees, which we earn as the pellets are produced. 73 Table of Contents North American Coal We recognize revenue when title passes to the customer. For domestic coal sales, this generally occurs when coal is loaded into rail cars at the mine. For export coal sales, this generally occurs when coal is loaded into the vessels at the terminal. Asia Pacific Iron Ore Sales revenue is recognized at the free on board, or F.O.B., point, which is generally when the product is loaded into the vessel. Foreign currency revenues are converted to Australian dollars at the currency exchange rate in effect at the time of the transaction. Our Asia Pacific operations receive funds in United States currency for their iron ore and coal sales. We use forward exchange contracts, call options, collar options and convertible collar options to hedge our foreign currency exposure for a portion of our sales receipts. United States currency is converted to Australian dollars at the currency exchange rate in effect at the time of the transaction. The primary objective for the use of these instruments is to reduce exposure to changes in Australian and United States currency exchange rates and to protect against undue adverse movement in these exchange rates. Effective July 1, 2008, we discontinued hedge accounting for these derivatives, but continue to hold these instruments as economic hedges to manage currency risk. At December 31, 2008, we had approximately $869.0 million of outstanding exchange rate contracts in the form of call options, collar options, convertible collar options and forward exchange contracts with varying maturity dates ranging from January 2009 to August 2011. Upon de designation of these cash flow hedges, the instruments are prospectively marked to fair value each reporting period through Changes in fair value of derivative instruments, net on the Statements of Consolidated Operations. In 2008 the mark to market adjustments resulted in a net unrealized loss of $188.2 million, based on a spot rate of 0.69 at December 31, 2008. The amounts that were previously recorded as a component of Other comprehensive income are reclassified to earnings and a corresponding realized gain or loss is recognized upon settlement of the related contracts. Since the July 1, 2008 date of de designation, we reclassified a $25.0 million gain out of Accumulated other comprehensive loss related to contracts that settled during the period, which was recorded as Product revenues on the Statements of Consolidated Operations for the year ended December 31, 2008. In 2008, 2007 and 2006, ineffectiveness resulting in an $8.6 million loss, a $17.0 million loss, and a $2.7 million gain, respectively, was recorded in Miscellaneous net on the Statements of Consolidated Operations. As of December 31, 2008, approximately $19.0 million of gains remains in Accumulated other comprehensive loss related to the effective cash flow hedge contracts prior to de designation. Of this amount, we estimate $14.9 million will be reclassified to Product revenues in the next 12 months upon settlement of the related contracts. Certain supply agreements primarily with our Asia Pacific customers provide for revenue or refunds based on the ultimate settlement of annual international benchmark pricing provisions. The pricing provisions are characterized as freestanding derivatives and are required to be accounted for separately once iron ore is shipped. The derivative instrument, which is settled and billed once the annual international benchmark price is settled, is marked to fair value as a revenue adjustment each reporting period based upon the estimated forward settlement until the benchmark is actually settled. In the fourth quarter of 2008, we negotiated additional sales with certain of our Asia Pacific Iron Ore customers who had previously fulfilled their 2008 purchase commitments under current year contracts and required additional tonnage. In response to the economic downturn and its impact on the global steel industry, we agreed that the provisional pricing for these shipments would be at a discount to 2008 benchmark prices to reflect the decline in steel demand and prices, with final pricing being based upon 2009 benchmark prices once they are settled. The discount pricing provisions are characterized as freestanding derivatives and are required to be accounted for separately once the iron ore is shipped. The derivative instrument, which is settled and billed once the 2009 international benchmark price is settled, is marked to fair value as a revenue adjustment each reporting period based upon the estimated forward settlement until the benchmark is actually settled. We recognized approximately $34.3 million as Product revenues on the Statement of Consolidated Operations for the year ended December 31, 2008, related to the shipment of approximately 0.4 million tonnes under these pricing provisions. 74 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2008, the 2009 international benchmark prices have not yet settled. Therefore, the derivative instrument was marked to fair value at December 31, 2008 resulting in a $7.7 million reduction in Product revenues on the Statement of Consolidated Operations in 2008. Refer to NOTE 1 BUSINESS SUMMARY AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, for further information regarding our revenue recognition policy. Litigation Accruals We are subject to proceedings, lawsuits and other claims. We are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as the potential ranges of probable losses. A determination of the amount of accrual required, if any, for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each matter. The required accrual may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach, such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters. We do not believe that any such matter will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Income Taxes Contingencies Domestic and foreign tax authorities periodically audit our income tax returns. These audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. At any time, multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various tax authorities. In evaluating the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions, we record reserves for exposures where a position taken has not met a more likely than not threshold. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter, for which we have established a reserve, is audited and fully resolved. When facts change or the actual results of a settlement with tax authorities differs from our established reserve for a matter, we adjust our tax contingencies reserve and income tax provision in the period in which the facts changed or the income tax matter is resolved. Prior to 2007, we recorded estimated tax liabilities to the extent they were probable and could be reasonably estimated. On January 1, 2007, we adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48). The effects of applying this Interpretation resulted in a decrease of $7.7 million to retained earnings as of January 1, 2007. FIN 48 prescribes a more likely than not threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken (or expected to be taken in a tax return). This Interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, accounting for income taxes in interim periods and income tax disclosures. Valuation Allowance At December 31, 2008, we had a valuation allowance of $17.6 million against our deferred tax assets. In determining the valuation allowance, we assess both negative and positive evidence when measuring the need for a valuation allowance. Evidence, such as operating results during the most recent three year period, is given more weight than our expectations of future profitability, which are inherently uncertain. Our losses in certain foreign locations in recent periods represented sufficient negative evidence to require a full valuation allowance against certain of our foreign deferred tax assets. We intend to maintain a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets until sufficient positive evidence exists to support the realization of such assets. Mineral Reserves We regularly evaluate our economic mineral reserves and update them as required in accordance with SEC Industry Guide 7. The estimated mineral reserves could be affected by future industry conditions, geological conditions and ongoing mine planning. Maintenance of effective production capacity or the mineral reserve could require increases in capital and development expenditures. Generally as mining operations progress, haul lengths and lifts increase. Alternatively, changes in economic conditions, or the expected quality of ore reserves could decrease capacity or ore reserves. Technological progress could alleviate such factors, or increase capacity or ore reserves. 75 Table of Contents We use our mineral reserve estimates combined with our estimated annual production levels, to determine the mine closure dates utilized in recording the fair value liability for asset retirement obligations. Refer to NOTE 7 ENVIRONMENTAL AND MINE CLOSURE OBLIGATIONS, for further information. Since the liability represents the present value of the expected future obligation, a significant change in mineral reserves or mine lives would have a substantial effect on the recorded obligation. We also utilize economic mineral reserves for evaluating potential impairments of mine assets and in determining maximum useful lives utilized to calculate depreciation and amortization of long lived mine assets. Decreases in mineral reserves or mine lives could significantly affect these items. Asset Retirement Obligations The accrued mine closure obligations for our active mining operations provide for contractual and legal obligations associated with the eventual closure of the mining operations. Our obligations are determined based on detailed estimates adjusted for factors that a market participant would consider (i.e., inflation, overhead and profit), which are escalated at an assumed rate of inflation to the estimated closure dates, and then discounted using the current credit adjusted risk free interest rate. The estimate also incorporates incremental increases in the closure cost estimates and changes in estimates of mine lives. The closure date for each location is determined based on the exhaustion date of the remaining iron ore reserves. The estimated obligations are particularly sensitive to the impact of changes in mine lives given the difference between the inflation and discount rates. Changes in the base estimates of legal and contractual closure costs due to changes in legal or contractual requirements, available technology, inflation, overhead or profit rates would also have a significant impact on the recorded obligations. Refer to NOTE 7 ENVIRONMENTAL AND MINE CLOSURE OBLIGATIONS, for further information. Asset Impairment In assessing the recoverability of our long lived assets, significant assumptions regarding the estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets must be made, as well as the related estimated useful lives. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future as a result of changes in strategy or market conditions, we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets in the period such determination was made. We monitor conditions that indicate that the carrying value of an asset or asset group may be impaired. We determine impairment based on the assets ability to generate cash flow greater than its carrying value, utilizing an undiscounted probability weighted analysis. If the analysis indicates the asset is impaired, the carrying value is adjusted to fair value. Fair value can be determined using a market approach, income approach or cost approach. The impairment analysis and fair value determination can result in substantially different outcomes based on critical assumptions and estimates including the quantity and quality of remaining economic ore reserves, future iron ore prices and production costs. Refer to NOTE 1 BUSINESS SUMMARY AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, for further information regarding our policy on asset impairment. Environmental Remediation Costs We have a formal policy for environmental protection and restoration. Our obligations for known environmental problems at active and closed mining operations and other sites have been recognized based on estimates of the cost of investigation and remediation at each site. If the estimate can only be estimated as a range of possible amounts, with no specific amount being more likely, the minimum of the range is accrued. Management reviews its environmental remediation sites quarterly to determine if additional cost adjustments or disclosures are required. The characteristics of environmental remediation obligations, where information concerning the nature and extent of clean up activities is not immediately available, and which are subject to changes in regulatory requirements, result in a significant risk of increase to the obligations as they mature. Expected future expenditures are not discounted to present value unless the amount and timing of the cash disbursements can be reasonably estimated. Potential insurance recoveries are not recognized until realized. 76 Table of Contents Employee Retirement Benefit Obligations We, along with our North American Iron Ore mining ventures, sponsor defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all North American employees. These plans are largely noncontributory, and benefits are generally based on employees years of service and average earnings for a defined period prior to retirement. We do not provide OPEB for most U.S. salaried employees hired after January 1, 1993. Pursuant to a 2003 asset purchase agreement with the previous owner, PinnOak assumed postretirement benefits for certain employees who will vest more than five years after the asset purchase date of June 30, 2003. Postretirement benefits for vested employees and those that will vest within the five year period subsequent to the acquisition date remain obligations of the previous owner. PinnOak records a provision for estimated postretirement benefits for employees not covered by the asset purchase agreement with the former owner based upon annual valuations. Portman does not have employee retirement benefit obligations. On September 12, 2006, our Board of Directors approved modifications to the pension benefits provided to salaried participants. The modifications retroactively reinstated the final average pay benefit formula (previously terminated and replaced with a cash balance formula in July 2003) to allow for additional accruals through June 30, 2008 or the continuation of benefits under an improved cash balance formula, whichever is greater. The change increased the projected benefit obligation, or PBO, by $15.1 million and pension expense by $1.1 million in 2006. On October 6, 2008, the USW ratified a new four year labor contract, which replaces the labor agreement that expired on September 1, 2008. The new agreement covers approximately 2,300 USW represented workers at our Empire and Tilden mines in Michigan, and our United Taconite and Hibbing mines in Minnesota. The changes enhanced the minimum pension formula by increasing the benefit dollar multipliers and renewed the lump sum special payments for certain employees retiring in the near future. The changes also included renewal of payments to surviving spouses of certain retirees. The result of the changes is an increase of $5.6 million in PBO and $1.8 million in 2008 pension expense. Following is a summary of our defined benefit pension and OPEB funding and expense for the years 2006 through 2009: (In Millions) Pension OPEB Funding Expense Funding Expense 2006 40.7 23.0 30.4 9.8 2007 32.5 17.4 23.0 4.5 2008 24.9 20.3 19.7 8.6 2009 (Estimated) 32.1 48.3 35.3 23.2 Assumptions used in determining the benefit obligations and the value of plan assets for defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefit plans (primarily retiree healthcare benefits) offered by the Company are evaluated periodically by management. Critical assumptions, such as the discount rate used to measure the benefit obligations, the expected long term rate of return on plan assets, the medical care cost trend, and the rate of compensation increase are reviewed annually. Our 2008 discount rate of 6.00 percent remained consistent with 2007. We assumed a compensation increase of 4.0 percent in 2008 to determine both our pension and OPEB obligations. This compares with a rate of compensation increase of 4.13 percent for pension and 4.50 percent for OPEB in 2007. Additionally, on December 31, 2008, we adopted the IRS 2009 prescribed mortality tables (separate pre retirement and postretirement) to determine the expected life of our plan participants, replacing the IRS static 2023/2015 tables. Following are sensitivities on estimated 2009 pension and OPEB expense of potential further changes in these key assumptions: Increase in 2009 Expense(In Millions) Pension OPEB Decrease discount rate .25 percent $ 1.3 $ 0.8 Decrease return on assets 1 percent 4.4 1.1 Increase medical trend rate 1 percent N/A 5.6 77 Table of Contents Changes in actuarial assumptions, including discount rates, employee retirement rates, mortality, compensation levels, plan asset investment performance, and healthcare costs, are determined by the Company based on analyses of actual and expected factors. Changes in actuarial assumptions and or investment performance of plan assets can have a significant impact on our financial condition due to the magnitude of our retirement obligations.

Accounting for Business Combinations In June 2008, we acquired an additional 4.8 percent interest in Portman through a share repurchase program offered by Portman, in which we did not participate. We subsequently made an off market offer to purchase the outstanding shares and proceeded with a compulsory acquisition of the remaining shares to obtain full ownership of Portman in the fourth quarter of 2008. In addition, effective July 1, 2008, we acquired the remaining 30 percent interest in United Taconite. Upon consummation of the purchase, our ownership interest increased from 70 percent to 100 percent. Each of these transactions constituted a step acquisition of a non controlling interest. In accordance with SFAS 141, Business Combinations, we accounted for the acquisition of the minority interests by the purchase method. As a result of each step acquisition, the then historical cost basis of the minority interest balance was reduced to the extent of the percentage interest sold, and the increased ownership obtained was accounted for by increasing the entitys basis from historical cost to fair value for the portion of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the additional ownership acquired. We are in the process of conducting a valuation of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed related to each of the acquisitions, most notably, property, plant and equipment, mineral reserves, inventory and sales contracts, and the final allocation will be made when completed. Accordingly, allocation of the purchase price is preliminary and subject to modification in the future. In estimating the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, we consider information obtained during our due diligence process and utilize various valuation methods, including a market approach, income approach or cost approach. Depending on the approach used, the valuation is performed based upon market prices, where available, the present value of estimated future cash flows, or comparisons to transactions for similar assets and liabilities. We are required to make subjective estimates in connection with these valuations and allocations.
