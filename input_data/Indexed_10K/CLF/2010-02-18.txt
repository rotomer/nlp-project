Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Overview Cliffs Natural Resources Inc. traces its corporate history back to 1847. Today, we are an international mining and natural resources company. We are the largest producer of iron ore pellets in North America, a major supplier of direct shipping lump and fines iron ore out of Australia, and a significant producer of metallurgical coal. Our companys operations are organized according to product category and geographic location: North American Iron Ore, North American Coal, Asia Pacific Iron Ore, Asia Pacific Coal and Latin American Iron Ore. In North America, we operate six iron ore mines in Michigan, Minnesota and Eastern Canada, and two coking coal mine complexes located in West Virginia and Alabama. Our Asia Pacific operations are comprised of two iron ore mining complexes in Western Australia, serving the Asian iron ore markets with direct shipping fines and lump ore, and a 45 percent economic interest in Sonoma, a coking and thermal coal mine located in Queensland, Australia. In Latin America, we have a 30 percent interest in Amap&aacute;, a Brazilian iron ore project. Over recent years, we have been executing a strategy designed to achieve scale in the mining industry and focused on serving the worlds largest and fastest growing steel markets. However, the current volatility and uncertainty in global markets, which persisted throughout 2009, coupled with the slowdown in the worlds major economies, has had a significant impact on commodity prices and demand. While showing signs of improvement during the second half of 2009, global crude steel production, a significant driver of our business, was down approximately 8 percent from 2008, with even greater production declines in some areas, including North America. Consolidated revenues for 2009 decreased to $2.3 billion, with net income per diluted share of $1.63. This compares with revenues of $3.6 billion and net income per diluted share of $4.76 in 2008. In response to the economic downturn and its impact on the steel industry, we initiated and extended production curtailments at our North American mines during 2009 necessary to align output with lower demand and optimize inventory. In Asia Pacific, the demand for steelmaking raw materials remained strong throughout the year primarily led by demand from China. Despite the absence of benchmark price settlements in China, we negotiated final pricing arrangements consistent with agreed upon price declines reached between Asia Pacific steelmakers outside of China and producers in Australia. Results for 2009 were favorably impacted by the rise in the Australian dollar to an exchange rate of A$0.90 at December 31, 2009, resulting in $85.7 million of unrealized gains on foreign currency exchange contracts during the year. Throughout 2009, we took proactive measures in response to the high degrees of uncertainty within our industry and the macroeconomic environment as well as to better position ourselves to take advantage of possible opportunities when the market improved. In 2009, we also continued to focus on cash conservation and generation from our business operations as well as reduction of discretionary capital expenditures, in order to ensure we were positioned to face the challenges and uncertainties associated with the current environment. These actions have allowed us to weather the financial crisis and continue to pursue our strategic plan. Segments We organize our business according to product category and geographic location: North American Iron Ore, North American Coal, Asia Pacific Iron Ore, Asia Pacific Coal and Latin American Iron Ore. The Asia Pacific Coal and Latin American Iron Ore operating segments do not meet the criteria for reportable segments. All North American business segments are headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio. Our Asia Pacific headquarters is located in Perth, Australia, and our Latin American headquarters is located in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. See NOTE 2 SEGMENT REPORTING for further information. Growth Strategy and Strategic Transactions While maintaining a disciplined approach to our operating activities given the current economic environment, we continue to identify opportunities to grow and at the same time position ourselves to address any uncertainties that lie ahead. We expect to continue increasing our operating scale and presence as an 46 Table of Contents international mining and natural resources company by expanding both geographically and through the minerals we mine and market. Our growth in North America combined with our investments in Australia and Latin America, as well as acquisitions in minerals outside of iron ore, such as metallurgical coal and chromite, illustrates the execution of this strategy. We also expect to achieve growth through early involvement in exploration and development activities by partnering with junior mining companies, which provide us low cost entry points for potentially significant reserve additions. In 2009, we established a global exploration group, led by professional geologists who have the knowledge and experience to identify new world class projects for future development or projects that add significant value to existing operations. We continued our strategic growth and transformation to an international mining and natural resources company through the following transactions: Acquisition of Freewest Acquisition of remaining interest in Wabush Acquisition of additional interest in renewaFUEL Establishment of a global exploration group Refer to Recent Developments within Item 1 Business, for additional information regarding each of these strategic transactions. Results of Operations Consolidated 2009 Compared to 2008 The following is a summary of our consolidated results of operations for 2009 compared with 2008: (In Millions) 2009 2008 VarianceFavorable/(Unfavorable) Revenues from product sales and services $ 2,342.0 $ 3,609.1 $ (1,267.1 ) Cost of goods sold and operating expenses (2,033.1 ) (2,449.4 ) 416.3 Sales Margin $ 308.9 $ 1,159.7 $ (850.8 ) Sales Margin % 13.2 % 32.1 % 18.9 % Revenue from Product Sales and Services Sales revenue in 2009 declined $1.3 billion, or 35 percent from 2008. The decrease in sales revenue was primarily due to lower sales volumes related to our North American business operations as a result of the volatility and uncertainty in global markets throughout much of 2009, which led to production slowdowns in the North American steel industry, and in turn reduced demand for iron ore and metallurgical coal. In addition, the global economic crisis resulted in a great deal of pressure from customers, particularly in China, for a roll back of the 2008 price increases for seaborne iron ore and metallurgical coal in 2009. We experienced a reduction in current year pricing at each of our business units, thereby contributing to lower revenue levels in 2009. As a result of the deteriorating market conditions that continued throughout much of 2009, revenues related to our North American Iron Ore and Coal segments decreased approximately $921.8 million and $139.1 million, respectively, compared with 2008. Based upon the economic downturn and the resulting impact on demand, sales volumes in 2009 declined approximately 28 percent at North American Iron Ore. North American Coal experienced a decrease in volume of 42 percent year over year. Revenues in 2009 were also negatively impacted by base rate adjustments related to reductions in World Pellet Pricing and producer price indices referenced in certain of our North American Iron Ore contracts as well as the estimated decline in average annual hot band steel pricing for one of our North American Iron Ore customers. 47 Table of Contents Revenues from our Asia Pacific operations were negatively impacted by the decline in 2009 iron ore prices caused by lower demand for steel worldwide. As a result, revenues at Asia Pacific Iron Ore in 2009 declined 30 percent from the prior year. Pricing decreases in the current year contrast with settled price increases in 2008 of 97 percent and 80 percent for lump and fines, respectively. The overall decline in current year revenue at Asia Pacific Iron Ore was partially offset by positive sales mix and a 9 percent increase in sales volume as a result of increased demand from China. Refer to Results of Operations Segment Information for additional information regarding the impact of specific factors that impacted revenue during the period. Cost of Goods Sold Cost of goods sold was $2.0 billion in 2009, a decrease of $416.3 million, or 17 percent compared with 2008. The decrease is primarily attributable to lower costs at our North American business operations as a result of declines in sales volume and cost reductions during the year related to ongoing cash conservation efforts that have been reinforced in light of the economic environment. Costs were also favorably impacted in 2009 by approximately $35.2 million related to favorable foreign exchange rates compared with the prior year. In addition, year to date fuel and energy costs in our North American and Asia Pacific iron ore operations decreased approximately $71.6 million from 2008. The overall decrease in cost of goods in 2009 was partially offset by idle expense of approximately $159.6 million related to production curtailments in North America throughout the year. In addition, costs in 2009 reflect the impact of the Asia Pacific Iron Ore and United Taconite step acquisitions, which occurred in the second half of 2008. Refer to Results of Operations Segment Information for additional information regarding the impact of specific factors that impacted our operating results during the period. Other Operating Income (Expense) Following is a summary of other operating income (expense) for 2009 and 2008: (In Millions) 2009 2008 VarianceFavorable/(Unfavorable) Royalties and management fee revenue $ 4.8 $ 21.7 $ (16.9 ) Selling, general and administrative expenses (120.7 ) (188.6 ) 67.9 Terminated acquisition costs (90.1 ) 90.1 Gain on sale of other assets net 13.2 22.8 (9.6 ) Casualty recoveries 10.5 (10.5 ) Miscellaneous net 24.0 2.9 21.1 $ (78.7 ) $ (220.8 ) $ 142.1 The decrease in royalties and management fee revenue of $16.9 million in 2009 compared with 2008 is primarily attributable to lower production at our iron ore mines and reduced sales prices. Additionally, we received all of Tildens production in 2009. Therefore, the remaining venture partner at Tilden was not required to pay us the resulting royalty for their share of tons mined and produced from the ore reserves owned by Cliffs. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expense of $67.9 million in 2009 compared with 2008 is primarily the result of an increased focus on cost reduction efforts due to the current economic conditions. In particular, outside professional service and legal fees associated with the expansion of our business declined approximately $38.4 million during the year. Additionally, employment costs were reduced by $26.2 million primarily as a result of lower share based and incentive compensation. Expenses at our Asia Pacific Iron Ore segment were $6.2 million higher in 2009 when compared with 2008, reflecting an increased focus on marketing activities due to the weakening economic climate, as well as higher employment costs and outside professional 48 Table of Contents services to support business development and improvement efforts. In addition, selling, general and administrative expense in the prior year was impacted by a charge in the first quarter of 2008 of approximately $6.8 million in connection with a legal judgment. On November 17, 2008, we announced the termination of the definitive merger agreement with Alpha Natural Resources, Inc., under which we would have acquired all outstanding shares of Alpha. Both our board of directors and Alphas board of directors made the decision after considering various issues, including the current macroeconomic environment, uncertainty in the steel industry, shareholder dynamics, and the risks and costs of potential litigation. Considering these issues, each board determined that termination of the merger agreement was in the best interest of its equity holders. Under the terms of the settlement agreement, we were required to pay Alpha a $70 million termination fee, which was financed through our revolving credit facility and paid in November 2008. As a result, $90.1 million in termination fees and associated acquisition costs were expensed in the fourth quarter of 2008 upon termination of the definitive merger agreement. In October 2009, Asia Pacific Iron Ore completed the sale of its 50 percent interest in the Irvine Island iron ore project to its joint venture partner, Pluton Resources Limited (Pluton Resources). The consideration received consisted of a cash payment of approximately $5 million and the issuance of 19.4 million shares in Pluton Resources, all of which resulted in recognition of a gain on sale amounting to $12.1 million. Our interest in Pluton Resources is approximately 12.5 percent at December 31, 2009. The prior year gain on sale of assets of $22.8 million primarily related to the sale of Cliffs Synfuel Corp. (Synfuel), which was completed in June 2008. Casualty recoveries in 2008 were primarily attributable to a $9.2 million insurance recovery related to a 2006 electrical explosion at our United Taconite facility. Miscellaneous net of $24.0 million in 2009 is primarily attributable to exchange rate gains on foreign currency transactions related to loans denominated in Australian dollars, as a result of the increase in exchange rates during the period from A$0.69 at December 31, 2008 to A$0.90 at December 31, 2009. Other income (expense) Following is a summary of other income (expense) for 2009 and 2008: (In Millions) 2009 2008 VarianceFavorable/(Unfavorable) Changes in fair value of foreign currency contracts, net $ 85.7 $ (188.2 ) $ 273.9 Interest income 10.8 26.2 (15.4 ) Interest expense (39.0 ) (39.8 ) 0.8 Impairment of securities (25.1 ) 25.1 Other non operating income 2.9 4.3 (1.4 ) $ 60.4 $ (222.6 ) $ 283.0 49 Table of Contents The impact of changes in the fair value of our foreign currency contracts on the Statement of Consolidated Operations is due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates during the year. The favorable unrealized mark to market fluctuation of $85.7 million in 2009 relates to the Australian to U.S. dollar spot rate of A$0.90 as of December 31, 2009, which increased considerably from the Australian to U.S. dollar spot rate of A$0.69 as of December 31, 2008. The changes in the spot rates are correlated to the appreciation of the Australian dollar relative to the United States dollar during the year. During 2009, approximately $780 million of outstanding contracts matured or were sold, resulting in a cumulative net realized loss of $37.0 million since inception of the contracts. The following table represents our foreign currency derivative contract position as of December 31, 2009: ($ in Millions) Contract Maturity Notional Amount Weighted AverageExchange Rate Spot Rate Fair Value Contract Portfolio (excluding AUD Call Options) (1) : Contracts expiring in the next 12 months $ 33.0 0.82 0.90 $ 0.9 Total $ 33.0 0.82 0.90 $ 0.9 AUD Call Options (2) Contracts expiring in the next 12 months $ 75.5 0.88 0.90 $ 3.3 Total $ 75.5 0.88 0.90 $ 3.3 Total Hedge Contract Portfolio $ 108.5 $ 4.2 (1) Includes collar options and convertible collar options. (2) AUD call options are excluded from the weighted average exchange rate used for the remainder of the contract portfolio due to the unlimited downside participation associated with these instruments. The decrease in interest income in 2009 compared with 2008 is attributable to a decline in interest bearing cash and investments held during the current year coupled with lower overall average returns. Investment returns in 2009 are lower as a result of market declines. The slight decrease in interest expense in 2009 is primarily due to lower average interest rates on total debt outstanding of 4.48 percent at December 31, 2009, compared with 5.85 percent at December 31, 2008, partially offset by an increase in the period outstanding related to borrowings under our senior notes. Higher interest expense in 2008 also reflected interest accretion for the deferred payment related to the PinnOak acquisition. See NOTE 9 DEBT AND CREDIT FACILITIES for further information. In 2008, we recorded impairment charges of $25.1 million related to declines in the fair value of our available for sale securities which we concluded were other than temporary. As of December 31, 2008, our investments in PolyMet and Golden West had fair values totaling $6.2 million and $4.7 million, respectively, compared with a cost of $14.2 million and $21.8 million, respectively. The severity of the impairments in relation to the carrying amounts of the individual investments was consistent with the macroeconomic market and industry developments during 2008. However, we evaluated the near term prospects of the issuers in relation to the severity and rapid decline in the fair value of each of these investments, and based upon that evaluation, we could not reasonably assert that the impairment period would be temporary primarily as a result of the global economic crisis and the corresponding uncertainties in the market. As a result of acquiring the remaining interest in Freewest effective January 27, 2010, results in the first quarter of 2010 will be impacted by approximately $13 million of realized gains, which will be recognized in Other income (expense) on the Statement of Operations for the period ended March 31, 2010. Income Taxes Our tax rate is affected by recurring items, such as depletion and tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and the relative amount of income we earn in our various jurisdictions. It is also affected by discrete items that may occur in any given year, but are not consistent from year to year. The following represents a summary of our tax provision and corresponding effective rates for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008: (In Millions) 2009 2008 Income tax expense $ 20.8 $ 144.2 Effective tax rate 7.2 % 20.1 % 50 Table of Contents Our tax provision for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 was $20.8 million and $144.2 million, respectively. The $123.4 million decrease in income tax expense and 12.9 percent decrease in the effective tax rate are primarily attributable to lower pre tax book income and increased benefits from certain discrete items, partially offset by increased valuation allowances. Discrete items in 2009 relate to benefits associated with the settlement of tax audits and filings for prior years. We had a $39.0 million increase in the valuation allowance of certain deferred tax assets. Of this amount, $24.5 million relates to certain foreign operating losses and $14.5 million relates to certain foreign assets where tax basis exceeds book basis. A reconciliation of the statutory tax rate to the effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 is as follows: 2009 2008 U.S. statutory rate 35.0 % 35.0 % Increases/(Decreases) due to: Percentage depletion (11.6 ) (11.9 ) Impact of foreign operations (9.1 ) (2.1 ) Valuation allowance 11.9 1.6 Other items net 0.4 (0.6 ) Effective income tax rate before discrete items 26.6 22.0 Discrete items (19.4 ) (1.9 ) Effective income tax rate 7.2 % 20.1 % See NOTE 14 INCOME TAXES for further information. Equity Loss in Ventures Equity loss in ventures is primarily comprised of our share of the results from Amap&aacute; and AusQuest, for which we have a 30 percent ownership interest in each. The equity loss in ventures for the year ended December 31, 2009 of $65.5 million primarily represents our share of the operating results of our equity method investment in Amap&aacute;. Such results consist of operating losses of $62.2 million. Results in 2008 mainly consisted of operating losses of $45.6 million, partially offset by foreign currency hedge gains of $10.5 million. The negative operating results in each year are primarily due to slower than anticipated ramp up of operations and product yields. Our equity share of the losses for Amap&aacute; were also higher in the current year due to a write down in the value of inventory, asset impairment charges, as well as changes in foreign currency exchange rates during 2009 and the resulting impact on project debt denominated in Brazilian real. Noncontrolling Interest Noncontrolling interest in consolidated income was a loss of $0.8 million in 2009 compared with income of $21.2 million in 2008. The change is primarily attributable to the acquisition of the remaining 19.6 percent interest in Asia Pacific Iron Ore (formerly known as Portman Limited) during 2008, thereby eliminating the related noncontrolling interests in 2009. 2008 Compared to 2007 The following is a summary of our consolidated results of operations for 2008 compared with 2007: (In Millions) 2008 2007 VarianceFavorable/(Unfavorable) Revenues from product sales and services $ 3,609.1 $ 2,275.2 $ 1,333.9 Cost of goods sold and operating expenses (2,449.4 ) (1,813.2 ) (636.2 ) Sales Margin $ 1,159.7 $ 462.0 $ 697.7 Sales Margin % 32.1 % 20.3 % 11.8 % 51 Table of Contents Revenue from Product Sales and Services Sales revenue in 2008 increased $1.3 billion, or 59 percent, compared with 2007. The increase in sales revenue was primarily due to higher sales prices combined with increases in sales volume. Higher sales volume in 2008 was primarily due to increased demand and commitments under our long term pellet sales agreements, increased spot sales, and customer plant outages during the prior year. However, this increase was partially offset by declines in sales volumes to customers during the fourth quarter of 2008 as a result of the volatility and uncertainty in global markets, which led to production slowdowns in the steel industry. In addition, sales volume was negatively impacted throughout the year by adverse mining conditions and production delays at our North American Coal segment. Results for North American Coal in 2007 represent five months of operations since the July 31, 2007 acquisition. Revenues in 2008 related to our North American Iron Ore segment increased approximately $624.2 million over 2007 primarily as a result of higher steel prices, renegotiated and new long term supply agreements with certain customers, which were negotiated at world pellet prices, and other contractual price adjustment factors. In 2008, revenue also included $225.5 million related to the supplemental steel payments compared with $98.3 million in 2007. In addition, the Australian benchmark prices for lump and fines settled at increases of 97 percent and 80 percent in 2008, thereby resulting in higher revenues from our Asia Pacific Iron Ore segment compared with 2007. Cost of Goods Sold Cost of goods sold was $2.4 billion in 2008, an increase of $636.2 million, or 35 percent compared with 2007. The increase in cost of goods sold in 2008 was primarily due to the fact that results for North American Coal in 2007 only represented five months of operations since the July 31, 2007 acquisition. In addition, the increase in cost of goods sold in 2008 was attributable to higher costs of production, higher royalty fees related to increases in pellet pricing, and increased maintenance costs associated with the Michigan expansion project and major furnace repairs at Empire and United Taconite during the first quarter of 2008. In 2008, we continued to be challenged with adverse geological conditions across the mines at our North American Coal segment and delays in delivery of new capital equipment, which contributed to overall equipment performance and availability issues, thereby resulting in production delays and increased costs in all operations. Costs were also negatively impacted in 2008 by approximately $1.6 million related to unfavorable foreign exchange rates as well as higher fuel and energy costs primarily related to our North American and Asia Pacific iron ore operations, which together increased $42.5 million compared with 2007. In addition, the impact of the United Taconite and Asia Pacific Iron Ore step acquisitions also contributed to the increase in 2008. Other Operating Income (Expense) Following is a summary of other operating income (expense) for 2008 and 2007: (In Millions) 2008 2007 VarianceFavorable/(Unfavorable) Royalties and management fee revenue $ 21.7 $ 14.5 $ 7.2 Selling, general and administrative expenses (188.6 ) (114.2 ) (74.4 ) Terminated acquisition costs (90.1 ) (90.1 ) Gain on sale of other assets net 22.8 18.4 4.4 Casualty recoveries 10.5 3.2 7.3 Miscellaneous net 2.9 (2.3 ) 5.2 $ (220.8 ) $ (80.4 ) $ (140.4 ) The increase in selling, general and administrative expense of $74.4 million in 2008 compared with 2007 is primarily a result of $20.2 million in higher share based and incentive compensation, and higher wages and benefits related to an increase in the number of employees. We also incurred approximately $2.2 million in 52 Table of Contents corporate severance costs during the fourth quarter of 2008. Outside professional service and legal fees associated with the expansion of our business increased approximately $15.1 million in 2008. Expenses at our Asia Pacific Iron Ore segment were $5.7 million higher than 2007, reflecting higher employment costs and outside professional services to support business development and improvement efforts. Selling, general and administrative expense in 2008 was also impacted by additional corporate development activities in Latin America, Asia Pacific, and other general business development, resulting in an increase of approximately $13.0 million. In addition, 2008 includes a full year of selling, general and administrative expenses from our North American Coal segment, compared with five months in 2007 based on a July 31, 2007 date of acquisition, resulting in an increase of $5.1 million. Selling, general and administrative expense in 2008 was also impacted by a charge in the first quarter of approximately $6.8 million in connection with a legal case as well as $4.3 million related to our interest in Sonoma acquired in 2007. On November 17, 2008, we announced the termination of the definitive merger agreement with Alpha Natural Resources, Inc., under which we would have acquired all outstanding shares of Alpha. Both our Board of Directors and Alphas Board of Directors made the decision after considering various issues, including the macroeconomic environment, uncertainty in the steel industry, shareholder dynamics, and the risks and costs of potential litigation. Considering these issues, each board determined that termination of the merger agreement was in the best interest of its equity holders. Under the terms of the settlement agreement, we were required to pay Alpha a $70 million termination fee, which was financed through our revolving credit facility and paid in November 2008. As a result, $90.1 million in termination fees and associated acquisition costs were expensed in the fourth quarter of 2008 upon termination of the definitive merger agreement. The gain on sale of other assets of $22.8 million in 2008 primarily relates to the sale of our wholly owned subsidiary, Synfuel, which was completed on June 4, 2008. Under the agreement, Oil Shale Exploration Company Skyline, LLC acquired 100 percent of Synfuel for $24 million. As additional consideration for the stock, a perpetual nonparticipating royalty interest was granted initially equal to $0.02 per barrel of shale oil and $0.01 per barrel of shale oil produced from lands covered by existing State of Utah oil shale leases, plus 25 percent of royalty payments from conventional oil and gas operations. We recorded a gain of $19 million in the second quarter of 2008 upon completion of the transaction. The gain on sale of assets in 2007 of $18.4 million primarily reflected the fourth quarter 2007 gain on the sale of portions of the former LTVSMC site. The sale included cash proceeds of approximately $18 million. The increase in casualty recoveries in 2008 compared with 2007 is primarily attributable to a $9.2 million insurance recovery recognized in the current year related to a 2006 electrical explosion at our United Taconite facility. Other income (expense) Following is a summary of other income (expense) for 2008 and 2007: (In Millions) 2008 2007 VarianceFavorable/(Unfavorable) Changes in fair value of foreign currency contracts, net $ (188.2 ) $ $ (188.2 ) Interest income 26.2 20.0 6.2 Interest expense (39.8 ) (22.6 ) (17.2 ) Impairment of securities (25.1 ) (25.1 ) Other non operating income 4.3 1.7 2.6 $ (222.6 ) $ (0.9 ) $ (221.7 ) The impact of changes in the fair value of our foreign currency contracts on the Statement of Consolidated Operations in 2008 is due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates during the year. We are required to record the market value of our open derivative positions on our Statements of Consolidated Financial Position. Previously, when the derivative instruments were designated as cash flow hedges, the mark to market 53 Table of Contents adjustments related to the effective portions of the hedges were recorded as a component of Other comprehensive income. Upon de designation of the cash flow hedges, effective July 1, 2008, the instruments are prospectively marked to fair value, and the adjustments resulting from changes in the market value of these derivative instruments are recorded as an unrealized gain or loss each reporting period. The following table represents our foreign currency derivative contract position as of December 31, 2008: ($ in Millions) Contract Maturity Notional Amount Weighted AverageExchange Rate Spot Rate Fair Value Contract Portfolio (excluding AUD Call Options) (1) : Contracts expiring in the next 12 months $ 537.0 0.81 0.69 $ (77.5 ) Contracts expiring in the next 13 to 24 months 202.5 0.74 0.69 (25.5 ) Contracts expiring in the next 25 to 36 months 55.0 0.77 0.69 (8.8 ) Total $ 794.5 0.79 0.69 $ (111.8 ) AUD Call Options (2) Contracts expiring in the next 12 months $ 33.0 0.87 0.69 $ 0.3 Contracts expiring in the next 13 to 24 months 41.5 0.90 0.69 0.6 Contracts expiring in the next 25 to 36 months Total $ 74.5 0.88 0.69 $ 0.9 Total Hedge Contract Portfolio $ 869.0 $ (110.9 ) (1) Includes collar options, convertible collar options and forward exchange contracts. (2) AUD call options are excluded from the weighted average exchange rate used for the remainder of the contract portfolio due to the unlimited downside participation associated with these instruments. The significant unrealized mark to market fluctuations are related to the Australian to U.S. dollar spot rate of A$0.69 as of December 31, 2008, which significantly decreased from the Australian to U.S. dollar spot rate of A$0.96 as of June 30, 2008 upon de designation of the hedges. The changes in the spot rates are correlated to the depreciation of the Australian dollar relative to the United States dollar during the period. In addition, the amount of outstanding contracts in our foreign exchange hedge book significantly increased from $559.2 million at June 30, 2008 to approximately $869.0 million as of December 31, 2008, primarily as a result of higher sales prices in 2008 partially offset by the expiration of contracts upon maturity. In 2008, we recorded impairment charges of $25.1 million related to declines in the fair value of our available for sale securities which we concluded were other than temporary. As of December 31, 2008, our investments in PolyMet and Golden West had fair values totaling $6.2 million and $4.7 million, respectively, compared with a cost of $14.2 million and $21.8 million, respectively. The metals and mining industry and our investees are susceptible to changes in the U.S. and global economies and the industries of their customers. Their principal customers are part of the global steel industry, and their businesses had been adversely affected by the slowdown of the global economy, particularly during the last quarter of 2008 when our investments became impaired. The severity of the impairments in relation to the carrying amounts of the individual investments was consistent with the macroeconomic market and industry developments. However, we had evaluated the near term prospects of the issuers in relation to the severity and rapid decline in the fair value of each of these investments, and based upon that evaluation, we could not reasonably assert that the impairment period would be temporary primarily as a result of the global economic crisis and the corresponding uncertainties in the market at the end of 2008. The increase in interest income in 2008 compared with 2007 is attributable to additional cash and investments held by our Asia Pacific Iron Ore segment during 2008 coupled with higher overall average returns. However, investment returns were lower in the fourth quarter of 2008 as a result of market declines. Higher interest expense in 2008 reflected increased borrowings under our senior notes and interest accretion for the deferred payment related to the PinnOak acquisition. 54 Table of Contents Income Taxes Our tax rate is affected by recurring items, such as depletion and tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and the relative amount of income we earn in our various jurisdictions. It is also affected by discrete items that may occur in any given year, but are not consistent from year to year. The following represents a summary of our tax provision and corresponding effective rates for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007: (In Millions) 2008 2007 Income tax expense $ 144.2 $ 84.1 Effective tax rate 20.1 % 22.1 % Our tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 was $144.2 million and $84.1 million, respectively. The increase was primarily attributable to higher pre tax book income partially offset by a decrease in our effective tax rate. Our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 was 20.1 percent and 22.1 percent, respectively. The 2.0 percent decrease is primarily attributable to increased percentage depletion and release of the valuation allowance related to foreign net operating losses. A reconciliation of the statutory tax rate to the effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 is as follows: 2008 2007 U.S. statutory rate 35.0 % 35.0 % Increases/(Decreases) due to: Percentage depletion (11.9 ) (12.3 ) Impact of foreign operations (2.1 ) (1.9 ) Valuation allowance 1.6 3.4 Other items net (0.6 ) (2.3 ) Effective income tax rate before discrete items 22.0 21.9 Discrete items (1.9 ) 0.2 Effective income tax rate 20.1 % 22.1 % Equity Loss in Ventures The equity loss in ventures for the year ended December 31, 2008 of $35.1 million primarily represents our share of the operating results of our equity method investment in Amap&aacute;. Such results mainly consist of start up and operating losses of $45.6 million, which includes operating losses from Amap&aacute;s railroad of $5.8 million. The loss was partially offset by foreign currency hedge gains of $10.5 million. This compares with a loss of $11.2 million in 2007, comprised of $7.2 million in pre production costs and $4.0 million of operating losses from the railroad. The negative operating results in 2008 were mainly due to slower than anticipated ramp up of operations and product yields. Noncontrolling Interest Noncontrolling interest in consolidated income increased $5.6 million, or 36 percent, for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase was primarily driven by a corresponding increase in the operating results of Asia Pacific Iron Ore (formerly known as Portman Limited), a consolidated subsidiary in which we owned approximately 80.4 percent in 2007 and throughout the first half of 2008. In June 2008, we acquired an additional 4.8 percent interest in Asia Pacific Iron Ore through a share repurchase program offered by Portman. We subsequently made an off market offer to purchase the outstanding shares and proceeded with a compulsory acquisition of the remaining shares to obtain full ownership of Asia Pacific Iron Ore in the fourth quarter of 2008. The transaction constituted a step acquisition of a noncontrolling interest, thereby reducing noncontrolling interest in consolidated income on a prospective basis. We accounted for the acquisition of the noncontrolling interest by the purchase method. As a result of the step acquisition, the then historical cost basis of the noncontrolling interest balance was reduced to the extent of the percentage interest sold, and the increased ownership obtained was accounted for by increasing the entitys basis from historical cost to fair value for the portion of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the additional ownership acquired. 55 Table of Contents Results of Operations Segment Information Our company is organized and managed according to product category and geographic location. Segment information reflects our strategic business units, which are organized to meet customer requirements and global competition. We evaluate segment performance based on sales margin, defined as revenues less cost of goods sold identifiable to each segment. This measure of operating performance is an effective measurement as we focus on reducing production costs throughout the Company. 2009 Compared to 2008 North American Iron Ore Following is a summary of North American Iron Ore results for 2009 and 2008: (In Millions) Change due to 2009 2008 Sales priceand rate Salesvolume Idle cost/Productionvolumevariance Freight andreimbursements Totalchange Revenues from product sales and services $ 1,447.8 $ 2,369.6 $ (165.5 ) $ (580.7 ) $ $ (175.6 ) $ (921.8 ) Cost of goods sold and operating expense (1,172.3 ) (1,565.3 ) (22.0 ) 358.3 (118.9 ) 175.6 393.0 Sales margin $ 275.5 $ 804.3 $ (187.5 ) $ (222.4 ) $ (118.9 ) $ $ (528.8 ) Sales tons 16.4 22.7 Revenue in 2009 decreased $921.8 million, or 39 percent compared with 2008 primarily as a result of a 28 percent decline in sales volume, which contributed $580.7 million to the overall decrease in revenue. The decline in sales volume is a result of the economic downturn and its impact on the global steel industry, which led to a decline in demand for steel making products in North America during 2009. In addition to the year over year decline in sales volume, reported price settlements for iron ore pellets reflected a decrease of approximately 48 percent below 2008 prices, compared with an increase of 87 percent in the prior year. As a result, base rate adjustments related to estimated reductions in World Pellet Pricing and producer price indices have contributed to a $165.5 million decline in revenues in 2009. Revenue in the current year included approximately $22.2 million related to supplemental contract payments compared with $225.5 million in 2008. The decrease between periods relates to the estimated decline in average annual hot band steel pricing for one of our North American Iron Ore customers. In August 2009, an arbitration demand was filed against us by one of our customers relating to a pellet price reopener provision in one of our supply contracts. The customer claims that it is entitled to request a price renegotiation even though it did not provide written notice before the deadline specified in the supply agreement and did not show that the triggering event had occurred. Should the arbitration panel determine that the customer is permitted to request a price renegotiation, the two sides have 60 days following notice per the supply agreement to negotiate revised pricing. In the event these negotiations are unsuccessful, further arbitration would be utilized to determine the revised applicable price under the supply agreement. The price determined by the arbitrator would be effective retroactive to the beginning of 2009. In the event this matter goes to supplementary arbitration to determine the revised price under the supply agreement, and we are unsuccessful in defending our position, the retroactive revised pricing for 2009 sales under the supply agreement would have a material impact on our consolidated operating results. Refer to Part I Item 3, Legal Proceedings, for additional information. In 2009 and 2008, certain customers purchased and paid for approximately 0.9 million tons and 1.2 million tons of pellets, respectively, in order to meet minimum contractual purchase requirements for each year under the terms of take or pay contracts. The inventory was stored at our facilities in upper lakes stockpiles. At the request of the customers, the ore was not shipped, resulting in deferred revenue at December 31, 2009 and 2008 of $81.9 million and $82.9 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2009, all of the 1.2 million tons that were deferred at the end of 2008 were delivered, resulting in the related revenue being recognized in 2009. Furthermore, the 56 Table of Contents supply agreement with one of our customers requires the customer to pay for any tons remaining under its 2009 nomination in addition to certain stockpile payments by December 31, 2009. There were approximately 1.7 million unshipped tons remaining under the customers 2009 nomination and 0.8 million tons related to December 2009 shipments, for which payment of $147.5 million was due on December 31, 2009 per the terms of the contract. The customer did not remit payment of this amount until January 4, 2010. As a result, such amounts are not reflected in our 2009 consolidated financial statements. Cost of goods sold and operating expense in 2009 decreased $393.0 million or 25 percent from the prior year primarily due to lower sales volume, which resulted in cost reductions of approximately $358.3 million. The overall decrease was partially offset by idle expense of $118.9 million related to production curtailments at nearly all of the North American Iron Ore mines during 2009 in order to balance production with anticipated sales demand. In addition, cost of goods sold and operating expenses were unfavorably impacted in 2009 by approximately $22 million due to higher cost rates. The increase was primarily attributable to $43 million of higher labor costs related to the new labor agreement entered into in September 2008 at our iron ore facilities as well as higher fringe rates combined with an increase of $22 million related to higher energy costs. This was partially offset by a $25 million reduction in fuel costs, a decrease in royalty costs of $18 million as a result of lower iron ore pellet pricing, and cost reductions of $11 million related to ongoing cash conservation efforts during the current year. In addition, due to lower partner demand, Cliffs acquired 1.6 million tons produced at Tilden and Wabush from the mine partners share at variable cost, which resulted in a favorable cost impact of approximately $79 million in 2009. Production Following is a summary of iron ore production tonnage for 2009 and 2008: (In Millions) (1) Company Share Total Mine 2009 2008 2009 2008 Empire 2.0 3.6 2.6 4.6 Tilden 5.6 6.5 5.6 7.6 Hibbing 0.4 1.9 1.7 8.2 Northshore 3.2 5.5 3.2 5.5 United Taconite 3.8 4.3 3.8 5.1 Wabush 2.1 1.1 2.7 4.2 Total 17.1 (2) 22.9 19.6 35.2 (1) Long tons of pellets (2,240 pounds). (2) Includes 1.6 million tons allocated to Cliffs due to re nominations by Cliffs partners at Tilden and Wabush. In response to the economic downturn, we continue to rationalize production to match customer demand. In 2009, we reduced production at our six North American Iron Ore mines to 17.1 million equity tons compared with 2008 production of 22.9 million equity tons. Based on signs of marked improvements in customer demand beginning in the second half of 2009, we have increased production at most of our facilities and have called employees back to work in order to ensure we are positioned to meet increases in demand. During the fourth quarter of 2009, Tilden and United Taconite began operating at full capacity. Northshore was operating its two large furnaces, and Empire continued to maintain its current production levels. Wabush was operating two of its three furnaces with Cliffs taking essentially all of the tonnage. Only Hibbing continues to be fully curtailed and is expected to remain idled until the second quarter of 2010. Based on current market uncertainties and corresponding blast furnace capacity utilization in North America, we continue to monitor the marketplace closely and will adjust our production plans for 2010 accordingly to meet customer demand. 57 Table of Contents North American Coal Following is a summary of North American Coal results for 2009 and 2008: (In Millions, except tonnage) Change due to 2009 2008 Sales priceand rate Salesvolume Idle cost/Productionvolumevariance Freight andreimbursements Totalchange Revenues from product sales and services $ 207.2 $ 346.3 $ 0.9 $ (127.1 ) $ $ (12.9 ) $ (139.1 ) Cost of goods sold and operating expense (279.1 ) (392.7 ) (5.3 ) 146.7 (40.7 ) 12.9 113.6 Sales margin $ (71.9 ) $ (46.4 ) $ (4.4 ) $ 19.6 $ (40.7 ) $ $ (25.5 ) Sales tons (in thousands) 1,874 3,241 We reported sales margin losses of $71.9 million and $46.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Revenue of $207.2 million in 2009 was 40 percent lower than the prior year. The decrease in revenue is primarily attributable to a 42 percent decline in sales volume as a result of market conditions which have adversely impacted the demand for steel making raw materials throughout the current year. Cost of goods sold and operating expense in 2009 decreased $113.6 million or 29 percent from the prior year primarily due to lower sales volume, which resulted in cost reductions of approximately $146.7 million. The decrease in current year sales volume also resulted in a decline in freight costs of $12.9 million and a reduction in royalty costs of $7.5 million. In addition, in response to the economic downturn, we decreased spending across the North American Coal business segment and idled production at both the Oak Grove and Pinnacle complexes during 2009. Production curtailments and headcount reductions during the current year have resulted in lower production related costs, including maintenance, supplies, and labor costs. Headcount reductions resulted in labor and benefit cost reductions of $32.2 million in 2009. Spending on operating supplies and maintenance costs was reduced in 2009 by approximately $26.1 million as we continued to focus on cash conservation and cost management strategies. However, these cost reductions were more than offset by higher cost per ton rates in 2009, due to the impact of lower volume, resulting in an overall unfavorable rate variance of $5.3 million. Cost of goods sold and operating expenses in 2009 were also negatively impacted by an increase in idle expense and production volume variance of $40.7 million related to production curtailments at both mine locations during the year and delays associated with development of longwall panels at Oak Grove in early 2009. Production Following is a summary of coal production tonnage for 2009 and 2008: (In Thousands) (1) 2009 2008 Mine: Pinnacle Complex 864 2,489 Oak Grove 877 979 Total 1,741 3,468 (1) Tons are short tons (2,000 pounds). Metallurgical coal demand has been reduced in the current year as the steel industry has cut back production in response to the global economic slowdown. As a result, we initiated plans in 2009 to align production with customer demand. In West Virginia, production was idled at our Green Ridge mines for part of the year, and production at our Pinnacle mine was temporarily suspended. In Alabama, operating levels were also reduced at our Oak Grove mine. However, production levels began to increase at the end of 2009 due to improvements in 58 Table of Contents market conditions and increases in customer demand. In particular, during the fourth quarter, production increased at Oak Grove and development was also accelerated to avoid downtime in 2010. At Pinnacle, the longwall move was completed and we resumed production in mid October. These production adjustments at North American Coal resulted in a 2009 annual operating rate of approximately 1.7 million tons. This compares with 2008 production of 3.5 million tons. The Oak Grove mine was recently idled due to ventilation, water and roofing issues at the mine. MSHA denied our request to continue limited production while we addressed these issues. Oak Grove continued to operate a continuous miner section to develop future longwall panels. MSHA approval was finally received on February 9, 2010 for longwall operations to resume. Asia Pacific Iron Ore Following is a summary of Asia Pacific Iron Ore results for 2009 and 2008: (In Millions) Change due to 2009 2008 Sales priceand rate Salesvolume Other Totalchange Revenues from product sales and services $ 542.1 $ 769.8 $ (257.5 ) $ 72.5 $ (42.7 ) $ (227.7 ) Cost of goods sold and operating expense (454.9 ) (421.2 ) 1.8 (33.8 ) (1.7 ) (33.7 ) Sales margin $ 87.2 $ 348.6 $ (255.7 ) $ 38.7 $ (44.4 ) $ (261.4 ) Sales tonnes 8.5 7.8 Sales margin for Asia Pacific Iron Ore declined to $87.2 million in 2009 compared with $348.6 million in 2008. Revenue decreased 30 percent in the current year primarily as a result of lower pricing for lump and fines in 2009 compared with 2008 prices. While the 2009 benchmark prices for iron ore lump and fines did not settle with all of our customers, we negotiated pricing arrangements with certain customers in China to reflect the decline in steel demand and prices. Pricing decreases in the current year of 44 percent and 33 percent for lump and fines, respectively, contrast with settled price increases in 2008 of 97 percent and 80 percent, respectively. Pricing in 2009 was based upon previously reported settlements in Japan and worldwide pressures in the market and remained unchanged from the estimates we made throughout most of 2009. The overall decline in current year revenue was partially offset by a favorable variance of $72.5 million due to a 9 percent increase in sales volume as a result of increased demand as well as a positive sales mix variance of $34.1 million due to more sales of lump and fines at higher prices and reduced sales of low grade fines. Cost of goods sold and operating expenses in 2009 were relatively consistent with 2008. Costs were unfavorably impacted by approximately $38.8 million of amortization expense related to the accounting for the acquisition of the remaining ownership interest in Asia Pacific Iron Ore which occurred during the second half of 2008. Costs in 2009 also increased by approximately $29.6 million due to higher sales volumes as well as higher shipping costs of $5.3 million due to freight arrangements with customers to secure sales during the current year. Increases in costs during 2009 were partially offset by favorable foreign exchange variances of $35.2 million. Production Following is a summary of iron ore production tonnage for 2009 and 2008: (In Millions) (1) 2009 2008 Mine: Koolyanobbing 8.3 7.3 Cockatoo Island 0.4 Total 8.3 7.7 (1) Tonnes are metric tons (2,205 pounds). Cockatoo production reflects our 50 percent share. 59 Table of Contents Production at Asia Pacific Iron Ore in 2009 was higher than 2008 as a result of increased demand and initiatives taken during the year to improve supply conditions and eliminate certain production and logistics constraints, including rail upgrades and stockpile utilization. Increases in production in 2009 were partially offset by the end of production at Cockatoo during 2008. Production is not expected to resume until the first half of 2011 once the seawall is completed. 2008 Compared to 2007 North American Iron Ore Following is a summary of North American Iron Ore results for 2008 and 2007: (In Millions) Change due to 2008 2007 Sales priceand rate Salesvolume Freight andreimbursements Totalchange Revenues from product sales and services $ 2,369.6 $ 1,745.4 $ 596.1 $ 34.4 $ (6.3 ) $ 624.2 Cost of goods sold and operating expense (1,565.3 ) (1,347.5 ) (199.0 ) (25.1 ) 6.3 (217.8 ) Sales margin $ 804.3 $ 397.9 $ 397.1 $ 9.3 $ $ 406.4 Sales tons 22.7 22.3 The increase in sales revenue in 2008 was primarily due to higher sales prices combined with an increase in sales volume. Revenue per ton increased 33.3 percent in 2008 primarily as a result of higher steel prices, renegotiated and new long term supply agreements with certain customers, which were negotiated at a time of higher world pellet prices, and other contractual price adjustment factors. In 2008, revenue included $225.5 million related to the supplemental steel payments compared with $98.3 million in 2007. The comparison of sales volume between 2008 and 2007 shows a slight increase year over year. However, in 2007, certain of our customers purchased and paid for approximately 1.5 million tons of iron ore pellets in stockpiles at the end of the year in order to comply with the take or pay provisions of their existing long term supply agreements. The customers requested via a fixed shipping schedule that we not ship the iron ore until the spring of 2008, when the Great Lakes waterways re opened for shipping. We recognized revenue on the 1.5 million tons in 2007. The following represents a comparison of sales volume in 2008, 2007 and 2006 as if the impact of the stockpile sales were excluded from the period reported and instead recognized in the period shipped: (In Millions) Actual SalesTons Recognized Cash Received /Sales Tons NotRecognized Pro FormaSales Tons 2006 20.3 1.2 21.5 2007 22.3 (1.2 ) 21.1 2008 22.7 1.2 23.9 Absent the impact of the stockpile sales, the increase in sales volume in 2008 is primarily due to increased demand during the first three quarters of 2008, commitments under our long term pellet sales agreements, and customer plant outages during 2007. However, this increase was partially offset by declines in sales volumes to customers during the fourth quarter of 2008 as a result of the volatility and uncertainty in global markets, which led to production curtailments in the steel industry. The increase in 2008 revenue is also attributable to a $50.6 million favorable mark to market adjustment related to the unsold tons associated with our purchase of the remaining 30 percent interest in United Taconite. The increase in cost of goods sold and operating expense in 2008 was primarily due to higher costs of production, higher royalty fees primarily related to the increases in pellet pricing, and increased maintenance 60 Table of Contents costs associated with the Michigan expansion project. Fuel and energy costs increased $28.4 million compared with 2007. In addition, the impact of the United Taconite step acquisition also contributed to the increase year over year. Production Following is a summary of iron ore production tonnage for 2008 and 2007: (In Millions) (1) Company Share Total Mine 2008 2007 2008 2007 Empire 3.6 3.9 4.6 4.9 Tilden 6.5 6.1 7.6 7.2 Hibbing 1.9 1.7 8.2 7.4 Northshore 5.5 5.2 5.5 5.2 United Taconite 4.3 3.7 5.1 5.3 Wabush 1.1 1.2 4.2 4.6 Total 22.9 21.8 35.2 34.6 (1) Long tons of pellets (2,240 pounds). The decrease in production at Empire in 2008 compared with 2007 is primarily due to Empire processing Tilden ore to produce 0.4 million tons of pellets under a test period. The corresponding increase is reflected at Tilden, bringing total 2008 production to 7.6 million tons compared with 7.2 million tons in 2007. The increase in Hibbings production in 2008 compared with 2007 was a result of the shutdown in late February 2007 due to severe weather conditions that caused significant buildup of ice in the basin supplying water to the processing facility. The full year production loss in 2007 totaled approximately 0.8 million tons (Company share 0.2 million tons). The increase in production in 2008 at Northshore was due to reactivation of one of the furnaces at the end of March 2008. Accordingly, production at Northshore benefited from an incremental increase of approximately 0.6 million tons in 2008. This increase was partially offset by production curtailments totaling 0.3 million tons in the fourth quarter of 2008 from idling pellet furnaces in response to production slowdowns in the steel industry. The increase in our share of production at United Taconite is primarily related to the acquisition of the remaining 30 percent interest in July 2008. United Taconites 2008 production was reduced by 0.2 million tons in the fourth quarter from idling a pellet furnace in response to production slowdowns in the steel industry. In December 2008, we executed plans to reduce production at our six North American iron ore mines. In order to implement the lower production levels, we temporarily idled various pellet furnaces and initiated workforce adjustments at each of our North American Iron Ore mines.

We reported losses of $46.4 million and $31.7 million in sales margin for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Sales volume and costs in 2008 were negatively impacted by adverse mining conditions and production delays throughout the year. In addition, we declared force majeure on customer shipments from our Pinnacle mine in mid March 2008. Production at the mine slowed as a result of encountering a fault area within the coal panel being mined at the time. The force majeure was lifted in mid June 2008. Despite completion of a longwall move in June 2008, our Oak Grove mine continued to experience delays and lower than planned production levels during the second half of 2008. The mine encountered lower than planned coal heights in the current mining panel and harsh geological conditions in the development areas. Additional costs have also been incurred for repairs and maintenance as a result of mechanical problems caused by adverse geological conditions, delays associated with equipment replacements and availability of experienced mining personnel. Oak Grove decreased production in the fourth quarter of 2008 to enable continuous miners to prepare longwall panels. One of our Green Ridge facilities, located in the Pinnacle Complex shut down production in an effort to focus on mining the remaining other Green Ridge location, resulting in lower overall production for the facility. We continued to be challenged with adverse geological conditions across the mines and delays in delivery of new capital equipment, which contributed to overall equipment performance and availability issues, which increased costs in all operations in 2008.

(2) Prior year results represent production since the July 31, 2007 acquisition. Production in 2008 was impacted by the extension of longwall development timing related to unplanned geological conditions, difficulty in obtaining additional equipment and personnel, and mechanical problems experienced within the second half of 2008 at our Oak Grove Mine. Also impacting production in 2008 were adverse mining conditions at our Pinnacle Complex. In addition, as a result of the economic downturn and its impact on the global steel industry, we initiated operating plans to reduce production and commence workforce adjustments at the Pinnacle Complex in December 2008. Asia Pacific Iron Ore Following is a summary of Asia Pacific Iron Ore results for 2008 and 2007: (In Millions) Change due to 2008 2007 Sales priceand rate Salesvolume Totalchange Revenues from product sales and services $ 769.8 $ 444.6 $ 343.9 $ (18.7 ) $ 325.2 Cost of goods sold and operating expense (421.2 ) (348.8 ) (87.1 ) 14.7 (72.4 ) Sales margin $ 348.6 $ 95.8 $ 256.8 $ (4.0 ) $ 252.8 Sales tons 7.8 8.1 62 Table of Contents In 2008, the Australian benchmark prices for lump and fines settled at increases of 97 percent and 80 percent, respectively. As a result of the price settlement, sales from our Asia Pacific Iron Ore segment were recorded at the higher 2008 prices, thereby resulting in record revenues. Cost of goods sold and operating expenses in 2008 increased primarily due to higher costs of production partially offset by lower volume and reduction of stockpiles. Increased costs of production were a result of higher fuel, maintenance and contract labor expenditures arising from inflationary pressures. Fuel and energy costs in 2008 increased approximately $14.1 million compared with 2007. Costs were also negatively impacted in 2008 by increased royalty payments due to higher revenues and approximately $1.6 million related to unfavorable foreign exchange rates. In addition, 2008 was impacted by the step acquisition of the remaining ownership interest in Asia Pacific Iron Ore. Production Following is a summary of iron ore production tonnage for 2008 and 2007: (In Millions) (1) Total 2008 2007 Mine: Koolyanobbing 7.3 7.7 Cockatoo Island 0.4 0.7 Total 7.7 8.4 (1) Tonnes are metric tons (2,205 pounds). Cockatoo production reflects our 50 percent share. The decrease in production in 2008 compared with 2007 was primarily due to inventory stockpile reductions in an effort to improve working capital. In addition, production at Cockatoo declined as the second stage of the seawall reserves were exhausted. Liquidity, Cash Flows and Capital Resources Our primary sources of liquidity are cash generated from our operating and financing activities. Our cash flows from operating activities are driven primarily by our operating results and changes in our working capital requirements. Our cash flows from financing activities are dependent upon our ability to access credit or other capital. Throughout 2009, we have taken a balanced approach to allocation of our capital resources and free cash flow. We continued to focus on cash conservation and generation in our business operations as well as reduction of any discretionary capital expenditures in order to ensure we are positioned to face the challenges and uncertainties associated with the current economic environment. 63 Table of Contents The following is a summary of significant sources and uses of cash in 2009 and 2008: (In Millions) 2009 2008 Cash and cash equivalents January 1 $ 179.0 $ 157.1 Significant Transactions Investment in ventures $ (81.8 ) $ (93.1 ) Rail upgrade in Asia Pacific (28.8 ) (11.7 ) Payments for new longwall system at North American Coal (29.6 ) Purchase of noncontrolling interest in Asia Pacific Iron Ore (485.1 ) Purchase of noncontrolling interest in United Taconite (104.4 ) Acquisition termination fees (70.0 ) Michigan expansion project (47.7 ) Other capital expenditures (87.5 ) (93.5 ) Sale of assets 28.3 41.2 Dividend distributions (1) (31.9 ) (37.2 ) Total (201.7 ) (931.1 ) Sources of Financing Net cash provided by operating activities (2) 185.7 923.2 Proceeds from sale of common shares 347.3 Net borrowings under senior notes 325.0 Net borrowings (repayments) under credit facility 3.3 (240.0 ) Total 536.3 1,008.2 Other net activity (10.9 ) (55.2 ) Cash and cash equivalents December 31 $ 502.7 $ 179.0 (1) On May 12, 2009, our board of directors enacted a 55 percent reduction in our quarterly common share dividend to $0.04 from $0.0875 for the second and third quarters of 2009 in order to enhance financial flexibility. In the fourth quarter of 2009, the dividend was reinstated to its previous level. (2) Excludes $70 million of acquisition termination fees paid in 2008 related to the Alpha transaction. The following discussion summarizes the significant activities impacting our cash flows during the year as well as those expected to impact our future cash flows over the next 12 months. Refer to the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows for additional information. Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $185.7 million in 2009, compared with $853.2 million in 2008 and $288.9 million in 2007. Operating cash flows in 2009 were impacted by lower operating results, as previously noted, and increases in working capital primarily at our North American Iron Ore business segment. Our operating cash flows vary with prices realized from iron ore and coal sales, production levels, production costs, cash payments for income taxes and interest, other working capital changes and other factors. As a result of weak economic conditions, operating plans were revised earlier in 2009 to curtail production, defer or eliminate capital projects and reduce costs. We have responded to the uncertain near term outlook and will continue to adjust our operating strategy as market conditions change. Beginning in the second half of 2009, capacity utilization among steelmaking facilities in North America demonstrated ongoing improvement, which continued through the remainder of 2009 and is expected to continue into 2010. The industry is showing signs of stabilization and recovery based on increasing steel production and the restarting of blast furnaces in North America and Europe. As a result, we have experienced marked improvements in customer demand and market expectations and have increased production at most of our facilities. 64 Table of Contents While we do not expect demand to return to the levels seen in 2008 for some time, we remain cautiously optimistic for a slow and progressive recovery. Based on current mine plans and subject to future iron ore and coal prices, we expect estimated operating cash flows in 2010 to be greater than our budgeted investments and capital expenditures, expected debt payments, dividends, and other cash requirements. Refer to Outlook for additional guidance regarding expected future results, including projections on pricing, sales volume and production for our various businesses. Investing Activities Net cash used by investing activities was $179.3 million in 2009, compared with $795.6 million and $745.4 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively. Capital expenditures were $116.3 million, $182.5 million and $199.5 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Investing activities in 2009 also included additional capital contributions of $70.2 million related to our investment in Amap&aacute; during the year. In addition, in January 2009, Asia Pacific Iron Ore sold a fleet of rail cars and subsequently leased them back for a period of 10 years. We received proceeds of $23.8 million from the sale of the rail cars, and the leaseback has been accounted for as a capital lease. Aside from capital expenditures, significant investing activities in 2008 included $485.1 million for the acquisition of the remaining noncontrolling interest in our Asia Pacific Iron Ore segment and $104.4 million for the acquisition of the remaining 30 percent interest in United Taconite. In addition, we received proceeds of approximately $24 million from the sale of our wholly owned subsidiary, Synfuel, in June 2008. Non cash investing activities in 2008 included the issuance of $165 million of unregistered common shares and the commitment to provide 1.2 million tons of iron ore pellets as part of the consideration paid to acquire the remaining 30 percent interest in United Taconite. Non cash investing activities during the prior year also included the issuance of four million of our common shares at a share price of $38.27 to the former owners of PinnOak to accelerate the deferred payment and settle the contingent earn out associated with the initial purchase agreement. Investing activities in 2007 primarily included the purchase of PinnOak as well as our investments in Sonoma and Amap&aacute;. The current volatility and uncertainty in global markets, coupled with the slowdown in the worlds major economies, has had a significant impact on commodity prices in 2009. In addition, the credit environment is expected to limit the funding and expansion capabilities of many mining companies. Based on these economic conditions, we continue to evaluate and assess our capital expenditures, in order to ensure we are positioned to face the challenges, uncertainties, as well as opportunities, associated with the current environment. We anticipate that total cash used for investments and capital expenditures in 2010 will be approximately $250 million, including approximately $30 million related to the funding of our investment in Amap&aacute;. This amount does not include the additional investment to acquire the remaining interest in Wabush, which is approximately $88 million, subject to certain working capital adjustments. As we continue to increase production and look toward continued recovery in 2010, capital expenditures will include the construction of a new portal at Oak Grove to improve productivity and support growth and expansion of the mine. At Pinnacle, a new longwall plow system was purchased to reduce maintenance costs and increase production at the mine. Remaining expenditures for the new system of approximately $54 million will be made throughout 2010 and 2011. In addition, based on signs of improving demand for iron ore pellets, we continue to perform studies to determine whether to resume a previously announced expansion project at our Empire and Tilden mines in Michigans Upper Peninsula. Furthermore, in 2009 we implemented a global exploration program, which is integral to our growth strategy and is focused on identifying and capturing new world class projects for future development or projects that add significant value to existing operations. We expect to spend between $25 million and $30 million on exploration and development activities in 2010, which will provide us with opportunities for significant future potential reserve additions globally. We are evaluating funding options for our capital needs and expect to be able to fund these requirements through operations and availability under our borrowing arrangements. Other funding options may include new lines of credit or other financing arrangements. 65 Table of Contents The following represents our future cash commitments and contractual obligations as of December 31, 2009: Payments Due by Period (1) (In Millions) Contractual Obligations Total Less Than1 Year 1 3Years 3 5Years More Than5 Years Long term debt $ 529.6 $ 4.6 $ 200.0 $ 270.0 $ 55.0 Interest on debt (2) 94.2 25.8 50.8 15.8 1.8 Operating lease obligations 94.3 22.4 33.3 26.4 12.2 Capital lease obligations 183.2 24.3 47.2 43.7 68.0 Purchase obligations: Asia Pacific rail upgrade 8.8 8.8 Longwall plow system 54.0 40.0 14.0 Open purchase orders 235.0 226.5 8.5 Minimum take or pay purchase commitments (3) 798.0 120.7 194.8 146.8 335.7 Total purchase obligations 1,095.8 396.0 217.3 146.8 335.7 Other long term liabilities: Pension funding minimums 242.9 45.9 102.1 94.9 OPEB claim payments 134.5 35.2 53.0 46.3 Deferred revenue 105.1 94.8 10.3 Environmental and mine closure obligations 132.3 7.9 4.5 3.3 116.6 FIN 48 obligations (4) 21.2 17.9 3.3 Personal injury 23.3 4.1 8.2 2.9 8.1 Other (5) Total other long term liabilities 659.3 187.9 196.0 150.7 124.7 Total $ 2,656.4 $ 661.0 $ 744.6 $ 653.4 $ 597.4 (1) Includes our consolidated obligations.

Refer to NOTE 18 COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our future purchase commitments and obligations. Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities in 2009 was $304.3 million compared with $32.4 million in 2008 and $250.1 million in 2007. Cash flows from financing activities in 2009 primarily included $348 million in net proceeds from the sale of our common shares. Cash flows from financing activities in 2008 primarily included borrowings under our revolving credit facility and senior notes of $865 million, partially offset by debt repayments of $780 million and dividend distributions of $37.2 million. In 2007, financing activities included borrowings under our revolving credit facility of approximately $1.2 billion, partially offset by the repayment of $755.0 million under our credit facility and $159.6 million of PinnOak debt. 66 Table of Contents Throughout 2009 we have implemented proactive initiatives to enhance financial flexibility and strengthen liquidity, including a public offering of our common shares, a 55 percent reduction in our common share quarterly dividend to $0.04 from $0.0875 for the second and third quarters of 2009, and compensation reductions across the organization. These initiatives were taken in response to the high degree of uncertainty within our industry and the macroeconomic environment as well as to better position ourselves to take advantage of possible opportunities when the market improves. Through the public offering of our common shares, which closed on May 19, 2009, we sold a total of 17.25 million shares out of treasury stock. Net proceeds at a price of $21.00 per share were approximately $348 million, which will be used for general corporate purposes, including, among other things, funding certain capital expenditures, repayment of indebtedness or other strategic transactions. In addition, the quarterly dividend and compensation reductions resulted in savings of approximately $22 million and $15 million, respectively, in 2009. Capital Resources We expect to fund our business obligations from available cash, current operations and borrowings under our credit facility. The following represents a summary of key liquidity measures as of December 31, 2009 and 2008: (In Millions) December 31,2009 December 31,2008 Cash and cash equivalents $ 502.7 $ 179.0 Credit facility $ 800.0 $ 800.0 Senior notes 325.0 325.0 Asia Pacific Iron Ore facilities 27.6 Senior notes drawn (325.0 ) (325.0 ) Term loans drawn (200.0 ) (200.0 ) Letter of credit obligations and other commitments (31.4 ) (40.3 ) Borrowing capacity available $ 568.6 $ 587.3 Refer to NOTE 9 DEBT AND CREDIT FACILITIES of our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our debt and credit facilities. Apart from cash generated by the business, our primary source of funding is cash on hand, which totals $502.7 million as of December 31, 2009 based on successful execution of an equity offering in the second quarter of 2009. We also have a $600 million revolving credit facility, which matures in 2012. This facility has available borrowing capacity of $569 million as of December 31, 2009. Effective October 29, 2009, we amended our credit facility agreement, which resulted in improved borrowing flexibility, more liberally defined financial covenants and debt restrictions, and other benefits in exchange for a modest increase in pricing. The combination of cash and the credit facility give us over $1 billion in liquidity entering 2010. As previously noted under Results of Operations Segment Information, at the end of 2009, one of our North American Iron Ore customers did not pay $147.5 million that was due by December 31, 2009 under the terms of its supply agreement. Instead, the customer remitted payment of the full amount on January 4, 2010. As a result, this amount is not included in the $502.7 million of cash on hand at December 31, 2009. We are party to financing arrangements under which we issue guarantees on behalf of certain of our unconsolidated subsidiaries. In the event of non payment, we are obligated to make payment in accordance with the provisions of the guarantee arrangement. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, Amap&aacute; had total project debt outstanding of approximately $530 million and $493 million, respectively, for which we have provided a several guarantee on our 30 percent share. Amap&aacute; is currently in violation of certain operating and financial loan covenants contained in the debt agreements. However, Amap&aacute; and its lenders have agreed to waive these covenants through May 31, 2010 related to the remaining debt outstanding. If Amap&aacute; is unable to either 67 Table of Contents renegotiate the terms of the debt agreements or obtain further extension of the compliance waivers, violation of the operating and financial loan covenants may result in the lenders calling the debt, thereby requiring us to recognize and repay our share of the debt in accordance with the provisions of the guarantee arrangement. Based on our current borrowing capacity and the actions we have taken in response to the global economic crisis to conserve cash, we have adequate liquidity and expect to fund our business obligations from available cash, current operations and borrowing under our current credit facilities. Other sources of funding may include new lines of credit or other financing arrangements. Several credit markets may provide additional capacity should that become necessary. The bank market may provide funding through a term loan or through exercising the $200 million accordion in our credit facility. The risk associated with this market is significant increases in borrowing costs as a result of decreasing capacity. Capacity, as in all debt markets, is a global issue that impacts the private placement market. However, capacity in the bond market has rebounded for investment grade companies. Longer term debt arrangements at current corporate bond rates must be aligned with our longer term capital structure needs. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We have entered into certain agreements under which we have provided guarantees to an unconsolidated entity that are off balance sheet arrangements. In addition, we have operating leases, which are primarily utilized for certain equipment and office space. Aside from this, we do not have any other off balance sheet financing arrangements. Refer to NOTE 18 COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES for additional information regarding our guarantees. Market Risks We are subject to a variety of risks, including those caused by changes in the market value of equity investments, changes in commodity prices, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. We have established policies and procedures to manage such risks; however, certain risks are beyond our control. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk We are subject to changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily as a result of our operations in Australia, which could impact our financial condition. Foreign exchange risk arises from our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates because our reporting currency is the United States dollar. Our Asia Pacific operations receive funds in United States currency for their iron ore and coal sales and incur costs in Australian currency. We use forward exchange contracts, call options, collar options and convertible collar options to hedge our foreign currency exposure for a portion of our sales receipts. The primary objective for the use of these instruments is to reduce exposure to changes in Australian and United States currency exchange rates and to protect against undue adverse movement in these exchange rates. At December 31, 2009, we had $108.5 million of outstanding exchange rate contracts with varying maturity dates ranging from January 2010 to October 2010. A 10 percent increase in the value of the Australian dollar from the month end rate would increase the fair value by approximately $7.4 million, and a 10 percent decrease would reduce the fair value by approximately $5.6 million. We may enter into additional hedging instruments in the near future as needed in order to further hedge our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Our share of pellets produced at the Wabush operation in Canada represented approximately 12 percent of our North American Iron Ore pellet production in 2009. This operation is subject to currency exchange fluctuations between the United States and Canadian currency; however, we do not hedge our exposure to this currency exchange fluctuation. Under the majority ownership of MMX, Amap&aacute;s functional currency was previously determined to be the Brazilian real. The change in control of Amap&aacute; to Anglo in August 2008 resulted in the review of financial, operating and treasury policies of the entity under new management. This, along with efforts to mitigate exposures related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates resulted in the reassessment of the accounting principles related to the determination of Amap&aacute;s functional currency during the fourth quarter of 68 Table of Contents 2008. As a result, effective October 1, 2008, the functional currency of Amap&aacute; was changed from the local currency to the U.S. dollar reporting currency primarily due to changes in the debt structure under which the entity is financed as well as changes in the treasury, risk mitigation and financial reporting policies under which the entitys operations are managed, resulting in the U.S. dollar becoming the currency of the primary economic environment in which the business operates. Interest Rate Risk Interest for borrowings under our credit facility is at a floating rate, dependent in part on the LIBOR rate, which exposes us to the effects of interest rate changes. Based on $200 million in outstanding term loans at December 31, 2009, with a floating interest rate and no corresponding fixed rate swap, a 100 basis point change to the LIBOR rate would result in a change of $2.0 million to interest expense on an annual basis. In October 2007, we entered into a $100 million fixed rate swap to convert a portion of this floating rate into a fixed rate. The interest rate swap terminated in October 2009. Based on the current interest rate environment and the mix of fixed and variable interest rates that apply to our outstanding debt, we have no plans at this time to replace the interest rate swap. Pricing Risks The current global economic crisis has resulted in increasing downward pressure from customers, particularly in China, for a roll back of the 2008 price increases for seaborne iron ore and metallurgical coal in 2009. The 2008 record price increase was driven by high demand for iron ore and coking coal, global steel production at historically high levels, combined with production and logistics constraints for both iron ore and coking coal, resulting in tight supply conditions. With the current global economic crisis, the market in some geographies, including North America, now is characterized by a reduction in steel demand with limited demand for iron ore and coking coal. Reduced demand for iron ore and coking coal has resulted in decreased demand for our products and decreasing prices, resulting in lower revenue levels in 2009 and decreasing margins as a result of decreased production, thereby adversely affecting our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Certain supply agreements with one North American Iron Ore customer provide for supplemental revenue or refunds based on the customers average annual steel pricing at the time the product is consumed in the customers blast furnace. The supplemental pricing is characterized as an embedded derivative, which is finalized based on a future price, and is marked to fair value as a revenue adjustment each reporting period until the pellets are consumed and the amounts are settled. The fair value of the instrument is determined using an income approach based on an estimate of the annual realized price of hot rolled steel at the steelmakers facilities. At December 31, 2009, we had a derivative asset of $63.2 million, representing the fair value of the pricing factors, based upon the amount of unconsumed tons and an estimated average hot band steel price related to the period in which the tons are expected to be consumed in the customers blast furnace at each respective steelmaking facility, subject to final pricing at a future date. This compares with a derivative asset of $76.6 million as of December 31, 2008, based upon the amount of unconsumed tons and the related estimated average hot band steel price. We estimate that a $25 change in the average hot band steel price realized from the December 31, 2009 estimated price recorded would cause the fair value of the derivative instrument to increase or decrease by approximately $13.7 million, thereby impacting our consolidated revenues by the same amount. We have not entered into any hedging programs to mitigate the risk of adverse price fluctuations, nor do we intend to hedge our exposure to such risks in the future; however, certain of our term supply agreements contain price collars, which typically limit the percentage increase or decrease in prices for our products during any given year. Nonperformance and Liquidity Risks The current global economic crisis has adversely affected our business and could impact our financial results. All of our customers have announced curtailments of production, which has adversely affected the demand for our iron ore and coal products. Continuation or worsening of the current economic conditions, a 69 Table of Contents prolonged global, national or regional economic recession or other events that could produce major changes in demand patterns, could have a material adverse effect on our sales, margins, liquidity and profitability. We are not able to predict the impact the current global economic crisis will have on our operations and the industry in general going forward. In addition, consolidations in some of the industries in which our customers operate have created larger customers, some of which are highly leveraged. These factors have caused some customers to be less profitable and increased our exposure to credit risk. A significant adverse change in the financial and or credit position of a customer could require us to assume greater credit risk relating to that customer and could limit our ability to collect receivables. Failure to receive payment from our customers for products that we have delivered could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Our investment policy relating to short term investments is to preserve principal and liquidity while maximizing the short term return through investment of available funds. The carrying value of these investments approximates fair value on the reporting dates. We commonly use AAA rated money market funds for short term investments. All money market funds in which we invest have maintained daily cash redemptions throughout 2009. Volatile Energy and Fuel Costs The volatile cost of energy and supplies is an important issue affecting our production costs, primarily in relation to our iron ore operations. Recent trends have shown that although electric power, natural gas, and oil costs are declining, the direction and magnitude of short term changes are difficult to predict. Our consolidated North American Iron Ore mining ventures consumed approximately 8.4 million MMBtus of natural gas at an average delivered price of $6.63 per MMBtu, and 15.5 million gallons of diesel fuel at an average delivered price of $2.17 per gallon in 2009. Consumption of diesel fuel by our Asia Pacific Operations was approximately 13.3 million gallons for the same period. Our strategy to address increasing energy rates includes improving efficiency in energy usage and utilizing the lowest cost alternative fuels. Through 2009, our North American Iron Ore mining ventures entered into forward contracts for certain commodities, primarily natural gas and diesel fuel, as a hedge against price volatility. Such contracts were in quantities expected to be delivered and used in the production process. As of December 31, 2009, all of our hedge contracts have matured. At the present time we have no specific plans to enter into further hedging activity for 2010 and beyond and do not plan to enter into any new forward contracts for natural gas or diesel fuel in the near term. We will continue to monitor relevant energy markets for risk mitigation opportunities and may make forward purchases or employ other hedging instruments in the future as warranted and deemed appropriate by management. Assuming we do not enter into further hedging activity in the near term, a 10 percent change in natural gas and diesel fuel prices would result in a change of approximately $13.8 million in our annual fuel and energy costs based on expected consumption in 2010. Supply Concentration Risks Many of our mines are dependent on one source for electric power and for natural gas. A significant interruption or change in service or rates from our energy suppliers could materially impact our production costs, margins and profitability. As an example, WEPCO, the sole supplier of electric power to our Tilden and Empire mines, has filed a rate case with the Michigan Public Utilities Commission requesting a 33 percent increase in rates from its rate payers, including our Empire and Tilden mines. If WEPCO is successful in effectuating the 33 percent rate increase currently being proposed, our estimated energy costs at Tilden and Empire in 2010 may be unfavorably impacted by approximately $29 million. Uncertainties of Proposed Tax Reform Legislation In 2010, significant proposed changes to U.S. income tax rules were announced as part of the Obama Administrations 2011 budget proposals. The proposed changes that could have a significant impact include the deferral of certain U.S. income tax deductions related to foreign operations, repeal of LIFO inventory accounting, 70 Table of Contents and elimination of certain current tax incentives for the coal industry, such as percentage depletion. These changes, if enacted, may reduce the competitive position of many U.S. businesses across all industries. The impact of the proposed changes on our business operations and financial statements remains uncertain. However, as the possibility of enactment progresses, we will continue to monitor current developments and assess the potential implications of these tax law changes on our business. Outlook We expect continued stabilization of the macroeconomic environment throughout 2010 and corresponding improvements for steelmaking raw material demand. Annual price settlements for iron ore products in 2010 are not yet concluded. As such, we are using the following assumptions, based on an average of widely published industry analyst estimates, to provide expectations for our iron ore businesses, which use the settlement prices as factors in determining individual customer pricing. Any deviation from the following assumptions will impact average realized price: Increases of 40 percent for world blast furnace iron ore pellet price settlements; Increases of 35 percent and 30 percent, respectively, for Australian lump and fines benchmark price settlements; and, North America hard coking coal prices of $125 per short ton FOB mine Based on the above assumptions, the following table provides a summary of our 2010 guidance for our three reportable business segments, including further detail below: 2010 Outlook Summary North AmericanIron Ore North American Coal Asia PacificIron Ore CurrentOutlook PreviousOutlook CurrentOutlook PreviousOutlook CurrentOutlook PreviousOutlook Sales volume (million tons/tonnes) 25.0 23.0 3.4 3.0 8.5 8.5 Revenue per ton/tonne $ 90 $95 $ 115 $120 $ 80 $85 Cost per ton/tonne $ 65 $70 $ 105 $110 $ 50 $55 North American Iron Ore Outlook For 2010, we are increasing our sales volume expectations to approximately 25 million tons, up from a previous expectation of 23 million tons due to improving demand from customers. We used a number of widely published analyst estimates, which call for an average 40 percent increase in blast furnace pellet pricing settlements, in providing guidance on average revenue per ton in our North American Iron Ore business segment. Applying this assumption, along with a 2010 range for hot band steel pricing of $550 to $650 per ton and no inflation for any other factors contained in our current supply agreements, we expect revenue per ton in North American Iron Ore to be $90 to $95. This expectation also considers the contractual base price changes, lag year adjustments and pricing caps and floors contained in our North American Iron Ore supply agreements. Actual realized average revenue per ton will ultimately depend on sales volume levels and customer mix, blast furnace pellet price settlements, production input costs and or steel prices, all of which are factors in the our formula based pricing for the North American Iron Ore business segment. In addition, the following approximate sensitivities would impact our actual realized price: For every 10 percent change from the above average analyst expectation for blast furnace pellet price settlements, we would expect our average realized revenue per ton in North American Iron Ore to change by $4 to $5. For every $25 change from the estimated 2010 hot rolled steel prices noted above, we would expect our average revenue per ton in North American Iron Ore to change by $0.40. 71 Table of Contents We expect 2010 production of approximately 25 million tons in our North American Iron Ore business segment. At this level of production, 2010 cost per ton is expected to be between $65 and $70 and includes a $5 per ton benefit from increased volume, offset by increased costs related to the acquisition of Wabush, and increases in labor costs as well as maintenance spending that was deferred in 2009. North American Coal Outlook In our North American Coal business segment, we are increasing our sales volume expectations to approximately 3.4 million tons, up from a previous expectation of 3.0 million tons. We begin 2010 with approximately 1.4 million tons of coal under contractual obligation, or approximately 40 percent of our current annual production guidance. This coal is priced at an average of $110 per ton, which includes production earmarks to fulfill obligations for 2009 international contracts ending March 31, 2010. Approximately 30 percent of our 2010 production volume is committed, but not yet priced, as benchmark pricing has not yet settled. We currently expect to sell the remaining 30 percent of uncommitted production on a spot basis throughout the year. In 2010, we expect cost per ton for the year to be approximately $105 to $110, with approximately $14 per ton comprised of depreciation, depletion and amortization. Asia Pacific Iron Ore Outlook Asia Pacific Iron Ore 2010 sales volume is expected to be 8.5 million tonnes, with production of 8.6 million tonnes. With annual price settlements for iron ore in 2010 not yet concluded, as noted above, we used an average industry analyst estimated increase for Australian lump and fines benchmark price settlements of 35 percent and 30 percent, respectively, in providing guidance on average revenue per ton in our Asia Pacific Iron Ore business segment. With these estimates, we expect revenue per ton in Asia Pacific Iron Ore to be $80 to $85. We expect 2010 Asia Pacific Iron Ore costs per tonne of approximately $50 to $55. Outlook for Sonoma and Amap&aacute; We have a 45 percent economic interest in the Sonoma Coal. In 2010, we expect total production of approximately 3.3 million tonnes. Sonoma expects to have sales volume of 3.5 million tonnes with an approximate 65/35 mix between thermal and metallurgical coal respectively. We expect Sonoma average revenue per tonne to be $85 to $90 in 2010. Per tonne costs at Sonoma are expected to be between $80 and $85. We have a 30 percent interest in Amap&aacute;. In 2010, assuming a 30 percent increase in iron ore pricing settlements for iron ore concentrate products, we expect to report an equity loss between $10 million and $20 million for our share of Amap&aacute;s results. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses and Other Expectations Selling, general and administrative expenses are anticipated to be approximately $130 million in 2010. As noted above, we intend to incur costs of approximately $25 to $30 million related to our global exploration efforts. We anticipate an effective tax rate of approximately 24 percent for the year and depreciation and amortization of approximately $275 million. We recently completed our previously announced acquisition of Freewest and, under the terms of the acquisition agreement, issued approximately 4.2 million shares. As a result, we currently have total diluted shares outstanding of approximately 136 million. 2010 Capital Budget and Other Uses of Cash Based on the above guidance, we expect to generate approximately $900 million in cash from operations in 2010. We expect capital expenditures of approximately $200 million, comprised of approximately $110 million in sustaining capital and approximately $90 million earmarked for expansion, including the following projects: $40 million related to installation of a new longwall mining system at the Pinnacle Mine in West Virginia, which is expected to be complete in the fourth quarter of 2010. 72 Table of Contents $15 million related to an upgrade of the Pinnacle Complex preparation plant, which is expected to be complete in the third quarter of 2011. $20 million related to installing a new mine shaft closer to current mining areas at our Oak Grove mine, which is expected to be complete in the first quarter of 2011. Combined, the above projects are anticipated to enable future production from our North American Coal assets to ramp up to 5 million tons annually from an expectation of 3.4 million tons in 2010. Other expected uses of cash in 2010 include approximately: $90 million related to the acquisition of Cliffs partners 73.2 percent interest in Wabush. $30 million related to our investment in Amap&aacute;, comprised of expected losses and capital spending. $70 million related to the reduction of Cliffs debt obligation at Amap&aacute;. $15 million related to renewaFUELs build out of its first commercial scale production facility in Michigan. $10 million related to Cliffs recently acquired chromite project in Ontario, Canada. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Refer to NOTE 1 BUSINESS SUMMARY AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES of the consolidated financial statements for a description of recent accounting pronouncements, including the respective dates of adoption and effects on results of operations and financial condition. Critical Accounting Estimates Managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. Preparation of financial statements requires management to make assumptions, estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses, and the related disclosures of contingencies. Management bases its estimates on various assumptions and historical experience, which are believed to be reasonable; however, due to the inherent nature of estimates, actual results may differ significantly due to changed conditions or assumptions. On a regular basis, management reviews the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are fairly presented in accordance with GAAP. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material. Management believes that the following critical accounting estimates and judgments have a significant impact on our financial statements. Revenue Recognition North American Iron Ore Customer Supply Agreements Most of our North American Iron Ore long term supply agreements are comprised of a base price with annual price adjustment factors, some of which are subject to annual price collars in order to limit the percentage increase or decrease in prices for our iron ore pellets during any given year. The base price is the primary component of the purchase price for each contract. The inflation indexed price adjustment factors are integral to the iron ore supply contracts and vary based on the agreement but typically include adjustments based upon changes in international pellet prices, changes in specified Producers Price Indices including those for all commodities, industrial commodities, energy and steel. The pricing adjustments generally operate in the same manner, with each factor typically comprising a portion of the price adjustment, although the weighting of each factor varies based upon the specific terms of each agreement. In most cases, these adjustment factors have not been finalized at the time our product is sold. In these cases, we estimate the adjustment factors at each reporting period based upon the best third party information available and adjust the estimate to actual when the information has been finalized. With respect to international pellet prices, certain long term supply agreements reference the previous years settled price, in which case, no estimate is required. However, pricing in some of our supply agreements is based upon the international pellet price for the current year. The period during which we must estimate changes in 73 Table of Contents international pellet prices varies year to year based on the timing of final settlement. Historically, contract negotiations were completed and pricing settlements for the upcoming year were reached during the first quarter of the contract year, in which case an estimate was required only for a short period of time and was adjusted to actual prior to reporting first quarter results. This was the case in 2007. As a result, the price adjustment provisions related to international pellet prices were essentially a fixed component of the purchase price for that contract year based upon the timing of settlement. However, several instances have occurred in more recent years, including 2009 and 2008, in which contract negotiations have been extended with settlement occurring later in the year. Information used in developing the estimate prior to settlement includes such factors as previous pricing settlements among other iron ore producers and consumers in the industry, current spot prices, market trends, publications and other industry information. However, based on the timing of settlement, adjustments of our estimate to the actual international pellet price were not material in 2009 or 2008 as a result of having limited shipments to customers with these contract provisions during the first quarter of each respective year. The producer price indices remain a provisional component of the sales price throughout the contract year and are estimated each quarter using publicly available forecasts of such indices. The final indices referenced in certain of the North American Iron Ore supply contracts are typically not published by the U.S. Department of Labor until the second quarter of the subsequent year. As a result, we record an adjustment for the difference between the fourth quarter estimate and the final price in the following year. Historically, such adjustments have not been material as they have represented less than half of 1 percent of North American Iron Ores revenue for each of the three preceding fiscal years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006. In addition, certain supply agreements with one customer include provisions for supplemental revenue or refunds based on the customers average annual steel pricing for the year the product is consumed in the customers blast furnaces. The supplemental pricing is characterized as an embedded derivative, which is finalized based on a future price, and is marked to fair value as a revenue adjustment each reporting period until the pellets are consumed and the amounts are settled. The fair value of the instrument is determined using an income approach based on an estimate of the annual realized price of hot rolled steel at the steelmakers facilities. At December 31, 2009, we had a derivative asset of $63.2 million, representing the fair value of the pricing factors, based upon the amount of unconsumed tons and an estimated average hot band steel price related to the period in which the tons are expected to be consumed in the customers blast furnace at each respective steelmaking facility, subject to final pricing at a future date. This compares with a derivative asset of $76.6 million as of December 31, 2008, based upon the amount of unconsumed tons and the related estimated average hot band steel price. 74 Table of Contents The customers average annual price is not known at the time of sale and the actual price is received on a delayed basis at the end of the year, once the average annual price has been finalized. As a result, we estimate the average price and adjust the estimate to actual in the fourth quarter when the information is provided by the customer at the end of each year. Information used in developing the estimate includes such factors as production and pricing information from the customer, current spot prices, third party analyst forecasts, publications and other industry information. The accuracy of our estimates typically increases as the year progresses based on additional information in the market becoming available and the customers ability to more accurately determine the average price it will realize for the year. The following represents the historical accuracy of our pricing estimates related to the derivative as well as the impact on revenue resulting from the difference between the estimated price and the actual price for each quarter during 2009, 2008 and 2007 prior to receiving final information from the customer for tons consumed during each year: Hot Band Steel Price Estimate vs. Actual 2009 2008 2007 FinalPrice EstimatedPrice Impact onRevenue(in millions) FinalPrice EstimatedPrice Impact onRevenue(in millions) FinalPrice EstimatedPrice Impact onRevenue(in millions) First Quarter $ 528 $ 523 $ 1.2 $ 763 $ 645 $ 24.9 $ 559 $ 568 $ (1.2 ) Second Quarter 528 545 (1.3 ) 763 773 (5.4 ) 559 564 (1.3 ) Third Quarter 528 536 (0.6 ) 763 794 (17.6 ) 559 560 (0.7 ) Fourth Quarter 528 528 763 763 559 559 We estimate that a $25 change in the average hot band steel price realized from the December 31, 2009 estimated price recorded for the unconsumed tons remaining at year end would cause the fair value of the derivative instrument to increase or decrease by approximately $13.7 million, thereby impacting our consolidated revenues by the same amount. Benchmark Pricing Provision Certain supply agreements primarily with our Asia Pacific Iron Ore customers provide for revenue or refunds based on the ultimate settlement of annual international benchmark pricing for lump and fines. As a result of the derivative accounting treatment applied to these provisions, revenue reflects the estimated benchmark price until final settlement occurs. Therefore, to the extent final prices are higher or lower than what was recorded on a provisional basis, an increase or decrease to revenues is recorded each reporting period until the date of final pricing. Accordingly, in times of rising iron ore prices, our revenues benefit from higher prices received for contracts priced at the current benchmark price and also from an increase related to the final pricing of provisionally priced sales pursuant to contracts entered into in prior periods; in times of falling iron ore prices, the opposite occurs. Pricing estimates are primarily based upon reported price settlements in the industry and worldwide pressures in the market. The following represents the historical accuracy of our benchmark price estimates as well as the impact on Product revenues resulting from the difference between the estimated change in price and the actual change in price for each quarter during 2009 and 2008 prior to settlement. In 2007, benchmark prices settled prior to reporting first quarter results; therefore, no estimate was required.

We agreed to final prices with our customers in China during the fourth quarter of 2009. (2) In 2008, Cliffs used 2007 prices as a proxy for 2008 prices prior to settlement. The 2008 benchmark prices referenced in our Asia Pacific Iron Ore contracts settled in the second quarter of 2008. (3) The impact on product revenue resulting from the difference between the estimated price and the actual price was recorded in the second quarter of each respective year. The derivative instrument was settled during the fourth quarter of 2009 upon settlement of the pricing provisions with each of our customers, which reflected pricing decreases of 44 percent and 33 percent for lump and fines, respectively. The settlement was consistent with previously reported price settlements in Japan as well as with our most recent estimates used for reporting revenue throughout the year. As a result, settlement of the pricing provisions referenced in certain of our Asia Pacific Iron Ore customer supply agreements did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2009. Refer to NOTE 3 DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES, for further information. Mineral Reserves We regularly evaluate our economic mineral reserves and update them as required in accordance with SEC Industry Guide 7. The estimated mineral reserves could be affected by future industry conditions, geological conditions and ongoing mine planning. Maintenance of effective production capacity or the mineral reserve could require increases in capital and development expenditures. Generally as mining operations progress, haul lengths and lifts increase. Alternatively, changes in economic conditions, or the expected quality of mineral reserves could decrease capacity or mineral reserves. Technological progress could alleviate such factors, or increase capacity of mineral reserves. We use our mineral reserve estimates combined with our estimated annual production levels, to determine the mine closure dates utilized in recording the fair value liability for asset retirement obligations. Refer to NOTE 11 ENVIRONMENTAL AND MINE CLOSURE OBLIGATIONS, for further information. Since the liability represents the present value of the expected future obligation, a significant change in mineral reserves or mine lives would have a substantial effect on the recorded obligation. We also utilize economic mineral reserves for evaluating potential impairments of mine assets and in determining maximum useful lives utilized to calculate depreciation and amortization of long lived mine assets. Decreases in mineral reserves or mine lives could significantly affect these items. Asset Retirement Obligations and Environmental Remediation Costs The accrued mine closure obligations for our active mining operations provide for contractual and legal obligations associated with the eventual closure of the mining operations. Our obligations are determined based on detailed estimates adjusted for factors that a market participant would consider (i.e., inflation, overhead and profit), which are escalated at an assumed rate of inflation to the estimated closure dates, and then discounted using the current credit adjusted risk free interest rate. The estimate also incorporates incremental increases in the closure cost estimates and changes in estimates of mine lives. The closure date for each location is determined based on the exhaustion date of the remaining iron ore reserves, which is dependent on our estimate of the economically recoverable mineral reserves. The estimated obligations are particularly sensitive to the impact of changes in mine lives given the difference between the inflation and discount rates. Changes in the base estimates of legal and contractual closure costs due to changes in legal or contractual requirements, available technology, inflation, overhead or profit rates would also have a significant impact on the recorded obligations. We have a formal policy for environmental protection and restoration. Our obligations for known environmental matters at active and closed mining operations and other sites have been recognized based on estimates of the cost of investigation and remediation at each site. If the obligation can only be estimated as a 76 Table of Contents range of possible amounts, with no specific amount being more likely, the minimum of the range is accrued. Management reviews its environmental remediation sites quarterly to determine if additional cost adjustments or disclosures are required. The characteristics of environmental remediation obligations, where information concerning the nature and extent of clean up activities is not immediately available, and which are subject to changes in regulatory requirements, result in a significant risk of increase to the obligations as they mature. Expected future expenditures are not discounted to present value unless the amount and timing of the cash disbursements can be reasonably estimated. Potential insurance recoveries are not recognized until realized. Refer to NOTE 11 ENVIRONMENTAL AND MINE CLOSURE OBLIGATIONS, for further information. Income Taxes Our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect managements best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid. We are subject to income taxes in both the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax expense. Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent financial operations. In projecting future taxable income, we begin with historical results adjusted for the results of discontinued operations and changes in accounting policies and incorporate assumptions including the amount of future state, federal and foreign pretax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences, and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions required significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses. In evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide, we consider three years of cumulative operating income (loss). At December 31, 2009, we had a valuation allowance of $89.4 million against our deferred tax assets. Our losses in certain foreign locations in recent periods represented sufficient negative evidence to require a full valuation allowance against certain of our foreign deferred tax assets. We intend to maintain a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets until sufficient positive evidence exists to support the realization of such assets. Changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. Management is not aware of any such changes that would have a material effect on the Companys results of operations, cash flows or financial position. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. Accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements requires that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on technical merits. We recognize tax liabilities in accordance with ASC 740, and we adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of evaluation of new information not previously available. Due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. These differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined. Goodwill and Asset Impairment In assessing the recoverability of our goodwill and other long lived assets, significant assumptions regarding the estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets must be made, including among other things, estimates related to pricing, volume and reserves. The fair value of goodwill is estimated using a discounted cash flow valuation model. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future as a result of changes in strategy or market conditions, we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets in the period such determination was made. 77 Table of Contents We monitor conditions that indicate that the carrying value of an asset or asset group may be impaired. We determine impairment based on the assets ability to generate cash flow greater than its carrying value, utilizing an undiscounted probability weighted analysis. If the analysis indicates the asset is impaired, the carrying value is adjusted to fair value. Fair value can be determined using a market approach, income approach or cost approach. The impairment analysis and fair value determination can result in substantially different outcomes based on critical assumptions and estimates including the quantity and quality of remaining economic ore reserves, future iron ore prices and production costs. We evaluate goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter each year. In addition to the annual impairment test required under U.S. GAAP, we assessed whether events or circumstances occurred that potentially indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable. Based on the assessment performed, we concluded that there were no such events or changes in circumstances during 2009. We determined that the fair value of the reporting units was in excess of our carrying value as of December 31, 2009, and that we did not have any reporting units that were at risk of failing the first step of the goodwill impairment test. Consequently, no goodwill impairment charges were recorded in 2009. Refer to NOTE 1 BUSINESS SUMMARY AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, for further information regarding our policy on asset impairment. Employee Retirement Benefit Obligations We offer defined benefit pension plans, defined contribution pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans, primarily consisting of retiree healthcare benefits, to most employees in North America as part of a total compensation and benefits program. This includes employees of PinnOak, who became employees of the Company through the July 2007 acquisition. We do not have employee retirement benefit obligations at our Asia Pacific Iron Ore operations. Following is a summary of our defined benefit pension and OPEB funding and expense for the years 2007 through 2010: (In Millions) Pension OPEB Funding Expense Funding Expense 2007 32.5 17.4 23.0 4.5 2008 24.9 20.3 19.7 8.6 2009 18.5 50.8 35.7 25.5 2010 (Estimated) 45.9 45.4 (1) 35.2 20.0 (1) (1) Approximately $28.0 million and $11.5 million of the 2010 estimated expense for Pension and OPEB, respectively, relates to previously unrecognized losses reported in OCI. Assumptions used in determining the benefit obligations and the value of plan assets for defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefit plans (primarily retiree healthcare benefits) offered by the Company are evaluated periodically by management. Critical assumptions, such as the discount rate used to measure the benefit obligations, the expected long term rate of return on plan assets, the medical care cost trend, and the rate of compensation increase are reviewed annually. We used a discount rate in 2009 of 5.66 percent, compared with a discount rate of 6.00 percent in 2008. We assumed a compensation increase of 4.0 percent in 2009 and 2008 to determine both our pension and OPEB obligations. Additionally, on December 31, 2008, we adopted the IRS 2009 prescribed mortality tables (separate pre retirement and postretirement) to determine the expected life of our plan participants, replacing the IRS static 2023/2015 tables. Following are sensitivities on estimated 2010 pension and OPEB expense of potential further changes in these key assumptions: Increase in 2010Expense(In Millions) Pension OPEB Decrease discount rate .25 percent $ 1.6 $ 0.8 Decrease return on assets 1 percent 4.7 1.5 Increase medical trend rate 1 percent N/A 5.9 78 Table of Contents Changes in actuarial assumptions, including discount rates, employee retirement rates, mortality, compensation levels, plan asset investment performance, and healthcare costs, are determined by the Company based on analyses of actual and expected factors. Changes in actuarial assumptions and or investment performance of plan assets can have a significant impact on our financial condition due to the magnitude of our retirement obligations. Refer to NOTE 12 PENSIONS AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS in Item 8 for further information.
