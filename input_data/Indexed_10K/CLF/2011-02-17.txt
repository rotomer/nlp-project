Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Overview Cliffs Natural Resources Inc. traces its corporate history back to 1847. Today, we are an international mining and natural resources company. A member of the S&P 500 Index, we are the largest producer of iron ore pellets in North America, a major supplier of direct shipping lump and fines iron ore out of Australia, and a significant producer of metallurgical coal. Our companys operations are organized according to product category and geographic location: North American Iron Ore; North American Coal; Asia Pacific Iron Ore: Asia Pacific Coal; Latin American Iron Ore; Alternative Energies; Ferroalloys; and our Global Exploration Group. Over recent years, we have been executing a strategy designed to achieve scale in the mining industry and focused on serving the worlds largest and fastest growing steel markets. In North America, we operate six iron ore mines in Michigan, Minnesota and Eastern Canada, five metallurgical coal mines located in West Virginia and Alabama and one thermal coal mine located in West Virginia. Our Asia Pacific operations are comprised of two iron ore mining complexes in Western Australia, serving the Asian iron ore markets with direct shipping fines and lump ore, and a 45 percent economic interest in a coking and thermal coal mine located in Queensland, Australia. In Latin America, we have a 30 percent interest in Amap&aacute;, a Brazilian iron ore project, and in Ontario, Canada, we have recently acquired chromite properties. Our operations also include our 95 percent controlling interest in renewaFUEL located in Michigan. In addition, our Global Exploration Group was established in 2009 and is focused on early involvement in exploration activities to identify new world class projects for future development or projects that add significant value to existing operations. The strengthening recovery and improving outlook during 2010 was characterized by increased steel production, higher demand and rising prices. In 2010, global crude steel production, a significant driver of our business, was up approximately 15 percent from 2009 with even greater production increases in some areas, including North America, where the economy grew at an annual rate of nearly three percent during 2010. Steel production in China also remained strong, increasing 10.4 percent from 2009. Consolidated revenues for 2010 increased to $4.7 billion, with net income per diluted share of $7.49. This compares with revenues of $2.3 billion and net income per diluted share of $1.63 in 2009. Based on the signs of marked improvement in customer demand, we increased production at all of our facilities in order to meet increases in demand. Higher sales volumes in North America during the year were attributable to increased sales of iron ore pellets, as well as metallurgical and thermal coal made available through our acquisitions of Wabush and CLCC during the first and third quarters of 2010, respectively. In Asia Pacific, the demand for steelmaking raw materials remained strong throughout 2010 primarily led by demand from China. Earlier in 2010, the worlds largest iron ore producers moved away from the annual international benchmark pricing mechanism referenced in our customer supply agreements, resulting in a shift in the industry toward shorter term pricing arrangements linked to the spot market. We finalized short term pricing arrangements with our Asia Pacific Iron Ore customers and reached final pricing settlements with some of our North American customers through the fourth quarter of 2010 for the 2010 contract year, reflecting significant increases over 2009 prices. Although pricing has been settled with some of our North American customers for 2010, we are still in the process of assessing the impact a change to the historical annual pricing mechanism will have on certain of our larger existing North American Iron Ore customer supply agreements that extend over multiple years, and negotiations are still ongoing with these customers. Results in 2010 reflect strong performance at our operations around the world and improved pricing for our products. Our strong cash flow generation and positive outlook for our business are allowing us to resume our focus on investments in our assets, which will enable us to continue to pursue strategic objectives and enhance our long term operating performance, while also providing us with greater confidence and the ability to increase our cash payouts to shareholders. In May 2010, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly common share dividend from $0.0875 to $0.14 per share. We also continued to strengthen our balance sheet and enhance financial flexibility, including the completion of two public offerings of senior notes in the aggregate principal amount of $400 million and $1 billion in the first and third quarters of 2010, respectively. The net proceeds from 50 Table of Contents these offerings have been used for the repayment of a portion of our debt obligations and have been or may be used for the funding of all or a portion of other strategic transactions and acquisitions, such as the pending acquisition of Consolidated Thompson for which a definitive arrangement agreement to acquire all of its common shares in an all cash transaction was entered into in January 2011 and is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of various closing conditions. Segments We organize our business according to product category and geographic location: North American Iron Ore; North American Coal; Asia Pacific Iron Ore; Asia Pacific Coal; Latin American Iron Ore; Alternative Energies; Ferroalloys and Global Exploration Group. The Asia Pacific Coal, Latin American Iron Ore, Alternative Energies; Ferroalloys and Global Exploration Group operating segments do not meet reportable segment disclosure requirements and therefore are not separately reported. The North American Iron Ore and North American Coal business segments are headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio. Our Asia Pacific headquarters is located in Perth, Australia, and our Latin American headquarters is located in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. In addition, the Alternative Energies, Ferroalloys and Global Exploration Group operating segments are currently managed at our Cleveland, Ohio location. See NOTE 2 SEGMENT REPORTING for further information. Growth Strategy and Strategic Transactions Throughout 2010, we continued to increase our operating scale and presence as an international mining and natural resources company by expanding both geographically and through the minerals we mine and market. The long term outlook remains healthy and we are now focusing on our growth projects with sustained investment in our core businesses. Our growth in North America, as well as acquisitions in minerals outside of iron ore and coal, illustrate the execution of this strategy during 2010. We also expect to achieve growth through early involvement in exploration activities by partnering with junior mining companies, which provide us low cost entry points for potentially significant reserve additions. We continued our strategic growth and transformation to an international mining and natural resources company through the following transactions: Acquisition of remaining interest in Freewest Acquisition of remaining interest in Wabush Acquisition of certain coal operations of privately owned INR Acquisition of Spider We plan to continue to execute our strategy in 2011 through acquisitions such as the pending acquisition of Consolidated Thompson that was announced in January 2011 and is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of various closing conditions. The Freewest, Wabush, CLCC, and Spider acquisitions allowed us to increase production capacity and add additional reserves at our North American Iron Ore and North American Coal businesses, gain additional access to the seaborne iron ore markets serving steelmakers in Europe and Asia, and further broaden our mineral and customer diversification. The agreement to acquire Consolidated Thompson will allow us to continue to build scale within our North American Iron Ore business through the acquired ownership of expandable and exportable steelmaking raw material assets serving international markets. Refer to Recent Developments within Item 1 Business, for additional information regarding each of these strategic transactions. 51 Table of Contents Results of Operations Consolidated 2010 Compared to 2009 The following is a summary of our consolidated results of operations for 2010 compared with 2009: (In Millions) 2010 2009 VarianceFavorable/(Unfavorable) Revenues from product sales and services $ 4,682.2 $ 2,342.0 $ 2,340.2 Cost of goods sold and operating expenses (3,158.7 ) (2,033.1 ) (1,125.6 ) Sales Margin $ 1,523.5 $ 308.9 $ 1,214.6 Sales Margin % 32.5 % 13.2 % 19.3 % Revenue from Product Sales and Services Sales revenue in 2010 increased $2.3 billion, or 100 percent from 2009. The increase in sales revenue was primarily due to higher sales volume and pricing related to our Asia Pacific and North American business operations. Sales volume increased 60 percent at North American Iron Ore in 2010 when compared to 2009, and sales volume for North American Coal was 75 percent higher than the prior year. Improving market conditions throughout 2010 led to increasing production in the North American steel industry, and in turn higher demand for iron ore and metallurgical coal. Higher sales volumes in 2010 were also attributable to increased sales of Wabush pellets, made available through our acquisition of full ownership of the mine during the first quarter of 2010, and increased sales of metallurgical and thermal coal, made available through our acquisition of CLCC during the third quarter of 2010. Higher sales prices also contributed to the increase in our consolidated revenue for the year ended 2010. A recent shift in the industry toward shorter term pricing arrangements that are linked to the spot market and elimination of the annual benchmark system caused us to reassess and, in some cases, renegotiate the terms of certain of our supply agreements, primarily with our North American Iron Ore and Asia Pacific Iron Ore customers. We renegotiated the terms of our supply agreements with our Chinese and Japanese Asia Pacific Iron Ore customers moving to shorter term pricing mechanisms of various durations based on the average daily spot prices, with certain pricing mechanisms that have a duration of up to a quarter. This change was effective in the first quarter of 2010 for our Chinese customers and the second quarter of 2010 for our Japanese customers. The increase in 2010 pricing was on average an 87 percent and 98 percent increase for lump and fines, respectively. In North America, we reached final pricing settlement with some of our North American Iron Ore customers through the fourth quarter of 2010. The increase in 2010 pricing was an average increase of 98 percent over 2009 prices for contracts based on world pellet prices. Although pricing has been settled with some of our North American customers for 2010, for the 2010 contract year, we are still in the process of assessing the impact a change to the historical annual pricing mechanism will have on certain of our larger existing North American Iron Ore customer supply agreements that extend over multiple years, and negotiations are still ongoing with these customers. Refer to Results of Operations Segment Information for additional information regarding the impact of specific factors that impacted revenue during the period. Cost of Goods Sold and Operating Expenses Cost of goods sold and operating expenses was $3.2 billion in 2010, an increase of $1.1 billion, or 55 percent compared with 2009. The increase in 2010 was primarily attributable to higher costs at both our North American and Asia Pacific business operations as a result of higher sales volume, partially offset by lower idle expense at our North American businesses as a result of higher production levels in 2010 to meet increasing customer demand. Costs were also negatively impacted in 2010 by approximately $125.3 million related to unfavorable foreign exchange rates compared with the same period in 2009, $35.3 million of inventory step up 52 Table of Contents and amortization of purchase price adjustments related to the accounting for the acquisition of the remaining interest in Wabush and $143.3 million related to higher royalty expenses, maintenance and repairs spending, energy and labor rates and stripping and recovery costs at our North American Iron Ore operations. Refer to Results of Operations Segment Information for additional information regarding the impact of specific factors that impacted our operating results during the period. Other Operating Income (Expense) Following is a summary of other operating income (expense) for 2010 and 2009: (In Millions) 2010 2009 VarianceFavorable/(Unfavorable) Royalties and management fee revenue $ 12.1 $ 4.8 $ 7.3 Selling, general and administrative expenses (238.0 ) (120.7 ) (117.3 ) Gain on sale of other assets net 3.0 13.2 (10.2 ) Casualty recoveries 3.3 3.3 Miscellaneous net (38.9 ) 24.0 (62.9 ) $ (258.5 ) $ (78.7 ) $ (179.8 ) The increase in selling, general and administrative expense of $117.3 million in 2010 compared with 2009 was primarily due to higher compensation costs of $25.8 million, additional performance royalty expense for our investment in Sonoma of $26.3 million and various other costs totaling $19.7 million. These various other costs consisted of outside professional service costs associated with our current year acquisition activity and on going arbitrations, higher insurance premiums and higher technology costs. We also incurred costs of $16.6 million related to our recently acquired Ferroalloys operating segment that were primarily comprised of feasibility study costs of $11 million, drilling costs of $1.6 million, and other administrative expenses of $1.6 million. In addition, we incurred $13.1 million in 2010 related to our involvement in exploration activities, as our Global Exploration Group focuses on identifying new world class projects for future development or projects that are intended to add significant value to existing operations. The prior year gain on sale of assets of $13.2 million primarily related to the Asia Pacific Iron Ore sale of its 50 percent interest in the Irvine Island iron ore project to its joint venture partner, Pluton Resources Limited (Pluton Resources). The consideration received consisted of a cash payment of approximately $5 million and the issuance of 19.4 million shares in Pluton Resources, all of which resulted in recognition of a gain on sale amounting to $12.1 million. Miscellaneous net losses of $38.9 million in 2010 primarily relate to foreign exchange losses on our Australian bank accounts that are denominated in U.S. dollars and short term intercompany loans that are denominated in Australian dollars, as a result of the increase in exchange rates during the current year from A$0.90 at December 31, 2009 to A$1.02 at December 31, 2010. In the prior year, we had gains on foreign currency transactions related to loans denominated in Australian dollars, as a result of the increase in exchange rates during the period from A$0.69 at December 31, 2008 to A$0.90 at December 31, 2009. 53 Table of Contents Other income (expense) Following is a summary of other income (expense) for 2010 and 2009: (In Millions) 2010 2009 VarianceFavorable/(Unfavorable) Gain on acquisition of controlling interest $ 40.7 $ $ 40.7 Changes in fair value of foreign currency contracts, net 39.8 85.7 (45.9 ) Interest income 9.9 10.8 (0.9 ) Interest expense (69.7 ) (39.0 ) (30.7 ) Impairment of securities (1.2 ) (1.2 ) Other non operating income 13.7 2.9 10.8 $ 33.2 $ 60.4 $ (27.2 ) As a result of acquiring the remaining ownership interests in Freewest and Wabush during the first quarter of 2010, our 2010 results were impacted by realized gains of $38.6 million primarily related to the increase in fair value of our previous ownership interest in each investment held prior to the business acquisition. The fair value of our previous 12.4 percent interest in Freewest was $27.4 million on January 27, 2010, the date of acquisition, resulting in a gain of $13.6 million being recognized in 2010. The fair value of our previous 26.8 percent equity interest in Wabush was $38.0 million on February 1, 2010, resulting in a gain of $25.0 million also being recognized in 2010. Refer to NOTE 5 ACQUISITIONS AND OTHER INVESTMENTS for further information. The impact of changes in the fair value of our foreign currency contracts held as economic hedges on the Statement of Consolidated Operations is due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates during the year. The favorable changes in fair value of our foreign currency contracts of $39.8 million in 2010 relates to the Australian to U.S. dollar spot rate of A$1.02 as of December 31, 2010, which increased from the Australian to U.S. dollar spot rate of A$0.90 as of December 31, 2009. The changes in the spot rates are correlated to the appreciation of the Australian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar during the year. In addition, we entered into additional foreign exchange contracts during 2010 resulting in the notional amount of outstanding contracts in our foreign exchange hedge book increasing from $108.5 million at December 31, 2009 to $230.0 million at December 31, 2010. During 2010, approximately $228.5 million of outstanding contracts matured, resulting in a cumulative net realized gain of $12.2 million since inception of the contracts. The following table represents our foreign currency derivative contract position for contracts held as economic hedges as of December 31, 2010: ($ in Millions) Contract Maturity Notional Amount Weighted AverageExchange Rate Spot Rate Fair Value Contract Portfolio (excluding AUD Call Options) (1): Contracts expiring in the next 12 months $ 205.0 0.86 1.02 $ 32.3 Contracts expiring in the next 13 to 24 months 15.0 0.86 1.02 2.0 Total $ 220.0 0.86 1.02 $ 34.3 AUD Call Options (2) Contracts expiring in the next 12 months $ 10.0 0.85 1.02 $ 1.9 Total $ 10.0 0.85 1.02 $ 1.9 Total Hedge Contract Portfolio $ 230.0 $ 36.2 (1) Includes collar options and convertible collar options. (2) AUD call options are excluded from the weighted average exchange rate used for the remainder of the contract portfolio due to the unlimited downside participation associated with these instruments. 54 Table of Contents The increase in interest expense in 2010 compared with 2009 is attributable to the completion of two public offerings of senior notes during the year. In the first quarter of 2010, we completed a $400 million public offering of 10 year senior notes at a 5.90 percent fixed interest rate. In addition, a $1 billion public offering of senior notes was completed in the third quarter of 2010 consisting of two tranches; a $500 million 10 year tranche at a 4.80 percent fixed interest rate and a $500 million 30 year tranche at a 6.25 percent fixed interest rate. See NOTE 8 DEBT AND CREDIT FACILITIES for further information. Income Taxes Our tax rate is affected by recurring items, such as depletion and tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and the relative amount of income we earn in our various jurisdictions. It is also affected by discrete items that may occur in any given year, but are not consistent from year to year. The following represents a summary of our tax provision and corresponding effective rates for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009: (In Millions) 2010 2009 Income tax expense $ 292.0 $ 20.8 Effective tax rate 22.5 % 7.2 % A reconciliation of the statutory tax rate to the effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 is as follows: 2010 2009 U.S. statutory rate 35.0 % 35.0 % Increases/(Decreases) due to: Percentage depletion (7.9 ) (11.6 ) Impact of foreign operations (6.9 ) (9.1 ) Valuation allowance 6.6 11.9 Other items net 1.0 0.4 Effective income tax rate before discrete items 27.8 26.6 Discrete items (5.3 ) (19.4 ) Effective income tax rate 22.5 % 7.2 % Our tax provision for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 was $292.0 million, for a 22.5 percent effective tax rate, and $20.8 million, for a 7.2 percent effective tax rate, respectively. The difference in the effective tax rate for 2010 compared with 2009 is primarily a result of discrete items that occurred during the year, as discussed below. The PPACA and the Reconciliation Act were signed into law in March 2010. As a result of these two acts, tax benefits available to employers that receive the Medicare Part D subsidy are reduced beginning in years ending after December 31, 2012. The income tax effect related to the acts for year ended 2010 was an increase to expense, recorded discretely, of $16.1 million, representing approximately 1.2 percent of the effective tax rate. The amount recorded is related to the postretirement prescription drug benefits computed after the elimination of the deduction for the Medicare Part D subsidy beginning in taxable years ending after December 31, 2012. Discrete items other than the expense resulting from the acts signed into law in March 2010, related legal entity restructuring, prior year U.S. and foreign provision benefits recognized in 2010 and interest expense related to unrecognized tax benefits. Discrete items for 2009 related to the benefits associated with the settlement of tax audits and filings for prior years. The valuation allowance of $172.7 million against certain deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2010 relates primarily to ordinary losses of certain foreign operations. See NOTE 13 INCOME TAXES for further information. 55 Table of Contents Equity Income (Loss) in Ventures Equity income (loss) in ventures is primarily comprised of our share of the results from Amap&aacute; and AusQuest, for which we have a 30 percent ownership interest in each. The equity income in ventures for the year ended December 31, 2010 of $13.5 million primarily represents our share of the operating results of our equity method investment in Amap&aacute;. Such results consisted of income of $17.2 million. During 2010, we recorded income of $12.9 million related to the reversal of certain accruals. In addition, during the second quarter of 2010, Amap&aacute; repaid its total project debt outstanding, for which we provided a several guarantee on our 30 percent share. Upon repayment of the project debt, our obligations under the provisions of the guarantee arrangement were relieved, and our estimate of the aggregate fair value of the outstanding guarantee of $6.7 million was reversed through Equity income (loss) from ventures for year ended December 31, 2010. Apart from the reversal of the debt guarantee and the reversal of certain accruals, our investment in Amap&aacute; realized nearly break even operating results. This compares with equity losses related to Amap&aacute; of $62.2 million in 2009. The negative operating results in the prior year were primarily due to slower than anticipated ramp up of operations and product yields. 2009 Compared to 2008 The following is a summary of our consolidated results of operations for 2009 compared with 2008: (In Millions) 2009 2008 VarianceFavorable/(Unfavorable) Revenues from product sales and services $ 2,342.0 $ 3,609.1 $ (1,267.1 ) Cost of goods sold and operating expenses (2,033.1 ) (2,449.4 ) 416.3 Sales Margin $ 308.9 $ 1,159.7 $ (850.8 ) Sales Margin % 13.2 % 32.1 % 18.9 % Revenue from Product Sales and Services Sales revenue in 2009 declined $1.3 billion, or 35 percent from 2008. The decrease in sales revenue was primarily due to lower sales volumes related to our North American business operations as a result of the volatility and uncertainty in global markets throughout much of 2009, which led to production slowdowns in the North American steel industry, and in turn reduced demand for iron ore and metallurgical coal. In addition, the global economic crisis resulted in a great deal of pressure from customers, particularly in China, for a roll back of the 2008 price increases for seaborne iron ore and metallurgical coal in 2009. We experienced a reduction in 2009 pricing at each of our business units, thereby contributing to lower revenue levels during the year. As a result of the deteriorating market conditions that continued throughout much of 2009, revenues related to our North American Iron Ore and Coal segments decreased approximately $921.8 million and $139.1 million, respectively, compared with 2008. Based upon the economic downturn and the resulting impact on demand, sales volumes in 2009 declined approximately 28 percent at North American Iron Ore. North American Coal experienced a decrease in volume of 42 percent year over year. Revenues in 2009 were also negatively impacted by base rate adjustments related to reductions in World Pellet Pricing and producer price indices referenced in certain of our North American Iron Ore contracts as well as the estimated decline in average annual hot band steel pricing for one of our North American Iron Ore customers. Revenues from our Asia Pacific operations were negatively impacted by the decline in 2009 iron ore prices caused by lower demand for steel worldwide. As a result, revenues at Asia Pacific Iron Ore in 2009 declined 30 percent from 2008. Pricing decreases in 2009 contrasted with settled price increases in 2008 of 97 percent and 80 percent for lump and fines, respectively. The overall decline in 2009 revenue at Asia Pacific Iron Ore was partially offset by positive sales mix and a 9 percent increase in sales volume as a result of increased demand from China. Refer to Results of Operations Segment Information for additional information regarding the impact of specific factors that impacted revenue during the period. 56 Table of Contents Cost of Goods Sold and Operating Expenses Cost of goods sold was $2.0 billion in 2009, a decrease of $416.3 million, or 17 percent compared with 2008. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower costs at our North American business operations as a result of declines in sales volume and cost reductions during the year related to ongoing cash conservation efforts that were reinforced in light of the economic environment. Costs were also favorably impacted in 2009 by approximately $35.2 million related to favorable foreign exchange rates compared with 2008. In addition, year to date fuel and energy costs in our North American and Asia Pacific iron ore operations for 2009 decreased approximately $71.6 million from 2008. The overall decrease in cost of goods in 2009 was partially offset by idle expense of approximately $159.6 million related to production curtailments in North America throughout the year. In addition, costs in 2009 reflected the impact of the Asia Pacific Iron Ore and United Taconite step acquisitions, which occurred in the second half of 2008. Refer to Results of Operations Segment Information for additional information regarding the impact of specific factors that impacted our operating results during the period. Other Operating Income (Expense) Following is a summary of other operating income (expense) for 2009 and 2008: (In Millions) 2009 2008 VarianceFavorable/(Unfavorable) Royalties and management fee revenue $ 4.8 $ 21.7 $ (16.9 ) Selling, general and administrative expenses (120.7 ) (188.6 ) 67.9 Terminated acquisition costs (90.1 ) 90.1 Gain on sale of other assets net 13.2 22.8 (9.6 ) Casualty recoveries 10.5 (10.5 ) Miscellaneous net 24.0 2.9 21.1 $ (78.7 ) $ (220.8 ) $ 142.1 The decrease in royalties and management fee revenue of $16.9 million in 2009 compared with 2008 was primarily attributable to lower production at our iron ore mines and reduced sales prices. Additionally, we received all of Tildens production in 2009. Therefore, the remaining venture partner at Tilden was not required to pay us the resulting royalty for its share of tons mined and produced from the ore reserves owned by Cliffs. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expense of $67.9 million in 2009 compared with 2008 was primarily the result of an increased focus on cost reduction efforts due to the economic conditions during the year. In particular, outside professional service and legal fees associated with the expansion of our business declined approximately $38.4 million during 2009. Additionally, employment costs were reduced by $26.2 million primarily as a result of lower share based and incentive compensation. Expenses at our Asia Pacific Iron Ore segment were $6.2 million higher in 2009 when compared with 2008, reflecting an increased focus on marketing activities due to the weakening economic climate, as well as higher employment costs and outside professional services to support business development and improvement efforts. In addition, selling, general and administrative expense in 2008 was impacted by a charge in the first quarter of approximately $6.8 million in connection with a legal judgment. On November 17, 2008, we announced the termination of the definitive merger agreement with Alpha Natural Resources, Inc., under which we would have acquired all outstanding shares of Alpha. Both our Board of Directors and Alphas Board of Directors made the decision after considering various issues, including the macroeconomic environment, uncertainty in the steel industry, shareholder dynamics, and the risks and costs of potential litigation. Considering these issues, each board determined that termination of the merger agreement was in the best interest of its equity holders. Under the terms of the settlement agreement, we were required to 57 Table of Contents pay Alpha a $70 million termination fee, which was financed through our revolving credit facility and paid in November 2008. As a result, $90.1 million in termination fees and associated acquisition costs were expensed in the fourth quarter of 2008 upon termination of the definitive merger agreement. In October 2009, Asia Pacific Iron Ore completed the sale of its 50 percent interest in the Irvine Island iron ore project to its joint venture partner, Pluton Resources. The consideration received consisted of a cash payment of approximately $5 million and the issuance of 19.4 million shares in Pluton Resources, all of which resulted in recognition of a gain on sale amounting to $12.1 million. Our interest in Pluton Resources was approximately 12.5 percent at December 31, 2009. The gain on sale of assets of $22.8 million in 2008 primarily related to the sale of Cliffs Synfuel Corp. (Synfuel), which was completed in June 2008. Casualty recoveries in 2008 were primarily attributable to a $9.2 million insurance recovery related to a 2006 electrical explosion at our United Taconite facility. Miscellaneous net of $24.0 million in 2009 was primarily attributable to exchange rate gains on foreign currency transactions related to loans denominated in Australian dollars, as a result of the increase in exchange rates during the period from A$0.69 at December 31, 2008 to A$0.90 at December 31, 2009. Other income (expense) Following is a summary of other income (expense) for 2009 and 2008: (In Millions) 2009 2008 VarianceFavorable/(Unfavorable) Changes in fair value of foreign currency contracts, net $ 85.7 $ (188.2 ) $ 273.9 Interest income 10.8 26.2 (15.4 ) Interest expense (39.0 ) (39.8 ) 0.8 Impairment of securities (25.1 ) 25.1 Other non operating income 2.9 4.3 (1.4 ) $ 60.4 $ (222.6 ) $ 283.0 The impact of changes in the fair value of our foreign currency contracts on the Statement of Consolidated Operations was due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates during the year. The favorable unrealized mark to market fluctuation of $85.7 million in 2009 related to the Australian to U.S. dollar spot rate of A$0.90 as of December 31, 2009, which increased considerably from the Australian to U.S. dollar spot rate of A$0.69 as of December 31, 2008. The changes in the spot rates were correlated to the appreciation of the Australian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar during the year. During 2009, approximately $780 million of outstanding contracts matured or were sold, resulting in a cumulative net realized loss of $37.0 million since inception of the contracts. The following table represents our foreign currency derivative contract position as of December 31, 2009: ($ in Millions) Contract Maturity Notional Amount Weighted AverageExchange Rate Spot Rate Fair Value Contract Portfolio (excluding AUD Call Options) (1): Contracts expiring in the next 12 months $ 33.0 0.82 0.90 $ 0.9 Total $ 33.0 0.82 0.90 $ 0.9 AUD Call Options (2) Contracts expiring in the next 12 months $ 75.5 0.88 0.90 $ 3.3 Total $ 75.5 0.88 0.90 $ 3.3 Total Hedge Contract Portfolio $ 108.5 $ 4.2 (1) Includes collar options and convertible collar options. 58 Table of Contents (2) AUD call options are excluded from the weighted average exchange rate used for the remainder of the contract portfolio due to the unlimited downside participation associated with these instruments. The decrease in interest income in 2009 compared with 2008 was attributable to a decline in interest bearing cash and investments held during the period coupled with lower overall average returns. Investment returns in 2009 were lower as a result of market declines. The slight decrease in interest expense in 2009 was primarily due to lower average interest rates on total debt outstanding of 4.48 percent at December 31, 2009, compared with 5.85 percent at December 31, 2008, partially offset by an increase in the period outstanding related to borrowings under our senior notes. Higher interest expense in 2008 also reflected interest accretion for the deferred payment related to the PinnOak acquisition. See NOTE 8 DEBT AND CREDIT FACILITIES for further information. In 2008, we recorded impairment charges of $25.1 million related to declines in the fair value of our available for sale securities which we concluded were other than temporary. As of December 31, 2008, our investments in PolyMet and Golden West had fair values totaling $6.2 million and $4.7 million, respectively, compared with a cost of $14.2 million and $21.8 million, respectively. The severity of the impairments in relation to the carrying amounts of the individual investments was consistent with the macroeconomic market and industry developments during 2008. However, we evaluated the near term prospects of the issuers in relation to the severity and rapid decline in the fair value of each of these investments, and based upon that evaluation, we could not reasonably assert that the impairment period would be temporary primarily as a result of the global economic crisis and the corresponding uncertainties in the market. Income Taxes Our tax rate is affected by recurring items, such as depletion and tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and the relative amount of income we earn in our various jurisdictions. It is also affected by discrete items that may occur in any given year, but are not consistent from year to year. The following represents a summary of our tax provision and corresponding effective rates for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008: (In Millions) 2009 2008 Income tax expense $ 20.8 $ 144.2 Effective tax rate 7.2 % 20.1 % Our tax provision for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 was $20.8 million and $144.2 million, respectively. The $123.4 million decrease in income tax expense and 12.9 percent decrease in the effective tax rate were primarily attributable to lower pre tax book income and increased benefits from certain discrete items, partially offset by increased valuation allowances. Discrete items in 2009 related to benefits associated with the settlement of tax audits and filings for prior years. We had a $39.0 million increase in the valuation allowance of certain deferred tax assets. Of this amount, $24.5 million related to certain foreign operating losses and $14.5 million related to certain foreign assets where tax basis exceeded book basis. A reconciliation of the statutory tax rate to the effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 is as follows: 2009 2008 U.S. statutory rate 35.0 % 35.0 % Increases/(Decreases) due to: Percentage depletion (11.6 ) (11.9 ) Impact of foreign operations (9.1 ) (2.1 ) Valuation allowance 11.9 1.6 Other items net 0.4 (0.6 ) Effective income tax rate before discrete items 26.6 22.0 Discrete items (19.4 ) (1.9 ) Effective income tax rate 7.2 % 20.1 % See NOTE 13 INCOME TAXES for further information. 59 Table of Contents Equity Loss in Ventures Equity loss in ventures is primarily comprised of our share of the results from Amap&aacute; and AusQuest, for which we have a 30 percent ownership interest in each. The equity loss in ventures for the year ended December 31, 2009 of $65.5 million primarily represented our share of the operating results of our equity method investment in Amap&aacute;. Such results consisted of operating losses of $62.2 million. Results in 2008 mainly consisted of operating losses of $45.6 million, partially offset by foreign currency hedge gains of $10.5 million. The negative operating results in each year were primarily due to slower than anticipated ramp up of operations and product yields. Our equity share of the losses for Amap&aacute; was also higher in 2009 due to a write down in the value of inventory, asset impairment charges, as well as changes in foreign currency exchange rates during 2009 and the resulting impact on project debt denominated in Brazilian real. Noncontrolling Interest Noncontrolling interest in consolidated income was a loss of $0.8 million in 2009 compared with income of $21.2 million in 2008. The change was primarily attributable to the acquisition of the remaining 19.6 percent interest in Asia Pacific Iron Ore (formerly known as Portman Limited) during 2008, thereby eliminating the related noncontrolling interests in 2009. Results of Operations Segment Information Our company is organized and managed according to product category and geographic location. Segment information reflects our strategic business units, which are organized to meet customer requirements and global competition. We evaluate segment performance based on sales margin, defined as revenues less cost of goods sold identifiable to each segment. This measure of operating performance is an effective measurement as we focus on reducing production costs throughout the Company. 2010 Compared to 2009 North American Iron Ore Following is a summary of North American Iron Ore results for 2010 and 2009: (In Millions) Change due to 2010 2009 Rate Volume Idle cost/Productionvolumevariance Freight andreimbursements Totalchange Revenues from product sales and services $ 2,921.4 $ 1,447.8 $ 549.0 $ 794.9 $ $ 129.7 $ 1,473.6 Cost of goods sold and operating expense (1,999.4 ) (1,172.3 ) (244.4 ) (534.9 ) 81.9 (129.7 ) (827.1 ) Sales margin $ 922.0 $ 275.5 $ 304.6 $ 260.0 $ 81.9 $ $ 646.5 Sales tons 26.2 16.4 Production tons (1): Total 32.0 19.6 Cliffs share of total 25.4 17.1 (2) (1) Long tons of pellets (2,240 pounds). (2) Includes 1.6 million tons allocated to Cliffs due to re nominations by Cliffs partners at Tilden and Wabush. Sales margin for North American Iron Ore was $922.0 million in 2010, compared with a sales margin of $275.5 million in 2009. The improvement over 2009 is attributable to an increase in revenue of $1.5 billion, partially offset by an increase in cost of goods sold and operating expenses of $827.1 million. The increase in revenue is a result of improvements in both rate and sales volumes, which caused revenue to increase $549.0 60 Table of Contents million and $794.9 million, respectively, over 2009 results. Sales volumes for 2010 increased 60 percent at North American Iron Ore when compared to the prior year primarily due to an overall increase in customer demand as a result of improving market conditions during 2010 and incremental sales of 1.2 million tons of Wabush pellets that were made available through our acquisition of the remaining 73.2 percent interest in February 2010. The increase in pricing in 2010 is attributable to higher demand in 2010 as the market continued to strengthen. There has been a recent shift in the industry toward shorter term pricing arrangements that are linked to the spot market and elimination of the annual world pellet pricing mechanism referenced in certain of our supply contracts. We reached final pricing settlement with some of our North American Iron Ore customers through the fourth quarter of 2010 for the 2010 contract year, reflecting an average increase of 98 percent over 2009 prices for contracts based on world pellet prices. This compares to the prior year settled price decrease of 48.3 percent below 2008 prices. Although pricing has been settled with some of our North American customers for 2010, we are still in the process of assessing the impact a change to the historical annual pricing mechanism will have on certain of our larger existing North American Iron Ore customer supply agreements that extend over multiple years, and negotiations are still ongoing with these customers. In addition, 2010 sales rates were positively impacted by a favorable sales mix of seaborne shipments at higher average sales rates due to the incremental tonnage available through our acquisition of the remaining interest in Wabush. Revenue in 2010 also included $120.2 million related to supplemental contract payments compared with $22.2 million in 2009. The overall increase between years relates to the estimated rise in average annual hot band steel pricing for one of our North American Iron Ore customers. The increase in revenue was partially offset by lower prices realized for sales under one of our customer supply agreements that is currently in arbitration. Given the early stage of the arbitration, as discussed below, and the uncertainty regarding its outcome as of December 31, 2010, the prices realized for sales under this contract in 2010 do not reflect the estimated increase in 2010 iron ore pricing. Throughout 2010, we have been party to two arbitration demands that were filed in relation to the pricing provisions referenced in the supply contracts for two of our largest customers. One arbitration relates to amendments of the supply contracts made necessary by changes in the world pellet pricing mechanism in 2010, specifically the move away from annual benchmark prices. In December 2010, a binding decision was reached by the arbitration panel that redefined world prices for blast furnace pellets, a factor used in determining annual price increases or decreases under the agreement. Although we received a $129 million settlement payment from the customer in January 2011, the customer is maintaining a court application to vacate the arbitration award. We are vigorously contesting the customers motion to vacate the award and we have counterclaimed to confirm the award. Currently, invoices and revenue are calculated pursuant to the arbitration panels decision. The other arbitration relates to a price reopener provision in the customer supply agreement and whether we are entitled to such a reopener for 2010. We are currently awaiting a ruling from the arbitration panel; however, we expect that we may collect approximately $300 million related to this arbitration in 2011. The outcome of such arbitrations may result in changes to the pricing mechanisms used and therefore, could impact sales prices realized in current and future periods. Refer to Part I Item 3. Legal Proceedings, for additional information. In 2010 and 2009, certain customers purchased and paid for approximately 2.4 million tons and 0.9 million tons of pellets, respectively, in order to meet minimum contractual purchase requirements for each year under the terms of take or pay contracts. The inventory was stored at our facilities in upper lakes stockpiles. At the request of the customers, the ore was not shipped, resulting in deferred revenue at December 31, 2010 and 2009 of $155.3 million and $81.9 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2010, all of the 0.9 million tons that were deferred at the end of 2009 were delivered, resulting in the related revenue being recognized in 2010. Cost of goods sold and operating expense in 2010 increased $827.1 million or 71 percent from the prior year primarily due to higher sales volumes as noted above, which resulted in cost increases of approximately $534.9 million. In addition, cost of goods sold and operating expenses were unfavorably impacted during the current year by $244.4 million due to higher cost rates. The increase was attributable to higher maintenance and repairs costs of $57.6 million, higher energy and labor costs of $49.0 million, unfavorable exchange rate variances of $44.0 million, higher stripping and recovery costs of $20.2 million, and higher royalty expenses of $16.5 million. Costs also increased during 2010 due to $35.3 million of inventory step up and amortization of purchase price adjustments related to our acquisition of Wabush. Approximately $10.7 of the inventory step up was recognized 61 Table of Contents in the first quarter of 2010 and was associated with the pelletizing and sale of acquired in process inventory that occurred during that period in conjunction with our acquisition of the remaining interest in Wabush. As such, the expense will not be recurring at this level in the future. The overall increase in cost was partially offset by $81.9 million related to lower idle expense due to increased production as a result of improving market conditions in the current year. Production Based on signs of marked improvements in customer demand that continued throughout 2010, we increased production at all of our facilities and called employees back to work in order to ensure that we were positioned to meet increases in demand. During 2010, Empire, Tilden and United Taconite were operating at full capacity. Northshore was operating three of its furnaces, with the fourth restarted in September. Wabush was operating two of its three furnaces with Cliffs taking all of the tonnage since acquiring full ownership on February 1, 2010. The shutdown at Hibbing, which began in May 2009, ended April 1, 2010. Prior year production levels were impacted by production curtailments and temporary facility shutdowns, which were executed in response to the economic downturn and production slowdowns in the steel industry. North American Coal Following is a summary of North American Coal results for 2010 and 2009: (In Millions, except tonnage) Change due to 2010 (1) 2009 Rate Volume CLCCacquisition Idle cost/Productionvolumevariance Freight andreimbursements Totalchange Revenues from product sales and services $ 438.2 $ 207.2 $ 82.9 $ 31.7 $ 111.7 $ $ 4.7 $ 231.0 Cost of goods sold and operating expenses (466.8 ) (279.1 ) (57.1 ) (36.2 ) (98.3 ) 8.6 (4.7 ) (187.7 ) Sales margin $ (28.6 ) $ (71.9 ) $ 25.8 $ (4.5 ) $ 13.4 $ 8.6 $ $ 43.3 Sales tons (in thousands) 3,284 1,874 Production tons (in thousands) (2) 3,245 1,741 (1) Results include CLCC since the July 30, 2010 acquistion date. (2) Tons are short tons (2,000 pounds). We reported a sales margin loss for North American Coal of $28.6 million and $71.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Revenue for 2010 was $231.0 million higher than 2009 due to increases in both sales volume and prices. North American Coal sold 3.3 million tons during 2010 compared with 1.9 million tons during 2009, as a result of improving market conditions in 2010 and 1,072 thousand tons of additional sales since the third quarter 2010 acquisition of CLCC. The increase in North American Coal sales volume resulted in an increase in revenues of $143.4 million over the prior year, of which $111.7 million was related to the acquisition of CLCC. Sales prices were also higher during 2010, reflecting increases in steel demand and the associated raw material prices. The increase in our 2010 contract rates caused revenue for 2010 to increase $82.9 million over the prior year. Cost of goods sold and operating expense in 2010 increased $187.7 million or 67 percent from the prior year primarily due to the significant increase in sales volume, which resulted in a cost increase of approximately $134.5 million. Of this amount, $98.3 million was attributable to the acquisition of CLCC. The increase in cost of goods sold and operating expenses during the year was also a result of increased costs primarily due to a lower of cost or market inventory charge of $26.1 million taken at our Pinnacle and Oak Grove mines as a result of geological and operational issues, higher depreciation and amortization of $11.7 million, higher royalties and 62 Table of Contents severance taxes of $8.2 million, and purchases of $6.6 million of third party coal at our Pinnacle mine to meet shipping requirements. Despite the production issues encountered at our legacy coal mines throughout 2010, the cost increase was partially offset by a reduction in idle expense of $8.6 million, attributable to increased production at our mines as a result of improving market conditions in the current year. Idle costs in the first half of 2009 were significantly higher due to production curtailments, delays associated with mine development issues at Oak Grove as a result of unplanned geological conditions. Production We increased production levels in 2010 in response to improving market conditions and increases in customer demand. The increase over the prior year was primarily related to production curtailments that occurred in 2009 to match declining market conditions as well as delays in developing the longwall panel at Oak Grove during the first quarter of 2009. In addition, the increase in production levels over the prior year was a direct result of the acquisition of CLCC during the third quarter of 2010. The overall increase in current year production at our Pinnacle Complex was partially offset by a decrease in production at Green Ridge due to the planned closure of Green Ridge No. 1 in February 2010 as well as the idling of Green Ridge No. 2 during 2010. Production recommenced at the Green Ridge No. 2 mine in January 2011. Despite the increase in production over the prior year, our Pinnacle mine was negatively impacted during 2010 by adverse geological conditions and delayed longwall operations, resulting in force majeures being declared on customer shipments during the third and fourth quarters of 2010. The force majeure declared in the fourth quarter was due to roof falls at the Pinnacle mine and was lifted in January 2011 with the restarting of the longwall. Asia Pacific Iron Ore Following is a summary of Asia Pacific Iron Ore results for 2010 and 2009: (In Millions) Change due to 2010 2009 Rate Volume ExchangeRate Totalchange Revenues from product sales and services $ 1,123.9 $ 542.1 $ 517.7 $ 72.3 $ (8.2 ) $ 581.8 Cost of goods sold and operating expenses (557.7 ) (454.9 ) 19.1 (40.6 ) (81.3 ) (102.8 ) Sales margin $ 566.2 $ 87.2 $ 536.8 $ 31.7 $ (89.5 ) $ 479.0 Sales metric tons 9.3 8.5 Production metric tons (1) 9.3 8.3 (1) Metric tons (2,205 pounds). Cockatoo production reflects our 50 percent share. Sales margin for Asia Pacific Iron Ore increased to $566.2 million in 2010 compared with $87.2 million in 2009. Revenue increased $581.8 million in 2010 compared with the prior year primarily as a result of higher prices for lump and fines, increased sales volume and favorable sales mix. During the first quarter of 2010, the worlds largest iron ore producers moved away from the annual international benchmark pricing mechanism referenced in our customer supply agreements, resulting in a shift in the industry toward shorter term pricing arrangements linked to the spot market. As a result, we renegotiated the terms of our supply agreements with our Chinese and Japanese Asia Pacific Iron Ore customers moving to shorter term pricing mechanisms of various durations based on the average daily spot prices, with certain pricing mechanisms that have a duration of up to a quarter. This change was effective in the first quarter of 2010 for our Chinese customers and the second quarter of 2010 for our Japanese customers. The increase in 2010 pricing over 2009 was on average an 87 percent and 98 percent increase for lump and fines, respectively. This compares to settled price decreases in the prior year of 44 percent and 33 percent for lump and fines, respectively. Pricing settlements in the current year reflect the increase in steel demand and spot prices for iron ore and are based upon quarterly index pricing mechanisms. Sales volume reached 9.3 million metric tons in 2010 compared with 8.5 million metric tons for the prior year, resulting in an increase in revenue of $72.3 million. In addition, revenue was favorably impacted by a positive sales mix variance of $4.0 million primarily due to the cessation of low grade fines sales in 2010. 63 Table of Contents Cost of goods sold and operating expenses in 2010 increased $102.8 million compared to 2009 primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange rate variances of $81.3 million coupled with a nine percent increase in sales volume, which resulted in cost increases of approximately $40.6 million. The overall increase in cost was partially offset by favorable rate variances, driven by lower inventory movement of $33.2 million primarily due to increased long term stockpile utilization and $14.6 million associated with lower shipping and processing costs during 2010. Higher royalties related to the increase in revenue, higher mining costs related to increased mining fleet maintenance and higher depletion costs due to increased rail volumes of $27.2 million partially offset the favorable rate variance. Production Production at Asia Pacific Iron Ore in 2010 was higher than 2009 as a result of increased sales demand in 2010 and initiatives taken to improve supply conditions and eliminate certain production and logistics constraints, including upgrades to the rail system. The increase in production over the prior year is also due to reduced availability in 2009 as a result of repairs to the production plant. Production at Cockatoo Island resumed in the third quarter of 2010. 2009 Compared to 2008 North American Iron Ore Following is a summary of North American Iron Ore results for 2009 and 2008: (In Millions) Change due to 2009 2008 Rate Volume Idle cost/Productionvolumevariance Freight andreimbursements Totalchange Revenues from product sales and services $ 1,447.8 $ 2,369.6 $ (165.5 ) $ (580.7 ) $ $ (175.6 ) $ (921.8 ) Cost of goods sold and operating expense (1,172.3 ) (1,565.3 ) (22.0 ) 358.3 (118.9 ) 175.6 393.0 Sales margin $ 275.5 $ 804.3 $ (187.5 ) $ (222.4 ) $ (118.9 ) $ $ (528.8 ) Sales tons 16.4 22.7 Production tons (1): Total 19.6 35.2 Cliffs share of total 17.1 (2) 22.9 (1) Long tons of pellets (2,240 pounds). (2) Includes 1.6 million tons allocated to Cliffs due to re nominations by Cliffs partners at Tilden and Wabush. Revenue in 2009 decreased $921.8 million, or 39 percent, compared with 2008 primarily as a result of a 28 percent decline in sales volume, which contributed $580.7 million to the overall decrease in revenue. The decline in sales volume was a result of the economic downturn and its impact on the global steel industry, which led to a decline in demand for steel making products in North America during 2009. In addition to the year over year decline in sales volume, reported price settlements for iron ore pellets reflected a decrease of approximately 48 percent below 2008 prices, compared with an increase of 87 percent in 2008. As a result, base rate adjustments related to estimated reductions in World Pellet Pricing and producer price indices contributed to a $165.5 million decline in revenues in 2009. Revenue in 2009 included approximately $22.2 million related to supplemental contract payments compared with $225.5 million in 2008. The decrease between periods related to the estimated decline in average annual hot band steel pricing for one of our North American Iron Ore customers. In 2009 and 2008, certain customers purchased and paid for approximately 0.9 million tons and 1.2 million tons of pellets, respectively, in order to meet minimum contractual purchase requirements for each year under the terms of take or pay contracts. The inventory was stored at our facilities in upper lakes stockpiles. At the request 64 Table of Contents of the customers, the ore was not shipped, resulting in deferred revenue at December 31, 2009 and 2008 of $81.9 million and $82.9 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2009, all of the 1.2 million tons that were deferred at the end of 2008 were delivered, resulting in the related revenue being recognized in 2009. Furthermore, the supply agreement with one of our customers required the customer to pay for any tons remaining under its 2009 nomination in addition to certain stockpile payments by December 31, 2009. There were approximately 1.7 million unshipped tons remaining under the customers 2009 nomination and 0.8 million tons related to December 2009 shipments, for which payment of $147.5 million was due on December 31, 2009 per the terms of the contract. The customer did not remit payment of this amount until January 4, 2010. As a result, such amounts were not reflected in our 2009 consolidated financial statements. Cost of goods sold and operating expense in 2009 decreased $393.0 million or 25 percent from the prior year primarily due to lower sales volume, which resulted in cost reductions of approximately $358.3 million. The overall decrease was partially offset by idle expense of $118.9 million related to production curtailments at nearly all of the North American Iron Ore mines during 2009 in order to balance production with anticipated sales demand. In addition, cost of goods sold and operating expenses were unfavorably impacted in 2009 by approximately $22 million due to higher cost rates. The increase was primarily attributable to $43 million of higher labor costs related to the new labor agreement entered into in September 2008 at our iron ore facilities as well as higher fringe rates combined with an increase of $22 million related to higher energy costs. This was partially offset by a $25 million reduction in fuel costs, a decrease in royalty costs of $18 million as a result of lower iron ore pellet pricing, and cost reductions of $11 million related to ongoing cash conservation efforts during 2009. In addition, due to lower partner demand, Cliffs acquired 1.6 million tons produced at Tilden and Wabush from the mine partners share at variable cost, which resulted in a favorable cost impact of approximately $79 million in 2009. Production In response to the economic downturn, we continued to rationalize production to match customer demand. In 2009, we reduced production at our six North American Iron Ore mines to 17.1 million equity tons compared with 2008 production of 22.9 million equity tons. Based on signs of marked improvements in customer demand beginning in the second half of 2009, we increased production at most of our facilities and called employees back to work in order to ensure that we were positioned to meet increases in demand. During the fourth quarter of 2009, Tilden and United Taconite began operating at full capacity. Northshore was operating its two large furnaces, and Empire continued to maintain its production levels. Wabush was operating two of its three furnaces with Cliffs taking essentially all of the tonnage. Only Hibbing continued to be fully curtailed. North American Coal Following is a summary of North American Coal results for 2009 and 2008: (In Millions, except tonnage) Change due to 2009 2008 Rate Volume Idle cost/Productionvolumevariance Freight andreimbursements Totalchange Revenues from product sales and services $ 207.2 $ 346.3 $ 0.9 $ (127.1 ) $ $ (12.9 ) $ (139.1 ) Cost of goods sold and operating expense (279.1 ) (392.7 ) (5.3 ) 146.7 (40.7 ) 12.9 113.6 Sales margin $ (71.9 ) $ (46.4 ) $ (4.4 ) $ 19.6 $ (40.7 ) $ $ (25.5 ) Sales tons (in thousands) 1,874 3,241 Production tons (in thousands) (1) 1,741 3,468 (1) Tons are short tons (2,000 pounds). 65 Table of Contents We reported sales margin losses of $71.9 million and $46.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Revenue of $207.2 million in 2009 was 40 percent lower than revenue in 2008. The decrease in revenue was primarily attributable to a 42 percent decline in sales volume as a result of market conditions which adversely impacted the demand for steel making raw materials throughout 2009. Cost of goods sold and operating expense in 2009 decreased $113.6 million or 29 percent from 2008 primarily due to lower sales volume, which resulted in cost reductions of approximately $146.7 million. The decrease in 2009 sales volume also resulted in a decline in freight costs of $12.9 million and a reduction in royalty costs of $7.5 million. In addition, in response to the economic downturn, we decreased spending across the North American Coal business segment and idled production at both the Oak Grove and Pinnacle complexes during 2009. Production curtailments and headcount reductions during 2009 resulted in lower production related costs, including maintenance, supplies, and labor costs. Headcount reductions resulted in labor and benefit cost reductions of $32.2 million in 2009. Spending on operating supplies and maintenance costs was reduced in 2009 by approximately $26.1 million as we continued to focus on cash conservation and cost management strategies. However, these cost reductions were more than offset by higher cost per ton rates in 2009, due to the impact of lower volume, resulting in an overall unfavorable rate variance of $5.3 million. Cost of goods sold and operating expenses in 2009 were also negatively impacted by an increase in idle expense and production volume variance of $40.7 million related to production curtailments at both mine locations during the year and delays associated with development of longwall panels at Oak Grove in early 2009. Production Metallurgical coal demand decreased in 2009 as the steel industry cut back production in response to the global economic slowdown. As a result, we initiated plans in 2009 to align production with customer demand. In West Virginia, production was idled at our Green Ridge mines for part of the year, and production at our Pinnacle mine was temporarily suspended. In Alabama, operating levels were also reduced at our Oak Grove mine. However, production levels began to increase at the end of 2009 due to improvements in market conditions and increases in customer demand. In particular, during the fourth quarter, production increased at Oak Grove and development was also accelerated to avoid downtime in 2010. At Pinnacle, the longwall move was completed and we resumed production in mid October. These production adjustments at North American Coal resulted in a 2009 annual operating rate of approximately 1.7 million tons. This compares with 2008 production of 3.5 million tons. The Oak Grove mine was idled towards the end of 2009 due to ventilation, water and roofing issues at the mine. MSHA denied our request to continue limited production while we addressed these issues. Oak Grove continued to operate a continuous miner section to develop future longwall panels. MSHA approval was received on February 9, 2010 for longwall operations to resume.

Cockatoo production reflects our 50 percent share. 66 Table of Contents Sales margin for Asia Pacific Iron Ore declined to $87.2 million in 2009 compared with $348.6 million in 2008. Revenue decreased 30 percent in 2009 primarily as a result of lower pricing for lump and fines during the year compared with 2008 prices. While the 2009 benchmark prices for iron ore lump and fines did not settle with all of our customers, we negotiated pricing arrangements with certain customers in China to reflect the decline in steel demand and prices. Pricing decreases in 2009 of 44 percent and 33 percent for lump and fines, respectively, contrasted with settled price increases in 2008 of 97 percent and 80 percent, respectively. Pricing in 2009 was based upon previously reported settlements in Japan and worldwide pressures in the market and remained unchanged from the estimates we made throughout most of 2009. The overall decline in 2009 revenue was partially offset by a favorable variance of $72.5 million due to a nine percent increase in sales volume as a result of increased demand as well as a positive sales mix variance of $34.1 million due to more sales of lump and fines at higher prices and reduced sales of low grade fines. Cost of goods sold and operating expenses in 2009 were relatively consistent with 2008. Costs were unfavorably impacted by approximately $38.8 million of amortization expense related to the accounting for the acquisition of the remaining ownership interest in Asia Pacific Iron Ore, which occurred during the second half of 2008. Costs in 2009 also increased by approximately $29.6 million due to higher sales volumes as well as higher shipping costs of $5.3 million due to freight arrangements with customers to secure sales during the period. Increases in costs during 2009 were partially offset by favorable foreign exchange variances of $35.2 million. Production Production at Asia Pacific Iron Ore in 2009 was higher than 2008 as a result of increased demand and initiatives taken during the year to improve supply conditions and eliminate certain production and logistics constraints, including rail upgrades and stockpile utilization. Increases in production in 2009 were partially offset by the end of production at Cockatoo Island during 2008. Liquidity, Cash Flows and Capital Resources Our primary sources of liquidity are cash generated from our operating and financing activities. Our cash flows from operating activities are driven primarily by our operating results and changes in our working capital requirements. Our cash flows from financing activities are dependent upon our ability to access credit or other capital. Throughout 2010, we have taken a balanced approach to the allocation of our capital resources and free cash flow. We have continued to strengthen our balance sheet and enhance financial flexibility, including the completion of two public offerings of senior notes in the aggregate principal amount of $400 million and $1 billion during the first and third quarters of 2010, respectively. All or a portion of the net proceeds from the offerings have been used for the repayment of a portion of other debt obligations, including those related to our investment in Amap&aacute;, and have been or may be used for the funding of all or a portion of other strategic transactions, such as the 2010 acquisitions and the pending acquisition of Consolidated Thompson pursuant to the definitive arrangement agreement that was entered into in January 2011 and is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of various closing conditions. Other uses of the proceeds from the $1 billion public offering of senior notes may include general corporate purposes and pending final use, investments in short term marketable securities. 67 Table of Contents The following is a summary of significant sources and uses of cash in 2010 and 2009: (In Millions) 2010 2009 Cash and cash equivalents January 1 $ 502.7 $ 179.0 Net cash provided by operating activities 1,320.0 185.7 Significant Investing Transactions Investment in ventures $ (191.3 ) $ (81.8 ) Rail upgrade in Asia Pacific (11.0 ) (28.8 ) Acquisition of Wabush (101.9 ) Acquisition of Freewest (1) (5.3 ) Acquisition of Spider (108.0 ) Acquisition of CLCC (775.9 ) Other capital expenditures (255.9 ) (87.5 ) Redemption of marketable securities 32.5 5.4 Sale of assets 59.1 28.3 Total (1,357.7 ) (164.4 ) Sources (Uses) of Financing Proceeds from sale of common shares 347.3 Net proceeds from issuance of $400 million senior notes 397.8 Net proceeds from issuance of $1 billion senior notes 990.3 Dividend distributions (68.9 ) (31.9 ) Repayment of term loan (200.0 ) Net borrowings under credit facility 450.0 3.3 Repayments under credit facility (450.0 ) Total 1,119.2 318.7 Other net activity (17.5 ) (16.3 ) Cash and cash equivalents December 31 $ 1,566.7 $ 502.7 (1) The purchase consideration for Freewest included the issuance of 4.2 million common shares valued at $173.1 million and $12.8 million in cash. This amount represents the cash paid for the acquisition of the remaining interest of Freewest, net of the cash acquired through the acquisition. The following discussion summarizes the significant activities impacting our cash flows during the year as well as those expected to impact our future cash flows over the next 12 months. Refer to the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows for additional information. Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.3 billion in 2010, compared with $185.7 million in 2009 and $853.2 million in 2008. Operating cash flows in 2010 were primarily impacted by higher operating results, as previously noted. Our operating cash flows vary with prices realized from iron ore and coal sales, production levels, production costs, cash payments for income taxes and interest, other working capital changes and other factors. As a result of improved economic conditions, operating plans for 2011 reflect increased production and modestly higher prices for iron ore and coal. The long term outlook remains strong and we are now focusing on our growth projects with sustained investment in our core businesses. Throughout 2010, capacity utilization among steelmaking facilities in North America demonstrated ongoing improvement. The industry continued to show signs of stabilization based on increasing steel production and the restarting of blast furnaces in North America and Europe. As a result, we experienced marked improvements in customer demand and market expectations and increased production at most of our facilities. 68 Table of Contents Based on current mine plans and subject to future iron ore and coal prices, we expect estimated operating cash flows in 2011 to be greater than our budgeted investments and capital expenditures, expected debt payments, dividends, and other cash requirements. This expectation excludes acquisition activities related to the pending acquisition of Consolidated Thompson. Refer to Outlook for additional guidance regarding expected future results, including projections on pricing, sales volume and production for our various businesses. Investing Activities Net cash used by investing activities was $1.4 billion in 2010, compared with $179.3 million and $795.6 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. Capital expenditures were $266.9 million, $116.3 million and $182.5 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Investing activities in 2010 also included $26.5 million of capital contributions related to the funding of operations at Amap&aacute; as well as $155 million related to the repayment of all Amap&aacute;s debt in 2010. This compares with capital contributions of $70.2 million related to our investment in Amap&aacute; during 2009. In February 2010, we completed the acquisition of the remaining 73.2 percent interest in Wabush for an aggregate acquisition price of $103 million. We also completed the acquisition of all of the coal operations of CLCC in July 2010 for an aggregate acquisition price of $775.9 million. During the fourth quarter of 2010, we completed the acquisition of the remaining shares of Spider through an amalgamation, increasing our ownership interest to 100 percent and resulting in a total cash investment in Spider of $108 million as of December 31, 2010. In December 2010, our North American Coal segment sold the new longwall plow system at our Pinnacle mine in West Virginia and subsequently leased the longwall back for a period of ten years. We received proceeds of $57.3 million from the sale of the longwall, and the leaseback was accounted for as a capital lease. Significant investing activities in 2009 included the sale of a fleet of Asia Pacific Iron Ore rail cars that were subsequently leased back for a period of ten years. We received proceeds of $23.8 million from the sale of the rail cars, and the leaseback was accounted for as a capital lease. Non cash investing activities during 2010 included the issuance of 4.2 million of our common shares valued at $173.1 million as part of the purchase consideration for the acquisition of the remaining interest in Freewest, which was completed on January 27, 2010. Non cash items during 2010 also included gains of $38.6 million primarily related to the remeasurement of our previous ownership interest in Freewest and Wabush held prior to each business acquisition. Based upon improving market conditions and a strengthening long term outlook, we anticipate that total cash used for capital expenditures in 2011 will be approximately $700 million. This expectation excludes capital expenditures related to the pending acquisition of Consolidated Thompson. As we continue to increase production into 2011, capital expenditures will include the expansion of our Empire and Tilden mines in Michigans Upper Peninsula in order to increase production capacity. The project has currently been approved for capital investments in equipment of approximately $143 million, of which approximately $125 million is expected to be spent in 2011. In Asia Pacific, an expansion project has been approved at our Koolyanobbing mine in order to increase production capacity to 11 million metric tons per year. We estimate the project to require an initial capital cash outflow of approximately $195 million, of which approximately $22 million was spent in 2010 and $146 million is expected to be spent in 2011. At Pinnacle, a new longwall plow system was purchased to reduce maintenance costs and increase production at the mine. Remaining expenditures for the new longwall plow system of approximately $14 million are expected to be made in 2011. The remaining expenditures are related to the longwall plow system assets pending delivery; therefore, they were not included within the longwall sale leaseback discussed above. Construction of a new portal at Oak Grove will continue in 2011 in order to improve productivity and support growth and expansion of the mine. The portal requires a total capital investment of approximately $29 million, of which $25 million was committed and $9 million was spent in 2010. Remaining expenditures for the portal of approximately $16 million are expected to be made in 2011. We are also in the process of upgrading the preparation plant at Pinnacle in order to increase product yield and plant availability. The modification project requires a capital investment of approximately $20 million, of which $17 million was spent in 2010. Additional significant capital expenditures are expected in 2011 related to our pending acquisition of Consolidated Thompson. We have implemented a global exploration program, which is integral to our growth strategy and is focused on identifying and capturing new world class projects for future development or projects that add significant 69 Table of Contents value to existing operations. Our Global Exploration Group is expected to spend between $50 million and $55 million on exploration activities in 2011, which we expect will provide us with opportunities for significant future potential reserve additions globally. Throughout 2010, we incurred expenses of $13.3 million and investments of $16.3 million related to our involvement in exploration activities. We continue to evaluate funding options for our capital needs and expect to be able to fund these requirements through operations and availability under our existing borrowing arrangements. Other funding options may include new lines of credit or other financing arrangements.

(6) This is for services to be provided in future periods. 70 Table of Contents Refer to NOTE 17 COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our future purchase commitments and obligations. Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities in 2010 was $1.1 billion compared with $304.3 million in 2009 and $32.4 million in 2008. Cash flows from financing activities in 2010 primarily included $397.8 million and $990.3 million in net proceeds, respectively, from two public offerings of senior notes, which we completed on March 17, 2010 and September 20, 2010, respectively. A portion of the net proceeds from the $400 million public offering of senior notes were used for the repayment of our $200 million term loan under our credit facility, which we repaid in March 2010, as well as the repayment of our share of Amap&aacute;s remaining debt outstanding of $100.8 million in May 2010. In addition, a portion of the net proceeds were used to fund a portion of the purchase price for the Spider and CLCC acquisitions. A portion of the net proceeds from the $1 billion public offering of senior notes were used for the repayment of the $350 million borrowings outstanding under our credit facility. Other uses of the net proceeds from the $1 billion public offering of senior notes may include general corporate purposes, the funding of strategic acquisitions such as the pending acquisition of Consolidated Thompson and pending final use, investments in short term marketable securities. Successful execution of these offerings allowed us to enhance our financial flexibility and better position ourselves to take advantage of possible opportunities as the market continues to improve in 2011. In May 2010, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly common share dividend from $0.0875 to $0.14 per share. The increased cash dividend was paid on June 1, 2010, September 1, 2010 and December 1, 2010. In May 2009, our Board of Directors enacted a 55 percent reduction in our quarterly common share dividend to $0.04 from $0.0875 for the second and third quarters of 2009 in order to enhance financial flexibility. In the fourth quarter of 2009, the dividend was reinstated to its previous level. Cash flows from financing activities in 2009 primarily included $348 million in net proceeds from the sale of our common shares. As previously discussed, on January 11, 2011, we entered into a definitive arrangement agreement with Consolidated Thompson to acquire all of its common shares in an all cash transaction including net debt, valued at approximately C$4.9 billion. We have currently entered into a $3.7 billion bridge financing commitment to provide for the financing of the arrangement. We intend to arrange permanent financing for the transaction by, among other things, accessing the capital markets depending on market conditions during 2011. A portion of our cash will also be used to fund a portion of the purchase price; however management focus is on maintaining sufficient cash balances to address our future operational needs. Capital Resources We expect to fund our business obligations from available cash, current operations and existing borrowing arrangements. The following represents a summary of key liquidity measures as of December 31, 2010 and 2009: (In Millions) December 31,2010 December 31,2009 Cash and cash equivalents $ 1,566.7 $ 502.7 Credit facility $ 600.0 $ 800.0 Senior notes 1,725.0 325.0 Senior notes drawn (1,725.0 ) (325.0 ) Term loans drawn (200.0 ) Letter of credit obligations and other commitments (64.7 ) (31.4 ) Borrowing capacity available $ 535.3 $ 568.6 71 Table of Contents Refer to NOTE 8 DEBT AND CREDIT FACILITIES of our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our debt and credit facilities. We are subject to certain financial covenants contained in the agreements governing certain of our debt instruments. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, we were in compliance with each of our financial covenants. Apart from cash generated by the business, our primary source of funding is cash on hand, which totaled $1.6 billion as of December 31, 2010. We also have a $600 million revolving credit facility, which matures in 2012. This facility has available borrowing capacity of $535.3 million as of December 31, 2010. Effective October 29, 2009, we amended our credit facility agreement, which resulted in improved borrowing flexibility, more liberally defined financial covenants and debt restrictions, and other benefits in exchange for a modest increase in pricing. The combination of cash and the credit facility gives us over $2.0 billion in liquidity entering the first quarter of 2011, which is expected to be used to fund operations and finance strategic transactions such as the pending acquisition of Consolidated Thompson. We are party to financing arrangements under which we issue guarantees on behalf of certain of our unconsolidated subsidiaries. In the event of non payment, we are obligated to make payment in accordance with the provisions of the guarantee arrangement. As of December 31, 2010, Amap&aacute; repaid its total project debt outstanding, for which we had previously provided a several guarantee on our 30 percent share. Repayment of our share of the total project debt outstanding consisted of $54.2 million and $100.8 million repaid on February 17, 2010 and May 27, 2010, respectively. Upon repayment of the project debt, our obligations under the provisions of the guarantee arrangement have been relieved. Based on our current borrowing capacity and the actions we have taken in response to the global financial crisis to conserve cash, we have adequate liquidity and expect to fund our business obligations from available cash, current operations and existing borrowing arrangements. Other sources of funding may include new lines of credit or other financing arrangements. Several credit markets may provide additional capacity should that become necessary. The bank market may provide funding through a term loan, bridge loan, revolving credit facility, or through exercising the $200 million accordion in our current credit facility. The risk associated with this market is significant increases in borrowing costs as a result of limited capacity. As in all debt markets, capacity is a global issue that impacts the bond market. Our issuance of a $400 million public offering of 10 year senior notes in March 2010 and a $1 billion public offering of 10 year and 30 year senior notes in September 2010 provide evidence that capacity in the bond markets has improved for investment grade companies compared to conditions impacting such markets in 2009. These transactions represent the successful execution of our strategy to increase liquidity and extend debt maturities to align with longer term capital structure needs. Accessing the capital markets may provide additional sources of funding, as well as other alternative sources such as lease financing. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We have operating leases, which are primarily utilized for certain equipment and office space. Aside from this, we do not have any other off balance sheet financing arrangements. Market Risks We are subject to a variety of risks, including those caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. We have established policies and procedures to manage such risks; however, certain risks are beyond our control. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk We are subject to changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily as a result of our operations in Australia, which could impact our financial condition. Foreign exchange risk arises from our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates because our reporting currency is the United States dollar, but the functional currency of our Asia Pacific operations is the Australian dollar. Our Asia Pacific operations receive funds in U.S. currency for their iron ore and coal sales and incur costs in Australian currency. We use forward 72 Table of Contents exchange contracts, call options and collar options to hedge our foreign currency exposure for a portion of our sales receipts. The primary objective for the use of these instruments is to reduce exposure to changes in Australian and U.S. currency exchange rates and to protect against undue adverse movement in these exchange rates. At December 31, 2010, we had $70 million of outstanding exchange rate contracts with varying maturity dates ranging from February 2011 to December 2011 for which we elected hedge accounting, effective October 2010. We also had $230 million of outstanding exchange rate contracts with varying maturity dates ranging from January 2011 to January 2012 that we have been holding as economic hedges, entered into prior to October 2010. A 10 percent increase in the value of the Australian dollar from the month end rate would increase the fair value of these contracts by approximately $31.2 million, and a 10 percent decrease would reduce the fair value by approximately $26.4 million. We may enter into additional hedging instruments in the near future as needed in order to further hedge our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The pellets produced at our Wabush operation in Canada represented approximately 15 percent of our North American Iron Ore pellet production as of December 31, 2010. This operation is subject to currency exchange fluctuations between the United States and Canadian currency. We do not currently hedge our exposure to this currency exchange fluctuation; however, we plan to enter into hedging instruments in the future to hedge such exposures. The functional currency for Wabush was determined to be the Canadian dollar prior to our acquisition of the remaining interest. At the time, we had a 26.8 percent noncontrolling interest in the mining venture. Our acquisition to obtain full ownership of Wabush and the resulting change in control in February 2010 triggered a reassessment of the accounting principles related to the determination of Wabushs functional currency during the first quarter of 2010. As a result, effective February 1, 2010, we changed the functional currency of Wabush from the local currency to the U.S. dollar reporting currency primarily due to changes in the nature of intercompany transactions and changes in the structure under which the entity is financed, resulting in the U.S. dollar becoming the currency of the primary economic environment in which the business operates. Interest Rate Risk Interest payable on our $1 billion, $400 million and $325 million senior notes is at fixed rates. Interest for borrowings under our credit facility is at a floating rate, dependent in part on the LIBOR rate, which could expose us to the effects of interest rate changes; however, there were no borrowings outstanding under our credit facility as of December 31, 2010. Pricing Risks Provisional Pricing Arrangements During the first quarter of 2010, the worlds largest iron ore producers moved away from the annual international benchmark pricing mechanism referenced in certain of our customer supply agreements, resulting in a shift in the industry toward shorter term pricing arrangements linked to the spot market. Such changes are likely to yield increased volatility in iron ore pricing. In addition, these changes led to extended pricing negotiations with certain customers during 2010. As a result, we recorded certain shipments made throughout the year on a provisional basis until final settlements were reached. The pricing provisions were characterized as freestanding derivatives, which were marked to fair value as a revenue adjustment each reporting period based upon the estimated forward settlement until prices were actually settled. The fair value of the instrument was determined based on the forward price expectation of the final price settlement. Therefore, to the extent final prices were higher or lower than what was recorded on a provisional basis, an increase or decrease to revenues was recorded each reporting period until the date of final pricing. We renegotiated the terms of our supply agreements and reached short term pricing arrangements with our Asia Pacific Iron Ore customers. In addition, we reached final pricing settlements with some of our North American Iron Ore customers through the fourth quarter of 2010 for the 2010 contract year. With respect to the North American Iron Ore customers for which final pricing for the 2010 contract year has not yet been settled as of December 31, 2010, we did not record shipments on a provisional basis due to pending arbitrations. As a result, there are no provisionally priced derivative assets recorded at December 31, 2010. Although pricing has been settled with some of our North American customers for 2010, we are still in the process of assessing the impact a change to the historical annual pricing mechanism will have on certain of our larger existing North American Iron Ore customer supply agreements that extend over multiple years, and negotiations are still ongoing with these customers. 73 Table of Contents Arbitration We are currently in discussions with certain of our customers regarding how our supply agreements will take into account the change in international market pricing. Additionally, we currently have arbitrations pending relating to the price adjustment provisions of two supply agreements, as further discussed under Part II Item 1, Legal Proceedings. These discussions and arbitrations may result in changes to the pricing mechanisms used with our various customers and could impact sales prices realized in current and future periods. In the event that we are unsuccessful in defending our position, the retroactive revised pricing for 2010 sales under one of the supply agreements could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations. The outcome and timing of the arbitrations are uncertain. Customer Supply Agreements Certain supply agreements with one North American Iron Ore customer provide for supplemental revenue or refunds based on the customers average annual steel pricing at the time the product is consumed in the customers blast furnace. The supplemental pricing is characterized as an embedded derivative, which is finalized based on a future price, and is marked to fair value as a revenue adjustment each reporting period until the pellets are consumed and the amounts are settled. The fair value of the instrument is determined using a market approach based on an estimate of the annual realized price of hot rolled steel at the steelmakers facilities, and takes into consideration current market conditions and nonperformance risk. At December 31, 2010, we had a derivative asset of $45.6 million, representing the fair value of the pricing factors, based upon the amount of unconsumed tons and an estimated average hot band steel price related to the period in which the tons are expected to be consumed in the customers blast furnace at each respective steelmaking facility, subject to final pricing at a future date. This compares with a derivative asset of $63.2 million as of December 31, 2009, based upon the amount of unconsumed tons and the related estimated average hot band steel price. We estimate that a $100 change in the average hot band steel price realized from the December 31, 2010 estimated price recorded would cause the fair value of the derivative instrument to increase or decrease by approximately $10 million, thereby impacting our consolidated revenues by the same amount. We have not entered into any hedging programs to mitigate the risk of adverse price fluctuations, nor do we intend to hedge our exposure to such risks in the future; however, certain of our term supply agreements contain price collars, which typically limit the percentage increase or decrease in prices for our products during any given year. Volatile Energy and Fuel Costs The volatile cost of energy is an important issue affecting our production costs, primarily in relation to our iron ore operations. Our consolidated North American Iron Ore mining ventures consumed approximately 14.4 million MMBtus of natural gas at an average delivered price of $4.82 per MMBtu, and 28.7 million gallons of diesel fuel at an average delivered price of $2.45 per gallon in 2010. Our recently acquired CLCC operations consumed approximately 1.9 million gallons of diesel fuel at an average delivered rate of $2.60 per gallon since the date of acquisition. Consumption of diesel fuel by our Asia Pacific Operations was approximately 13.0 million gallons at an average delivered price of $1.67 per gallon for the same period. Our strategy to address increasing energy rates includes improving efficiency in energy usage and utilizing the lowest cost alternative fuels. In addition, we purchased forward contracts for projected natural gas and diesel needs related to our North American Iron Ore operations as a hedge against price volatility during 2010. Such contracts are in quantities expected to be delivered and used in the production process. As of December 31, 2010, all of our natural gas hedge contracts have matured. We have 2011 diesel purchases for a volume of 1.1 million gallons at an average price of $2.36 per gallon. This represents five percent of the total projected usage for 2011. At December 31, 2010, the notional amount of the outstanding diesel fuel forward contracts was $2.5 million. The contracts for 2011 mature at various times through May 2011. If the forward rates were to change 10 percent from the month end rate, the value and potential cash flow effect on the contracts would be approximately $0.3 million. We will continue to monitor relevant energy markets for risk mitigation opportunities and may make additional forward purchases or employ other hedging instruments in the future as warranted and deemed 74 Table of Contents appropriate by management. Assuming we do not enter into further hedging activity in the near term, a 10 percent change in natural gas and diesel fuel prices would result in a change of approximately $16.9 million in our annual fuel and energy costs base on expected consumption in 2011. Supply Concentration Risks Many of our mines are dependent on one source for electric power and for natural gas. A significant interruption or change in service or rates from our energy suppliers could materially impact our production costs, margins and profitability. Uncertainties of Health Care Reform Legislation On March 23, 2010, the PPACA was signed into law. On March 30, 2010, a companion bill, the Reconciliation Act was also signed into law. Among other things, the PPACA and the Reconciliation Act, when taken together, reduce the tax benefits available to an employer that receives the Medicare Part D subsidy. The Reconciliation Act partially restores the reduction under the PPACA. The impact of the U.S. health care reform will be phased in between 2011 and 2014 and will likely have a significant impact on our costs of providing employee health benefits beginning in 2011. In addition, as a result of the health care reform legislation that has been passed, our results of operations have been negatively impacted by a non cash income tax charge of approximately $16.1 million in the first quarter of 2010 to reflect the reduced deductibility of the postretirement prescription drug coverage. The charge was recorded in the first quarter of 2010 based upon the period of enactment. As with any significant government action, the provisions of the Acts are still being assessed and may have additional financial accounting and reporting ramifications. In addition, it is possible that standard setters or regulators may decide to address the accounting for the Acts in the future. The impact of any such changes on our business operations and financial statements remains uncertain. However, as additional information becomes available, we will continue to monitor current developments and assess the potential implications of the PPACA and the Reconciliation Act on our business. Outlook We anticipate global steel production will continue to grow in 2011, primarily driven by emerging economies such as China, India and Brazil. Based on these dynamics, we continue to have an optimistic outlook for our businesses. Subsequent to year end, we announced we had entered into a definitive arrangement agreement with Consolidated Thompson to acquire all of its common shares in an all cash transaction including net debt, valued at approximately C$4.9 billion, which was unanimously approved by Consolidated Thompsons board of directors. In addition, we entered into a support agreement with Consolidated Thompsons largest shareholder, Wuhan Iron and Steel (Group) Corporation of China, along with the directors and certain senior officers of Consolidated Thompson. This transaction is expected to close in early second quarter of 2011, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of various closing conditions. After closing this transaction, we anticipate including this business in subsequent market outlooks. North American Iron Ore Outlook (Long tons) For 2011, we are increasing our North American Iron Ore sales volume expectation to approximately 28 million tons, partially as a result of an additional 600,000 tons of sales volume that we expect to recognize in the first quarter of 2011. Revenue was not recognized during the fourth quarter of 2010 for these tons due to payment timing and severe weather conditions on the Great Lakes. The balance of the increase is due to improved market conditions. Our North American Iron Ore 2011 revenue per ton expectation is $140 to $145, based on the following assumptions: 2011 U.S. blast furnace utilization of approximately 70 percent; 2011 average hot rolled steel pricing of $650 to $700; 75 Table of Contents 2011 settled annual pellet increases of 35 percent from 2010s pricing; and Successful collection of $300 million associated with the pending arbitration discussed above. The revenue per ton expectation also considers various contract provisions, lag year adjustments and pricing caps and floors contained in certain supply agreements. Actual realized average revenue per ton for the full year will ultimately depend on increases or decreases for blast furnace pellets from annual 2010 seaborne pellet prices, sales volume levels, customer mix, production input costs and or steel prices (all factors in our formula based pricing in the North American Iron Ore business segment) and the final award for the on going arbitration. In addition, the following approximate sensitivities could impact actual realized prices: For every 10 percent change from the above expectation for annual blast furnace pellet prices, we expect our average realized revenue per ton in North American Iron Ore to change by approximately $6; and For every $25 change from the estimated 2011 hot rolled steel prices noted above, we expect our average revenue per ton in North American Iron Ore to change by $0.55. We expect our North American Iron Ore 2011 production volume to be approximately 28 million tons. At this production level, we anticipate our cost per ton to be $65 to $70, with approximately $5 per ton comprised of depreciation, depletion and amortization. North American Coal Outlook (Short tons F.O.B. the mine) We are maintaining our 2011 North American Coal sales and production volumes expectation of approximately 6.5 million tons, comprised of 1.0 million tons of thermal coal, 1.5 million tons of high volatile metallurgical coal and 4.0 million tons of low volatile metallurgical coal. Our North American Coal 2011 revenue per ton expectation is $135 to $140. This revenue per ton estimate is based on the following factors: Virtually all of the expected thermal coal sales volume committed at an average price of $71 per ton; 95 percent of the expected high volatile metallurgical coal sales volume committed at an average of $115 per ton; 70 percent of the expected low volatile metallurgical coal sales volume committed at an average of $150 per ton; and Uncommitted tons of low volatile metallurgical coal priced at $185 per ton. In 2011, we anticipate cost per ton for the year of approximately $105 to $110, with approximately $15 per ton comprised of depreciation, depletion and amortization. Asia Pacific Iron Ore Outlook (metric tons F.O.B. the port) Asia Pacific Iron Ore 2011 sales and production volumes are expected to be 9 million tons. Our 2011 Asia Pacific Iron Ore revenue per ton expectation is $175 to $180, based on the following assumptions: The Platts spot price of $187 per ton (C.I.F. China) as of January 31, 2011, is maintained for the remainder of 2011; Pricing for the majority of Chinese customers, which represents approximately 80 percent of the expected sales volume, continues to use a mechanism closely correlated to spot prices; Pricing mechanisms for the majority of Japanese customers, which represents approximately 20 percent of the expected sales volumes, continue to use quarterly lag spot prices; and A product mix of approximately 50 percent lump and 50 percent fines. We expect costs per ton to be approximately $70 to $75. The year over year increase in the average cost expectation is primarily driven by higher royalties, higher stripping costs and a less favorable foreign exchange rate. Depreciation, depletion and amortization costs per ton are expected to be $12. 76 Table of Contents The following table provides a summary of our 2011 guidance for these three business segments: 2011 Outlook Summary North AmericanIron Ore (1) North AmericanCoal (2) Asia PacificIron Ore (3) CurrentOutlook CurrentOutlook CurrentOutlook Sales volume (in millions) 28.0 6.5 9.0 Revenue per ton $ 140 $145 $ 135 $140 $ 175 $180 Cost per ton $ 65 $70 $ 105 $110 $ 70 $75 (1) North American Iron Ore tons are reported in long tons.

Outlook for Sonoma Coal and the Amap&aacute; Iron Ore Project (metric tons F.O.B. the port) In 2011, we expect our equity sales and production volume at Sonoma Coal to be 1.6 million tons. The approximate product mix is expected to be two thirds thermal coal and one third metallurgical coal. We expect per ton costs to be $105 to $110. The year over year increase in the average cost expectation is primarily driven by higher royalties and an unfavorable exchange rate variance. We expect the Amap&aacute; Iron Ore Project to be modestly profitable in 2011. SG&A Expenses and Other Expectations We anticipate SG&A expenses to be approximately $200 million in 2011. We intend to incur the following additional cash outflows: Approximately $50 million to $55 million related to our global exploration activities; Approximately $35 million related to our chromite project in Ontario, Canada; and Approximately $50 million related to Sonoma Coal partner profit sharing. We anticipate an effective tax rate of approximately 30 percent for the year and depreciation, depletion, and amortization of approximately $360 million. 2011 Capital Budget Update and Other Uses of Cash Based on the above outlook, we expect to generate more than $2.7 billion in cash from operations in 2011. We expect capital expenditures of approximately $700 million, comprised of approximately $300 million in sustaining capital and approximately $400 million in growth and expansion, including the following projects within our business segments: North American Iron Ore $125 million related to the previously disclosed extension of our Empire Mine in Michigan to 2014; and $20 million related to increasing production at Wabush to 5.5 million tons by 2013. North American Coal $45 million related to bringing Lower War Eagle, a high volatile metallurgical coal mine in West Virginia, into production; $16 million related to the previously disclosed mine shaft construction at our Oak Grove Mine in Alabama; and 77 Table of Contents $14 million related to the previously disclosed long wall installation at our Pinnacle Mine in West Virginia. Asia Pacific Iron Ore $146 million related to the previously disclosed infrastructure upgrades at our Koolyanobbing Mine in Western Australia. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Refer to NOTE 1 BUSINESS SUMMARY AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES of the consolidated financial statements for a description of recent accounting pronouncements, including the respective dates of adoption and effects on results of operations and financial condition. Critical Accounting Estimates Managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. Preparation of financial statements requires management to make assumptions, estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses, and the related disclosures of contingencies. Management bases its estimates on various assumptions and historical experience, which are believed to be reasonable; however, due to the inherent nature of estimates, actual results may differ significantly due to changed conditions or assumptions. On a regular basis, management reviews the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are fairly presented in accordance with GAAP. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material. Management believes that the following critical accounting estimates and judgments have a significant impact on our financial statements. Revenue Recognition North American Iron Ore Customer Supply Agreements Most of our North American Iron Ore long term supply agreements are comprised of a base price with annual price adjustment factors, some of which are subject to annual price collars in order to limit the percentage increase or decrease in prices for our iron ore pellets during any given year. The base price is the primary component of the purchase price for each contract. The inflation indexed price adjustment factors are integral to the iron ore supply contracts and vary based on the agreement but typically include adjustments based upon changes in international pellet prices, changes in specified Producers Price Indices including those for all commodities, industrial commodities, energy and steel. The pricing adjustments generally operate in the same manner, with each factor typically comprising a portion of the price adjustment, although the weighting of each factor varies based upon the specific terms of each agreement. In most cases, these adjustment factors have not been finalized at the time our product is sold. In these cases, we have historically estimated the adjustment factors at each reporting period based upon the best third party information available. The estimates are then adjusted to actual when the information has been finalized. During the third quarter of 2010, we revised our approach for estimating the adjustment factors to include 2010 published pricing settlements realized by other companies in the industry. With respect to international pellet prices, certain long term supply agreements reference the previous years settled price, in which case, no estimate is required. However, pricing in some of our supply agreements is based upon the international pellet price for the current year. The period during which we must estimate changes in international pellet prices varies year to year based on the timing of final settlement. Historically, contract negotiations were completed and pricing settlements for the upcoming year were reached during the first quarter of the contract year, in which case an estimate was required only for a short period of time and was adjusted to actual prior to reporting first quarter results. This was the case in 2007. As a result, the price adjustment provisions related to international pellet prices were essentially a fixed component of the purchase price for that contract year based upon the timing of settlement. Several instances occurred in both 2009 and 2008, in which 78 Table of Contents contract negotiations were extended with settlement occurring later in the year. Information used in developing the estimate prior to settlement included such factors as previous pricing settlements among other iron ore producers and consumers in the industry, current spot prices, market trends, publications and other industry information. However, based on the timing of settlement, adjustments of our estimate to the actual international pellet price were not material in 2009 or 2008 as a result of having limited shipments to customers with these contract provisions during the first quarter of each respective year. In 2010, the worlds largest iron ore producers moved away from the annual international benchmark pricing mechanism referenced in certain of our customer supply agreements, resulting in a shift in the industry toward shorter term pricing arrangements linked to the spot market. These changes caused us to assess the impact a change to the historical annual pricing mechanism would have on certain of our larger existing North American Iron Ore customer supply agreements. We reached final pricing settlements with some of our North American Iron Ore customers through the fourth quarter of 2010 for the 2010 contract year. As a result, we recorded certain shipments made throughout the 2010 year on a provisional basis until final settlements were reached. With respect to the North American Iron Ore customers for which final pricing for the 2010 contract year has not yet been settled as of December 31, 2010, we did not record shipments on a provisional basis due to pending arbitrations. Based on the timing of these settlements and the quality of our estimates, adjustments of our provisional pricing estimates were not material during 2010. The producer price indices remain a provisional component of the sales price throughout the contract year and are estimated each quarter using publicly available forecasts of such indices. The final indices referenced in certain of the North American Iron Ore supply contracts are typically not published by the U.S. Department of Labor until the second quarter of the subsequent year. As a result, we record an adjustment for the difference between the fourth quarter estimate and the final price in the following year. Historically, such adjustments have not been material as they have represented less than half of 1 percent of North American Iron Ores revenue for each of the three preceding fiscal years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007. In addition, certain supply agreements with one customer include provisions for supplemental revenue or refunds based on the customers average annual steel pricing for the year the product is consumed in the customers blast furnaces. The supplemental pricing is characterized as an embedded derivative, which is finalized based on a future price, and is marked to fair value as a revenue adjustment each reporting period until the pellets are consumed and the amounts are settled. The fair value of the instrument is determined using a market approach based on an estimate of the annual realized price of hot rolled steel at the steelmakers facilities. At December 31, 2010, we had a derivative asset of $45.6 million, representing the fair value of the pricing factors, based upon the amount of unconsumed tons and an estimated average hot band steel price related to the period in which the tons are expected to be consumed in the customers blast furnace at each respective steelmaking facility, subject to final pricing at a future date. This compares with a derivative asset of $63.2 million as of December 31, 2009, based upon the amount of unconsumed tons and the related estimated average hot band steel price. 79 Table of Contents The customers average annual price is not known at the time of sale and the actual price is received on a delayed basis at the end of the year, once the average annual price has been finalized. As a result, we estimate the average price and adjust the estimate to actual in the fourth quarter when the information is provided by the customer at the end of each year. Information used in developing the estimate includes such factors as production and pricing information from the customer, current spot prices, third party analyst forecasts, publications and other industry information. The accuracy of our estimates typically increases as the year progresses based on additional information in the market becoming available and the customers ability to more accurately determine the average price it will realize for the year. The following represents the historical accuracy of our pricing estimates related to the derivative as well as the impact on revenue resulting from the difference between the estimated price and the actual price for each quarter during 2010, 2009 and 2008 prior to receiving final information from the customer for tons consumed during each year: Hot Band Steel Price Estimate vs. Actual 2010 2009 2008 FinalPrice EstimatedPrice Impact onRevenue(in millions) FinalPrice EstimatedPrice Impact onRevenue(in millions) FinalPrice EstimatedPrice Impact onRevenue(in millions) First Quarter $ 593 $ 624 $ (0.8 ) $ 528 $ 523 $ 1.2 $ 763 $ 645 $ 24.9 Second Quarter 593 634 (12.1 ) 528 545 (1.3 ) 763 773 (5.4 ) Third Quarter 593 609 (7.0 ) 528 536 (0.6 ) 763 794 (17.6 ) Fourth Quarter 593 593 528 528 763 763 We estimate that a $100 change in the average hot band steel price realized from the December 31, 2010 estimated price recorded for the unconsumed tons remaining at year end would cause the fair value of the derivative instrument to increase or decrease by approximately $10 million, thereby impacting our consolidated revenues by the same amount. Provisional Pricing Arrangements Historically, certain supply agreements primarily with our Asia Pacific Iron Ore customers provided for revenue or refunds based on the ultimate settlement of annual international benchmark pricing for lump and fines. As a result of the derivative accounting treatment applied to the provisions, revenue reflected the estimated benchmark price until final settlement occurred. Therefore, to the extent final prices were higher or lower than what was recorded on a provisional basis, an increase or decrease to revenues was recorded each reporting period until the date of final pricing. Accordingly, in times of rising iron ore prices, our revenues benefited from higher prices received for contracts priced at the current benchmark price and also from an increase related to the final pricing of provisionally priced sales pursuant to contracts entered into in prior periods; in times of falling iron ore prices, the opposite occurred. Pricing estimates were primarily based upon reported price settlements in the industry and worldwide pressures in the market. As discussed above, in 2010, the worlds largest iron ore producers moved away from the annual international benchmark pricing mechanism referenced in certain of our customer supply agreements, resulting in a shift in the industry toward shorter term pricing arrangements linked to the spot market. As a result, we renegotiated the terms of our supply agreements with our Chinese and Japanese Asia Pacific Iron Ore customers moving to shorter term pricing mechanisms of various durations based on the average daily spot prices, with certain pricing mechanisms that have a duration of up to a quarter. This change was effective in the first quarter of 2010 for our Chinese customers and the second quarter of 2010 for our Japanese customers. Based on timing of these changes, pricing settlements were finalized with customers during each of the 2010 quarters with the exception of the first quarter of 2010. Therefore, provisional pricing estimates were used during the first quarter of 2010 to reflect an increase of 26 percent over 2009 settled prices for both lump and fines based on provisional quarterly index pricing. The pricing estimates for the first quarter of 2010 reflected the increase in steel demand and spot prices for iron ore and were based upon index pricing mechanisms previously reported in the industry. In addition, sales to our Japanese customers during the first quarter of 2010 reflected 2009 prices based upon contract years of April 1 to March 31. 80 Table of Contents The following represents the historical accuracy of our provisional price estimates, as well as the impact on Product revenues resulting from the difference between the estimated change in price and the actual change in price for the quarters during 2010, 2009 and 2008 prior to settlement. The derivative instrument recorded during the first quarter of 2010 was settled during the second quarter of 2010 upon the move to short term pricing arrangements with Asia Pacific Iron Ore customers. The timing of the pricing settlements for 2009 and 2008 is described further in the table below.

Refer to NOTE 3 DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES, for further information. Mineral Reserves We regularly evaluate our economic mineral reserves and update them as required in accordance with SEC Industry Guide 7. The estimated mineral reserves could be affected by future industry conditions, geological conditions and ongoing mine planning. Maintenance of effective production capacity or the mineral reserve could require increases in capital and development expenditures. Generally as mining operations progress, haul lengths and lifts increase. Alternatively, changes in economic conditions, or the expected quality of mineral reserves could decrease capacity or mineral reserves. Technological progress could alleviate such factors, or increase capacity of mineral reserves. We use our mineral reserve estimates combined with our estimated annual production levels, to determine the mine closure dates utilized in recording the fair value liability for asset retirement obligations. Refer to NOTE 10 ENVIRONMENTAL AND MINE CLOSURE OBLIGATIONS, for further information. Since the liability represents the present value of the expected future obligation, a significant change in mineral reserves or mine lives would have a substantial effect on the recorded obligation. We also utilize economic mineral reserves for evaluating potential impairments of mine assets and in determining maximum useful lives utilized to calculate depreciation and amortization of long lived mine assets. Decreases in mineral reserves or mine lives could significantly affect these items. Asset Retirement Obligations and Environmental Remediation Costs The accrued mine closure obligations for our active mining operations provide for contractual and legal obligations associated with the eventual closure of the mining operations. Our obligations are determined based on detailed estimates adjusted for factors that a market participant would consider (i.e., inflation, overhead and profit), which are escalated at an assumed rate of inflation to the estimated closure dates, and then discounted 81 Table of Contents using the current credit adjusted risk free interest rate. The estimate also incorporates incremental increases in the closure cost estimates and changes in estimates of mine lives. The closure date for each location is determined based on the exhaustion date of the remaining iron ore reserves, which is dependent on our estimate of the economically recoverable mineral reserves. The estimated obligations are particularly sensitive to the impact of changes in mine lives given the difference between the inflation and discount rates. Changes in the base estimates of legal and contractual closure costs due to changes in legal or contractual requirements, available technology, inflation, overhead or profit rates would also have a significant impact on the recorded obligations. We have a formal policy for environmental protection and restoration. Our obligations for known environmental matters at active and closed mining operations and other sites have been recognized based on estimates of the cost of investigation and remediation at each site. If the obligation can only be estimated as a range of possible amounts, with no specific amount being more likely, the minimum of the range is accrued. Management reviews its environmental remediation sites quarterly to determine if additional cost adjustments or disclosures are required. The characteristics of environmental remediation obligations, where information concerning the nature and extent of clean up activities is not immediately available, and which are subject to changes in regulatory requirements, result in a significant risk of increase to the obligations as they mature. Expected future expenditures are not discounted to present value unless the amount and timing of the cash disbursements can be reasonably estimated. Potential insurance recoveries are not recognized until realized. Refer to NOTE 10 ENVIRONMENTAL AND MINE CLOSURE OBLIGATIONS, for further information. Income Taxes Our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect managements best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid. We are subject to income taxes in both the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax expense. Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent financial operations. In projecting future taxable income, we begin with historical results adjusted for the results of discontinued operations and changes in accounting policies and incorporate assumptions including the amount of future state, federal and foreign pretax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences, and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses. In evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide, we consider three years of cumulative operating income (loss). At December 31, 2010, we had a valuation allowance of $172.7 million against our deferred tax assets. Our losses in certain foreign locations in recent periods represented sufficient negative evidence to require a full valuation allowance against certain of our foreign deferred tax assets. We intend to maintain a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets until sufficient positive evidence exists to support the realization of such assets. Changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. Management is not aware of any such changes that would have a material effect on the Companys results of operations, cash flows or financial position. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. Accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements requires that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on technical merits. 82 Table of Contents We recognize tax liabilities in accordance with ASC 740, and we adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of evaluation of new information not previously available. Due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. These differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined. Goodwill Impairment In assessing the recoverability of our goodwill, significant assumptions regarding the estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of a reporting unit must be made, including among other things, estimates related to pricing, volume and reserves. The fair value of a reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow valuation model. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future as a result of changes in strategy or market conditions, we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets in the period such determination was made. Goodwill is allocated among and evaluated for impairment at the reporting unit level in the fourth quarter of each year. We determined that the fair value of the reporting units for which goodwill has been assigned was in excess of our carrying value as of December 31, 2010, and that we did not have any reporting units that were at risk of failing the first step of the goodwill impairment test. The fair values were substantially in excess of our carrying values for our North American Iron Ore, North American Coal, and Asia Pacific Iron Ore reporting units. The fair value of our Ferroalloys operating unit was not substantially in excess of our carrying values due the fact that this reporting unit is primarily comprised of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed through the Freewest and Spider acquisitions in 2010. Therefore, our carrying values for the Ferroalloys operating unit were recorded at fair value through the completion of these acquisitions. In addition to the annual impairment test required under U.S. GAAP, we assessed whether events or circumstances occurred that potentially indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable. Based on the assessment performed, we concluded that there were no such events or changes in circumstances during 2010. Consequently, no goodwill impairment charges were recorded in 2010. Refer to NOTE 1 BUSINESS SUMMARY AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, for further information regarding our policy on goodwill impairment. Asset Impairment In assessing the recoverability of our long lived assets, significant assumptions regarding the estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets must be made, as well as the related estimated useful lives. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future as a result of changes in strategy or market conditions, we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets in the period such determination was made. We monitor conditions that indicate that the carrying value of an asset or asset group may be impaired. In order to determine if assets have been impaired, assets are grouped and tested at the lowest level for which identifiable, independent cash flows are available. An impairment loss exists when projected undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the assets. The measurement of the impairment loss to be recognized is based on the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the assets. Fair value can be determined using a market approach, income approach or cost approach. The impairment analysis and fair value determination can result in substantially different outcomes based on critical assumptions and estimates including the quantity and quality of remaining economic ore reserves, future iron ore prices and production costs. Refer to NOTE 1 BUSINESS SUMMARY AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, for further information regarding our policy on asset impairment. Employee Retirement Benefit Obligations We offer defined benefit pension plans, defined contribution pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans, primarily consisting of retiree healthcare benefits, to most employees in North America as part of a total compensation and benefits program. This includes employees of PinnOak, who became employees of the 83 Table of Contents Company through the July 2007 acquisition, and employees of CLCC, who became employees of the Company through the July 2010 acquisition. Upon the acquisition of the remaining 73.2 percent interest in Wabush in February 2010, we fully consolidated the Canadian plans into our pension and OPEB obligations. We do not have employee retirement benefit obligations at our Asia Pacific Iron Ore operations. Following is a summary of our defined benefit pension and OPEB funding and expense for the years 2008 through 2011: (In Millions) Pension OPEB Funding Expense Funding Expense 2008 $ 24.9 $ 20.3 $ 19.7 $ 8.6 2009 18.5 50.8 35.7 25.5 2010 45.6 45.6 38.5 24.2 2011 (Estimated) 72.5 38.0 40.0 26.1 Assumptions used in determining the benefit obligations and the value of plan assets for defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefit plans (primarily retiree healthcare benefits) that we offer are evaluated periodically by management. Critical assumptions, such as the discount rate used to measure the benefit obligations, the expected long term rate of return on plan assets, the medical care cost trend, and the rate of compensation increase are reviewed annually. As of December 31, 2010, we used the following assumptions: Pension and OtherBenefits 2010 2009 U.S. plan discount rate 5.11 % 5.66 % Canadian plan discount rate 5.00 (1 ) Rate of compensation increase 4.00 4.00 U.S. expected return on plan assets 8.50 (1 ) Canadian expected return on plan assets 7.50 (1 ) (1) The Canadian plans were not consolidated into our pension and OPEB obligations prior to the acquisition of the remaining 73.2 percent interest in Wabush in February 2010. Additionally, on December 31, 2010, we adopted the IRS 2011 prescribed mortality tables (separate pre retirement and postretirement) to determine the expected life of our plan participants, replacing the IRS 2010 prescribed mortality tables for our U.S. plans. The assumed mortality remained the same as the previous year for our Canadian plans, UP 1994 with full projection. Following are sensitivities of potential further changes in these key assumptions on the estimated 2011 pension and OPEB expense and the pension and OPEB benefit obligations as of December 31, 2010: Increase inExpense(In Millions) Increase inBenefit Obligation(In Millions) Pension OPEB Pension OPEB Decrease discount rate .25 percent $ 1.7 $ 1.2 $ 27.5 $ 14.2 Decrease return on assets 1 percent 7.3 1.9 Increase medical trend rate 1 percent N/A 8.7 N/A 51.5 Changes in actuarial assumptions, including discount rates, employee retirement rates, mortality, compensation levels, plan asset investment performance, and healthcare costs, are determined based on analyses of actual and expected factors. Changes in actuarial assumptions and or investment performance of plan assets can have a significant impact on our financial condition due to the magnitude of our retirement obligations. Refer to NOTE 11 PENSIONS AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS in Item 8 for further information. 84 Table of Contents Forward Looking Statements This report contains statements that constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
