Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Overview Cliffs Natural Resources Inc. traces its corporate history back to 1847. Today, we are an international mining and natural resources company. A member of the S&P 500 Index, we are a major global iron ore producer and a significant producer of high and low volatile metallurgical coal. Our companys operations are organized according to product category and geographic location: U.S. Iron Ore, Eastern Canadian Iron Ore, North American Coal, Asia Pacific Iron Ore, Asia Pacific Coal, Latin American Iron Ore, Ferroalloys, and our Global Exploration Group. We have been executing a strategy designed to achieve scale in the mining industry and focused on serving the worlds largest and fastest growing steel markets. In the U.S. we operate five iron ore mines in Michigan and Minnesota, five metallurgical coal mines located in West Virginia and Alabama and one thermal coal mine located in West Virginia. We also operate two iron ore mines in Eastern Canada that provide iron ore to the seaborne market for Asian steel producers. Our Asia Pacific operations primarily are comprised of two iron ore mining complexes in Western Australia, serving the Asian iron ore markets with direct shipping fines and lump ore, and a 45 percent economic interest in a coking and thermal coal mine located in Queensland, Australia. In Latin America, we have a 30 percent interest in Amap&aacute;, a Brazilian iron ore operation, and in Ontario, Canada, we have a major chromite project in the pre feasibility stage of exploration. In addition, our Global Exploration Group is focused on early involvement in exploration activities to identify new world class projects for future development or projects that add significant value to existing operations. Our 2011 results were driven by increased steel production, higher demand and rising prices. Global crude steel production, the primary driver of our business, was up approximately five percent from 2010. This included increases of approximately nine and seven percent in China and the U.S., respectively, which are the two largest markets for the Company. China produced approximately 683 million metric tons of crude steel in 2011, representing approximately 46 percent of global production. The world price of iron ore is influenced heavily by international demand; and rising spot market prices for iron ore has reflected this trend. Our consolidated revenues for 2011 increased to $6.8 billion, with net income from continuing operations per diluted share of $11.61. This compares with revenues of $4.7 billion and net income from continuing operations per diluted share of $7.51 in 2010. Based upon the recent shift in the industry toward shorter term pricing arrangements linked to the spot market and away from the annual international benchmark pricing mechanism historically referenced in our customer supply agreements, pricing has continued to increase during 2011 compared to 2010. We have finalized short term pricing arrangements with our Asia Pacific Iron Ore customers and we have reached final pricing settlements with the majority of our U.S. Iron Ore customers for the 2011 contract year. However, in some cases we are still working to revise components of the pricing calculations referenced within our supply agreements to incorporate new pricing mechanisms as a result of the changes to historical benchmark pricing. In addition, in April 2011, we reached a negotiated settlement with ArcelorMittal USA with respect to our previously disclosed arbitrations and litigation resulting in additional revenue recorded in 2011. Revenues during 2011 were also impacted by higher iron ore sales volumes in Eastern Canada and higher metallurgical and thermal coal sales volumes in the U.S. that were made available through our acquisition of Consolidated Thompson and CLCC during the second quarter of 2011 and the third quarter of 2010, respectively. In Asia Pacific, the demand for steelmaking raw materials remained strong throughout 2011 primarily led by demand from China. Results in 2011 reflect strong performance at our operations around the world and improved pricing for our products. Our strong cash flow generation and positive outlook for our business are allowing us to resume our focus on investments in our assets, which will enable us to continue to pursue strategic objectives and enhance our long term operating performance, while also providing us with greater confidence and the ability to increase our cash payouts to shareholders. In 2011, we continued to align our balance sheet and enhance our financial flexibility to be consistent with our long term financial growth goals and objectives, including the completion of a public offering of senior notes in the aggregate principal amount of $1.0 billion, the completion of a $1.25 billion five year term loan, the 53 Table of Contents completion of a public offering of 10.35 million of our common shares that raised approximately $854 million and the execution of a five year unsecured amended and restated multicurrency credit agreement that resulted in, among other things, a $1.75 billion revolving credit facility. The senior notes offering consisted of a $700 million 10 year tranche and a $300 million 30 year tranche completed in March and April 2011, respectively. The net proceeds from the senior notes offering and the term loan were used to fund a portion of the purchase price for the acquisition of Consolidated Thompson and to pay the related fees and expenses. A portion of the net proceeds from the public offering of our common shares were used to repay the $750 million of borrowings under the bridge credit facility, with the remainder of the net proceeds to be used for general corporate purposes. Proceeds from the revolving credit facility will be used to refinance existing indebtedness, to finance general working capital needs and for other general corporate purposes, including the funding of acquisitions. In August 2011, $250 million was drawn against the revolving credit facility in order to pay down a portion of the term loan. All amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility were repaid in December 2011. Segments As a result of the acquisition of Consolidated Thompson, we have revised the number of our operating and reportable segments as determined under ASC 280. Our Companys primary operations are organized and managed according to product category and geographic location and now include: U.S. Iron Ore, Eastern Canadian Iron Ore, North American Coal, Asia Pacific Iron Ore, Asia Pacific Coal, Latin American Iron Ore, Ferroalloys and our Global Exploration Group. Our historical presentation of segment information consisted of three reportable segments: North American Iron Ore, North American Coal and Asia Pacific Iron Ore. Our restated presentation consists of four reportable segments: U.S. Iron Ore, Eastern Canadian Iron Ore, North American Coal and Asia Pacific Iron Ore. The amounts disclosed in NOTE 2 SEGMENT REPORTING reflects this restatement. Growth Strategy and Strategic Transactions Throughout 2011, we continued to increase our operating scale and presence as an international mining and natural resources company by maintaining our focus on integration and execution. Our strategy includes the continuing integration of our acquisition of Consolidated Thompson, which was acquired on May 12, 2011. The acquisition reflects our strategy to build scale by owning expandable and exportable steelmaking raw material assets serving international markets. Through our acquisition of Consolidated Thompson, we now own and operate an iron ore mine and processing facility near Bloom Lake in Quebec, Canada that produces high quality iron ore concentrate. WISCO is a 25 percent partner in Bloom Lake. The initial design of Bloom Lake operations is to achieve a production rate of 8.0 million metric tons of iron ore concentrate per year. Additional capital investments were approved by our Board of Directors in January 2012 in order to increase the initial production rate to 16.0 million metric tons of iron ore concentrate per year. We also own two additional development properties, Lam&ecirc;l&eacute;e and Peppler Lake, in Quebec. All three of these properties are in proximity to our existing Canadian operations and will allow us to leverage our port facilities and supply this iron ore to the seaborne market. The acquisition also is expected to further diversify our existing customer base. In addition to the integration of Consolidated Thompson, we have a number of capital projects underway in all of our reportable business segments. We believe these projects will continue to improve our operational performance, diversify our customer base and extend the reserve life of our portfolio of assets, all of which are necessary to sustain continued growth. Throughout 2012, we also will reinforce our global reorganization, as our leadership moves to an integrated global management structure. We also expect to achieve growth through early involvement in exploration and development activities by partnering with junior mining companies, which provide us low cost entry points for potentially significant reserve additions. 54 Table of Contents Results of Operations Consolidated 2011 Compared to 2010 The following is a summary of our consolidated results of operations for 2011 compared with 2010: (In Millions) 2011 2010 VarianceFavorable/(Unfavorable) Revenues from product sales and services $ 6,794.3 $ 4,682.1 $ 2,112.2 Cost of goods sold and operating expenses (4,105.7 ) (3,155.6 ) (950.1 ) Sales Margin $ 2,688.6 $ 1,526.5 $ 1,162.1 Sales Margin % 39.6 % 32.6 % 7.0 % Revenue from Product Sales and Services Sales revenue in 2011 increased $2.1 billion, or 45.1 percent from 2010. The increase in sales revenue primarily was due to higher pricing related to our iron ore segments. At our U.S. Iron Ore operating segment, in April 2011, we reached a negotiated settlement with ArcelorMittal USA with respect to our previously disclosed arbitrations and litigation regarding price re opener entitlements for 2009 and 2010 and pellet nominations for 2010 and 2011. The settlement included a pricing true up for pellet volumes delivered to certain ArcelorMittal USA steelmaking facilities in North America during both 2009 and 2010 and resulted in an additional $280.9 million of revenue at our U.S. Iron Ore operating segment during 2011. Revenues also included the impact of $23.4 million related to the finalization of pricing on sales for Algomas 2010 pellet nomination that occurred during the first half of 2011. Our realized sales price for our U.S. Iron Ore operations during 2011 was an average increase per ton of 40 percent over 2010, or an increase per ton of 28 percent excluding the impact of the arbitration settlement with ArcelorMittal USA. The realized sales price for our Eastern Canadian Iron Ore operations was on average a nine percent increase per metric ton for 2011 when compared to 2010. In 2011, our Eastern Canadian Iron Ore sales included both iron ore pellets and concentrate, whereas our 2010 sales only included iron ore pellets. The increase in our realized price during 2011 at our Asia Pacific Iron Ore operating segment was on average a 38 percent and 24 percent increase for lump and fines, respectively, over the prior year. Higher sales volumes at our Eastern Canadian Iron Ore and North American Coal operating segments also contributed to the increase in our consolidated revenue for 2011. Compared to 2010, sales volumes increased over 100 percent at Eastern Canadian Iron Ore in 2011 due to increased sales of iron ore concentrate made available through our acquisition of Consolidated Thompson during the second quarter of 2011. In addition, sales volumes increased 26.6 percent at North American Coal in 2011 due to increased sales of metallurgical and thermal coal made available through our acquisition of CLCC during the third quarter of 2010. Refer to Results of Operations Segment Information for additional information regarding the impact of specific factors that impacted revenue during the period. Cost of Goods Sold and Operating Expenses Cost of goods sold and operating expenses was $4.1 billion in 2011, an increase of $1.0 billion, or 30 percent compared with 2010. The increase primarily was attributable to higher sales volumes at our Eastern Canadian Iron Ore and North American Coal business operations as a result of acquisitions in 2011 and 2010, respectively. The increase in the sales volumes at Eastern Canadian Iron Ore, due to the acquisition of Consolidated Thompson, resulted in $431.0 million of additional costs in 2011, and the increase in sales volumes at North American Coal, due to the acquisition of CLCC, resulted in incremental cost increases of $138.7 million when compared to 2010. Cost of goods sold and operating expenses also were impacted by cost rate increases of $112.1 million, $61.6 million and $75.8 million, respectively, at U.S. Iron Ore, Eastern Canadian Iron Ore and Asia Pacific Iron Ore segments. These cost increases were primarily a result of higher expenditures on plant 55 Table of Contents repairs and maintenance, increased mining costs and higher energy costs in 2011. In addition, costs were negatively impacted by $72.2 million and $18.4 million of unfavorable foreign exchange rates at our Asia Pacific Iron Ore and Eastern Canadian Iron Ore segments, respectively, when compared to 2010. Refer to Results of Operations Segment Information for additional information regarding the impact of specific factors that impacted our operating results during the period. Other Operating Income (Expense) Following is a summary of other operating income (expense) for 2011 and 2010: (In Millions) 2011 2010 VarianceFavorable/(Unfavorable) Selling, general and administrative expenses $ (274.4 ) $ (202.1 ) $ (72.3 ) Exploration costs (80.5 ) (33.7 ) (46.8 ) Impairment of goodwill (27.8 ) (27.8 ) Consolidated Thompson acquisition costs (25.4 ) (25.4 ) Miscellaneous net 68.1 (20.5 ) 88.6 $ (340.0 ) $ (256.3 ) $ (83.7 ) Selling, general and administrative expenses in 2011 increased $72.3 million over the same periods in 2010. These increases primarily were due to additional selling, general and administrative expenses of $14.9 million related to our Montreal office and service activities related to our Bloom Lake operations, which we acquired in May 2011, and $29.1 million of higher employee compensation in 2011. 2011 also was impacted by $27.0 million of higher technology and office related costs and higher outside services costs, primarily comprised of legal and information technology consulting. The increases to selling, general and administrative expenses were offset slightly by a $4.5 million decrease in our partner profit sharing expenses incurred during 2011. The increase in exploration costs of $46.8 million for year ended December 31, 2011 over the prior year primarily was due to increases in costs at our Global Exploration Group and our Ferroalloys operating segment. Our Global Exploration Group had cost increases of $28.3 million in 2011 related to our involvement in exploration activities, as the group focuses on identifying mineral resources for future development or projects that are intended to add significant value to existing operations. The increases at our Ferroalloys operating segment primarily were comprised of increases in environmental and engineering costs and other pre feasibility costs in 2011 of $22.5 million. Upon performing our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2011, a goodwill impairment charge of $27.8 million was recorded for our CLCC reporting unit within the North American Coal operating segment. The fair value was determined using a combination of a discounted cash flow model and valuations of comparable businesses. The impairment charge for the CLCC reporting unit was driven by our overall outlook on coal pricing in light of economic conditions, increases in our anticipated costs to bring the Lower War Eagle mine into production and increases in our anticipated sustaining capital cost for the lives of the CLCC mines that currently are operating. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we incurred acquisition costs related to our acquisition of Consolidated Thompson of $25.4 million. The acquisition costs primarily were comprised of investment banker fees and legal fees incurred throughout the negotiation and completion of the acquisition. Miscellaneous net income increased $88.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 over 2010. The increase primarily was attributable to the $20.0 million gain we recognized on foreign currency remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities in our Australian and Canadian operations during 2011 as compared to the $39.1 million loss recognized in 2010. Additionally, we recognized incremental income of $16.1 million during 2011 from the sale of certain assets, including those assets related to our ownership of Cliffs Erie. We also recognized $13.7 million of insurance recoveries net of casualty losses related to the tornado damage at our Oak Grove mine in April 2011. 56 Table of Contents Other income (expense) Following is a summary of other income (expense) for 2011 and 2010: (In Millions) 2011 2010 VarianceFavorable/(Unfavorable) Gain on acquisition of controlling interest $ $ 40.7 $ (40.7 ) Changes in fair value of foreign currency contracts, net 101.9 39.8 62.1 Interest income 9.5 9.9 (0.4 ) Interest expense (216.5 ) (70.1 ) (146.4 ) Other non operating income (expense) (2.0 ) 12.5 (14.5 ) $ (107.1 ) $ 32.8 $ (139.9 ) As a result of acquiring the remaining ownership interests in Freewest and Wabush during the first quarter of 2010, our 2010 results were impacted by realized gains of $38.6 million primarily related to the increase in fair value of our previous ownership interest in each investment held prior to the business acquisition. The fair value of our previous 12.4 percent interest in Freewest was $27.4 million on January 27, 2010, the date of acquisition, resulting in a gain of $13.6 million being recognized in 2010. The fair value of our previous 26.8 percent equity interest in Wabush was $38.0 million on February 1, 2010, resulting in a gain of $25.0 million also being recognized in 2010. Refer to NOTE 4 ACQUISITIONS AND OTHER INVESTMENTS for further information. The favorable changes in the fair value of our foreign currency exchange contracts held as economic hedges during 2011 in the Statements of Consolidated Operations primarily were a result of hedging a portion of the purchase price for the acquisition of Consolidated Thompson through Canadian dollar foreign currency exchange forward contracts and an option contract. The favorable changes in fair value of these Canadian dollar foreign currency exchange forward contracts and option contract for the year ended December 31, 2011 were a result of net realized gains of $93.1 million realized upon the maturity of the related contracts during the second quarter of 2011. In addition, favorable changes in the fair value of our Australian dollar foreign currency contracts resulted in net realized gains of $43.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, based upon the maturity of $215 million of outstanding contracts during the period. Of these gains, $34.9 million were recognized in previous periods as mark to market adjustments as part of the changes in fair value of these instruments. Favorable changes in the fair value of our outstanding Australian dollar foreign currency contracts resulted in mark to market adjustments of $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, based upon the Australian to U.S. dollar spot rate of 1.02 as of December 31, 2011. The spot rate as of the end of 2011 remained flat when compared to the Australian to U.S. dollar spot rate of 1.02 as of December 31, 2010. The following table represents our Australian dollar foreign currency exchange contract position for contracts held as economic hedges as of December 31, 2011: ($ in Millions) Contract Maturity Notional Amount Weighted AverageExchange Rate Spot Rate Fair Value Contract Portfolio (1): Contracts expiring in the next 12 months $ 15.0 0.86 1.02 $ 2.8 Total Hedge Contract Portfolio $ 15.0 $ 2.8 (1) Includes collar options. 57 Table of Contents Refer to NOTE 3 DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES for further information. The increase in interest expense in 2011 compared with 2010 is attributable to higher debt levels to support acquisition activity. This included the recognition of a full year of interest expense in 2011 related to the $1 billion public offering of senior notes that was completed in September 2010 consisting of two tranches: a $500 million 10 year tranche at a 4.80 percent fixed interest rate and a $500 million 30 year tranche at a 6.25 percent fixed interest rate. We completed an additional $1 billion public offering of senior notes during the first half of 2011 consisting of two tranches: a $700 million 10 year tranche at a 4.875 percent fixed interest rate and a $300 million 30 year tranche at a 6.25 percent fixed interest rate. These 2011 public offerings were completed in March and April 2011, respectively. During the second quarter of 2011, we borrowed $1.25 billion under the five year term loan and we terminated the bridge credit facility that we entered into to provide a portion of the financing for the acquisition of Consolidated Thompson. The termination of the bridge credit facility resulted in the realization of $38.3 million of debt issuance cost related to the bridge credit facility during 2011. In August 2011, we entered into a five year unsecured amended and restated multicurrency credit agreement that resulted in, among other things, a $1.75 billion revolving credit facility that was used to pay down $250 million of the term loan. The weighted average annual interest rate under the revolving credit facility and the term loan was 1.84 percent and 1.40 percent, respectively, from each of the respective borrowing dates through December 31, 2011. All amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility were repaid in full on December 12, 2011. See NOTE 7 DEBT AND CREDIT FACILITIES for further information. Income Taxes Our tax rate is affected by recurring items, such as depletion and tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and the relative amount of income we earn in our various jurisdictions with tax rates that differ from the U.S. statutory rate. It is also affected by discrete items that may occur in any given year, but are not consistent from year to year. The following represents a summary of our tax provision and corresponding effective rates for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010: (In Millions) 2011 2010 Income tax expense $ 420.1 $ 293.50 Effective tax rate 18.7 % 22.5 % A reconciliation of the statutory tax rate to the effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 is as follows: 2011 2010 U.S. statutory rate 35.0 % 35.0 % Increases/(Decreases) due to: Non taxable income related to noncontrolling interests (2.8 ) Percentage depletion (6.9 ) (7.9 ) Impact of foreign operations (2.2 ) (6.9 ) Income not subject to tax (3.0 ) Non taxable hedging income (1.5 ) State taxes 0.3 Manufacturers deduction (0.5 ) Valuation allowance 2.4 6.6 Tax uncertainties 0.3 Other items net 0.9 1.0 Effective income tax rate before discrete items 22.0 27.8 Discrete items (3.3 ) (5.3 ) Effective income tax rate 18.7 % 22.5 % 58 Table of Contents Our tax provision for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 was $420.1 million, for an 18.7 percent effective tax rate, and $293.5 million, for a 22.5 percent effective tax rate, respectively. The difference in the effective tax rate for 2011 compared with 2010 is primarily a result of the inclusion of the remeasurement of foreign deferred tax assets and liabilities related to the Consolidated Thompson acquisition, the non taxable income related to our noncontrolling interest in partnerships, income not subject to tax and the change in the valuation allowance relating to ordinary losses of certain foreign operations for which utilization is currently uncertain. Discrete items as of December 31, 2011 relate to foreign exchange remeasurement, prior year adjustments related to the filing of the 2010 tax returns in multiple jurisdictions, audit closures, statute expiration and interest related to unrecognized tax benefits. Discrete items for 2010 related to expenses resulting from the PPACA and the Reconciliation Act that were signed into law in March 2010, expenses related to prior year U.S. and foreign income tax provisions recognized in 2010 and interest related to unrecognized tax benefits. As mentioned above, the PPACA and the Reconciliation Act were signed into law in 2010. As a result of these two acts, tax benefits available to employers that receive the Medicare Part D subsidy are reduced beginning in years ending after December 31, 2012. The income tax effect related to the acts for year ended 2010 was an increase to expense, recorded discretely, of $16.1 million, representing approximately 1.2 percent of the effective tax rate. The amount recorded was related to the postretirement prescription drug benefits computed after the elimination of the deduction for the Medicare Part D subsidy beginning in taxable years ending after December 31, 2012. The valuation allowance of $223.9 million as of December 31, 2011 reflects an increase of $51.2 million from December 31, 2010. This primarily relates to ordinary losses of certain foreign operations for which utilization is uncertain. See NOTE 12 INCOME TAXES for further information. Equity Income (Loss) from Ventures Equity income (loss) from ventures primarily is comprised of our share of the results from Amap&aacute; and AusQuest, for which we have a 30 percent ownership interest in each. The equity income (loss) from ventures for the year ended December 31, 2011 of $9.7 million compares to equity income (loss) from ventures for year ended December 31, 2010 of $13.5 million. The equity income for 2011 primarily is comprised of our share of the operating results of our equity method investment in Amap&aacute;, which consisted of operating income of $32.4 million for year ended December 31, 2011, compared with operating income of $17.2 million for 2010. Amap&aacute;s equity income increased during 2011 due to increased sales volume and higher pricing. This equity income was offset partially by the impairment taken on our investment in AusQuest of $19.1 million during 2011 related to the decline in the fair value of our ownership interest, which was determined to be other than temporary. We evaluated the severity of the decline in the fair value of the investment as compared to our historical carrying amount, considering the broader macroeconomic conditions and the status of current exploration prospects, and could not reasonably assert that the impairment period would be temporary. Noncontrolling Interest Noncontrolling Interest is comprised of the 25 percent noncontrolling interest related to Bloom Lake and the 21 percent noncontrolling interest related to the Empire mining venture. WISCO is a 25 percent partner in Bloom Lake, resulting in a noncontrolling interest adjustment of $56.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 for WISCOs ownership percentage. A subsidiary of ArcelorMittal USA is a 21 percent partner in the Empire mining venture, resulting in a noncontrolling interest adjustment of $136.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 for ArcelorMittal USAs ownership percentage. The noncontrolling interest adjustment for ArcelorMittal USAs ownership percentage has been recognized prospectively as of September 30, 2011. See NOTE 1 BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES for further information. 59 Table of Contents 2010 Compared to 2009 The following is a summary of our consolidated results of operations for 2010 compared with 2009: (In Millions) 2010 2009 VarianceFavorable/(Unfavorable) Revenues from product sales and services $ 4,682.1 $ 2,342.0 $ 2,340.1 Cost of goods sold and operating expenses (3,155.6 ) (2,030.3 ) (1,125.3 ) Sales Margin $ 1,526.5 $ 311.7 $ 1,214.8 Sales Margin % 32.6 % 13.3 % 19.3 % Revenue from Product Sales and Services Sales revenue in 2010 increased $2.3 billion, or 100 percent from 2009. The increase in sales revenue primarily was due to higher sales volume and pricing related to our Asia Pacific and North American business operations. Sales volume increased 68 percent at U.S. Iron Ore and 22 percent at Eastern Canadian Iron Ore in 2010 when compared to 2009. Sales volume for North American Coal was 75 percent higher than 2009. Improved market conditions throughout 2010 led to increased production in the North American steel industry, and in turn higher demand for iron ore and metallurgical coal. Higher sales volumes in 2010 also were attributable to increased sales of Wabush pellets, made available through our acquisition of full ownership of the mine during the first quarter of 2010, and increased sales of metallurgical and thermal coal, made available through our acquisition of CLCC during the third quarter of 2010. Higher sales prices also contributed to the increase in our consolidated revenue for the year ended 2010 compared to year ended 2009. During 2010, a shift in the industry toward shorter term pricing arrangements that were linked to the spot market and elimination of the annual benchmark system caused us to reassess and, in some cases, renegotiate the terms of certain of our supply agreements, primarily with our U.S. Iron Ore and Asia Pacific Iron Ore customers. We renegotiated the terms of our supply agreements with our Chinese and Japanese Asia Pacific Iron Ore customers and moved to shorter term pricing mechanisms of various durations based on the average daily spot prices, with certain pricing mechanisms that have a duration of up to a quarter. The change was affective in the first quarter of 2010 for our Chinese customers and the second quarter of 2010 for our Japanese customers. The increase in 2010 pricing was on average an 87 percent and 98 percent increase for lump and fines, respectively. In North America, we reached final pricing settlement with some of our U.S. Iron Ore and Eastern Canadian Iron Ore customers through the fourth quarter of 2011. The increase in 2010 pricing was an average increase of 98 percent over 2009 prices for contracts based on world pellet prices. Although pricing had been settled with some of our North American customers for 2010 for the 2010 contract year, we were still in the process of assessing the impact a change to the historical annual pricing mechanism would have on certain of our larger existing U.S. Iron Ore and Eastern Canadian Iron Ore customer supply agreements that extend over multiple years, and negotiations were still ongoing with these customers. Refer to Results of Operations Segment Information for additional information regarding the impact of specific factors that impacted revenue during the period. Cost of Goods Sold and Operating Expenses Cost of goods sold and operating expenses were $3.2 billion in 2010, an increase of $1.1 billion, or 55 percent compared with 2009. The increase in 2010 primarily was attributable to higher costs at our U.S. Iron Ore, Eastern Canadian Iron Ore and Asia Pacific business operations as a result of higher sales volume, offset partially by lower idle expense at our U.S. Iron Ore and Eastern Canadian businesses as a result of higher production levels in 2010 to meet increasing customer demand. Costs also were negatively impacted in 2010 by approximately $125.3 million related to unfavorable foreign exchange rates compared with the same period in 60 Table of Contents 2009, $35.3 million of inventory step up and amortization of purchase price adjustments related to the accounting for the acquisition of the remaining interest in Wabush and $143.3 million related to higher royalty expenses, maintenance and repairs spending, energy and labor rates and stripping and recovery costs at our U.S. Iron Ore and Eastern Canadian Iron Ore operations. Refer to Results of Operations Segment Information for additional information regarding the impact of specific factors that impacted our operating results during the period. Other Operating Income (Expense) Following is a summary of other operating income (expense) for 2010 and 2009: (In Millions) 2010 2009 VarianceFavorable/(Unfavorable) Selling, general and administrative expenses $ (202.1 ) $ (117.6 ) $ (84.5 ) Exploration costs (33.7 ) (33.7 ) Miscellaneous net (20.5 ) 42.0 (62.5 ) $ (256.3 ) $ (75.6 ) $ (180.7 ) The increase in selling, general and administrative expense of $84.5 million in 2010 compared with 2009 primarily was due to higher compensation costs of $25.8 million, additional performance royalty expense for our investment in Sonoma of $26.3 million and various other costs totaling $19.7 million. These various other costs consisted of outside professional service costs associated with 2010 acquisition activity and related arbitrations, higher insurance premiums and higher technology costs. The exploration costs of $33.7 million for 2010 primarily were due to costs incurred at our Global Exploration Group and our Ferroalloys operating segment. We incurred costs of $16.6 million related to the Ferroalloys operating segment that primarily were comprised of feasibility study costs of $11.0 million, drilling costs of $1.6 million and other administrative expenses of $1.6 million. In addition, we incurred $13.1 million in 2010 related to our involvement in exploration activities, as our Global Exploration Group focuses on identifying new world class projects for future development or projects that are intended to add significant value to existing operations. Miscellaneous net losses of $20.5 million in 2010 primarily related to foreign exchange losses on our Australian bank accounts that are denominated in U.S. dollars and short term intercompany loans that are denominated in Australian dollars, as a result of the increased exchange rates during the period from A$0.90 at December 31, 2009 to A$1.02 at December 31, 2010. In 2009, we had gains on foreign currency transactions related to short term intercompany loans to our Australian subsidiaries denominated in Australian dollars, as a result of the increased exchange rates during the period from A$0.69 at December 31, 2008 to A$0.90 at December 31, 2009. Additionally, in 2009, there was a gain on sales of assets of $13.2 million primarily related to the Asia Pacific Iron Ore sale of its 50 percent interest in Irvine Island iron ore project to its joint venture partner, Pluton Resources. The consideration received consisted of a cash payment of approximately $5.0 million and the issuance of 19.4 million shares in Pluton Resources, all of which resulted in recognition of a gain on sale amounting to $12.1 million. 61 Table of Contents Other income (expense) Following is a summary of other income (expense) for 2010 and 2009: (In Millions) 2010 2009 VarianceFavorable/(Unfavorable) Gain on acquisition of controlling interest $ 40.7 $ $ 40.7 Changes in fair value of foreign currency contracts, net 39.8 85.7 (45.9 ) Interest income 9.9 10.8 (0.90 ) Interest expense (70.1 ) (39.0 ) (31.1 ) Other non operating income 12.5 2.9 9.6 $ 32.8 $ 60.4 $ (27.6 ) As a result of acquiring the remaining ownership interests in Freewest and Wabush during the first quarter of 2010, our 2010 results were impacted by realized gains of $38.6 million primarily related to the increase in fair value of our previous ownership interest in each investment held prior to the business acquisition. The fair value of our previous 12.4 percent interest in Freewest was $27.4 million on January 27, 2010, the date of acquisition, resulted in a gain of $13.6 million recognized in 2010. The fair value of our previous 26.8 percent equity interest in Wabush was $38.0 million on February 1, 2010, resulted in a gain of $25.0 million also recognized in 2010. Refer to NOTE 4 ACQUISITIONS AND OTHER INVESTMENTS for further information. The impact of changes in the fair value of our foreign currency exchange contracts held as economic hedges in the Statements of Consolidated Operations was due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates during 2010. The favorable changes in fair value of our foreign currency contracts of $39.8 million in 2010 related to the Australian to the U.S. dollar spot rate of A$1.02 as of December 31, 2010, which increased from the Australian to U.S. dollar spot rate of A$0.90 as of December 31, 2009. The changes in the spot rates were correlated to the appreciation of the Australian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar during 2010. In addition, we entered into additional foreign exchange contracts during 2010 that resulted in the notional amount of outstanding contracts in our foreign exchange hedge book increasing from $108.5 million at December 31, 2009 to $230.0 million at December 31, 2010. During 2010, approximately $228.5 million of outstanding contracts matured and resulted in a cumulative net realized gain of $12.2 million since inception of the contracts.

In the first quarter of 2010, we completed a $400 million public offering of 10 year senior notes at a 5.90 percent fixed interest rate. In addition, a $1 billion public offering of senior notes was completed in the third quarter of 2010 consisting of two tranches: a $500 million 10 year tranche at a 4.80 percent fixed interest rate and a 500 million 30 year tranche at a 6.25 percent fixed interest rate. See NOTE 7 DEBT AND CREDIT FACILITIES for further information. Income Taxes Our tax rate is affected by recurring items, such as depletion and tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and the relative amount of income we earn in our various jurisdictions with tax rates that differ from the U.S. statutory rate. It is also affected by discrete items that may occur in any given year, but are not consistent from year to year. The following represents a summary of our tax provision and corresponding effective rates for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009: (In Millions) 2010 2009 Income tax expense $ 293.5 $ 22.5 Effective tax rate 22.5 % 7.6 % A reconciliation of the statutory tax rate to the effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 is as follows: 2010 2009 U.S. statutory rate 35.0 % 35.0 % Increases/(Decreases) due to: Percentage depletion (7.9 ) (11.4 ) Impact of foreign operations (6.9 ) (8.9 ) Valuation allowance 6.6 11.6 Other items net 1.0 0.4 Effective income tax rate before discrete items 27.8 26.7 Discrete items (5.3 ) (19.1 ) Effective income tax rate 22.5 % 7.6 % Our tax provision for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 was $293.5 million, for a 22.5 percent effective tax rate, and $22.5 million, for a 7.6 percent effective tax rate, respectively. The difference in the effective tax rate for 2010 compared with 2009 primarily was a result of discrete items that occurred during the year, as discussed below. Discrete items included the expense that resulted from the PPACA and the Reconciliation Act signed into law in March 2010. The income tax effect related to the acts for the year ended 2010 was an increase to expense, recorded discretely, of $16.1 million, representing approximately 1.2 percent of the effective tax rate. Other discrete items related to legal entity restructuring, prior year U.S. and foreign provision benefits recognized in 2010 and interest expense related to unrecognized tax benefits. Discrete items for 2009 related to the benefits associated with the settlement of tax audits and filings for prior years. The valuation allowance of $172.7 million against certain deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2010 primarily related to ordinary losses of certain foreign operations. See NOTE 12 INCOME TAXES for further information. 63 Table of Contents Equity Income (Loss) in Ventures Equity income (loss) from ventures primarily was comprised of our share of the results from Amap&aacute; and AusQuest, for which we have a 30 percent ownership interest in each. The equity income (loss) from ventures for the year ended December 31, 2010 of $13.5 million primarily represented our share of the operating results of our equity method investment in Amap&aacute;. Such results consisted of income of $17.2 million. During 2010, we recorded income of $12.9 million related to the reversal of certain accruals. In addition, during the second quarter of 2010, Amap&aacute; repaid its total project debt outstanding, for which we provided a several guarantee on our 30 percent share. Upon repayment of the project debt, our obligations under the provisions of the guarantee arrangement were relieved, and our estimate of the aggregate fair value of the outstanding guarantee of $6.7 million was reversed through Equity income (loss) from ventures for year ended December 31, 2010. Apart from the reversal of the debt guarantee and the reversal of certain accruals, our investment in Amap&aacute; realized nearly break even operating results in 2010. This compared with equity losses related to Amap&aacute; of $62.2 million in 2009. The negative operating results in 2009 primarily were due to slower than anticipated ramp up of operations and product yields. Results of Operations Segment Information Our company is organized and managed according to product category and geographic location. Segment information reflects our strategic business units, which are organized to meet customer requirements and global competition. We evaluate segment performance based on sales margin, defined as revenues less cost of goods sold and operating expenses identifiable to each segment. This measure of operating performance is an effective measurement as we focus on reducing production costs throughout the Company. 2011 Compared to 2010 U.S. Iron Ore Following is a summary of U.S. Iron Ore results for 2011 and 2010: (In Millions) Change due to 2011 2010 ArcelorMittalSettlement Sales Priceand Rate SalesVolume Idle cost/Productionvolumevariance Freight andreimbursements Totalchange Revenues from product sales and services $ 3,509.9 $ 2,443.7 $ 280.9 $ 662.9 $ 121.5 $ $ 0.9 $ 1,066.2 Cost of goods sold and operating expenses (1,830.6 ) (1,655.3 ) (112.1 ) (76.0 ) 13.7 (0.9 ) (175.3 ) Sales margin $ 1,679.3 $ 788.4 $ 280.9 $ 550.8 $ 45.5 $ 13.7 $ $ 890.9 Sales tons (1) 24.2 23.0 Production tons (1): Total 31.0 28.1 Cliffs share of total 23.7 21.5 (1) Long tons of pellets (2,240 pounds). Sales margin for U.S. Iron Ore was $1.7 billion for 2011, compared with a sales margin of $788.4 million for 2010. The improvement over the prior year is attributable to an increase in revenue of $1.1 billion, offset partially by an increase in cost of goods sold and operating expenses of $175.3 million. The increase in revenue was a result of improvements in sales prices and volumes, as well as the ArcelorMittal USA price re opener settlement, which caused revenue to increase $662.9 million, $121.5 million and $280.9 million, respectively, over 2010. The increase in sales price was driven by higher market pricing during 2011. Sales prices realized at U.S. Iron Ore were positively impacted by the industrys shift toward shorter term pricing arrangements linked to 64 Table of Contents the spot market and by sales tons to seaborne customers at market based rates. Historically, U.S. Iron Ore has not provided sales tons to seaborne customers. We provided 1.2 million sales tons to seaborne customers in 2011 compared to 0.3 million sales tons in 2010. In addition, revenue in 2011 included $178.0 million related to supplemental contract payments compared with $120.2 million in 2010. The overall increase between years relates to the estimated rise in average annual hot band steel pricing for one of our U.S. Iron Ore customers. As previously disclosed, we reached a negotiated settlement with ArcelorMittal USA in April 2011 with respect to our previously disclosed arbitrations and litigation regarding price re opener entitlements for 2009 and 2010 and pellet nominations for 2010 and 2011. The financial results for the first half of 2011 included $255.6 million of the price re opener settlement, with an additional $25.3 million recognized during the latter half of 2011 upon the shipment of additional tons under the 2010 pellet nomination. Sales prices for 2011 also increased by $23.4 million as a result of finalizing prices on sales for Algomas 2010 pellet nomination, due to the previously announced arbitration agreement. Our realized sales price during 2011 was an average increase per ton of 40 percent over 2010, or an increase per ton of 28 percent excluding the impact of the arbitration settlement with ArcelorMittal USA. The increase in sales volume was partially due to 652 thousand tons related to a subsidiary of ArcelorMittal USAs noncontrolling interest in the Empire mining venture that has been prospectively recognized through product revenue. In addition, sales volumes increased during 2011 due to increases in customer demand that were driven primarily by increased blast furnace utilization rates at several of our customer locations, and due to incremental sales volumes that also were recognized over 2010 due to sales tons to seaborne customers during the 2011 period, as discussed earlier. We also recognized $24.1 million of additional revenue on a customer shipment as the related payments were made in the fourth quarter of 2011, compared to the fourth quarter of 2010 shipments for the same customer that were not recognized due to the timing of cash receipts. These increases during 2011 were offset partially when comparing to 2010 by 785 thousand carryover tons from 2009 that were recognized as sales in 2010 due to timing of shipments. Cost of goods sold and operating expenses in 2011 increased $175.3 million from the prior year predominantly as a result of: Higher cost rates of $112.1 million during 2011 primarily due to: Increased mining costs of $40.0 million; Higher spending for maintenance and repair projects of $29.6 million; Increased depreciation of $30.5 million and; Higher energy rates of $50.9 million; Offset partially by improved cost leverage driving down the cost rate by $43.6 million at some of our mines as production volume increased and by the liquidation of $10.6 million of previous LIFO layers that were at lower rates. Higher sales volumes also resulted in higher costs of $76.0 million compared to 2010. See NOTE 1 BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES for further information regarding the accounting adjustments for the Empire partnership arrangement. Production We increased production at all of our facilities during 2011 to ensure we are positioned to meet customer demand. During 2011, Northshore operated all of its four furnaces, compared to the three furnaces that were operating during most of 2010 as the fourth furnace was not restarted until September 2010. Additionally, 2010 results at Northshore and Tilden were impacted by repair activities. Production also increased at Hibbing in 2011 as compared to 2010 due to the shutdown of this location through April 1, 2010, as a result of the economic downturn. The production results for 2011 also include 652 thousand tons related to a subsidiary of ArcelorMittal USAs noncontrolling interest in the Empire mining venture that has been prospectively included 65 Table of Contents within our share of the mines production results. As previously announced, we plan to curtail production at Empire during 2012 as a result of planned blast furnace maintenance at one of our customers facilities.

(2) Results include our 100 percent ownership of Wabush since our acquisition of the remaining 73.2 percent interest on February 1, 2010. (3) Metric tons (2,205 pounds). Sales margin for Eastern Canadian Iron Ore was $290.9 million for 2011, compared with a sales margin of $133.6 million for 2010. The improvement over last year is attributable to an increase in revenue of $700.4 million, primarily due to the acquisition of Consolidated Thompson. Eastern Canadian Iron Ore sold 7.4 million metric tons during 2011 compared with 3.3 million metric tons during 2010. This increase in sales volume is attributable directly to 3.9 million metric tons of additional sales due to the acquisition of Consolidated Thompson, resulting in $571.0 million of additional revenue for 2011. In addition, sales volumes at Wabush resulted in $37.5 million of additional revenue over 2010 driven largely by increases in demand and the timing of our acquisition of the remaining interest in Wabush during February 2010. The increase in revenue is also a result of improvement in sales price, which caused revenue to increase $91.9 million over the comparable prior year period. Our realized sales price for 2011 over 2010 was on average a nine percent increase per metric ton, due to higher prices for iron ore due to worldwide demand. The increase in revenue was offset partially by increases in cost of goods sold and operating expenses during 2011, which increased by $543.1 million primarily due to: Significant increase in sales volume as a result of the acquisition of Consolidated Thompson, resulting in $431.0 million of additional cost for 2011. This includes the impact of expensing $59.8 million of stepped up value inventory that resulted from the purchase accounting for the acquisition of Consolidated Thompson. Increase in costs at our Eastern Canadian pellet operations during 2011 as a result of: Higher spending of $40.2 million related to plant structures and repairs; Unfavorable fixed cost leverage driving up the cost rate by $18.2 million as pellet production volume decreased. Higher pellet sales volumes also resulted in higher costs of $22.4 million compared to 2010. $18.4 million related to unfavorable foreign exchange rate variances. 66 Table of Contents Production The increase in production levels over the prior year is the result of our acquisition of Consolidated Thompson during the second quarter of 2011. Since the acquisition date, Bloom Lake produced 3.5 million metric tons of iron ore concentrate. Production at Wabush remained relatively flat for 2011; however, operational setbacks were experienced at Wabush during the fourth quarter of 2011, causing a slight production shortfall compared to the same period in 2010. North American Coal Following is a summary of North American Coal results for 2011 and 2010: (In Millions) Change due to 2011 2010 (1) CLCCAcquisition Sales Priceand Rate SalesVolume Idle cost/Productionvolumevariance Freight andreimbursements Totalchange Revenues from product sales and services $ 512.1 $ 438.2 $ 151.7 $ 31.1 $ (85.3 ) $ $ (23.6 ) $ 73.9 Cost of goods sold and operating expenses (570.5 ) (466.8 ) (138.7 ) (22.4 ) 82.7 (48.9 ) 23.6 (103.7 ) Sales margin $ (58.4 ) $ (28.6 ) $ 13.0 $ 8.7 $ (2.6 ) $ (48.9 ) $ $ (29.8 ) Sales tons 4.2 3.3 Production tons (2) 5.0 3.2 (1) CLCC was acquired on July 30, 2010. Therefore, the 2010 results reflect the impact of the CLCC acquistion since that date. (2) Tons are short tons (2,000 pounds). We reported sales margin loss for North American Coal of $58.4 million and $28.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Revenue during 2011 increased 17 percent over the prior year to $512.1 million due to the acquisition of CLCC that occurred during the third quarter of 2010 and due to improvements in sales price during 2011. North American Coal sold 4.2 million tons during 2011 compared with 3.3 million tons during the prior year, which included 1.5 million incremental sales tons made available through the acquisition of CLCC. The additional CLCC sales tons resulted in $151.7 million of additional revenue in 2011 when compared to 2010. This increase in volume was offset partially by lower availability of coal at our Pinnacle and Oak Grove locations given carbon monoxide levels and significant tornado damage, respectively, that impacted production during 2011, and market softening for CLCCs high volatile metallurgical coal. Volume also was negatively affected by severe shipping congestion caused by demand for export metallurgical coal shipped from port facilities in Virginia and the lack of rail car availability due to supply constraints related to increases in demand experienced during the first quarter of 2011. The sales volume decreases at these locations resulted in lower revenues of $85.3 million over 2010. In addition, sales prices increased by $31.1 million when compared to 2010, reflecting increases in our 2011 contract prices as a result of high steel demand and the associated raw material prices. These sale price increases were offset partially by a change in the sales mix from the CLCC acquisition to higher percentages of lower priced high volatile, metallurgical grade coal and thermal coal. Cost of goods sold and operating expenses in 2011 increased $103.7 million or 22 percent from the prior year, primarily due to: Significant increase in sales volume attributable to the acquisition of CLCC, which resulted in a cost increase of $138.7 million. Increase in costs during 2011 was also a result of higher idle costs of $48.9 million over 2010 due to: 67 Table of Contents Significant tornado damage to the Oak Grove preparation plant and overland conveyor system in April 2011; Suspension of operations at Pinnacle due to elevated levels of carbon monoxide at the mine in May 2011; Ventilation issues at the Oak Grove mine in September 2011 that resulted in reduced longwall run rates. Higher contract and outside service costs of $26.5 million relating to the operational issues at Pinnacle and Oak Grove, higher depreciation costs of $7.0 million relating to capital additions and higher labor costs of $13.0 million, offset by lower of cost or market inventory charge of $26.1 million taken at our Pinnacle and Oak Grove mines in 2010. These costs were offset partially by decreases in sales volumes at the Pinnacle and Oak Grove locations, as discussed above, and resulted in cost reductions of $82.7 million over 2010. Production The increase in production levels during 2011 over 2010 is the result of the acquisition of CLCC during the third quarter of 2010 and lower production results at Oak Grove and Pinnacle in 2010 due to operational difficulties. Oak Grove production levels in 2011 were negatively impacted by the significant tornado damage to the above ground operations in April 2011 and ventilation issues in September 2011 that resulted in reduced longwall run rates. Despite the significant tornado damage at Oak Grove, the mines underground operations continued to run in anticipation of the preparation plant restart. The preparation plant achieved partial operating capacity in January 2012. The underground operations during 2011 mined 1.9 million tons of raw coal which has been stockpiled on site, or 746 thousand tons of clean coal equivalent. Pinnacles production during the year was also impacted by a longwall move during February and March 2011, lower belt availability and electrical problems during April 2011, and the suspension of operations at Pinnacle due to elevated levels of carbon monoxide in May 2011. In June 2011, we announced that regulatory agencies denied our plan designed to address the detected levels of carbon monoxide at Pinnacle. The continuous miners at Pinnacle were permitted to resume operations in July 2011 and longwall operations were permitted to resume at the end of September 2011. Pinnacles production returned to conventional levels as evidenced by producing 673 thousand tons of its 1.3 million total 2011 production tons during the fourth quarter of 2011. Production at the Green Ridge No. 2 mine recommenced in January 2011 from the 2010 idling and was once again idled in January 2012. Asia Pacific Iron Ore Following is a summary of Asia Pacific Iron Ore results for 2011 and 2010: (In Millions) Change due to 2011 2010 Sales Priceand Rate SalesVolume ExchangeRate Totalchange Revenues from product sales and services $ 1,363.5 $ 1,123.9 $ 316.5 $ (74.8 ) $ (2.1 ) $ 239.6 Cost of goods sold and operating expenses (664.0 ) (557.7 ) (75.8 ) 41.7 (72.2 ) (106.3 ) Sales margin $ 699.5 $ 566.2 $ 240.7 $ (33.1 ) $ (74.3 ) $ 133.3 Sales metric tons (1) 8.6 9.3 Production metric tons (1) 8.9 9.3 (1) Metric tons (2,205 pounds). Cockatoo Island production and sales reflects our 50 percent share. Sales margin for Asia Pacific Iron Ore increased to $699.5 million during 2011 compared with $566.2 million in 2010. Revenue increased 21 percent in 2011 primarily as a result of higher lump and fines iron ore prices. In 2010, the worlds largest iron ore producers moved away from the annual international benchmark 68 Table of Contents pricing mechanism referenced in our customer supply agreements, resulting in a shift in the industry toward shorter term pricing arrangements linked to the spot market. As previously discussed, we renegotiated the terms of our supply agreements with our Chinese and Japanese Asia Pacific Iron Ore customers moving to shorter term pricing mechanisms of various durations based on the average daily spot prices, with certain pricing mechanisms that have a duration of up to a quarter. This change was effective in the first quarter of 2010 for our Chinese customers and the second quarter of 2010 for our Japanese customers. We finalized quarterly pricing arrangements with our Asia Pacific Iron Ore customers during the second quarter of 2010. The increase in our realized price for 2011 over 2010 was on average a 38 percent and 24 percent increase per wet metric ton for lump and fines, respectively. Pricing settlements in 2011 reflect the increase in steel demand and spot prices for iron ore. In addition, sales prices increased during 2011 due to the sale of approximately 400 thousand additional metric tons of premium fines produced at Cockatoo Island during the period. Sales volume during 2011 decreased to 8.6 million metric tons compared with 9.3 million metric tons for the prior year, resulting in decrease in revenue of $74.8 million. The lower sales volume was driven by a planned extended shutdown of the Esperance Port as part of the 11 million metric ton per year expansion project and third party labor disputes at both port and rail facilities that were settled in July and November 2011, respectively. These events impacted shipments during 2011 and caused shipment timing delays from December 2011 into January 2012. The decrease in sales volume was offset partially by higher sales from our Cockatoo Island mine. Cockatoo Island sales volumes were lower in the prior year as the mine production was resumed during the third quarter of 2010. Cost of goods sold and operating expenses in 2011 increased $106.3 million compared with 2010 primarily as a result of: $75.8 million of cost increases mainly related to: Cost increases of $98.6 million during 2011 due to increases in fuel prices and increases in mining costs as a result of increases in waste mining volumes; Mining costs for Cockatoo Island up $27.0 million over the prior year given the resumed mine production during third quarter of 2010; Royalty costs also increased $20.2 million during 2011, as a result of increased revenue; Processing costs were higher by $8.9 million in 2011 primarily due to increases in fuel prices and maintenance costs compared to 2010 and; Offset partially by inventory movement of $78.9 million during 2011, due to a reduction in inventory in 2010 from the utilization of long term stock piles and an increase in inventory in 2011. $72.2 million related to unfavorable foreign exchange rate variances. These costs were offset partially by $41.7 million due to lower sales volume during 2011. Production Production at Asia Pacific Iron Ore decreased slightly in 2011 when compared to 2010 due to a seven day shutdown of the ore handling plant in the fourth quarter of 2011 in order to replenish run of mine stocks, combined with poor weather conditions at Koolyanobbing in January of 2011, including severe wet weather and a tropical storm. The decrease was offset partially by higher production results at the Cockatoo Island mine in 2011 as production at the Cockatoo Island mine did not resume until the third quarter of 2010. 69 Table of Contents 2010 Compared to 2009 U.S. Iron Ore Following is a summary of U.S. Iron Ore results for 2010 and 2009: (In Millions) Change due to 2010 2009 Sales Priceand Rate SalesVolume Idle cost/Productionvolumevariance Freight andreimbursements Totalchange Revenues from product sales and services $ 2,443.7 $ 1,211.6 $ 372.0 $ 730.4 $ $ 129.7 $ 1,232.1 Cost of goods sold and operating expenses (1,655.3 ) (998.4 ) (131.1 ) (490.2 ) 94.1 (129.7 ) (656.9 ) Sales margin $ 788.4 $ 213.2 $ 240.9 $ 240.2 $ 94.1 $ $ 575.2 Sales tons (1) 23.0 13.7 Production tons (1): Total 28.1 16.9 Cliffs share of total 21.5 15.0 (1) Long tons of pellets (2,240 pounds). Sales margin for U.S. Iron Ore was $788.4 million for 2010, compared with a sales margin of $213.2 million for 2009. The improvement over 2009 was attributable to increased revenue of $1.2 billion, offset partially by an increase in cost of goods sold and operating expenses of $656.9 million. The increase in revenue was a result of improvements in both sales price and sales volume, which caused revenue to increase $372.0 million and $730.4 million, respectively, over 2009 results. Sales volumes for 2010 increased 68 percent at U.S. Iron Ore when compared to 2009 primarily due to an overall increase in customer demand as a result of improved market conditions during 2010. The increase in pricing in 2010 was attributable to higher demand in 2010 as the market continued to strengthen. There was a shift in the industry toward shorter term pricing arrangements linked to the spot market and the move away from the annual world pellet pricing mechanism referenced in certain of our supply contracts. We reached final pricing settlement with some of our U.S. Iron Ore customers through the fourth quarter of 2010 for the 2010 contract year, which reflected an average increase of 98 percent over 2009 prices for contracts based on world pellet prices. This compared to the 2009 settled price decrease of 48.3 percent below 2008 prices. Revenue in 2010 also included $120.2 million related to supplemental contract payments compared with $22.2 million in 2009. The overall increase between years related to the estimated rise in average annual hot band steel pricing for one of our U.S. Iron Ore customers. The increase in revenue was offset partially by lower prices realized for sales under one of our customer supply agreements that were in arbitration at the end of 2010. Given the early stage of the arbitration at the time, and the uncertainty regarding its outcome as of December 31, 2010, the prices realized for sales under the contract in 2010 did not reflect the estimated increase in 2010 iron ore pricing. The arbitration subsequently was settled during 2011. In 2010 and 2009, certain customers purchased and paid for approximately 2.4 million tons and 0.9 million tons of pellets, respectively, in order to meet minimum contractual purchase requirements for each year under the terms of take or pay contracts. The inventory was stored at our facilities in upper lakes stockpiles. At the request of the customers, the ore was not shipped, resulting in deferred revenue at December 31, 2010 and 2009 of $155.3 million and $81.9 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2010, all of the 0.9 million tons that were deferred at the end of 2009 were delivered, resulting in the related revenue being recognized in 2010. Cost of goods sold and operating expenses in 2010 increased $656.9 million or 66 percent from the prior year primarily due to: Higher sales volumes as noted above, which resulted in cost increases of approximately $490.2 million. 70 Table of Contents Unfavorable impact during 2010 of $131.1 million due to: Higher cost rates attributable to higher maintenance and repairs costs of $42.3 million, higher energy and labor costs of $55.8 million, higher stripping and recovery costs of $27.9 million and higher royalty expenses of $15.2 million. These costs partially were offset by $94.1 million related to lower idle expense due to increased production as a result of improving market conditions in the current year. Production Based on signs of marked improvements in customer demand during 2010, production was increased at all our facilities and employees were called back to work in order to ensure that we were positioned to meet the increased demand. During 2010, Empire, Tilden and United Taconite operated at full capacity. Northshore operated three of its furnaces, with the fourth restarted in September 2010. The shutdown at Hibbing, which began in May 2009, ended on April 1, 2010.

(2) Metric tons (2,205 pounds). Sales margin for Eastern Canadian Iron Ore was $133.6 million for 2010, compared with a sales margin of $62.3 million for 2009. The improvement over 2009 was attributable to increased revenue of $241.5 million, offset partially by an increase in cost of goods sold and operating expenses of $170.2 million. The increase in revenue was a result of improvements in both sales price and sales volume, which caused revenue to increase $199.5 million and $42.0 million, respectively, over 2009 results. The increase in pricing in 2010 was attributable to higher demand in 2010 as the market continued to strengthen. Final pricing settlement with our Eastern Canadian Iron Ore customers reflected an average increase of 98 percent over 2009 prices for contracts based on world pellet prices. This compared to the 2009 settled price decrease of 48.3 percent below 2008 prices. Sales volumes for 2010 increased 22 percent at Eastern Canadian Iron Ore when compared to 2009 primarily due to an overall increase in customer demand as a result of improved market conditions during 2010 and incremental sales of 0.6 million metric tons of Wabush pellets that were made available through our acquisition of the remaining 73.2 percent interest in February 2010. In 2009, sales volumes for 2009 were higher as our joint venture partner in the mine allowed us to take additional tonnage over our ownership percentage. Cost of goods sold and operating expenses in 2010 increased $170.2 million or 98 percent from the prior year primarily due to: Higher costs of $91.6 million attributable to: 71 Table of Contents Higher supplies and service costs, as a result of spending limitations in 2009 due to the economic conditions at that time; $98.3 million of additional costs in 2010 associated with Eastern Canadian Iron Ore taking its former partners share of production but only having to pay variable costs in 2009; Costs of $35.3 million of inventory step up and amortization of purchase price adjustments related to our acquisition of Wabush in 2010 and; Offset partially by favorable fixed cost per ton effect of $51.9 million due to the increase in production tons. $36.1 million of unfavorable exchange rate variances over 2009. Higher sales volumes noted above resulted in cost increases of approximately $30.3 million. Production Production tonnage at Wabush was higher in 2010 when compared to 2009 as Wabush was operating two of its three furnaces during 2010, with Cliffs taking all of the tonnage since acquiring full ownership on February 1, 2010.

(2) Tons are short tons (2,000 pounds). We reported a sales margin loss for North American Coal of $28.6 million and $71.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Revenue for 2010 was $231.0 million higher than 2009 due to increases in both sales volume and prices. North American Coal sold 3.3 million tons during 2010 compared with 1.9 million tons during 2009, as a result of improved market conditions in 2010 and 1.1 million tons of additional sales since the acquisition of CLCC. The increase in North American Coal sales volume resulted in an increase in revenues of $143.4 million over 2009, of which $111.7 million was related to the acquisition of CLCC. Sales prices were also higher during 2010, reflecting increases in steel demand and the associated raw material prices. The increase in our 2010 contract rates caused revenue for 2010 to increase $82.9 million over 2009. Cost of goods sold and operating expenses in 2010 increased $187.7 million or 67 percent from the prior year primarily due to: Significant increase in sales volume as a result of the acquisition of CLCC, resulting in $98.3 million of additional cost for 2010. 72 Table of Contents $57.1 million of cost increases mainly related to: A lower of cost or market inventory charge of $26.1 million taken at our Pinnacle and Oak Grove mines. Geological and operational issues, higher depreciation and amortization of $11.7 million, higher royalties and severance taxes of $8.2 million and purchases of $6.6 million of third party coal at our Pinnacle mine to meet shipping requirements. Significant increase in sales volume, which resulted in a cost increase of approximately $36.2 million. These costs were offset partially by a reduction in idle expense of $8.6 million. Despite the production issues encountered at our legacy coal mines throughout 2010, we increased production at our mines as a result of improving market conditions in 2010. Idle costs in the first half of 2009 were significantly higher due to production curtailments and delays associated with mine development issues at Oak Grove as a result of unplanned geological conditions. Production We increased production levels in 2010 in response to improving market conditions and increases in customer demand. The increase over the prior year primarily was related to production curtailments that occurred in 2009 to match declining market conditions as well as delays in developing the longwall panel at Oak Grove during the first quarter of 2009. In addition, the increase in production levels over 2009 was a direct result of the acquisition of CLCC during the third quarter of 2010. The overall increase in 2010 production at our Pinnacle Complex was offset partially by a decrease in production at Green Ridge due to the closure of Green Ridge No. 1 in February 2010, as well as the idling of Green Ridge No. 2 during 2010. Production recommenced at the Green Ridge No. 2 mine in January 2011. Despite the increase in production over 2009, our Pinnacle mine negatively was impacted during 2010 by adverse geological conditions and delayed longwall operations, resulting in force majeures declared on customer shipments during the third and fourth quarters of 2010. The force majeure declared in the fourth quarter was due to roof falls at the Pinnacle mine and was lifted in January 2011 with the restarting of the longwall. Asia Pacific Iron Ore Following is a summary of Asia Pacific Iron Ore results for 2010 and 2009: (In Millions) Change due to 2010 2009 Sales Priceand Rate SalesVolume ExchangeRate Totalchange Revenues from product sales and services $ 1,123.9 $ 542.1 $ 517.7 $ 72.3 $ (8.2 ) $ 581.8 Cost of goods sold and operating expenses (557.7 ) (454.9 ) 19.1 (40.6 ) (81.3 ) (102.8 ) Sales margin $ 566.2 $ 87.2 $ 536.8 $ 31.7 $ (89.5 ) $ 479.0 Sales metric tons 9.3 8.5 Production metric tons (1) 9.3 8.3 (1) Metric tons (2,205 pounds). Cockatoo Island production reflects our 50 percent share. Sales margin for Asia Pacific Iron Ore increased to $566.2 million in 2010 compared with $87.2 million in 2009. Revenue increased $581.8 million in 2010 compared with 2009 primarily as a result of higher prices for lump and fines, increased sales volume and favorable sales mix. The price increases during 2010 were attributable to the industry shift toward shorter term pricing arrangements linked to the spot market, as discussed above. As a result, we renegotiated the terms of our supply agreements with our Chinese and Japanese Asia Pacific Iron Ore customers moving to shorter term pricing mechanisms of various durations based on the average daily spot prices, with certain pricing mechanisms that have a duration of up to a quarter. The increase in 2010 pricing over 2009 was on average an 87 percent and 98 percent increase per wet metric ton for lump and fines, respectively. This compares to settled price decreases in 2009 of 44 percent and 33 percent for lump and fines, respectively. Pricing settlements in 2010 reflected the increase in steel demand and spot prices for iron ore and were based upon quarterly index pricing mechanisms. 73 Table of Contents Sales volume reached 9.3 million metric tons in 2010 compared with 8.5 million metric tons for 2009, resulting in an increase in revenue of $72.3 million. In addition, revenue favorably was impacted by a positive sales mix variance of $4.0 million primarily due to the cessation of low grade fines sales in 2010. Cost of goods sold and operating expenses in 2010 increased $102.8 million compared to 2009 primarily due to: Unfavorable foreign exchange rate variances of $81.3 million. A nine percent increase in sales volume, which resulted in cost increases of approximately $40.6 million. These costs were offset partially by favorable rate variances, driven by lower inventory movement of $33.2 million primarily due to increased long term stockpile utilization and $14.6 million associated with lower shipping and processing costs during 2010. Higher royalties related to the increase in revenue and higher mining costs related to increased mining fleet maintenance due to increased rail volumes of $27.2 million. Production Production at Asia Pacific Iron Ore in 2010 was higher than 2009 as a result of initiatives taken to improve supply conditions and eliminate certain production and logistics constraints, including upgrades to the rail system. The increase in production over 2009 was also due to reduced availability in 2009 as a result of repairs to the production plant. Production at Cockatoo Island resumed in the third quarter of 2010. Liquidity, Cash Flows and Capital Resources Our primary sources of liquidity are cash generated from our operating and financing activities. Our cash flows from operating activities are driven by our operating results and changes in our working capital requirements. Our cash flows from financing activities are dependent upon our ability to access credit or other capital. Throughout 2011, we have taken a balanced approach to the allocation of our capital resources and free cash flow. In 2011, we continued to strengthen our balance sheet and enhance financial flexibility to be consistent with our long term financial growth goals and objectives, including the completion of a public offering of senior notes in the aggregate principal amount of $1.0 billion, the completion of a $1.25 billion five year term loan, the completion of a public offering of 10.35 million of our common shares that raised approximately $854 million and the execution of a five year unsecured amended and restated multicurrency credit agreement that resulted in, among other things, a $1.75 billion revolving credit facility. The senior notes offering consisted of a $700 million 10 year tranche and a $300 million 30 year tranche completed in March and April 2011, respectively. The net proceeds from the senior notes offering and the term loan were used to fund a portion of the purchase price for the acquisition of Consolidated Thompson and to pay the related fees and expenses. A portion of the net proceeds from the public offering of our common shares were used to repay the $750 million of borrowings under the bridge credit facility, with the remainder of the net proceeds to be used for general corporate purposes. Proceeds from the revolving credit facility will be used to refinance existing indebtedness, to finance general working capital needs and for other general corporate purposes, including the funding of acquisitions. In August 2011, $250 million was drawn against the revolving credit facility in order to pay down a portion of the term loan. All amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility were repaid in full on December 12, 2011. Refer to NOTE 7 DEBT AND CREDIT FACILITIES for further information. 74 Table of Contents The following is a summary of significant sources and uses of cash in 2011 and 2010: (In Millions) 2011 2010 Cash and cash equivalents January 1 $ 1,566.7 $ 502.7 Net cash provided by operating activities 2,288.8 1,320.0 Significant Investing Transactions Net settlements on Canadian dollar foreign exchange contracts $ 93.1 $ Investment in Consolidated Thompson senior secured notes (125.0 ) Acquisition of Consolidated Thompson, net of cash acquired (4,423.5 ) Acquisition of Wabush (101.9 ) Acquisition of Freewest (5.3 ) Acquisition of Spider (108.0 ) Acquisition of CLCC (775.9 ) Capital expenditures (880.7 ) (266.9 ) Total (5,336.1 ) (1,258.0 ) Sources (Uses) of Financing Net proceeds from issuance of common shares 853.7 Net proceeds from issuance of senior notes 998.1 1,388.1 Borrowing on term loan 1,250.0 Repayment of Consolidated Thompson convertible debentures (337.2 ) Payments under share buyback program (289.8 ) Common Stock Dividends (118.9 ) (68.9 ) Total 2,355.9 1,319.2 Other net activity (353.7 ) (317.2 ) Cash and cash equivalents December 31 $ 521.6 $ 1,566.7 The following discussion summarizes the significant activities impacting our cash flows during the year as well as those expected to impact our future cash flows over the next 12 months. Refer to the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows for additional information. Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $2.3 billion in 2011, compared with $1.3 billion in 2010 and $185.7 million in 2009. Operating cash flows in 2011 were impacted primarily by stronger operating results, as previously noted. Our operating cash flows vary with prices realized from iron ore and coal sales, production levels, production costs, cash payments for income taxes and interest, other working capital changes and other factors. In addition, our cash provided by operating activities was stronger in 2011 due to the receipt of a $129.0 million payment in January 2011 from Algoma to true up the portion of revenues from 2010 pellet sales that previously was disputed throughout 2010 and the receipt of a $275.0 million payment in April 2011 from ArcelorMittal USA to true up pricing for pellet volumes delivered to certain ArcelorMittal USA steelmaking facilities in North America during both 2009 and 2010. Such receipts will not be recurring in 2012 or in the future. Our long term outlook remains stable and we now are focusing on our growth projects with sustained investment in our core businesses. Capacity utilization among steelmaking facilities in North America demonstrated ongoing improvement and held firm during the remainder of the year. We expect the U.S. economy to continue to remain stable, sustaining a healthy North American business. High year over year crude steel production and iron ore imports in Asia continue to support demand for our products in the seaborne market. As a result, we have planned increased production at all of our facilities, with the exception of one. 75 Table of Contents Based on current mine plans and subject to future iron ore and coal prices, we expect estimated operating cash flows in 2012 to be greater than our budgeted investments and capital expenditures, expected debt payments, dividends and other cash requirements. Refer to Outlook for additional guidance regarding expected future results, including projections on pricing, sales volume and production for our various businesses. Our U.S. operations generate sufficient cash flows and, consequently, we do not need to repatriate earnings from our foreign operations. Our U.S. cash and cash equivalents balance at December 31, 2011 was $239.6 million, or approximately 45.9 percent of our consolidated total cash and cash equivalents balance of $521.6 million. Given the recent strategic acquisition of Consolidated Thompson, U.S. cash and cash equivalent balances are lower than at the beginning of 2011; however, we continue to maintain significant liquidity to support all operating activities. We historically have been able to raise additional capital through private financings and public debt and equity offerings, the bulk of which, to date, have been U.S. based. Additionally, as of December 31, 2011, we had available borrowing capacity of $1.73 billion under our $1.75 billion U.S. based revolving credit facility. In addition, if the U.S. and Asian economies soften, we have the financial and operational flexibility to reduce production, delay capital expenditures and reduce overhead costs. Investing Activities Net cash used by investing activities was $5.3 billion in 2011, compared with $1.4 billion and $179.3 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively. In May 2011, we completed our acquisition of Consolidated Thompson for a net acquisition price of $4.4 billion. In addition, we purchased the outstanding Consolidated Thompson senior secured notes directly from the note holders for $125.0 million, including accrued and unpaid interest, during April 2011. Capital expenditures were $880.7 million, $266.9 million and $116.3 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. During 2011, the net cash used by investing activities was offset partially by $93.1 million of settlements on the Canadian dollar foreign exchange contracts used to hedge a portion of the purchase price related to the acquisition of Consolidated Thompson. Investing activities in 2010 also included $26.5 million of capital contributions related to the funding of operations at Amap&aacute; as well as $155 million related to the repayment of all Amap&aacute;s debt in 2010. In February 2010, we completed the acquisition of the remaining 73.2 percent interest in Wabush for an aggregate acquisition price of $103.0 million. We also completed the acquisition of all of the coal operations of CLCC in July 2010 for an aggregate acquisition price of $774.5 million. During the fourth quarter of 2010, we completed the acquisition of the remaining shares of Spider through an amalgamation, increasing our ownership interest to 100 percent and resulting in a total cash investment in Spider of $108.0 million as of December 31, 2010. In December 2010, our North American Coal segment sold the new longwall plow system at our Pinnacle mine in West Virginia and subsequently leased the longwall back for a period of five years. In October 2011, North American Coal entered into the second phase of the longwall sale leaseback arrangement. We received proceeds of $57.3 million and $18.6 million, respectively, from the first and second phase sale of the longwall, and the leaseback was accounted for as a capital lease. Non cash investing activities during 2010 included the issuance of 4.2 million of our common shares valued at $173.1 million as part of the purchase consideration for the acquisition of the remaining interest in Freewest, which was completed on January 27, 2010. Non cash items during 2010 also included gains of $38.6 million primarily related to the remeasurement of our previous ownership interest in Freewest and Wabush held prior to each business acquisition. Based upon improving market conditions and a strengthening long term outlook, we anticipate that total cash used for capital expenditures in 2012 will be approximately $1 billion. This expectation includes capital expenditures related to Bloom Lake as we assumed capital commitments related to an expansion of the Bloom Lake mine in order to increase production capacity. The project to increase production capacity by 8.0 million metric tons of iron ore concentrate per year has been approved for capital investments of approximately $1.3 billion, of which approximately $0.2 billion was spent in 2011. Of the remaining capital investment amount, approximately $0.6 billion is expected to be spent in 2012, with the remainder expected to be spent between 2013 and 2016. In addition, as we continue to increase production into 2012, capital expenditures will include the expansion of our Empire and Tilden mines in Michigans Upper Peninsula in order to extend the existing production capacity at our Empire mine and increase production capacity at our Tilden mine. The project requires a capital investment of approximately $260 million, of which approximately $140 million was spent 76 Table of Contents through 2011. Of the remaining capital investment amount, approximately $80 million is expected to be spent in 2012 and $40 million is expected to be spent between 2013 and 2016. In Asia Pacific Iron Ore, an expansion project has been approved at our Koolyanobbing mine in order to increase production capacity to 11 million metric tons per year. We estimate the project to require an initial capital cash outflow of approximately $275 million, of which approximately $202 million was spent in 2011 and $73 million is expected to be spent in 2012. In 2011, we entered into an agreement to upgrade an existing rail line used by our Koolyanobbing operations. Our portion of the related purchase commitment for the upgrade is approximately $33 million, of which approximately $7 million was spent in 2011. Of the remaining amount, approximately $10 million is expected to be spent in 2012 and $16 million is expected to be spent between 2013 and 2014. In the first quarter of 2011, we began a project to bring Lower War Eagle, a high volatile metallurgical coal mine in West Virginia, into production. Approximately $40 million of committed capital was spent in relation to this project throughout 2011 and $50 million is expected to be spent in 2012. As a result of the significant tornado damage to the above ground operations at our Oak Grove mine during the second quarter of 2011, we have capital projects to repair the damage of approximately $52 million, of which approximately $46 million was spent in 2011 and $6 million is expected to be spent in 2012. At Pinnacle, a new longwall plow system was purchased to reduce maintenance costs and increase production at the mine. The remaining expenditures for the longwall plow system were completed in 2011. Construction of a new portal at Oak Grove was substantially completed in 2011 in order to improve productivity and support growth and expansion of the mine. As mentioned previously, we have the flexibility to reduce production, capital expenditures and overhead costs if market conditions change in the future. We have implemented a global exploration program, which is integral to our growth strategy and is focused on identifying and capturing new world class projects for future development or projects that add significant value to existing operations. Our Global Exploration Group is expected to spend approximately $90 million on exploration activities in 2012, which we expect will provide us with opportunities for significant future potential reserve additions globally. Throughout 2011, we spent approximately $48.4 million related to our involvement in exploration and development activities. We continue to evaluate funding options for our capital needs and expect to be able to fund these requirements through operations and availability under our existing borrowing arrangements. Other funding options may include new lines of credit or other financing arrangements. 77 Table of Contents The following represents our future cash commitments and contractual obligations as of December 31, 2011: Payments Due by Period (1) (In Millions) Contractual Obligations Total Less than1 Year 1 3Year 3 5Year More Than5 Years Long term debt $ 3,683.5 $ 74.8 $ 494.3 $ 727.9 $ 2,386.5 Interest on debt (2) 2,290.0 169.7 309.6 278.5 1,532.2 Operating lease obligations 111.8 24.2 42.8 19.8 25.0 Capital lease obligations 348.8 87.1 115.4 72.9 73.4 Purchase obligations: Asia Pacific rail upgrade 8.0 8.0 Oak Grove portal project 2.7 2.7 Michigan expansion project 35.8 35.8 Koolyanobbing expansion project 57.3 57.3 Bloom Lake expansion project 280.8 280.8 Oak Grove repair project 6.0 6.0 Lower War Eagle development project 14.9 14.9 Open purchase orders 190.6 188.8 0.7 0.8 0.3 Minimum take or pay purchase commitments (3) 2,489.1 306.8 374.7 242.2 1,565.4 Total purchase obligations 3,085.2 901.1 375.4 243.0 1,565.7 Other long term liabilities: Pension funding minimums 431.9 66.3 156.3 128.1 81.2 OPEB claim payments 698.7 41.2 52.6 49.6 555.3 Deferred revenue (6) 126.6 43.2 16.7 16.7 50.0 Environmental and mine closure obligations 235.7 13.7 18.7 1.6 201.7 Unrecognized tax benefits (4) 6.5 6.5 Personal injury 7.0 3.2 2.6 0.7 0.5 Other (5) Total other long term liabilities 1,506.4 167.6 253.4 196.7 888.7 Total $ 11,025.7 $ 1,424.5 $ 1,590.9 $ 1,538.8 $ 6,471.5 (1) Includes our consolidated obligations.

Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities in 2011 was $2.0 billion compared with $1.1 billion in 2010 and $304.3 million in 2009. Cash flows from financing activities in 2011 included $998.1 million in net proceeds from the issuance of two tranches of senior notes in the aggregate principal amount of $1.0 billion, completed through a public offering in March and April 2011. In addition, we borrowed $750.0 million under the bridge credit facility and $1.25 billion under the term loan in May 2011, and incurred $38.3 million and $8.7 million, respectively, of issuance costs related to the execution and funding of each arrangement. We used the net proceeds from the public offering of senior notes, the bridge credit facility and the term loan to fund a portion of the cash required upon the consummation of the acquisition of Consolidated Thompson, including the related fees and expenses. A portion of the funds also were used for the repayment of the Consolidated Thompson convertible debentures that were included among the liabilities assumed in the acquisition. We completed a public offering of 10.35 million of our common shares in June 2011. The net proceeds from the offering were approximately $854 million at a sales price to the public of $85.63 per share. A portion of the net proceeds were used to repay the $750.0 million of borrowings under the bridge credit facility, with the remainder of the net proceeds to be used for general corporate purposes. In July 2011, our Board of Directors increased the quarterly common share dividend by 100 percent to $0.28 per share. The increased cash dividend was paid on September 1, 2011 and December 1, 2011 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on August 15, 2011 and November 18, 2011, respectively. In May 2010, our Board of Directors had increased our quarterly common share dividend from $0.0875 to $0.14 per share, and it was paid on June 1, 2010, September 1, 2010 and December 1, 2010. This increased cash dividend of $0.14 per share was paid on March 1, 2011 and June 1, 2011 to shareholders of record as of February 15, 2011 and April 29, 2011, respectively. In August 2011, we entered into a five year unsecured amended and restated multicurrency credit agreement in order to amend the terms of our existing $600 million multicurrency credit agreement. The credit agreement resulted in, among other things, a $1.75 billion revolving credit facility. As a condition of the credit agreement terms, $250 million was drawn against the revolving credit facility in order to pay down a portion of the term loan. The $250 million payment was in addition to the scheduled quarterly principal payments on the term loan totaling $28.0 million. All amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility were repaid in full on December 12, 2011. Additionally, our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase plan that authorized us to purchase up to four million of our outstanding shares. During the second half of 2011, four million common shares were repurchased at a cost of approximately $289.8 million, or an average price of approximately $72.44 per share. Cash flows from financing activities in 2010 primarily included $397.7 million and $990.3 million in net proceeds, from two public offerings of senior notes, which we completed in March and September of 2010, respectively. The net proceeds from the first public offering in 2010 were used for the repayment in March 2010 of our $200 million term loan under our credit facility, the repayment of our share of Amap&aacute;s remaining debt outstanding during the second quarter of 2010 and for the financing of a portion of the purchase price for the Spider and CLCC acquisitions. A portion of the net proceeds from the second public offering in 2010 were used for the repayment of the $350.0 million borrowings outstanding under the credit facility at that time. Other uses of the net proceeds from the $1.0 billion public offering of senior notes included general corporate purposes and the funding of the acquisition of Consolidated Thompson. Successful execution of these offerings allowed us to enhance our financial flexibility and better position ourselves to take advantage of possible opportunities as the market continues to improve in 2012. 79 Table of Contents Capital Resources We expect to fund our business obligations from available cash, current operations and existing borrowing arrangements. The following represents a summary of key liquidity measures as of December 31, 2011 and 2010: (In Millions) December 31,2011 December 31,2010 Cash and cash equivalents $ 521.6 $ 1,566.7 Credit facility $ 1,750.0 $ 600.0 Revolving loans drawn Senior notes 2,725.0 1,725.0 Senior notes drawn (2,725.0 ) (1,725.0 ) Term loan 972.0 Term loans drawn (972.0 ) Letter of credit obligations and other commitments (23.5 ) (64.7 ) Borrowing capacity available $ 1,726.5 $ 535.3 Refer to NOTE 7 DEBT AND CREDIT FACILITIES of our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our debt and credit facilities. We are subject to certain financial covenants contained in the agreements governing certain of our debt instruments. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, we were in compliance with each of our financial covenants. Our primary sources of funding consist of a $1.75 billion revolving credit facility, which matures in 2016. This facility has available borrowing capacity of $1.73 billion as of December 31, 2011. Effective August 11, 2011, we amended our credit facility agreement, which provided more flexible financial covenants and debt restrictions through the amendment of certain customary covenants. We also have cash generated by the business and cash on hand, which totaled $521.6 million as of December 31, 2011. The combination of cash and the credit facility gives us over $2.2 billion in liquidity entering the first quarter of 2012, which is expected to be used to fund operations, capital expenditures and finance strategic transactions. We are party to financing arrangements under which we issue guarantees on behalf of certain of our unconsolidated subsidiaries. In the event of non payment, we are obligated to make payment in accordance with the provisions of the guarantee arrangement. As of December 31, 2010, Amap&aacute; repaid its total project debt outstanding, for which we previously had provided a several guarantee on our 30 percent share. Repayment of our share of the total project debt outstanding consisted of $54.2 million and $100.8 million repaid on February 17, 2010 and May 27, 2010, respectively. Upon repayment of the project debt, our obligations under the provisions of the guarantee arrangement have been relieved. Based on our current borrowing capacity and the actions we have taken to conserve cash, we have adequate liquidity and expect to be able to fund our current business obligations from available cash, current operations and existing borrowing arrangements for the foreseeable future. Other sources of funding may include new lines of credit or other financing arrangements. Several credit markets may provide additional capacity should that become necessary. The bank market may provide funding through a term loan, bridge loan, revolving credit facility or through exercising the $250 million accordion in our current credit facility or the $250 million accordion made through our term loan. Our execution of a five year unsecured amended and restated multicurrency credit agreement that resulted in, among other things, a $1.75 billion revolving credit facility in August 2011 provides evidence of funding available through the bank market. The risk associated with this market is significant increases in borrowing costs as a result of limited capacity. As in all debt markets, capacity is a global issue that impacts the bond market. Our issuance of a $1.0 billion public offering of 10 year and 30 year senior notes in March and April 2011 provides evidence that capacity in the bond markets has improved and remains stable for investment grade companies compared to conditions impacting such markets in previous years. These transactions represent the successful execution of our strategy to increase liquidity and extend debt maturities to align with longer term capital structure needs. In addition, various capital markets may provide additional sources of funding. 80 Table of Contents Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We have operating leases, which primarily are utilized for certain equipment and office space. Aside from these, we do not have any other off balance sheet financing arrangements. Market Risks We are subject to a variety of risks, including those caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. We have established policies and procedures to manage such risks; however, certain risks are beyond our control. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk We are subject to changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily as a result of our operations in Australia and Canada, which could impact our financial condition. With respect to Australia, foreign exchange risk arises from our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates because our reporting currency is the U.S. dollar, but the functional currency of our Asia Pacific operations is the Australian dollar. Our Asia Pacific operations receive funds in U.S. currency for their iron ore and coal sales and incur costs in Australian currency. We use forward exchange contracts, call options and collar options to hedge our foreign currency exposure for a portion of our sales receipts. The primary objective for the use of these instruments is to reduce exposure to changes in Australian and U.S. currency exchange rates and to protect against undue adverse movement in these exchange rates. At December 31, 2011, we had $400 million of outstanding exchange rate contracts with varying maturity dates ranging from January 2012 to December 2012 for which we elected hedge accounting, effective October 2010. We also had $15 million of outstanding exchange rate contracts with maturity dates in January 2012 that we have been holding as economic hedges, entered into prior to October 2010. A 10 percent increase in the value of the Australian dollar from the month end rate would increase the fair value of these contracts by approximately $38 million, and a 10 percent decrease would reduce the fair value by approximately $46 million. We may enter into additional hedging instruments in the near future as needed in order to further hedge our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The following table represents our Australian dollar foreign currency exchange contract position for contracts held as cash flow and economic hedges as of December 31, 2011: ($ in Millions) Contract Maturity Notional Amount Weighted AverageExchange Rate Spot Rate Fair Value Contract Portfolio (1): Contracts expiring in the next 12 months $ 415.0 0.99 1.02 $ 4.5 Total Hedge Contract Portfolio $ 415.0 $ 4.5 (1) Includes collar options and forward contracts. Refer to NOTE 3 DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES for further information. With respect to Canada, we entered into foreign currency exchange contracts and an option contract in order to hedge a portion of the Consolidated Thompson purchase price on the open market in the first half of 2011. The contracts were considered economic hedges that do not qualify for hedge accounting. As of December 31, 2011, these contracts all have matured. In January 2012, in accordance with our policy, we began to enter into Canadian dollar foreign currency exchange contracts in the form of forward contracts that qualify for hedge accounting. Subsequent to December 31, 2011, we have entered into contracts with a notional amount of approximately C$200 million with varying maturity dates. The pellets produced at our Wabush operations and the concentrate produced at our Bloom Lake operations in Canada represented approximately 11.2 percent of our total iron ore production in North America as of December 31, 2011. This operation is subject to currency exchange fluctuations between the U.S. and Canadian 81 Table of Contents currencies. As of December 31, 2011, we did not hedge our exposure to this currency exchange fluctuation; however, as discussed above, we plan to continue to enter into hedging instruments in the future to hedge such exposures. Interest Rate Risk Interest payable on our senior notes is at fixed rates. Interest payable under our revolving credit facility and term credit facility is at a floating rate based upon the base rate or the LIBOR rate plus a margin depending on a leverage ratio. As of December 31, 2011, we had no amounts drawn on the revolving credit facility and $971 million outstanding on the term credit facility. A 100 basis point change to the base rate or the LIBOR rate under the term credit facility would result in a change of approximately $10 million to interest expense on an annual basis. Pricing Risks Provisional Pricing Arrangements During 2010, the worlds largest iron ore producers moved away from the annual international benchmark pricing mechanism referenced in certain of our customer supply agreements, resulting in a shift in the industry toward shorter term pricing arrangements linked to the spot market. Such changes are likely to yield increased volatility in iron ore pricing. This change has impacted certain of our U.S. Iron Ore and Eastern Canadian Iron Ore customer supply agreements for the 2011 contract year. We have reached final pricing settlements with a majority of our U.S. Iron Ore customers through the end of 2011. However, in some cases we are still working to revise components of the pricing calculations referenced within our supply agreements to incorporate new pricing mechanisms as a result of the changes to historical benchmark pricing. As a result, we have recorded certain shipments made to U.S. Iron Ore and Eastern Canadian Iron Ore customers in 2011 on a provisional basis until final settlement is reached. The pricing provisions are characterized as freestanding derivatives, which are marked to fair value as a revenue adjustment each reporting period based upon the estimated forward settlement until prices actually are settled. The fair value of the instrument is determined based on the forward price expectation of the final price settlement for 2011. Therefore, to the extent final prices are higher or lower than what was recorded on a provisional basis, an increase or decrease to revenues is recorded each reporting period until the date of final pricing. We had a derivative asset of $1.2 million and a derivative liability of $19.5 million, respectively, at December 31, 2011 related to our estimate of final pricing in 2011 with our customers representing the incremental difference between the provisional price agreed upon with our customers and our estimate of the ultimate price settlement in 2012. We also have derivatives of $83.8 million classified as accounts receivable to reflect the amount we provisionally have agreed upon with our customers until a final price is reached. We estimate that a 25 percent change in the settlement prices realized from the December 31, 2011 estimated prices recorded would cause the fair value of the derivative instrument to increase or decrease by approximately $90 million, thereby impacting our consolidated revenues by the same amount. In addition, final agreement may result in changes to the pricing mechanisms used with our various customers and could impact sales prices realized in current and future periods, which could have a material effect on our results of operations. Customer Supply Agreements Certain supply agreements with one U.S. Iron Ore customer provide for supplemental revenue or refunds based on the customers average annual steel pricing at the time the product is consumed in the customers blast furnace. The supplemental pricing is characterized as a freestanding derivative, which is finalized based on a future price, and is marked to fair value as a revenue adjustment each reporting period until the pellets are consumed and the amounts are settled. The fair value of the instrument is determined using an income approach based on an estimate of the annual realized price of hot rolled steel at the steelmakers facilities. At December 31, 2011, we had a derivative asset of $72.9 million, representing the fair value of the pricing factors, based upon the amount of unconsumed tons and an estimated average hot band steel price related to the period in which the tons are expected to be consumed in the customers blast furnace at each respective steelmaking facility, subject to final pricing at a future date. We estimate that a $75 change in the average hot 82 Table of Contents band steel price realized from the December 31, 2011 estimated price recorded would cause the fair value of the derivative instrument to increase or decrease by approximately $7 million, thereby impacting our consolidated revenues by the same amount. We have not entered into any hedging programs to mitigate the risk of adverse price fluctuations, nor do we intend to hedge our exposure to such risks in the future; however, certain of our term supply agreements contain price collars, which typically limit the percentage increase or decrease in prices for our products during any given year. Volatile Energy and Fuel Costs The volatile cost of energy is an important issue affecting our production costs, primarily in relation to our iron ore operations. Our consolidated U.S. Iron Ore mining ventures consumed approximately 14.7 million MMBtus of natural gas at an average delivered price of $4.52 per MMBtu, and 31.0 million gallons of diesel fuel at an average delivered price of $3.19 per gallon in 2011. Our consolidated Eastern Canadian Iron Ore mining ventures consumed approximately 12.0 million gallons of diesel fuel at an average delivered price of $4.54 per gallon in 2011. Our CLCC operations consumed approximately 3.6 million gallons of diesel fuel at an average delivered rate of $3.27 per gallon during 2011. Consumption of diesel fuel by our Asia Pacific operations was approximately 18.0 million gallons at an average delivered price of $2.05 per gallon for the same period. In the ordinary course of business, there also will be likely increases in prices relative to electrical costs at our U.S. mine sites. As the cost of producing electricity increases, energy companies regularly seek to reclaim those costs from the mine sites, which often results in tariff disputes. Our strategy to address increasing energy rates includes improving efficiency in energy usage and utilizing the lowest cost alternative fuels. At the present time we have no specific plans to enter into hedging activity for 2012 and beyond and do not plan to enter into any new forward contracts for natural gas or diesel fuel in the near term. We will continue to monitor relevant energy markets for risk mitigation opportunities and may make additional forward purchases or employ other hedging instruments in the future as warranted and deemed appropriate by management. Assuming we do not enter into further hedging activity in the near term, a 10 percent change in natural gas and diesel fuel prices would result in a change of approximately $22 million in our annual fuel and energy costs based on expected consumption for 2012. Supply Concentration Risks Many of our mines are dependent on one source each of electric power and natural gas. A significant interruption or change in service or rates from our energy suppliers could impact materially our production costs, margins and profitability. Outlook In 2012, we anticipate selling approximately half of our expected global iron ore sales volume of over 45 million tons to seaborne customers in Asia, with remaining volumes sold to North American customers. We expect modest 2012 growth in the U.S. economy, supporting healthy demand for our U.S. Iron Ore business. Conversely, we expect meaningful growth in emerging economies, specifically China, where crude steel production and iron ore imports are anticipated to reach record annual levels. We are maintaining our 2012 business segment outlook, as previously disclosed in January, 2012. Assumptions in this outlook include an average 2012 spot price for 62 percent Fe seaborne iron ore of approximately $150 per ton (C.F.R. China). U.S. Iron Ore 2012 Outlook (Long tons) For 2012, we are maintaining our expected sales volume in U.S. Iron Ore of approximately 23 million tons. U.S. Iron Ore revenue per ton is expected to be approximately $115 to $125, based on the following assumptions: 2012 U.S. blast furnace utilization of approximately 70 percent to 75 percent; and 2012 average hot rolled steel pricing of $700 to $750 per ton. 83 Table of Contents In addition, the revenue per ton expectation also considers various contract provisions, lag year adjustments and pricing caps and floors contained in certain supply agreements. Actual realized revenue per ton for the full year will depend on iron ore price changes, customer mix, production input costs and or steel prices (all factors contained in certain of our supply agreements). Our full year 2012 U.S. Iron Ore cash cost per ton expectation is approximately $60 to $65. Depreciation, depletion and amortization for full year 2012 is expected to be approximately $5 per ton. We also expect our U.S. Iron Ore 2012 production volume of approximately 22 million tons. Eastern Canadian Iron Ore 2012 Outlook (Metric Tons, F.O.B. Eastern Canada) For 2012, we are maintaining our previously disclosed Eastern Canadian Iron Ore expected sales and production volumes of approximately 12 million tons. Our full year 2012 Eastern Canadian Iron Ore revenue per ton outlook is approximately $135 to $145, assuming a product mix of approximately two thirds iron ore concentrate and one third iron ore pellets. Full year 2012 cash costs per ton in Eastern Canadian Iron Ore are expected to be approximately $70 to $75. Depreciation, depletion and amortization is expected to be approximately $19 per ton for full year 2012. Asia Pacific Iron Ore 2012 Outlook (Metric tons, F.O.B. the port) We are maintaining our full year 2012 Asia Pacific Iron Ore expected sales and production volumes of approximately 11 million tons. Our full year 2012 Asia Pacific Iron Ore revenue per ton outlook is approximately $135 to $145, assuming a product mix of approximately half lump and half fines iron ore. Full year 2012 Asia Pacific Iron Ore cash cost per ton is expected to be approximately $65 to $70, which assumes a U.S./Australian dollar exchange rate of $1.03 for 2012. We anticipate depreciation, depletion and amortization to be approximately $13 per ton for full year 2012. North American Coal 2012 Outlook (Short tons, F.O.B. the mine) We are maintaining our 2012 North American Coal sales and production volume expectations of approximately 7.2 million tons and 6.6 million tons, respectfully. Sales volume mix is anticipated to be approximately 4.3 million tons of low volatile metallurgical coal and 1.8 million tons of high volatile metallurgical coal, with thermal coal making up the remainder of the expected sales volume. Our North American Coal 2012 revenue per ton expectation is approximately $140 to $150. Cash cost per ton is anticipated to be approximately $105 to $110, including the impact of sales from higher cost inventory stockpiles at Oak Grove Mine related to the operations recovery from severe weather in 2011. Full year 2012 depreciation, depletion and amortization is expected to be approximately $16 per ton. The table below summarizes our 2012 outlook by business segment. 2012 Outlook Summary U.S.Iron Ore (1) Eastern CanadianIron Ore (2) Asia PacificIron Ore (3) North AmericanCoal (4) Sales volume (million tons) 23 12 11 7.2 Revenue per ton $115 $125 $135 $145 $135 $145 $140 $150 Cash cost per ton $60 $65 $70 $75 $65 $70 $105 $110 DD&A per ton $5 $19 $13 $16 (1) U.S. Iron Ore tons are reported in long tons.

For 2012, we are maintaining our equity sales and production volume expectations of approximately 1.6 million tons. The approximate product mix is expected to be two thirds thermal coal and one third metallurgical coal. Cash cost per ton are expected to be approximately $110. For 2012, depreciation, depletion and amortization is expected to be approximately $14 per ton. We expect Amap&aacute; to contribute over $30 million in equity income in 2012. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses & Other Expectations Our full year 2012 selling, general and administrative expense expectation is approximately $325 million. The year over year increase in selling, general and administrative expense primarily is driven by an increase in growth related corporate projects. We expect to incur cash outflows of approximately $165 million to support future growth, comprised of approximately $90 million related to our global exploration activities and approximately $75 million related to our chromite project in Ontario, Canada. For 2012, we anticipate a full year effective tax rate of approximately 25 percent. In addition, we expect our full year 2012 depreciation, depletion and amortization to be approximately $620 million. 2012 Capital Budget Update and Other Uses of Cash For 2012, based on our outlook, we anticipate generating cash flow from operations of approximately $1.9 billion. We also are maintaining our 2012 capital expenditures outlook, as previously disclosed in January, 2012 of approximately $1 billion. This is comprised of approximately $300 million in sustaining capital and $700 million in growth and productivity improvement capital. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Refer to NOTE 1 BUSINESS SUMMARY AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES of the consolidated financial statements for a description of recent accounting pronouncements, including the respective dates of adoption and effects on results of operations and financial condition. Critical Accounting Estimates Managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. Preparation of financial statements requires management to make assumptions, estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses, and the related disclosures of contingencies. Management bases its estimates on various assumptions and historical experience, which are believed to be reasonable; however, due to the inherent nature of estimates, actual results may differ significantly due to changed conditions or assumptions. On a regular basis, management reviews the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are fairly presented in accordance with GAAP. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material. Management believes that the following critical accounting estimates and judgments have a significant impact on our financial statements. Revenue Recognition U.S. and Eastern Canadian Iron Ore Provisional Pricing Arrangements Most of our U.S. Iron Ore long term supply agreements are comprised of a base price with annual price adjustment factors, some of which are subject to annual price collars in order to limit the percentage increase or decrease in prices for our iron ore pellets during any given year. The base price is the primary component of the purchase price for each contract. The inflation indexed price adjustment factors are integral to the iron ore supply 85 Table of Contents contracts and vary based on the agreement, but typically include adjustments based upon changes in international pellet prices and changes in specified Producers Price Indices, including those for all commodities, industrial commodities, energy and steel. The pricing adjustments generally operate in the same manner, with each factor typically comprising a portion of the price adjustment, although the weighting of each factor varies based upon the specific terms of each agreement. In most cases, these adjustment factors have not been finalized at the time our product is sold. In these cases, we historically have estimated the adjustment factors at each reporting period based upon the best third party information available. The estimates are then adjusted to actual when the information has been finalized. Several of our Eastern Canadian Iron Ore customers have multi year pricing arrangements that contain pricing adjustments that reference certain published market prices for iron ore. To the extent the particular market prices are not published at the end of each reporting period, we estimate the final pricing settlement based upon the best third party information available. Similar to U.S. Iron Ore, the estimates are then adjusted to actual when the published market prices are available. During 2010, the worlds largest iron ore producers moved away from the annual international benchmark pricing mechanism referenced in certain of our U.S. Iron Ore and Eastern Canadian Iron Ore customer supply agreements, resulting in a shift in the industry toward shorter term pricing arrangements linked to the spot market. These changes caused us to assess the impact a change to the historical annual pricing mechanism would have on certain of our larger existing U.S. Iron Ore and Eastern Canadian Iron Ore customer supply agreements, and resulted in modifications to certain of our U.S. Iron Ore and Eastern Canadian Iron Ore customer supply agreements for the 2011 contract year. We reached final pricing settlements with a majority of our U.S. Iron Ore customers through the end of 2011 for the 2011 contract year. However, in some cases we are still working to revise components of the pricing calculations referenced within our supply agreements to incorporate new pricing mechanisms as a result of the changes to historical benchmark pricing. As a result, we have recorded certain shipments made to our U.S. Iron Ore and Eastern Canadian Iron Ore customers throughout the 2011 year on a provisional basis until final settlement is reached. With respect to the U.S. Iron Ore and Eastern Canadian Iron Ore customers for which final pricing for the 2011 contract year has not yet been settled as of December 31, 2011, we recorded derivative assets and liabilities of $1.2 million and $19.5 million, respectively, related to our estimate of final pricing for the 2011 contract year. This amount represents the incremental difference between the provisional prices agreed upon with our customers and our estimate of the ultimate price settlement for the 2011 contract year. In 2010, we reached final pricing settlement with some of our U.S. Iron Ore customers through the fourth quarter of 2010 for the 2010 contract year. With respect to the U.S. Iron Ore and Eastern Canadian Iron Ore customers for which final pricing for the 2010 contract year was not settled as of December 31, 2010, we did not record shipments on a provisional basis due to pending arbitrations that subsequently were settled during 2011. Based on the timing of the provisional pricing settlements and the quality of our estimates, adjustments of our provisional pricing estimates were not material during 2010 and 2009. The Producer Price Indices remain a provisional component of the sales price throughout the contract year and are estimated each quarter using publicly available forecasts of such indices. The final indices referenced in certain of the U.S. Iron Ore supply contracts are typically not published by the U.S. Department of Labor until the second quarter of the subsequent year. As a result, we record an adjustment for the difference between the fourth quarter estimate and the final price in the following year. Historically, such adjustments have not been material as they have represented less than half of 1 percent of U.S. Iron Ores and Eastern Canadian Iron Ores respective revenues for each of the three preceding fiscal years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009. U.S. Iron Ore Customer Supply Agreements In addition, certain supply agreements with one U.S. Iron Ore customer include provisions for supplemental revenue or refunds based on the customers average annual steel pricing for the year the product is consumed in the customers blast furnaces. The supplemental pricing is characterized as a freestanding derivative and is required to be accounted for separately once the product is shipped. The derivative instrument, which is finalized based on a future price, is marked to fair value as a revenue adjustment each reporting period until the pellets are consumed and the amounts are settled. The fair value of the instrument is determined using a market approach 86 Table of Contents based on an estimate of the annual realized price of hot rolled steel at the steelmakers facilities, and takes into consideration current market conditions and nonperformance risk. At December 31, 2011, we had a derivative asset of $72.9 million, representing the fair value of the pricing factors, based upon the amount of unconsumed tons and an estimated average hot band steel price related to the period in which the tons are expected to be consumed in the customers blast furnace at each respective steelmaking facility, subject to final pricing at a future date. This compares with a derivative asset of $45.6 million as of December 31, 2010, based upon the amount of unconsumed tons and the related estimated average hot band steel price. The customers average annual price is not known at the time of sale and the actual price is received on a delayed basis at the end of the year, once the average annual price has been finalized. As a result, we estimate the average price and adjust the estimate to actual in the fourth quarter when the information is provided by the customer at the end of each year. Information used in developing the estimate includes such factors as production and pricing information from the customer, current spot prices, third party analyst forecasts, publications and other industry information. The accuracy of our estimates typically increases as the year progresses based on additional information in the market becoming available and the customers ability to more accurately determine the average price it will realize for the year. The following represents the historical accuracy of our pricing estimates related to the derivative as well as the impact on revenue resulting from the difference between the estimated price and the actual price for each quarter during 2011, 2010 and 2009 prior to receiving final information from the customer for tons consumed during each year: 2011 2010 2009 FinalPrice EstimatedPrice Impact onRevenue(in millions) FinalPrice EstimatedPrice Impact onRevenue(in millions) FinalPrice EstimatedPrice Impact onRevenue(in millions) First Quarter $ 700 $ 715 $ (0.7 ) $ 593 $ 624 $ (0.8 ) $ 528 $ 523 $ 1.2 Second Quarter 700 731 (5.8 ) 593 634 (12.1 ) 528 545 (1.3 ) Third Quarter 700 716 (4.3 ) 593 609 (7.0 ) 528 536 (0.1 ) Fourth Quarter 700 700 593 593 528 528 We estimate that a $75 change in the average hot band steel price realized from the December 31, 2011 estimated price recorded for the unconsumed tons remaining at year end would cause the fair value of the derivative instrument to increase or decrease by approximately $7 million, thereby impacting our consolidated revenues by the same amount. Asia Pacific Iron Ore Provisional Pricing Arrangements Historically, certain supply agreements primarily with our Asia Pacific Iron Ore customers provided for revenue or refunds based on the ultimate settlement of annual international benchmark pricing for lump and fines. As a result of the derivative accounting treatment applied to the provisions, revenue reflected the estimated benchmark price until final settlement occurred. Therefore, to the extent final prices were higher or lower than what was recorded on a provisional basis, an increase or decrease to revenues was recorded each reporting period until the date of final pricing. Accordingly, in times of rising iron ore prices, our revenues benefited from higher prices received for contracts priced at the current benchmark price and also from an increase related to the final pricing of provisionally priced sales pursuant to contracts entered into in prior periods; in times of falling iron ore prices, the opposite occurred. Pricing estimates primarily were based upon reported price settlements in the industry and worldwide pressures in the market. As discussed above, in 2010, the worlds largest iron ore producers moved away from the annual international benchmark pricing mechanism referenced in certain of our customer supply agreements, resulting in a shift in the industry toward shorter term pricing arrangements linked to the spot market. As a result, we renegotiated the terms of our supply agreements with our Chinese and Japanese Asia Pacific Iron Ore customers and moved to shorter term pricing mechanisms of various durations based on the average daily spot prices, with certain pricing mechanisms that had a duration of up to a quarter. This change was effective in the first quarter of 2010 for our Chinese customers and the second quarter of 2010 for our Japanese customers. Based on timing of these changes, pricing settlements were finalized with customers during each of the 2010 quarters with the exception of the first quarter of 2010. Therefore, provisional pricing estimates were used during the first quarter 87 Table of Contents of 2010 and reflected an increase of 26 percent over 2009 settled prices for both lump and fines based on provisional quarterly index pricing. The pricing estimates for the first quarter of 2010 reflected the increase in steel demand and spot prices for iron ore and were based upon index pricing mechanisms previously reported in the industry. In addition, sales to our Japanese customers during the first quarter of 2010 reflected 2009 prices based upon contract years of April 1 to March 31. The following represents the historical accuracy of our provisional price estimates, as well as the impact on Product revenues resulting from the difference between the estimated change in price and the actual change in price for the quarters during 2010 and 2009 prior to settlement. The derivative instrument recorded during the first quarter of 2010 was settled during the second quarter of 2010 upon the move to short term pricing arrangements with Asia Pacific Iron Ore customers. The timing of the pricing settlements for 2010 and 2009 is described further in the table below. Provisional pricing arrangements did not occur in 2011. As such, 2011 is not included within the table below.

We agreed to final prices with our customers in China during the fourth quarter of 2009. Prices with our customers in China were settled at the estimated price decreases and therefore no additional revenue impact was realized during 2009. (2) The impact of product revenue resulted from the difference between the estimated price and the actual price was recorded in the second quarter of each respective year in the table above. Mineral Reserves We regularly evaluate our economic mineral reserves and update them as required in accordance with SEC Industry Guide 7. The estimated mineral reserves could be affected by future industry conditions, geological conditions and ongoing mine planning. Maintenance of effective production capacity or the mineral reserve could require increases in capital and development expenditures. Generally, as mining operations progress, haul lengths and lifts increase. Alternatively, changes in economic conditions or the expected quality of mineral reserves could decrease capacity or mineral reserves. Technological progress could alleviate such factors or increase capacity of mineral reserves. We use our mineral reserve estimates, combined with our estimated annual production levels, to determine the mine closure dates utilized in recording the fair value liability for asset retirement obligations. Refer to NOTE 9 ENVIRONMENTAL AND MINE CLOSURE OBLIGATIONS, for further information. Since the liability represents the present value of the expected future obligation, a significant change in mineral reserves or mine lives would have a substantial effect on the recorded obligation. We also utilize economic mineral reserves for evaluating potential impairments of mine assets and in determining maximum useful lives utilized to calculate depreciation and amortization of long lived mine assets. Increases or decreases in mineral reserves or mine lives could significantly affect these items. 88 Table of Contents Asset Retirement Obligations and Environmental Remediation Costs The accrued mine closure obligations for our active mining operations provide for contractual and legal obligations associated with the eventual closure of the mining operations. Our obligations are determined based on detailed estimates adjusted for factors that a market participant would consider (i.e., inflation, overhead and profit), which are escalated at an assumed rate of inflation to the estimated closure dates, and then discounted using the current credit adjusted risk free interest rate. The estimate also incorporates incremental increases in the closure cost estimates and changes in estimates of mine lives. The closure date for each location is determined based on the exhaustion date of the remaining iron ore reserves, which is dependent on our estimate of the economically recoverable mineral reserves. The estimated obligations are particularly sensitive to the impact of changes in mine lives given the difference between the inflation and discount rates. Changes in the base estimates of legal and contractual closure costs due to changes in legal or contractual requirements, available technology, inflation, overhead or profit rates also would have a significant impact on the recorded obligations. We have a formal policy for environmental protection and restoration. Our obligations for known environmental matters at active and closed mining operations and other sites have been recognized based on estimates of the cost of investigation and remediation at each site. If the obligation can only be estimated as a range of possible amounts, with no specific amount being more likely, the minimum of the range is accrued. Management reviews its environmental remediation sites quarterly to determine if additional cost adjustments or disclosures are required. The characteristics of environmental remediation obligations, where information concerning the nature and extent of clean up activities is not immediately available and which are subject to changes in regulatory requirements, result in a significant risk of increase to the obligations as they mature. Expected future expenditures are not discounted to present value unless the amount and timing of the cash disbursements can be reasonably estimated. Potential insurance recoveries are not recognized until realized. Refer to NOTE 9 ENVIRONMENTAL AND MINE CLOSURE OBLIGATIONS, for further information. Income Taxes Our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect managements best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid. We are subject to income taxes in both the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax expense. Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent financial operations. In projecting future taxable income, we begin with historical results adjusted for the results of discontinued operations and changes in accounting policies and incorporate assumptions including the amount of future state, federal and foreign pretax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences, and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses. In evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide, we consider three years of cumulative operating income (loss). At December 31, 2011 and 2010, we had a valuation allowance of $223.9 million and $172.7 million, respectively, against our deferred tax assets. Our losses in certain foreign locations in recent periods represented sufficient negative evidence to require a full valuation allowance against certain of our foreign deferred tax assets. We intend to maintain a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets until sufficient positive evidence exists to support the realization of such assets. Changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. Management is not aware of any such changes that would have a material effect on the Companys results of operations, cash flows or financial position. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. 89 Table of Contents Accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements requires that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on technical merits. We recognize tax liabilities in accordance with ASC 740, and we adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of evaluation of new information not previously available. Due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. These differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined. Goodwill Impairment Goodwill represents the excess purchase price paid over the fair value of the net assets of acquired companies. We assign goodwill arising from acquired companies to the reporting units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the acquisition. Our reporting units are either at the operating segment level or a component one level below our operating segments that constitutes a business for which management generally reviews production and financial results of that component. Decisions are often made as to capital expenditures, investments and production plans at the component level as part of the ongoing management of the related operating segment. We have determined that our Asia Pacific Iron Ore and Ferroalloys operating segments constitute separate reporting units, that our Bloom Lake and Wabush mines within our Eastern Canadian Iron Ore operating segment constitute reporting units, that CLCC within our North American Coal operating segment constitutes a reporting unit and that our Northshore mine within our U.S. Iron Ore operating segment constitutes a reporting unit. Goodwill is allocated among and evaluated for impairment at the reporting unit level in the fourth quarter of each year or as circumstances occur that potentially indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable. There were no such events or changes in circumstances during 2011. As of December 31, 2011, the remaining value of goodwill associated with our Eastern Canadian Iron Ore, Asia Pacific Iron Ore, Ferroalloys and U.S. Iron Ore reporting operating segments totaled $986.2 million, $83.0 million, $80.9 million and $2.0 million, respectively. No goodwill remains within our North American Coal reporting unit as of December 31, 2011. We use a two step process to test goodwill for impairment. In the first step, we generally use a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of each reporting unit, which considers forecasted cash flows discounted at an estimated weighted average cost of capital. In assessing the recoverability of our goodwill, significant assumptions regarding the estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of a reporting unit must be made, including among other things, estimates related to long term price expectations, foreign currency exchange rates, expected capital expenditures and working capital requirements, which are based upon our long range plan and life of mine estimates. If the discounted cash flow analysis yields a fair value estimate less than the reporting units carrying value, we would proceed to step two of the impairment test. In the second step, the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill is determined by allocating the reporting units fair value to the assets and liabilities other than goodwill in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation. In performing this allocation of fair value to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, we utilize third party valuation firms to support the fair values allocated. The resulting implied fair value of the goodwill that results from the application of this second step is then compared to the carrying amount of the goodwill and, if the carrying amount exceeds the implied fair value, an impairment charge is recorded for the difference. If these estimates were to change in the future as a result of changes in strategy or market conditions, we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets in the period such determination was made. After performing our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2011, we determined that $27.8 million of goodwill associated with our CLCC reporting unit was impaired as the carrying value within this reporting unit exceeded its fair value. The fair value was determined using a combination of a discounted cash flow model and valuations of comparable businesses. The impairment charge for the CLCC reporting unit was driven by our overall outlook on coal pricing in light of economic conditions, increases in our anticipated costs to bring the Lower War Eagle mine into production and increases in our anticipated sustaining capital cost for the lives of the CLCC mines that are currently operating. 90 Table of Contents No impairment charges were identified in connection with our annual goodwill impairment test with respect to our other identified reporting units. However, a 20 percent decrease in the fair value of our Ferroalloys reporting unit could indicate the potential for an impairment of its goodwill. With respect to the Ferroalloys reporting unit, no impairment charges were taken as of December 31, 2011, due in part to the fact that the project within the reporting unit is still in the pre feasibility stage. As management continues to work through the pre feasibility stage for the project, higher than anticipated capital costs and our ability to secure regulatory and environmental permitting could impact this determination. The fair value of our Bloom Lake operating unit was not substantially in excess of our carrying values due to the fact that this reporting unit is comprised of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed through our acquisition of Consolidated Thompson in 2011. Therefore, our carrying values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed for the Bloom Lake operating unit were recorded at fair value through the completion of the acquisition. These fair values are preliminary and subject to modification in the future. A substantial decline in long term pricing expectations and higher than anticipated costs on expansion projects for Bloom Lake could result in future impairment indicators. We determined that our other identified reporting units were not at risk of failing the first step of the goodwill impairment test as of December 31, 2011. The fair values for our Asia Pacific Iron Ore, Wabush and Northshore reporting units were substantially in excess of our carrying values. Refer to NOTE 1 BUSINESS SUMMARY AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, for further information regarding our policy on goodwill impairment. Asset Impairment In assessing the recoverability of our long lived assets, significant assumptions regarding the estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets must be made, as well as the related estimated useful lives. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future as a result of changes in strategy or market conditions, we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets in the period such determination was made. We monitor conditions that indicate that the carrying value of an asset or asset group may be impaired. In order to determine if assets have been impaired, assets are grouped and tested at the lowest level for which identifiable, independent cash flows are available. An impairment loss exists when projected undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the assets. The measurement of the impairment loss to be recognized is based on the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the assets. Fair value can be determined using a market approach, income approach or cost approach. The impairment analysis and fair value determination can result in substantially different outcomes based on critical assumptions and estimates including the quantity and quality of remaining economic ore reserves, future iron ore prices and production costs. Refer to NOTE 1 BUSINESS SUMMARY AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, for further information regarding our policy on asset impairment. Employee Retirement Benefit Obligations We offer defined benefit pension plans, defined contribution pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans, primarily consisting of retiree healthcare benefits, to most employees in North America as part of a total compensation and benefits program. This includes employees of CLCC who became employees of the Company through the July 2010 acquisition. Upon the acquisition of the remaining 73.2 percent interest in Wabush in February 2010, we fully consolidated the Canadian plans into our pension and OPEB obligations. We do not have employee retirement benefit obligations at our Asia Pacific Iron Ore operations. The defined benefit pension plans largely are noncontributory and benefits generally are based on employees years of service and average earnings for a defined period prior to retirement or a minimum formula. 91 Table of Contents Following is a summary of our defined benefit pension and OPEB funding and expense for the years 2009 through 2012: Pension OPEB Funding Expense Funding Expense 2009 $ 18.5 $ 50.8 $ 35.7 $ 25.5 2010 45.6 45.6 38.5 24.2 2011 70.1 37.8 37.4 26.8 2012 (Estimated) 66.3 54.5 41.2 29.4 Assumptions used in determining the benefit obligations and the value of plan assets for defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefit plans (primarily retiree healthcare benefits) that we offer are evaluated periodically by management. Critical assumptions, such as the discount rate used to measure the benefit obligations, the expected long term rate of return on plan assets, the medical care cost trend, and the rate of compensation increase are reviewed annually. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, we used the following assumptions: Pension and OtherBenefits 2011 2010 U.S. plan discount rate 4.28 % 5.11 % Canadian pension plan discount rate 4.00 5.00 Canadian OPEB plan discount rate 4.25 5.00 Rate of compensation increase 4.00 4.00 U.S. expected return on plan assets 8.25 8.50 Canadian expected return on plan assets 7.25 7.50 Additionally, on December 31, 2011, we adopted the IRS 2012 prescribed mortality tables (separate pre retirement and postretirement) to determine the expected life of our plan participants, replacing the IRS 2011 prescribed mortality tables for our U.S. plans. The assumed mortality remained the same as the previous year for our Canadian plans, UP 1994 with full projection. Following are sensitivities of potential further changes in these key assumptions on the estimated 2012 pension and OPEB expense and the pension and OPEB benefit obligations as of December 31, 2011: Increase inExpense(In Millions) Increase in BenefitObligation(In Millions) Pension OPEB Pension OPEB Decrease discount rate .25 percent $ 1.9 $ 2.0 $ 32.7 $ 16.4 Decrease return on assets 1 percent 7.3 2.1 N/A N/A Increase medical trend rate 1 percent N/A 11.0 N/A 60.0 Changes in actuarial assumptions, including discount rates, employee retirement rates, mortality, compensation levels, plan asset investment performance and healthcare costs, are determined based on analyses of actual and expected factors. Changes in actuarial assumptions and or investment performance of plan assets may have a significant impact on our financial condition due to the magnitude of our retirement obligations.
