ITEM 7 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview We have grown significantly in recent years through both strategic acquisitions and growth in our existing businesses. On November 18, 2002, we completed the acquisition of AT&T Corp.s broadband business (the "Broadband acquisition"). The Broadband acquisition substantially increased the size of our cable operations and caused significant changes in our capital structure, including a substantially higher amount of debt. As a result, direct comparisons of our results of operations and financial condition for periods prior to November 18, 2002 to subsequent periods are not meaningful. In February 2003, we announced that we had entered into a definitive agreement with Bresnan Broadband Holdings, LLC and Bresnan Communications, LLC (together "Bresnan") pursuant to which we agreed to transfer to Bresnan cable systems serving approximately 317,000 subscribers in Montana, Wyoming, Colorado and Utah that we had acquired in connection with the Broadband acquisition. We reflect these systems as assets held for sale in our consolidated balance sheet and as discontinued operations in our consolidated statement of operations. Accordingly, we have excluded these systems results in our discussions of liquidity and capital resources, statement of cash flows and results of operations for all periods presented. We have historically met our cash needs for operations through our cash flows from operating activities. We have generally financed our acquisitions and capital expenditures through issuances of our common stock, borrowings of long term debt, sales of investments and from existing cash, cash equivalents and short term investments. General Developments of Business Refer to "General Developments of Our Business" in Part I and Note 5 to our financial statements included in Item 8 for a discussion of our acquisitions and other significant events. Significant and Subjective Estimates The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making estimates about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Refer to Note 2 to our financial statements included in Item 8 for a discussion of our accounting policies with respect to these and other items. Critical Accounting Judgments and Estimates We believe our judgments and related estimates associated with the impairment testing and valuation of our cable franchise rights, and the valuation of acquisition related assets, liabilities and legal contingencies, to be critical in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting judgments and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors and the Audit Committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to them presented below. Impairment Testing and Valuation of Cable Franchise Rights Our cable systems are constructed and operated under non exclusive franchises granted by state or local governmental authorities for varying lengths of time. As of December 31, 2002, we served approximately 4,600 franchise areas in the United States. We have concluded that our cable franchise rights have an indefinite useful life since there are no legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other factors limiting the period over which these rights will contribute to our cash flows. Accordingly, our cable franchise rights are not subject to amortization but are assessed periodically for impairment in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." We have acquired these franchise rights either directly from local franchise authorities or through many separate cable system acquisitions that include multiple franchise territories. Upon acquisition, we integrate the individual franchise territories into our national footprint. While our Cable Division is organized nationally into six geographic divisions, which are further organized into geographic clusters of cable systems, we operate our cable operations and their associated franchise rights as a single asset, essentially inseparable from one another. 22 We have concluded that the preponderance of indicators in Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") 02 7, "Unit of Accounting for Testing Impairment of Indefinite Lived Intangible Assets," supports the testing of our cable franchise rights for impairment at the cable segment level, which is the same unit of accounting used by us to test cable related goodwill for impairment. We assess the recoverability of our cable franchise rights annually or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. We estimate the fair value of our cable franchise rights primarily based on a multiple of operating income before depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") generated by the underlying assets. The EBITDA multiple used in our evaluation is determined based on our analyses of current market transactions, profitability information, including estimated future operating results, trends or other determinants of fair value. We also consider other valuation methods such as discounted cash flow analyses. If the value of our cable franchise rights determined by these evaluations is less than its carrying amount, an impairment charge would be recognized for the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of the assets. Future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of the related business may indicate an inability to recover the carrying value of the assets, thereby possibly requiring a future impairment charge. As more fully described in Note 5 to our financial statements included in Item 8 (see Acquisition of Broadband), the fair value of the shares issued for Broadband was based on the date the non equity, or "other" consideration being paid was substantively changed from the terms of the original merger agreement. The fair value of the shares issued for Broadband based on the new measurement date was approximately one half the fair value assigned to the shares as of the date of the original merger agreement. Accordingly, the effect of the modification was to reduce by approximately one half (approximately $23 billion) the value assigned to the equity consideration issued in connection with the Broadband acquisition. As a significant portion of the purchase price was allocated to indefinite lived cable franchise rights and to goodwill, the reduction in the fair value of the equity consideration reduces the likelihood of a future impairment charge related to our cable franchise rights or goodwill. The carrying amount of cable franchise rights related to our historical cable systems is significantly less than their current estimated fair value largely because we acquired many of these rights directly from local franchise authorities rather than through separate cable system acquisitions. Conversely, the carrying amount of cable franchise rights for our more recent cable system acquisitions has not been significantly reduced through amortization (and has not been reduced at all for acquisitions made subsequent to the adoption of SFAS No. 142). Nevertheless, testing for impairment at the cable segment level reduces the likelihood of a future impairment charge related to our cable franchise rights. Fair Value of Acquisition Related Assets, Liabilities and Legal Contingencies We allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. In determining fair value, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the recorded amounts. To assist in this process, third party valuation specialists are engaged to value certain of these assets and liabilities. Estimates used in valuing acquired assets and liabilities include but are not limited to: expected future cash flows; market rate assumptions for contractual obligations; actuarial assumptions for benefit plans; settlement plans for litigation and contingencies; and appropriate discount rates. Managements estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain. In addition, estimated liabilities to exit activities of the acquired operations, including the exiting of contractual obligations and the termination of employees, are subject to change as management continues its assessment of operations and finalizes its integration plans. The assets and assumed liabilities related to the Broadband acquisition requiring significant judgment in estimating fair value include investments, cable franchise rights, franchise related customer relationships, assumed contractual and other obligations, and costs related to terminating certain of Broadbands contractual obligations and employees. In addition, we are party to certain Broadband legal contingencies, including those described in Item 3, Legal Proceedings. If, based on information available, a potential loss arising from these lawsuits, claims and actions was deemed probable and reasonably estimable, we recorded the estimated liability in the purchase price allocation. While management believes the recorded liabilities are adequate, additional information related to these cases is still being obtained. In addition, the inherent limitations in the estimation process may cause future actual losses to exceed expected losses. Our estimates associated with the accounting for the Broadband acquisition have and will continue to change as final reports from valuation specialists are obtained and additional information becomes available regarding 23 assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Since the publication of our 2002 year end earnings release, the ongoing valuation and allocation process has resulted in inconsequential changes to the balance sheet, primarily affecting non amortizable intangible assets and related deferred tax liabilities. Changes in the amounts assigned to other acquisition related assets and liabilities may affect operating results, or gains or losses upon the disposition of assets acquired, in future periods. Liquidity and Capital Resources The cable and the electronic retailing industries are experiencing increasing competition and rapid technological changes. Our future results of operations will be affected by our ability to react to changes in the competitive environment and by our ability to implement new technologies. We believe that competition and technological changes will not significantly affect our ability to obtain financing. In order to preserve the treatment of the Broadband acquisition as tax free, our ability to redeem stock or issue equity securities will be limited through December 2004. As of December 31, 2002, we had the ability to issue at least 250 million shares of our common stock without affecting the tax treatment of the Broadband acquisition. We believe that we will be able to meet our current and long term liquidity and capital requirements, including fixed charges, through our cash flows from operating activities, existing cash, cash equivalents and investments, and through available borrowings under our existing credit facilities. Available sources of financing to fund these requirements include: o our existing cash and cash equivalents, which totaled $781 million as of December 31, 2002, o amounts available under our and our subsidiaries lines of credit, which totaled $5.949 billion as of December 31, 2002, o proceeds of approximately $525 million from the sale of cable systems to Bresnan Broadband Holdings, LLC and Bresnan Communications, LLC, a transaction we expect will close by the end of the first quarter of 2003, o proceeds of approximately $725 million from the sale of our interest in a cable joint venture with Charter Communications, Inc., a transaction we expect to close in April 2003, and o through the sales or restructurings of our other investments, including $2.1 billion of cash due upon the restructuring of Time Warner Entertainment L.P. ("TWE"). In addition, as more fully described in Note 5 to our financial statements included in Item 8 (see TWE Restructuring), upon closing of the TWE restructuring agreement, we will receive $1.5 billion in common stock of AOL Time Warner and an approximate 21% equity interest in Time Warner Cable, Inc. Refer to the Contractual Obligations table on page 29 and to Note 13 to our financial statements included in Item 8 for a discussion of our commitments and contingencies. Cash and Cash Equivalents We have traditionally maintained significant levels of cash and cash equivalents to meet our short term liquidity requirements. Our cash equivalents are recorded at fair value. Cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2002 were $781 million, substantially all of which is unrestricted. Investments A significant portion of our investments are in publicly traded companies and are reflected at fair value, which fluctuates with market changes. We do not have any significant contractual funding commitments with respect to any of our investments. Our ownership interests in these investments may, however, be diluted if we do not fund our investees non binding capital calls. We continually evaluate our existing investments, as well as new investment opportunities. Refer to Note 6 to our financial statements included in Item 8 for a discussion of our investments. Capital Expenditures During 2003, we expect to incur approximately $4.2 billion of capital expenditures in our cable, commerce and content businesses, including approximately $4 billion for our cable operations. We anticipate capital expenditures for years subsequent to 2003 will continue to be significant. As of December 31, 2002, we do not have any significant contractual obligations for capital expenditures. Cable We expect our 2003 cable capital expenditures will include approximately $1.3 billion for the upgrading and rebuilding of certain of our cable systems, approximately 24 $1.8 billion for the deployment of cable modems, digital converters and new service offerings, and approximately $0.9 billion for recurring capital projects. We expect to substantially complete the upgrade and rebuild of the newly acquired systems by the end of 2004 for a total cost of $2.2 billion to $2.5 billion. The amount of our capital expenditures for years subsequent to 2003 will depend on numerous factors, some of which are beyond our control including: o competition, o changes in technology, and o the timing and rate of deployment of new services. Commerce During 2003, we expect to incur approximately $125 million of capital expenditures for QVC, primarily to maintain QVCs distribution facilities and information systems. Capital expenditures in QVCs international operations represent nearly 40% of QVCs total capital expenditures. On March 3, 2003, we announced that Liberty Media Corporation delivered a notice to us, pursuant to the stockholders agreement between us and Liberty, that triggers an exit rights process with respect to Libertys approximate 42% interest in QVC. We and Liberty will attempt to negotiate the fair market value of QVC prior to March 31, 2003. If we and Liberty cannot agree, an appraisal process will determine the value of QVC. We will then have the right to purchase Libertys interest in QVC at the determined value. We may pay Liberty for the QVC stock in cash, in a promissory note maturing not more than three years after issuance, in our equity securities or in a combination of these, subject to Libertys right to request payment in all equity securities and the parties obligation to use reasonable efforts to consummate the purchase in the most tax efficient method available (provided that we are not required to issue securities representing more than 4.9% of the outstanding equity or vote of our common stock). If we elect not to purchase Libertys interest in QVC, Liberty then will have a similar right to purchase our approximate 57% interest in QVC. If neither we nor Liberty elect to purchase the interest of the other, then we and Liberty are required to use our best efforts to sell QVC; either company is permitted to be a purchaser in any such sale. We and Liberty may agree not to enter into a transaction, or may agree to a transaction other than that specified in the stockholders agreement. Under the current terms of the stockholders agreement between us and Liberty, we would no longer control QVC if we elect not to purchase Libertys interest in QVC. Affiliation Agreements Certain of our content subsidiaries and QVC enter into multi year affiliation agreements with various cable and satellite system operators for carriage of their respective programming. In connection with these affiliation agreements, we generally pay a fee to the cable or satellite operator based upon the number of subscribers. During 2003, we expect to incur $150 million to $200 million related to these affiliation agreements, excluding amounts applicable to our cable systems. Financing As of December 31, 2002 and 2001, our debt, including capital lease obligations, was $34.910 billion and $12.202 billion, respectively. The $22.708 billion increase from December 31, 2001 to December 31, 2002 results from the effects of the Broadband acquisition, offset by the effects of net debt repayments. Included in our debt as of December 31, 2002 was short term debt and current portion of long term debt of $6.953 billion. In January and March 2003, we sold an aggregate of $3.0 billion of public debt consisting of $600 million of 5.85% senior notes due 2010, $900 million of 6.50% senior notes due 2015, $750 million of 5.50% senior notes due 2011 and $750 million of 7.05% senior notes due 2033. We used all of the net proceeds from the offerings to repay a portion of our short term debt. As a result of the Broadband acquisition, we assumed notes exchangeable into the common stock of Cablevision NY Group Class A common stock, Microsoft Corporation ("Microsoft") common stock, Vodafone ADRs, and Comcast Class A Special common stock (together, the "Exchangeable Notes"). At maturity the Exchangeable Notes are mandatorily redeemable at our option into (i) a number of shares of common stock or ADRs equal to the underlying shares multiplied by an exchange ratio (as defined), or (ii) its cash equivalent. The maturity value of the Exchangeable Notes varies based upon the fair market value of the security to which it is indexed. The Exchangeable Notes are collateralized by our investments in Cablevision, Microsoft and Vodafone, respectively, and our Class A Special common stock held in treasury. As of December 31, 2002, our debt includes an aggregate of $5.459 billion of Exchangeable Notes, including $1.555 billion and $3.904 billion within current portion of long term debt and long term debt, respectively. As of December 31, 2002, our investments include Cablevision, Microsoft and Vodafone securities with an aggregate fair value of $4.420 billion, including $1.993 billion and $2.427 billion within short term and 25 noncurrent investments, respectively. Upon closing of the Broadband acquisition, we classified the Comcast shares, which are held by a subsidiary of ours, as treasury stock within stockholders equity. As of December 31, 2002, the securities held by us collateralizing the Exchangeable Notes were sufficient to satisfy the debt obligations associated with the outstanding Exchangeable Notes. Excluding the effects of interest rate risk management instruments, 31.8% and 13.4% of our long term debt, including short term debt and current portion, as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively, was at variable rates. The increase from December 31, 2001 to December 31, 2002 in the percentage of our variable rate debt was due principally to the effects of the Broadband acquisition. We have, and may from time to time in the future, depending on certain factors including market conditions, make optional repayments on our debt obligations, which may include open market repurchases of our outstanding public notes and debentures. Refer to Notes 8 and 10 to our financial statements included in Item 8 for a discussion of our financing activities. Interest Rate Risk Management We are exposed to the market risk of adverse changes in interest rates. We maintain a mix of fixed and variable rate debt and enter into various derivative transactions pursuant to our policies to manage the volatility relating to these exposures. We monitor our interest rate risk exposures using techniques including market value and sensitivity analyses. We do not hold or issue any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to leveraged instruments. We manage the credit risks associated with our derivative financial instruments through the evaluation and monitoring of the creditworthiness of the counterparties. Although we may be exposed to losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties, we do not expect such losses, if any, to be significant. We use interest rate exchange agreements ("Swaps") to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and variable interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed upon notional principal amount. We use interest rate lock agreements ("Rate Locks") to hedge the risk that cash flows related to the interest payments on an anticipated issuance or assumption of fixed rate debt may be adversely affected by interest rate fluctuations. We use interest rate cap agreements ("Caps") to lock in a maximum interest rate should variable rates rise, but enable us to otherwise pay lower market rates. We use interest rate collar agreements ("Collars") to limit our exposure to and benefits from interest rate fluctuations on variable rate debt to within a certain range of rates. The table set forth below summarizes the fair values and contract terms of financial instruments subject to interest rate risk maintained by us as of December 31, 2002 (dollars in millions): Fair Value at 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 Thereafter Total 12/31/02 Debt Fixed Rate.......................... $2,162 $1,720 $2,637 $1,789 $1,131 $14,363 $23,802 $25,719 Average Interest Rate............ 7.1% 6.7% 7.2% 7.2% 8.2% 8.0% 7.7% Variable Rate....................... $4,791 $4,415 $1,817 $45 $39 $1 $11,108 $11,108 Average Interest Rate............ 2.4% 2.6% 2.8% 4.0% 3.0% 7.4% 2.6% Interest Rate Instruments Variable to Fixed Swaps............. $608 $715 $488 $1,811 $64 Average Pay Rate................. 7.3% 7.6% 7.6% 7.5% Average Receive Rate............. 1.4% 1.7% 2.2% 1.7% Fixed to Variable Swaps............. $300 $300 $41 Average Pay Rate................. 7.8% 7.8% Average Receive Rate............. 9.7% 9.7% The notional amounts of interest rate instruments, as presented in the table above, are used to measure interest to be paid or received and do not represent the amount of exposure to credit loss. The estimated fair value approximates the proceeds to settle the outstanding contracts. We estimate interest rates on variable debt using the average implied forward London Interbank Offer Rate ("LIBOR") rates for the year of maturity based on the yield curve in effect at December 31, 2002, plus the borrowing margin in effect for each credit facility at 26 December 31, 2002. We estimate average receive rates on the Variable to Fixed Swaps using the average implied forward LIBOR rates for the year of maturity based on the yield curve in effect at December 31, 2002. While Swaps, Rate Locks, Caps and Collars represent an integral part of our interest rate risk management program, their incremental effect on interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 was not significant. Equity Price Risk Management We have entered into cashless collar agreements (the "Equity Collars") and prepaid forward sales agreements ("Prepaid Forward Sales") which we account for at fair value. The Equity Collars and Prepaid Forward Sales limit our exposure to and benefits from price fluctuations in the common stock of certain of our investments accounted for as trading securities. Refer to Note 6 to our financial statements included in Item 8 for a discussion of our Prepaid Forward Sales. The change in the fair value of our investments accounted for as trading securities was substantially offset by the changes in the fair value of the Equity Collars, the derivative components of the ZONES, the Exchangeable Notes and the Prepaid Forward Sales. See "Results of Operations Investment Income (Expense)" below. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) The change in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) from December 31, 2001 to December 31, 2002 is principally attributable to unrealized losses on our Rate Locks classified as cash flow hedges entered into in 2002, to declines in unrealized gains on our investments classified as available for sale held throughout the period, and to realized losses on sales of investments and investment impairment losses on investments classified as available for sale during 2002. Refer to Notes 6 and 8 to our financial statements in Item 8. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations In January 2003, the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") issued final rules which require the disclosure of material off balance sheet arrangements and known contractual obligations as of the most recent balance sheet date. The new rules are effective with our 2003 Annual Report. The disclosures below are based on the requirements of the new rules. We do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources, as defined under the new rules. Refer to Notes 8 and 13 to our financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for a description of our obligations related to guarantees, operating leases and other commitments. We have summarized our known contractual obligations as of December 31, 2002, and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods, in a tabular format prescribed by the new SEC rules. Refer to Note 8 to our financial statements included in Item 8 for a description of our long term debt. Refer to Note 13 to our financial statements included in Item 8 for a description of our operating lease and purchase obligations. Refer to Note 5 to our financial statements included in Item 8 for a description of our acquisition related obligations. Contractual Obligations Payments Due by Period More Years Years than 5 Total Year 1 2 3 4 5 years (dollars in millions) Debt obligations ............................... $34,678 $6,936 $10,474 $2,923 $14,345 Capital lease obligations ...................... 232 17 115 81 19 Operating lease obligations..................... 1,120 248 354 220 298 Purchase obligations (1)........................ 1,373 230 392 258 493 Other long term liabilities reflected on the balance sheet Acquisition related obligations (2)........ 2,377 869 516 261 731 Other long term obligations (3)............ 935 294 334 69 238 Total........................................... $40,715 $8,594 $12,185 $3,812 $16,124 (1) Purchase obligations consist of agreements to purchase goods and services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, price provisions and timing of the transaction. Our purchase obligations consist of the employment agreements that we, through Comcast Spectacor, have with both players and coaches of our professional sports teams and license agreements that our programming networks have entered into for programs and sporting events which will be available 27 for telecast subsequent to December 31, 2002. Certain of these employment agreements, which provide for payments that are guaranteed regardless of employee injury or termination, are covered by disability insurance if certain conditions are met. (2) Acquisition related obligations consist primarily of costs related to terminating employees, costs relating to exiting contractual obligations, and other assumed contractual obligations of the acquired entity. (3) Other long term obligations consist principally of our deferred compensation obligations, pension, post retirement and post employment benefit obligations, and program rights payable under license agreements. Statement of Cash Flows Cash and cash equivalents increased $431 million as of December 31, 2002 from December 31, 2001. The increase in cash and cash equivalents resulted from cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities as explained below. Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations amounted to $2.995 billion for the year ended December 31, 2002, due principally to our operating income before depreciation and amortization (see "Results of Operations"), offset by changes in working capital as a result of the timing of receipts and disbursements and the effects of net interest and current income tax expense. Net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations includes borrowings and repayments of debt, proceeds from settlements of Swaps, issuances and repurchases of our equity securities and deferred financing costs. Net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations was $1.292 billion for the year ended December 31, 2002. During 2002, we borrowed $8.759 billion, consisting of: o $7.180 billion under our New Credit Facilities, o $1.135 billion under revolving credit facilities, and o $444 million under Comcast Cables commercial paper program. During 2002, we repaid $9.808 billion of our debt, consisting of: o $5.85 billion of Broadband intercompany indebtedness due at closing of the Broadband acquisition, o $1.525 billion on certain of our revolving credit facilities, o $1.023 billion of our Zero Coupon Debentures, o $841 million under Comcast Cables commercial paper program, o $250 million of short term debt, o $200 million of our senior subordinated debentures, and o $119 million under capital leases and other. During 2002, we received proceeds of $57 million from settlement of certain of our Swaps, and incurred $332 million of deferred financing costs. Net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations includes the effects of acquisitions, net of cash acquired, purchases of investments, capital expenditures and additions to intangible assets, offset by proceeds from sales of investments. Net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was $1.272 billion for the year ended December 31, 2002. During 2002, acquisitions, net of cash acquired, amounted to $251 million, related primarily to our acquisition of Broadband. Capital expenditures were $1.975 billion and additions to intangible and other noncurrent assets were $221 million, including $65 million related to the satellite and cable television affiliation agreements of QVC and our content subsidiaries. Such amounts were offset, in part, by proceeds from sales and settlements of investments of $1.263 billion. Results of Operations The effects of the Broadband acquisition and our other recent acquisitions were to increase our revenues and expenses, resulting in increases in our operating income before depreciation and amortization. The increases in our property and equipment, intangible assets and long term debt, and the corresponding increases in depreciation expense and interest expense from 2001 to 2002 are primarily due to the effects of the Broadband acquisition, and the increases from 2000 to 2001 are primarily due to the effects of our acquisitions, our cable systems exchanges and our increased levels of capital expenditures. As the effect of the Broadband acquisition was to substantially increase the size of our cable operations, direct comparisons of our results of operations and financial condition for periods prior to November 18, 2002 to subsequent periods are not meaningful. Refer to "Pro Forma 2002 Results" below for our 2002 supplemental pro forma financial information prepared as if the Broadband acquisition occurred on January 1, 2002. Refer to Notes 5 and 12 to our financial statements included in Item 8 for a discussion of our acquisitions and cable systems exchanges, and of the effect of these 28 transactions on our balance sheet. We adopted SFAS No. 142 on January 1, 2002, as required by the new statement. See "Amortization" on page 32 for a discussion of the impact the adoption of the new statement had on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. Our summarized consolidated financial information for the three years ended December 31, 2002 is as follows (dollars in millions, "NM" denotes percentage is not meaningful): Year Ended December 31, Increase/(Decrease) 2002 2001 $ % Revenues........................................................ $12,460 $9,836 $2,624 26.7% Cost of goods sold from electronic retailing.................... 2,793 2,514 279 11.1 Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses......... 5,976 4,652 1,324 28.5 Depreciation.................................................... 1,775 1,211 564 46.6 Amortization.................................................... 257 2,205 (1,948) (88.3) Operating income (loss)......................................... 1,659 (746) 2,405 NM Interest expense................................................

EBITDA is a measure of a companys ability to generate cash to service its obligations, including debt service obligations, and to finance capital and other expenditures. In part due to the capital intensive nature of our businesses and the resulting significant level of non cash depreciation and amortization expense, EBITDA is frequently used as one of the bases for comparing businesses in our industries, although our measure of EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. EBITDA is the primary basis used by our management to measure the operating performance of our businesses. EBITDA does not purport to represent net income or net cash provided by operating activities, as those terms are defined under generally accepted accounting principles, and should not be considered as an alternative to such measurements as an indicator of our performance. See "Statement of Cash Flows" above for a discussion of net cash provided by operating activities. 29 Consolidated Operating Results Revenues The increases in consolidated revenues from 2001 to 2002 and from 2000 to 2001 are primarily attributable to increases in service revenues in our Cable segment and to increases in net sales in our Commerce segment (see "Operating Results by Business Segment" below). The remaining increases are primarily the result of increases in revenues from our content operations, principally due to growth in our historical operations and the effects of our acquisitions in 2001. On January 1, 2002, we adopted EITF 01 9, "Accounting for Consideration Given to a Customer (Including a Reseller of the Vendors Products)" and EITF 01 14, "Income Statement Characterization of Reimbursements Received for Out of Pocket Expenses Incurred." We have reclassified our statement of operations for all periods presented to reflect the adoption of EITF 01 9 and EITF 01 14. The changes in classification had no impact on our reported operating income (loss) or financial condition. Refer to Note 2 to our financial statements included in Item 8 for a discussion of EITF 01 9 and EITF 01 14. Cost of goods sold from electronic retailing Refer to the "Commerce" section of "Operating Results by Business Segment" below for a discussion of the increases in cost of goods sold from electronic retailing. Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses The increases in consolidated operating, selling, general and administrative expenses from 2001 to 2002 and from 2000 to 2001 are primarily attributable to increases in expenses in our Cable segment and, to a lesser extent, to increases in expenses in our Commerce segment (see "Operating Results by Business Segment" below). The remaining increases are primarily the result of increased expenses in our content operations, principally due to growth in our historical operations and the effects of our acquisitions in 2001. Depreciation The increases in depreciation expense from 2001 to 2002 and from 2000 to 2001 are primarily attributable to our Cable segment and are principally due to the effects of our recent acquisitions, our cable systems exchanges and our increased levels of capital expenditures. Depreciation expense in our Commerce segment was essentially unchanged. The remaining increases in depreciation expense from 2000 to 2001 are primarily the result of increases in depreciation in our content operations, principally due to the effects of our acquisitions and increased levels of capital expenditures. Amortization Of the $1.948 billion decrease in amortization expense from 2001 to 2002, $2.002 billion is attributable to the adoption of SFAS No. 142 on January 1, 2002. The remaining change is primarily the result of increases in amortization expense in our content operations, principally due to the effects of our acquisitions. The $423 million increase in amortization expense from 2000 to 2001 is primarily due to the effects of our acquisitions. Refer to Note 7 to our financial statements included in Item 8 for the pro forma impact of adoption of SFAS No. 142 on amortization expense. Operating Results by Business Segment The following represent the operating results of our significant business segments, "Cable" and "Commerce." The remaining components of our operations are not independently significant to our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. Refer to Note 14 to our financial statements included in Item 8 for a summary of our financial data by business segment. 30 Cable The following table presents financial information for our Cable segment (dollars in millions). The effect of the Broadband acquisition was to substantially increase the size of our cable operations, thereby increasing our revenues and expenses, resulting in increases in our operating income before depreciation and amortization. Accordingly, direct comparisons of our results of operations for periods prior to November 18, 2002 to subsequent periods are not meaningful. Refer to "Pro Forma 2002 Results" below for our 2002 supplemental pro forma financial information prepared as if the Broadband acquisition occurred on January 1, 2002.

Video revenue consists of our basic, expanded basic, premium, pay per view, equipment and digital cable services. Of the $1.238 billion and $627 million increases in video revenues from 2001 to 2002 and from 2000 to 2001, $945 million and $339 million, respectively, are attributable to the effects of our acquisitions of cable systems and $293 million and $288 million, respectively, relate to changes in rates and subscriber growth in our historical operations, driven principally by growth in digital subscribers, and to a lesser extent, to the effects of a higher priced digital service offering made in the second half of 2000. During 2002, we added approximately 4,374,000 digital subscribers as a result of the Broadband acquisition and we added approximately 505,000 digital subscribers through growth in our historical operations. During 2001 and 2000, through acquisitions and growth in our historical operations, we added approximately 534,000 and 753,000 digital subscribers, respectively. The increases in high speed Internet revenue from 2001 to 2002 and from 2000 to 2001 are primarily due to the addition of high speed Internet subscribers. During 2002, we added approximately 2,094,000 high speed Internet subscribers as a result of the Broadband acquisition and we added approximately 578,000 high speed Internet subscribers through growth in our historical operations. During 2001 and 2000, through acquisitions and growth in our historical operations, we added approximately 548,000 and 258,000 high speed Internet subscribers, respectively. The increase in advertising sales revenue from 2001 to 2002 is due to the effects of the Broadband acquisition, as well as to the effects of a stronger advertising market and the continued leveraging of our market wide fiber interconnects. The increase in advertising sales revenue from 2000 to 2001 was attributable to the effects of new advertising contracts, market wide fiber interconnects and 31 the continued leveraging of our existing fiber networks, helping to offset an otherwise weak advertising environment. Other revenue includes phone revenues, installation revenues, guide revenues, commissions from electronic retailing, revenues of our regional sports programming networks and revenue from other product offerings. The increase from 2001 to 2002 in other revenue is primarily attributable to increased phone revenues and other product revenues as a result of the Broadband acquisition. The increase from 2000 to 2001 in other revenue is primarily attributable to the effects of our acquisition of Home Team Sports (now known as CSN Mid Atlantic). The remaining increases from 2000 to 2001 and from 2001 to 2002 are attributable to growth in our historical operations. The increase in operating, selling, general and administrative expenses from 2001 to 2002 is primarily attributable to the effects of the Broadband acquisition, as well as to the effects of increases in the costs of cable programming, increases in labor costs and other volume related expenses in our historical operations, and, to a lesser extent, to the effects of high speed Internet subscriber growth. On September 28, 2001, At Home Corporation ("At Home"), our former provider of high speed Internet services, filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. In October 2001, we amended our agreement with At Home to continue service to our existing and new subscribers during October and November 2001. We agreed to be charged a higher rate than we had incurred under our previous agreement. On December 3, 2001, we reached a definitive agreement, approved by the Bankruptcy Court, with At Home pursuant to which At Home agreed to continue to provide high speed Internet services to our existing and new subscribers through February 28, 2002. In December 2001, we began to transfer our high speed Internet subscribers from the At Home network to our new Comcast owned and managed network. We completed this transition in February 2002. Operating expenses in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2001 include $140 million of net incremental expenses incurred in the fourth quarter of 2001 in the continuation of service to and transition of our high speed Internet subscribers from At Homes network to our network. The remaining increases from 2000 to 2001 in operating, selling, general and administrative expenses are primarily due to the effects of our acquisitions and exchanges of cable systems, as well as to the effects of increases in the costs of cable programming, high speed Internet subscriber growth, and, to a lesser extent, increases in labor costs and other volume related expenses in our historical operations. Our cost of programming increases as a result of changes in rates, subscriber growth, additional channel offerings and our acquisitions and exchanges of cable systems. We anticipate the cost of cable programming will increase in the future as cable programming rates increase and additional sources of cable programming become available. 32 Commerce The following table sets forth the operating results for our Commerce segment, which consists of QVC, Inc. and subsidiaries (dollars in millions): Year Ended December 31, Increase 2002 2001 $ % Net sales from electronic retailing........................... $4,381 $3,917 $464 11.8% Cost of goods sold from electronic retailing.................. 2,793 2,514 279 11.1 Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses....... 730 681 49 7.2 Operating income before depreciation and amortization (a)......................................... $858 $722 $136 18.7% Gross margin.................................................. 36.3% 35.8% Year Ended December 31, Increase 2001 2000 $ % Net sales from electronic retailing........................... $3,917 $3,536 $381 10.8% Cost of goods sold from electronic retailing.................. 2,514 2,285 229 10.0 Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses....... 681 632 49 7.8 Operating income before depreciation and amortization (a)......................................... $722 $619 $103 16.7% Gross margin.................................................. 35.8% 35.4% (a) See footnote (1) on page 29. Of the $464 million and $381 million increases in net sales from electronic retailing from 2001 to 2002 and from 2000 to 2001, $296 million and $332 million, respectively, is attributable to increases in net sales in the United States. This growth is principally the result of increases in the average number of homes receiving QVC services and in net sales per home as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2002 2001 Increase in average number of homes in U.S.................... 3.6% 3.8% Increase in net sales per home in U.S......................... 5.3% 6.5% It is unlikely that the number of homes receiving the QVC service domestically will continue to grow at rates comparable to prior periods given that the QVC service is already received by approximately 97% of all U.S. cable television homes and substantially all satellite television homes in the U.S. Future growth in sales will depend increasingly on continued additions of new customers from homes already receiving the QVC service and continued growth in repeat sales to existing customers. The remaining increases of $168 million and $49 million in net sales from electronic retailing from 2001 to 2002 and from 2000 to 2001 are primarily attributable to increases in net sales in Germany, Japan and the United Kingdom, offset, in part, by the effects of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates during the periods. The increases in cost of goods sold from 2001 to 2002 and from 2000 to 2001 are primarily related to the growth in net sales. The increases in gross margin are primarily due to the effects of increases in product margins. The increases in operating, selling, general and administrative expenses from 2001 to 2002 and from 2000 to 2001 are primarily attributable to higher variable costs and personnel costs associated with the increase in sales volume. 33 Consolidated Analysis Interest Expense The increase in interest expense from 2001 to 2002 is due to our increased amount of debt outstanding as a result of the Broadband acquisition. The increase in interest expense from 2000 to 2001 is primarily due to the increases in our net borrowings. We anticipate that, for the foreseeable future, interest expense will be significant. We believe we will continue to be able to meet our obligations through our ability both to generate operating income before depreciation and amortization and to obtain external financing. Investment Income (Expense) Investment income (expense) includes the following (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Interest and dividend income........................................... $63 $77 $171 (Losses) gains on sales and exchanges of investments, net.............. (48) 485 887 Investment impairment losses........................................... (247) (972) (74) Reclassification of unrealized gains................................... 1,330 Unrealized (loss) gain on trading securities........................... (1,569) 285 Mark to market adjustments on derivatives related to trading securities............................................. 1,340 (185) Mark to market adjustments on derivatives and hedged items............. (144) 42 Investment income (expense)....................................... ($605) $1,062 $984 The investment impairment losses for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 relate principally to an other than temporary decline in our investment in AT&T. During the year ended December 31, 2001, we wrote off our investment in At Home common stock based upon a decline in the investment that was considered other than temporary. In connection with the realization of this impairment loss, we reclassified to investment income (expense) the accumulated unrealized gain of $238 million on our investment in At Home common stock which was previously recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). We recorded this accumulated unrealized gain prior to our designation of our right under a stockholders agreement as a hedge of our investment in the At Home common stock. In June 2001, we and AT&T entered into an Amended and Restated Share Issuance Agreement (the "Share Issuance Agreement"). AT&T issued to us approximately 80.3 million unregistered shares of AT&T common stock and we agreed to settle our right under the Share Exchange Agreement to exchange an aggregate 31.2 million At Home shares and warrants held by us for shares of AT&T common stock. Under the terms of the Share Issuance Agreement, we retained the At Home shares and warrants held by us. We recorded to investment income (expense) a pre tax gain of $296 million, representing the fair value of the increased consideration received by us to settle our right under the Share Exchange Agreement. In connection with the reclassification of our investment in Sprint PCS from an available for sale security to a trading security in 2001, we reclassified to investment income (expense) the accumulated unrealized gain of $1.092 billion on our investment in Sprint PCS which was previously recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Income Related to Indexed Debt Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 133 on January 1, 2001, we accounted for the ZONES as an indexed debt instrument since the maturity value is dependent upon the fair value of Sprint PCS common stock. During the year ended December 31, 2000, we recorded income related to indexed debt of $666 million to reflect the fair value of the underlying Sprint PCS stock. Equity in Net Losses of Affiliates The increase in equity in net losses of affiliates from 2001 to 2002 is primarily due to other than temporary declines in certain of our equity method investees, the effects of our additional investments, changes in the net 34 income or loss of our equity method investees, as well as to the effects of the discontinuance of amortization of equity method goodwill as a result of the adoption of SFAS No. 142 on January 1, 2002. The increase from 2000 to 2001 is primarily attributable to the effects of our additional investments, as well as the effects of changes in the net income or loss of our equity method investees. Other Income On October 30, 2001, we acquired from Fox Entertainment Group, Inc. ("Fox Entertainment") the approximate 83.2% interest in Outdoor Life Network ("OLN") not previously owned by us. Upon closing of the acquisition, we exchanged our 14.5% interest in Speedvision Network ("SVN"), together with a previously made loan, for Fox Entertainments interest in OLN. In connection with the exchange of our interest in SVN, we recorded a pre tax gain of $107 million, representing the difference between the estimated fair value of our interest in SVN as of the closing date of the transaction and our cost basis in SVN. On January 1, 2001, we completed our cable systems exchange with Adelphia Communications Corporation ("Adelphia"). We received cable systems serving approximately 445,000 subscribers from Adelphia and Adelphia received certain of our cable systems serving approximately 441,000 subscribers. We recorded a pre tax gain of $1.199 billion, representing the difference between the estimated fair value of $1.799 billion as of the closing date of the transaction and our cost basis in the systems exchanged. On December 31, 2000, we completed our cable systems exchange with AT&T. We received cable systems serving approximately 770,000 subscribers from AT&T and AT&T received certain of our cable systems serving approximately 700,000 subscribers. We recorded a pre tax gain of $1.711 billion, representing the difference between the estimated fair value of $2.840 billion as of the closing date of the transaction and our cost basis in the systems exchanged. In August 2000, we obtained the right to exchange our At Home Series A Common Stock with AT&T and we waived certain of our At Home Board level and shareholder rights under a stockholders agreement. We also agreed to cause our existing appointee to the At Home Board of Directors to resign. In connection with the transaction, we recorded a pre tax gain of $1.045 billion, representing the estimated fair value of the investment as of the closing date. In August 2000, we exchanged all of the capital stock of a wholly owned subsidiary which held certain wireless licenses for approximately 3.2 million shares of AT&T common stock. In connection with the exchange, we recognized a pre tax gain of $98 million, representing the difference between the fair value of the AT&T shares received of $100 million and our cost basis in the subsidiary. Income Tax Expense The decreases in income tax expense from 2001 to 2002 and from 2000 to 2001 are primarily the result of the effects of changes in our income before taxes and minority interest, and non deductible goodwill amortization. Minority Interest The increase in minority interest from 2001 to 2002 is attributable to increases in the net income of our less than wholly owned consolidated subsidiaries, as well as to the minority interests in certain subsidiaries acquired in connection with the Broadband acquisition. The increase in minority interest from 2000 to 2001 is primarily attributable to the effects of changes in the net income or loss of our less than wholly owned consolidated subsidiaries. Cumulative Effect of Accounting Change Upon adoption of SFAS No. 133, we recognized as income a cumulative effect of accounting change, net of related income taxes, of $385 million during the year ended December 31, 2001. The income consisted of a $400 million adjustment to record the debt component of our ZONES at a discount from its value at maturity and $192 million principally related to the reclassification of gains previously recognized as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on our equity derivative instruments, net of related deferred income taxes of $207 million. We believe that our operations are not materially affected by inflation. 35 Pro Forma 2002 Results As described above, the Broadband acquisition substantially increased the size of our cable operations. As a result, direct comparisons of our results of operations from the periods prior to November 18, 2002 to subsequent periods are not meaningful. The following tables reconcile our 2002 consolidated and Cable segment reported financial information to pro forma amounts and present our 2002 pro forma financial information on a quarterly basis as if the Broadband acquisition occurred on January 1, 2002. This information has been prepared in accordance with SEC rules and guidance and is based on our and Broadbands historical results of operations. In the opinion of management, this information is not indicative of what our results would have been had we operated Broadband since January 1, 2002, nor of our future results. The financial information for Broadband represents Broadbands results for the period from January 1, 2002 through November 18, 2002. The consolidated pro forma results reflect the elimination of all significant transactions between Broadband and Comcasts commerce and content businesses during 2002. This pro forma financial information is presented as supplemental information to assist users of this Annual Report in analyzing the impact the Broadband acquisition may have on our future results of operations (dollars in millions).
