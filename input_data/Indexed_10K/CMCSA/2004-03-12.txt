ITEM 7 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview Comcast is principally involved in the management and operation of cable communications networks and in the management of programming content over cable and satellite television networks. In 2003, we received over 95% of our revenue from our cable operations, primarily through monthly subscriptions to our video, high speed Internet and phone services, and advertising. Subscribers typically pay us monthly, based on rates and related charges that vary according to their chosen level of service and the type of equipment they use. Revenue from our national television networks is derived from the sale of advertising time and affiliation agreements with cable and satellite television companies. Highlights for the year 2003 included the following: Integration of Broadband acquisition We improved the profitability of the Broadband systems, increasing revenues and operating margins. We increased the number of basic subscribers in the Broadband systems, reversing their three year trend of losses prior to our acquisition. We accelerated our upgrade program. By the end of 2003, 93% of our acquired systems have been upgraded to provide two way digital cable and high speed Internet service. Continued growth in our new services such as digital cable and high speed Internet. Digital cable grew 15.6% to 7.7 million subscribers while high speed Internet grew 45.9% to 5.3 million subscribers. We reduced our total debt outstanding by $7.9 billion primarily with proceeds received from the sale of QVC and related Liberty Notes, the TWE restructuring and other transactions. The following provides the details of these highlights and insights into our companys financial statements, including critical accounting judgments and estimates used in preparing the financial statements, our liquidity and capital resources, and a discussion of our results of operations. Business Developments We have grown significantly in recent years through both strategic acquisitions and growth in our existing businesses. On November 18, 2002, we completed the acquisition of AT&T Corp.s broadband business, which we refer to as Broadband. The Broadband acquisition substantially increased the size of our cable operations and caused significant changes in our capital structure, including a substantially higher amount of debt. As a result, direct comparisons of our results of operations for periods prior to November 18, 2002 to subsequent periods are not meaningful. See Results of Continuing Operations for a discussion of the effects of the Broadband acquisition on our results of operations. On September 17, 2003 we completed the sale to Liberty Media Corporation of our approximate 57% interest in QVC, Inc. for approximately $7.7 billion. We received from Liberty $4.0 billion of three year senior unsecured floating rate notes, approximately 218 million shares of Liberty Series A common stock valued at $2.339 billion and cash of $1.35 billion. QVC has been presented as a discontinued operation in our financial statements. Refer to Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 for more information on the sale of QVC. Refer to General Developments of Our Business in Part I and Note 5 to our financial statements included in Item 8 for a discussion of our acquisitions and other significant events. Critical Accounting Judgments and Estimates We believe our judgments and related estimates associated with the impairment testing and valuation of our cable franchise rights, and the valuation of acquisition related assets, liabilities and legal contingencies, to be critical in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting judgments and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors and the Audit Committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to them presented below. Impairment Testing and Valuation of Cable Franchise Rights Our cable systems are constructed and operated under non exclusive franchises granted by state or local governmental authorities for varying lengths of time. As of December 31, 2003, we served approximately 4,400 franchise areas in the United States. We have concluded that our cable franchise rights have an indefinite useful life since there are no legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other factors limiting the period over which these rights will contribute to our cash flows. Accordingly, our cable franchise rights are not subject to amortization but are assessed periodically for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. 19 We have acquired these franchise rights either directly from local franchise authorities or through many separate cable system acquisitions that include multiple franchise territories. Upon acquisition, we integrate the individual franchise territories into our national footprint, typically by incorporating the management of those territories into our existing geographic regions. We control the sourcing of content, pricing, marketing and branding, and capital deployment throughout the company, as if our cable franchise rights were a single asset. Therefore, we have concluded the franchise rights are operated as a single asset within our cable segment. From time to time, however, the franchise rights are separated and sold in units below the cable segment level. We have concluded that Emerging Issues Task Force 02 07, Unit of Accounting for Testing Impairment of Indefinite Lived Intangible Assets, supports the testing of our cable franchise rights for impairment at a level no higher than where the assets both are operated together and are essentially inseparable. During 2002 and 2003, we tested our cable franchise rights for impairment at the cable segment level. Effective in the first quarter of 2004, we will change the unit of accounting used for testing impairment to geographic regions and will perform impairment testing on our cable franchise rights. We do not anticipate recording any impairment charge in connection with the impairment testing. We assess the recoverability of our cable franchise rights annually or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. We estimate the fair value of our cable franchise rights primarily based on multiples of operating income before depreciation and amortization generated by the underlying assets, discounted cash flow analyses, analyses of current market transactions, and profitability information, including estimated future operating results, trends or other determinants of fair value. If the value of our cable franchise rights determined by these evaluations is less than its carrying amount, an impairment charge would be recognized for the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of the assets. Future adverse changes in market conditions or in the operating results of the related business may indicate an inability to recover the carrying value of the assets, thereby possibly requiring a future impairment charge. The carrying amount of cable franchise rights related to some of our historical cable systems is significantly less than their current estimated fair value largely because we acquired many of these rights directly from local franchise authorities rather than through separate cable system acquisitions. Conversely, the carrying amount of cable franchise rights for our more recent cable system acquisitions has not been significantly reduced through amortization (and has not been reduced at all for acquisitions made subsequent to the adoption of SFAS No. 142). Nevertheless, testing for impairment at a level higher than the individual franchise agreement or cable system level reduces the likelihood of a future impairment charge related to our cable franchise rights. As more fully described in Note 5 to our financial statements included in Item 8 (see Acquisition of Broadband), the fair value of the shares issued for Broadband was based on the date the non equity, or other, consideration being paid was substantively changed from the terms of the original merger agreement. The fair value of the shares issued for Broadband based on the new measurement date was approximately one half the fair value of the shares as of the date of the original merger agreement. Accordingly, the effect of the modification was to reduce by approximately one half (approximately $23 billion) the value assigned to the equity consideration issued in connection with the Broadband acquisition. The reduction in the fair value of the equity consideration reduces the likelihood of a future impairment charge related to our goodwill. Fair Value of Acquisition Related Assets, Liabilities and Legal Contingencies We allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. In determining fair value, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the recorded amounts. To assist in this process, third party valuation specialists are engaged to value certain of these assets and liabilities. Estimates used in valuing acquired assets and liabilities include but are not limited to: expected future cash flows, market rate assumptions for contractual obligations, actuarial assumptions for benefit plans, settlement plans for litigation and contingencies, and appropriate discount rates. Our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but that are inherently uncertain. In addition, estimated liabilities to exit activities of the acquired operations, including the exiting of contractual obligations and the termination of employees, are subject to change as we complete the implementation of the plan. The assets and assumed liabilities related to the Broadband acquisition that required significant judgment in estimating fair value included investments, cable franchise rights, franchise related customer relationships, assumed contractual and other obligations, and costs related to terminating certain of Broadbands contractual obligations and employees. In addition, we are party to certain legal contingencies, including those described in Item 3, Legal Proceedings. If, based on information available, a potential loss arising from the lawsuits, claims and actions involving AT&T or Broadband was deemed 20 probable and reasonably estimable or the fair value of the contingency could be determined, we recorded the liability in the purchase price allocation. For certain other cases, we are awaiting additional information to determine if a liability should be recorded. In addition, the inherent limitations in the estimation process may cause future actual losses to exceed expected losses. Significant and Subjective Estimates The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and contingent liabilities (such as income taxes and litigation). We base our judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making estimates about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Refer to Note 2 to our financial statements included in Item 8 for a discussion of our accounting policies with respect to these and other items. Liquidity and Capital Resources During 2003, we significantly strengthened our balance sheet and increased our liquidity through the repayment and refinancing of debt, and through the sales or restructurings of certain of our investments, which are more fully described below (see Financing on page 23). Anticipated Sources of Liquidity We believe that we will be able to meet our current and long term liquidity and capital requirements, including fixed charges, through our cash flows from operating activities, existing cash, cash equivalents and investments, through available borrowings under our existing credit facilities, and through our ability to obtain future external financing. Cash and Cash Equivalents We have traditionally maintained significant levels of cash and cash equivalents to meet our short term liquidity requirements. As of December 31, 2003, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.55 billion, substantially all of which is unrestricted. Investments Investments that we determine to be non strategic, highly valued or both, are considered by us to be a source of liquidity. As of December 31, 2003, we consider our investments in the following to be potential sources of liquidity: $1.5 billion in Time Warner Inc. common equivalent preferred stock, $1.4 billion in Liberty common stock, 21% interest in Time Warner Cable Inc., and interests in certain cable television partnerships. We do not have any significant contractual funding commitments with respect to any of our investments. Refer to Note 6 to our financial statements included in Item 8 for a discussion of our investments. Available Borrowings Under Credit Facilities We have traditionally maintained significant availability under our lines of credit to meet our short term liquidity requirements. As of December 31, 2003, amounts available under our lines of credit totaled $5.876 billion. On January 8, 2004, we refinanced three of our existing revolving credit facilities with a new $4.5 billion, five year revolving bank credit facility due January 2009. As of January 8, 2004, remaining amounts available under our lines of credit totaled $4.381 billion (see Debt Covenants on page 24). Anticipated Uses of Cash Capital Expenditures Our most significant recurring investing activity has been and is expected to continue to be capital expenditures. During 2004, however, we expect cable capital expenditures to decline compared to 2003 as we complete the upgrade of our cable systems. We expect to incur approximately $3.4 billion of capital expenditures in our cable and content businesses, substantially all of which will be in our cable business. As of December 31, 2003, we do not have any significant contractual obligations for capital expenditures. The amount of our capital expenditures for 2004 and for subsequent years will depend on numerous factors, some of which are beyond our control, including: competition, changes in technology, and the timing and rate of deployment of new services. 21 The following table illustrates the capital expenditures we incurred in our cable business during 2003 and expect to incur in 2004 (in millions): 2003 2004 Upgrading of certain cable systems $1,414 $760 Deployment of cable modems, digital converters, and new service offerings 1,923 1,880 Recurring capital projects 760 710 Total capital expenditures $4,097 $3,350 Interest During 2003, we made cash payments for interest totaling $2.053 billion. We anticipate that, for the foreseeable future, our cash paid interest will decline modestly as average debt balances decline, but will remain significant. Income Taxes During 2003, we made cash payments for income taxes totaling $945 million, primarily as a result of our sale of QVC and certain of our other investments. We anticipate that our cash paid for income taxes will be significantly reduced in 2004. Stock Repurchases In December 2003, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1 billion of our outstanding common equity securities. We expect such repurchases to occur from time to time, in the open market or in private transactions, subject to market conditions. Affiliation Agreements Certain of our content subsidiaries enter into multi year affiliation agreements with various cable and satellite television system operators for carriage of their respective programming. In connection with these affiliation agreements, we generally pay a launch fee to the cable or satellite television operator based upon the number of subscribers. During 2004, we expect to incur fees of no more than $150 million related to these affiliation agreements, excluding amounts applicable to our cable systems. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any significant off balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. Contractual Obligations Our unconditional contractual obligations as of December 31, 2003, which consist primarily of our debt obligations, and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods, are summarized in the table below. Refer to Note 8 to our financial statements included in Item 8 for a discussion of our long term debt. Refer to Note 13 to our financial statements included in Item 8 for a discussion of our operating lease and purchase obligations. Refer to Note 5 to our financial statements included in Item 8 for a discussion of our acquisition related obligations. 22 Contractual Obligations Payments Due by Period Total Year 1 Years2 3 Years4 5 More than5 years (dollars in millions) Debt obligations, excluding Exchangeable Notes $22,451 $684 $3,500 $2,389 $15,878 Exchangeable Notes 4,318 2,427 1,839 52 Capital lease obligations 227 50 89 78 10 Operating lease obligations 979 200 281 200 298 Purchase obligations (1) 9,177 2,138 2,293 1,816 2,930 Other long term liabilities reflected on the balance sheet Acquisition related obligations (2) 897 372 195 102 228 Other long term obligations (3) 3,642 247 279 121 2,995 Total $41,691 $6,118 $8,476 $4,758 $22,339 (1) Purchase obligations consist of agreements to purchase goods and services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, price provisions and timing of the transaction. Our purchase obligations include payments under the employment agreements that we, through Comcast Spectacor, have with both players and coaches of our professional sports teams that are guaranteed regardless of employee injury or termination. Certain of these agreements may be covered by disability insurance if certain conditions are met. Also included are payments under license agreements that our programming networks have entered into for programs and sporting events that will be available for telecast subsequent to December 31, 2003. Also included are the minimum guaranteed payments under programming contracts that our cable segment enters into for the purchase of programming from cable network providers. We have also included commitments to purchase cable related equipment. We did not include contracts with immaterial future commitments. (2) Acquisition related obligations consist primarily of costs related to terminating employees, costs relating to exiting contractual obligations, and other assumed contractual obligations of the acquired entity. (3) Other long term obligations consist principally of our prepaid forward transactions on equity securities we hold, subsidiary preferred shares, deferred compensation obligations, pension, post retirement and post employment benefit obligations, and program rights payable under license agreements. Financing As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, our debt, including capital lease obligations, was $26.996 billion and $34.909 billion, respectively. The $7.913 billion decrease from December 31, 2002 to December 31, 2003 results from our net debt repayments and non cash financing transactions during 2003. Included in our debt as of December 31, 2003 and 2002 was short term debt and current portion of long term debt of $3.161 billion and $6.953 billion, respectively. We have, and may from time to time in the future, depending on certain factors including market conditions, make optional repayments on our debt obligations, which may include open market repurchases of our outstanding public notes and debentures. Refer to Notes 8 and 10 to our financial statements included in Item 8 for a discussion of our financing activities. The following table illustrates the sources of cash received from our significant investing and financing activities during 2003. The majority of these proceeds were used to repay or refinance a portion of our outstanding debt and other obligations. 23 Date Amount Source January 2003March 2003May 2003 $4.0 billion Sale of public debt March 2003 $.53 billion Transfer of cable systems to Bresnan Broadband Holdings, LLC and Bresnan Communications, LLC March 2003 $2.1 billion Closing of the TWE restructuring June 2003 $.73 billion Sale of interest in CC VIII, LLC, a cable joint venture with Charter Communications, Inc. September 2003December 2003 $5.35 billion Sale of QVC and sale of Liberty Notes received in connection with the sale of QVC December 2003 $.89 billion Monetization of a portion of Liberty shares received in connection with the sale of QVC The Cross Guarantee Structure To simplify our capital structure, we and a number of our wholly owned subsidiaries that hold substantially all of our cable communications assets have unconditionally guaranteed each others debt securities and indebtedness for borrowed money, including amounts outstanding under the new credit facilities. As of December 31, 2003, $20.866 billion of our debt was included in the cross guarantee structure. Comcast Holdings is not a guarantor and none of its debt is guaranteed under the cross guarantee structure. As of December 31, 2003, $1.024 billion of our debt was outstanding at Comcast Holdings. Debt Covenants We and our cable subsidiaries that have provided guarantees are subject to the covenants and restrictions set forth in the indentures governing our public debt securities and in the credit agreement governing our bank credit facilities. We and the guarantors are in compliance with the covenants and we believe that neither the covenants nor the restrictions in our indentures or loan documents will limit our ability to operate our business or raise additional capital. The two financial covenants in our bank credit facility are tested on an ongoing basis and measure our leverage and interest coverage. We have significant headroom under these financial covenants. The entire amount of our new $4.5 billion bank credit facility is currently available for our use, and future compliance with our financial covenants is not dependent on further debt reduction or on improved operating results. Exchangeable Notes We have outstanding notes exchangeable into the common stock of Cablevision NY Group (Cablevision) Class A common stock, Microsoft Corporation (Microsoft) common stock, Vodafone ADRs and Comcast Class A Special common stock (together, the Exchangeable Notes). At maturity the Exchangeable Notes are mandatorily redeemable at our option into (i) a number of shares of common stock or ADRs equal to the underlying shares multiplied by an exchange ratio (as defined), or (ii) its cash equivalent. The maturity value of the Exchangeable Notes varies based upon the fair market value of the security to which it is indexed. The Exchangeable Notes are collateralized by our investments in Cablevision, Microsoft and Vodafone, respectively. The Comcast exchangeable notes are collateralized by our Class A Special common stock held in treasury. We have and intend in the future to settle the Comcast exchangeable notes using cash. During 2003, we settled $1.851 billion of our obligations relating to certain of our Exchangeable Notes by delivering the underlying shares of common stock or cash to the counterparty upon maturity of the instruments, and the equity collar agreements related to the underlying shares expired or were settled. As of December 31, 2003, our debt includes an aggregate of $4.318 billion of Exchangeable Notes, including $2.427 billion and $1.891 billion within current portion of long term debt and long term debt, respectively. As of December 31, 2003, the securities held by us collateralizing the Exchangeable Notes were 24 sufficient to satisfy the debt obligations associated with the outstanding Exchangeable Notes. Interest Rate Risk Management We are exposed to the market risk of adverse changes in interest rates. We maintain a mix of fixed and variable rate debt and enter into various derivative transactions pursuant to our policies to manage the volatility relating to these exposures. We monitor our interest rate risk exposures using techniques including market value and sensitivity analyses. We do not hold or issue any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to leveraged instruments. We manage the credit risks associated with our derivative financial instruments through the evaluation and monitoring of the creditworthiness of the counterparties. Although we may be exposed to losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties, we do not expect such losses, if any, to be significant. We use the following derivative financial instruments to manage the market risk of adverse changes in interest rates: Interest rate exchange agreements ("Swaps") to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and variable interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed upon notional principal amount; Interest rate lock agreements ("Rate Locks") to hedge the risk that cash flows related to the interest payments on an anticipated issuance or assumption of fixed rate debt may be adversely affected by interest rate fluctuations; Interest rate cap agreements ("Caps") to lock in a maximum interest rate should variable rates rise, but enable us to otherwise pay lower market rates; and Interest rate collar agreements ("Collars") to limit our exposure to and benefits from interest rate fluctuations on variable rate debt to within a certain range of rates. While Swaps, Rate Locks, Caps and Collars represent an integral part of our interest rate risk management program, their effect on interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 was not significant. However, Swaps, Rate Locks, Caps and Collars may have a significant effect on our interest expense in the future. The table set forth below summarizes the fair values and contract terms of financial instruments subject to interest rate risk maintained by us as of December 31, 2003 (dollars in millions): 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 Thereafter Total FairValue at12/31/03 Debt Fixed Rate $1,930 $2,762 $1,725 $974 $1,493 $15,887 $24,771 $27,993 Average Interest Rate 6.8% 7.2% 7.3% 8.4% 7.2% 7.7% 7.6% Variable Rate $1,231 $941 $52 $1 $2,225 $2,225 Average Interest Rate 2.2% 3.4% 5.9% 7.4% 2.8% Interest Rate Instruments Variable to Fixed Swaps (notional amounts) $715 $488 $1,203 $25 Average Pay Rate 7.6% 7.6% 7.6% Average Receive Rate 2.2% 3.4% 2.7% Fixed to Variable Swaps (notional amounts) $200 $600 $1,650 $2,450 $15 Average Pay Rate 6.1% 7.0% 6.4% 6.5% Average Receive Rate 6.4% 6.2% 6.8% 6.6% The notional amounts of interest rate instruments, as presented in the table above, are used to measure interest to be paid or received and do not represent the amount of exposure to credit loss. The estimated fair value approximates the proceeds to settle the outstanding contracts. We estimate interest rates on variable debt using the average implied forward London Interbank Offer Rate (LIBOR) rates for the year of maturity based 25 on the yield curve in effect at December 31, 2003, plus the borrowing margin in effect for each credit facility at December 31, 2003. We estimate the floating rates on our Swaps using the average implied forward LIBOR rates for the year of maturity based on the yield curve in effect at December 31, 2003. Excluding the effects of interest rate risk management instruments, 8.2% of our total debt as of December 31, 2003 was at variable rates, compared to 31.8% at December 31, 2002. The decrease from December 31, 2002 in the percentage of our variable rate debt was due to the repayment of substantially all of our variable rate bank debt during 2003. As a matter of practice, we typically do not structure our financial contracts to include credit ratings based triggers that could affect our liquidity. In the ordinary course of business, certain of our Swaps could be subject to termination provisions if we do not maintain investment grade credit ratings. As of December 31, 2003, the fair value of the liability related to those Swaps was approximately $19 million. The amount due upon termination, if any, would be based upon the fair value of those outstanding contracts at that time. Equity Price Risk Management We are exposed to the market risk of changes in the equity prices of certain of our investments accounted for as trading securities. We enter into various derivative transactions pursuant to our policies to manage the volatility relating to these exposures. We monitor our equity price risk exposures to ensure that the instruments are matched with the underlying assets or liabilities, reduce our risks relating to equity prices, and through market value and sensitivity analyses, maintain a high correlation to the risk inherent in the hedged item. We use the following derivative financial instruments, which we account for at fair value, to limit our exposure to and benefits from price fluctuations in the common stock of certain of our investments accounted for as trading securities: Cashless collar agreements ("Equity Collars"); Prepaid forward sales agreements ("Prepaid Forward Sales"); Indexed debt instruments ("Exchangeable Notes"). Except as described in Results of Continuing Operations Investment Income (Loss), Net on page 31, the changes in the fair value of our investments accounted for as trading securities were substantially offset by the changes in the fair values of the Equity Collars and the derivative components of the Exchangeable Notes and the Prepaid Forward Sales. Refer to Note 2 to our financial statements included in Item 8 for a discussion of our accounting policies with respect to derivative financial instruments and to Notes 6 and 8 to our financial statements included in Item 8 for discussions of our derivative financial instruments. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) The components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) primarily are unrealized losses on our Rate Locks, offset by unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities. Changes to these components account for the change in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) from December 31, 2002 to December 31, 2003. Refer to Notes 6 and 8 to our financial statements included in Item 8 for more information about these components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Statement of Cash Flows Cash and cash equivalents increased $1.045 billion as of December 31, 2003 from December 31, 2002. The increase in cash and cash equivalents resulted from cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities as explained below. Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations amounted to $2.854 billion for the year ended December 31, 2003, due principally to our operating income before depreciation and amortization (see Results of Continuing Operations), the effects of interest and income tax payments, and changes in operating assets and liabilities as a result of the timing of receipts and disbursements. Net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations consists primarily of borrowings and repayments of debt. Net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations was $7.048 billion for the year ended December 31, 2003. During 2003, we borrowed $9.398 billion, consisting principally of: $3.988 billion of senior notes, $3.707 billion under revolving credit facilities, and $1.650 billion under a term loan due 2006. During 2003, we repaid $16.465 billion of our debt, consisting principally of: $4.830 billion of our term loans, 26 $4.496 billion on certain of our revolving credit facilities, $3.750 billion of short term debt, $1.959 billion of our senior and medium term notes, $517 million of Trust Preferred Securities, and $498 million of exchangeable debt. Net cash provided by investing activities from continuing operations was $5.239 billion for the year ended December 31, 2003. During 2003, proceeds from investing activities include sales, settlements and restructuring of investments as listed in the table under Financing on page 24, offset, in part, by capital expenditures of $4.161 billion. Results of Continuing Operations Revenues Consolidated revenues for the years 2003 and 2002 increased $10.2 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively, from the previous year. Of these increases, $10.1 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively, relate to our cable segment, which is discussed separately below. The remaining increases are primarily the result of our content businesses, which achieved combined revenue growth of 15.4% and 26.5%, during the years 2003 and 2002, respectively. Such increases in the content businesses were primarily the result of increases in distribution revenues, increases in advertising revenues and the effects of our 2001 acquisitions. Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses Consolidated operating, selling, general and administrative expenses for the years 2003 and 2002 increased $6.7 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively, from the previous year. Of these increases, $6.6 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively, relate to our cable segment, which is discussed separately below. The remaining increases are primarily the result of growth in our content businesses and increases in corporate overhead. Depreciation The increases in depreciation expense for the years 2003 and 2002 are primarily attributable to our cable segment. The increases in our cable segment are principally due to the effects of the Broadband acquisition, as well as our increased levels of capital expenditures. Amortization The increase in amortization expense for the year 2003 is primarily attributable to our cable segment. The increase in our cable segment is principally due to the effects of the Broadband acquisition. As a result of the Broadband acquisition, we recorded approximately $3.4 billion of franchise related customer relationship intangible assets, which we are amortizing over their average estimated useful life of approximately four years. The decrease in amortization expense for the year 2002 is primarily attributable to our cable segment, principally due to the effects of the adoption of SFAS No. 142 on January 1, 2002 as we no longer amortize goodwill or franchise rights intangible assets. This decrease is partially offset by the effects of the Broadband acquisition. Cable Segment Operating Results The discussion of our cable segment historical operating results is presented as a comparison of the 2003, 2002 and 2001 periods, which only include the Broadband results subsequent to November 18, 2002. In order to provide additional information relating to our cable segment operating results, we also present a comparison of 2003 actual results to 2002 results on a pro forma basis. Management uses pro forma data to evaluate performance when significant acquisitions or dispositions occur. Historical data reflects results of acquired businesses only after the acquisition dates while pro forma data enhances comparability of financial information between periods by adjusting the data as if the acquisitions (or dispositions) occurred at the beginning of the prior year. Our pro forma data is only adjusted for the timing of acquisitions and does not include adjustments for costs related to integration activities, cost savings or synergies that have or may be achieved by the combined businesses. In the opinion of management, this information is not indicative of what our results would have been had we operated Broadband since January 1, 2002, nor of our future results (amounts in millions). 27 2003 to 2002 Pro Forma Comparisons Our 2003 cable operating results reflect revenue growth of 9.1% and operating income before depreciation and amortization growth of 42.1% compared to the pro forma 2002 year. The growth in revenue is primarily the result of growth in basic, digital cable and high speed Internet subscribers, and rate increases. The increase in high speed Internet subscribers reflects increased consumer demand for the faster and more reliable Internet service provided over our cable networks. The increase in our video subscribers was driven by an increase of approximately 117,000 subscribers in 2003 in the Broadband systems that reversed a loss of approximately 483,000 subscribers in 2002. The growth in digital cable subscribers reflects increased demand for additional programming choices and enhancements in digital service packages. Rate increases occurred in our traditional video service, as well as from the repricing and repackaging of the digital and premium channel products in the Broadband systems. The 2003 operating income before depreciation and amortization results reflect the significant operating trends and efficiencies achieved in integrating the Broadband operations. The integration of Broadband involved changing the organizational structure and refocusing priorities including: Focusing on selling video and high speed Internet services, and emphasizing profitability over subscriber growth in phone. Accelerating our upgrade of Broadband systems to deploy and market expanded services sooner. In 2003, we upgraded over 53,000 miles versus 27,500 miles in pro forma 2002. Renegotiating programming contracts or achieving synergies in existing programming contracts. The impact of these initiatives was to reduce the growth in our programming costs. Reducing redundant Broadband overhead functions. 2003 2002 Increase (Decrease) % Increase(Decrease) Video $12,096 $11,460 $636 5.5 % High speed Internet 2,255 1,486 769 51.7 Phone 801 818 (17 ) (2.2 ) Advertising sales 1,112 1,036 76 7.4 Other 619 667 (48 ) (7.2 ) Franchise fees 608 570 38 6.8 Revenues 17,491 16,037 1,454 9.1 Programming expenses 3,909 3,822 87 2.3 Other operating, selling, general and administrative expenses 7,232 7,746 (514 ) (6.6 ) Operating income before depreciation and amortization (a) $6,350 $4,469 $1,881 42.1 % Video subscribers 21,468.0 21,327.4 140.6 0.7 % High speed Internet subscribers 5,283.9 3,620.4 1,663.5 45.9 % Phone subscribers 1,266.9 1,438.4 (171.5 ) (11.9 %) Monthly average revenue per video subscriber $47.15 $44.54 $2.61 5.9 % Monthly average revenue per high speed Internet subscriber $42.44 $41.81 $0.63 1.5 % Monthly average revenue per phone subscriber $48.90 $54.35 ($5.45 ) (10.0 %) (a) Operating income before depreciation and amortization is defined as operating income before depreciation and amortization, impairment charges, if any, related to fixed and intangible assets and gains or losses from the sale of assets, if any. As such, it eliminates the significant level of non cash depreciation and amortization expense that results from the capital intensive nature of our businesses and intangible assets recognized in business combinations, and is unaffected by our capital structure or investment activities. Our management and Board of Directors use this measure in evaluating our consolidated operating performance and the operating performance of all of our operating segments. This metric is used to allocate resources and capital to our operating segments and is a significant component of our annual incentive compensation programs. We believe that this measure is also useful to investors as it is one of the bases for comparing our operating performance with other companies in our industries, although our measure may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other companies. Because we use operating 28 income before depreciation and amortization as the measure of our segment profit or loss, we reconcile it to operating income, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), in the business segment footnote to our financial statements. This measure should not be considered as a substitute for operating income (loss), net income (loss), net cash provided by operating activities or other measures of performance or liquidity reported in accordance with GAAP. Revenues Video revenue consists of our basic, expanded basic, premium, pay per view, equipment and digital cable services. The increase in video revenue from 2002 to 2003 is primarily due to increases in monthly average revenue per video subscriber as a result of rate increases in our traditional video service, growth in digital subscribers, and repricing and repackaging of the digital and premium channel services in the Broadband systems. From December 31, 2002 to December 31, 2003, we added approximately 140,000 basic subscribers and over 1.0 million digital subscribers, or a 15.6% increase in digital subscribers. We expect continued growth in our video services revenue. The increase in high speed Internet revenue from 2002 to 2003 is primarily due to the addition in 2003 of approximately 1.7 million high speed Internet subscribers, or a 45.9% increase in high speed Internet subscribers, as well as to the effects of an increase in monthly average revenue per subscriber. We expect continued revenue growth as overall demand for our services continues to increase. The decrease in phone revenue from 2002 to 2003 is primarily as a result of our focus on operating efficiencies to drive profitability in the phone business, rather than focusing on subscriber growth. As a result, during 2003 our phone subscribers decreased by approximately 171,000 subscribers. The increase in advertising sales revenue from 2002 to 2003 is primarily due to the effects of growth in regional/national advertising as a result of the continuing success of our regional interconnects, offset by reduced growth in a soft local advertising market. Other revenue includes installation revenues, guide revenues, commissions from electronic retailing, revenue from our regional sports programming networks and reduced revenue from other product offerings. The increase in franchise fees collected from our cable subscribers from 2002 to 2003 is primarily attributable to the increase in our revenues upon which the fees apply. Expenses Total expenses decreased $427 million or 3.7% in 2003 from 2002, which is primarily the result of the effects of approximately $425 million of acquisition and employee termination related costs recorded by Broadband in 2002. Excluding the effects of these costs, total expenses were nearly level with the 2002 amounts. This is a result of cost efficiencies generated from the integration of Broadband. Programming costs represent our single largest operating expense and represent fees paid to license programming from cable and broadcast networks that we distribute, package and sell to our video subscribers. Programming expenses are impacted by changes in programming rates, the number of subscribers and programming channels. In 2003, programming costs increased 2.3% as compared to 2002. During 2003, we were able to negotiate reductions in programming rates, primarily in premium channels. We anticipate our programming costs will increase in the future primarily as a result of increased cost to produce and purchase programming and additional programming channels provided to our subscribers. These increases are mitigated, to some extent, by additional volume discounts associated with our increased size and future growth in subscribers receiving such programming channels. Other operating, selling and general and administrative expenses decreased from 2002 to 2003 primarily due to the effects of approximately $425 million of acquisition and employee termination related costs recorded by Broadband in 2002. Additionally, in 2003, customer service expenses slightly declined because we no longer outsource Broadbands customer service operations. We also reduced administrative and overhead expenses through reductions in headcount and the elimination of redundancies. Offsetting these decreases were increases in labor and other volume related operating expenses associated with the growth in our high speed Internet and digital cable services. 29 2003 to 2002 Historical Comparisons 2003 2002 Increase % Increase Video $12,096 $5,516 $6,580 119.3 % High speed Internet 2,255 715 1,540 215.4 Phone 801 127 674 530.7 Advertising sales 1,112 474 638 134.6 Other 620 275 345 125.5 Franchise fees 608 243 365 150.2 Revenues 17,492 7,350 10,142 138.0 Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses 11,142 4,552 6,590 144.8 Operating income before depreciation and amortization (a) $6,350 $2,798 $3,552 126.9 % (a) Refer to footnote (a) on page 28. Video revenue increased $6.580 billion from 2002 to 2003, of which $6.286 billion is attributable to the effects of the Broadband acquisition and $294 million relates to changes in rates and subscriber growth in our historical operations, driven principally by growth in our digital subscribers. During 2003, we added over 1.0 million digital subscribers. The increase in high speed Internet revenue from 2002 to 2003 is primarily due to the Broadband acquisition and growth in high speed Internet subscribers. During 2003, we added approximately 1.7 million high speed Internet subscribers. The increase in phone, advertising sales and other revenue is principally attributable to the effects of the Broadband acquisition. Our historical operations prior to the Broadband acquisition did not contain significant phone revenue. The increase in franchise fees collected from our cable subscribers from 2002 to 2003 is primarily attributable to the increase in our revenues upon which the fees apply. The increase in operating, selling, general and administrative expenses from 2002 to 2003 is primarily attributable to the effects of the Broadband acquisition, as well as to the effects of an increase in the costs of cable programming, an increase in labor costs and other volume related expenses in our historical operations, and, to a lesser extent, to the effect of high speed Internet subscriber growth. 2002 to 2001 Historical Comparisons 2002 2001 Increase % Increase Video $5,516 $4,278 $1,238 28.9 % High speed Internet 715 294 421 143.2 Advertising sales 474 326 148 45.4 Other 402 232 170 73.3 Franchise fees 243 193 50 25.9 Revenues 7,350 5,323 2,027 38.1 Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses 4,552 3,269 1,283 39.2 Operating income before depreciation and amortization (a) $2,798 $2,054 $744 36.2 % (a) Refer to footnote (a) on page 28. 30 Video revenues increased $1.238 billion from 2001 to 2002, of which $945 million is attributable to the effects of our acquisitions of cable systems and $293 million relates to changes in rates and subscriber growth in our historical operations, driven principally by growth in digital subscribers. During 2002, we added approximately 4.4 million digital subscribers as a result of the Broadband acquisition and we added approximately 0.5 million digital subscribers through growth in our historical operations. The increase in high speed Internet revenue from 2001 to 2002 is primarily due to the addition of high speed Internet subscribers. During 2002, we added approximately 2.1 million high speed Internet subscribers as a result of the Broadband acquisition and we added approximately 0.6 million high speed Internet subscribers through growth in our historical operations. The increase in advertising sales revenue from 2001 to 2002 is due to the effects of the Broadband acquisition, as well as to the effects of a stronger advertising market and the continued success of our regional interconnects. The increase from 2001 to 2002 in other revenue is primarily attributable to other product revenues, including phone revenue, as a result of the Broadband acquisition. The remaining increase from 2001 to 2002 is attributable to growth in our historical operations. The increase in franchise fees collected from our cable subscribers from 2001 to 2002 is primarily attributable to the increases in our revenues upon which the fees apply. The increase in operating, selling, general and administrative expense from 2001 to 2002 is primarily attributable to the effects of the Broadband acquisition, as well as to the effect of an increase in the costs of cable programming, an increase in labor costs and other volume related expenses in our historical operations, and, to a lesser extent, to the effect of high speed Internet subscriber growth. On September 28, 2001, At Home Corporation (At Home), our former provider of high speed Internet services, filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. In October 2001, we amended our agreement with At Home to continue service to our existing and new subscribers during October and November 2001. We agreed to be charged a higher rate than we had incurred under our previous agreement. On December 3, 2001, we reached a definitive agreement, approved by the Bankruptcy Court, with At Home pursuant to which At Home agreed to continue to provide high speed Internet services to our existing and new subscribers through February 28, 2002. In December 2001, we began to transfer our high speed Internet subscribers from the At Home network to our new Comcast owned and managed network. We completed this transition in February 2002. Operating expenses in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2001 include $140 million of net incremental expenses incurred in the fourth quarter of 2001 in the continuation of service to and transition of our high speed Internet subscribers from At Homes network to our network. Consolidated Other Income (Expense) Items Interest Expense The increases in interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 from the previous year are due to our increased amount of debt outstanding as a result of the Broadband acquisition. Investment Income (Loss), Net Investment income (loss), net for the years ended December, 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 includes the following (in millions): 2003 2002 2001 Interest and dividend income $166 $53 $59 Gains (losses) on sales and exchanges of investments, net 28 (48 ) 485 Investment impairment losses (72 ) (247 ) (972 ) Reclassifications of unrealized gains 1,330 Unrealized gains (losses) on trading securities 965 (1,569 ) 285 Mark to market adjustments on derivatives related to trading securities (818 ) 1,284 (227 ) Mark to market adjustments on derivatives and hedged items (353 ) (16 ) 26 Investment income (loss), net ($84 ) ($543 ) $986 31 We have entered into derivative financial instruments that we account for at fair value and which economically hedge the market price fluctuations in the common stock of certain of our investments accounted for as trading securities. Investment income (loss), net includes the fair value adjustments related to our trading securities and derivative financial instruments. The change in the fair value of our investments accounted for as trading securities, with the exception in 2003 of the unrealized gain on 118 million shares of our Liberty common shares discussed below, was substantially offset by the changes in the fair value of the related derivatives. Beginning in 2003, we are exposed to changes in the fair value of 118 million shares of Liberty common stock we hold and account for as a trading security as we have not entered into a corresponding derivative to hedge this market exposure. We are also exposed to changes in the fair value of the derivative component of the Comcast exchangeable notes we have outstanding since the underlying 30.9 million shares of Comcast Class A Special common stock we hold in treasury are carried at our historical cost and are not adjusted for changes in fair value. Accordingly, our future results of operations may be affected by fluctuations in the fair value of both the Liberty common stock and the derivative component of the Comcast exchangeable notes in future periods. Gains (losses) on sales and exchanges of investments, net in 2001 relates principally to our investment in At Home. The investment impairment losses relate principally to other than temporary declines in our investment in AT&T. In connection with the reclassification of our investment in Sprint PCS from an available for sale security to a trading security upon the adoption of SFAS No. 133 on January 1, 2001, we reclassified to investment income (loss), net the accumulated unrealized gain of $1.092 billion on our investment in Sprint PCS that was previously recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Equity in Net Losses of Affiliates Equity in net losses of affiliates for 2003 results principally from the full year impact of losses of investees we acquired in the Broadband acquisition. The increase in equity in net losses of affiliates from 2001 to 2002 is primarily due to an other than temporary decline in certain of our equity method investees, the effects of our additional investments, a change in the net income or loss of our equity method investees, as well as to the effects of the discontinuance of amortization of equity method goodwill as a result of the adoption of SFAS No. 142 on January 1, 2002. Other Income The increase in other income from 2002 to 2003 is primarily attributable to lease rental income related to certain assets acquired in the Broadband acquisition. On October 30, 2001, we acquired from Fox Entertainment Group, Inc. (Fox Entertainment) the approximate 83.2% interest in Outdoor Life Network (OLN) not previously owned by us. Upon closing of the acquisition, we exchanged our 14.5% interest in Speedvision Network (SVN), together with a previously made loan, for Fox Entertainments interest in OLN. In connection with the exchange of our interest in SVN, we recorded a pre tax gain of $107 million, representing the difference between the estimated fair value of our interest in SVN as of the closing date of the transaction and our cost basis in SVN. On January 1, 2001, we completed our cable systems exchange with Adelphia Communications Corporation (Adelphia). We received cable systems serving approximately 445,000 subscribers from Adelphia and Adelphia received certain of our cable systems serving approximately 441,000 subscribers. We recorded a pre tax gain of $1.199 billion, representing the difference between the estimated fair value of $1.799 billion as of the closing date of the transaction and our cost basis in the systems exchanged. Income Tax Benefit (Expense) The changes in income tax benefit (expense) are primarily the result of the effects of changes in our income before taxes and minority interest, and non deductible goodwill amortization in 2001. Minority Interest The increases in minority interest are attributable to increases in the net income of our less than wholly owned consolidated subsidiaries, as well as, in 2003, to dividends recorded to minority interest related to certain subsidiaries acquired in the Broadband acquisition prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity. 32 Discontinued operations Income from discontinued operations decreased from 2002 to 2003 primarily as a result of the 2003 period including QVCs results through August 31, while the 2002 period includes QVCs results for the full year. As a result of the sale of QVC, we recognized a $3.290 billion gain, net of approximately $2.865 billion of related income taxes. Income from discontinued operations decreased from 2001 to 2002 primarily as a result of an investment loss recognized by QVC during 2002. Cumulative Effect of Accounting Change Upon adoption of SFAS No. 133, we recognized as income a cumulative effect of accounting change, net of related income taxes, of $385 million during the year ended December 31, 2001. The income consisted of a $400 million adjustment to record the debt component of our 2.0% Exchangeable Subordinated Debentures due 2029 at a discount from its value at maturity and $192 million principally related to the reclassification of gains previously recognized as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on our equity derivative instruments, net of related deferred income taxes of $207 million. We believe that our operations are not materially affected by inflation.
