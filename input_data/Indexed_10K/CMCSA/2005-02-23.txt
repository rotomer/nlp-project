ITEM 7 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  OVERVIEW We are principally involved in the management and operation of broadband communications networks (our cable segment) and in the management of programming content that is distributed over national cable television networks (our content segment). In 2004, we received over 95% of our revenue from our cable segment, primarily through monthly subscriptions to our video, high speed Internet and phone services, as well as from advertising. Subscribers typically pay us monthly, based on rates and related charges that vary according to their chosen level of service and the type of equipment they use. Revenue from our content segment is derived from the sale of advertising time and affiliation agreements with cable and satellite television companies. We have several competitors in each aspect of our businesses, including satellite providers, DSL providers, telephone companies and broadcast networks. Highlights for the year 2004 include the following: Revenue growth of 10.4% in our cable segment compared to the year 2003, driven by continued subscriber growth in our digital cable and high speed Internet services and rate increases in our video services. Our subscriber growth is attributable to new and improved products and advanced services in our digital cable and high speed Internet services. These include video on demand ("VOD" or "On Demand"), high definition television ("HDTV") programming and digital video recorders ("DVR"s) in our video services and a fast and reliable network, enhanced Internet portal, video mail and additional content in our high speed Internet services; Operating income before depreciation and amortization growth of 17.6% in our cable segment compared to the year 2003, resulting from our revenue growth, efficiencies achieved and volume related savings based on our size; Substantial completion of our cable systems upgrade; Investment in and long term access to technology platforms and national fiber optic networks that allow us to control the development, delivery and quality of our digital and advanced services for our video, high speed Internet and phone services; and Repurchases of approximately 46.9 million shares of our Class A Special common stock for aggregate consideration of $1.328 billion pursuant to our Board authorized repurchase program. The following discussion provides the details of these highlights and insights into our consolidated financial statements, including business developments, critical accounting judgments and estimates used in preparing the financial statements, and discussions of our results of operations, liquidity and capital resources.  BUSINESS DEVELOPMENTS We operate our businesses in an increasingly competitive, highly regulated and technologically complex environment. We are the largest video, broadband high speed Internet and cable phone service provider in the United States. We have substantially completed the upgrade of our broadband communications networks, allowing us to provide customers with new and improved products and advanced services in our video, high speed Internet and phone services. We also have expanded the ownership and management of our content businesses on national, regional and local levels. Cable On November 18, 2002, we completed the acquisition of AT&T Corp.s broadband business, which we refer to as "Broadband" and "the Broadband acquisition." The Broadband acquisition substantially increased the size of our cable operations and caused significant changes in our capital structure, including a substantially higher amount of debt. As a result, direct comparisons of our results of operations for periods prior to November 18, 2002, to subsequent periods are not meaningful. During 2004, we expanded our efforts to acquire and develop technology that will drive product differentiation and new applications and extend our nationwide fiber optic network. We achieved these objectives in 2004 through strategic agreements signed with Gemstar TV Guide and Microsoft, which enable us to control and develop the enhancement of the user interface and the functionality of our service offerings, such as our interactive programming guide and our VOD and DVR service. In addition, we and Gemstar formed an entity to develop and enhance interactive programming guides. In December 2004, we also announced a long term agreement with Level 3 Communications that is part of the extension of our fiber optic network. This national network, or "backbone," provides a technically advanced, nationwide broadband network over which we can deliver new and enhanced services. Content On May 10, 2004, we completed the acquisition of TechTV Inc. ("TechTV") for approximately $300 million in cash. On May 28, 2004, G4 and TechTV began operating as one network that is available to approximately 47 million cable and satellite homes nationwide as of December 31, 2004, and provides video and computer game related programming. 20 On July 28, 2004, we exchanged approximately 120 million shares of Liberty Media Corporation ("Liberty") Series A common stock that we held with Liberty for cash of $547 million, an additional 10.4% interest in E! Entertainment Television ("E! Entertainment") and 100% of International Channel Networks, a cultural and heritage related national cable network that is available to approximately 10 million cable homes nationwide as of December 31, 2004. QVC On September 17, 2003, we completed the sale to Liberty of our approximate 57% interest in QVC, Inc. for approximately $7.7 billion. We received from Liberty $4.0 billion of three year senior unsecured floating rate notes, approximately 218 million shares of Liberty Series A common stock valued at $2.339 billion, and cash of $1.35 billion. QVC is presented as a discontinued operation in our consolidated financial statements. Refer to General Developments of Our Business in Part I and Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 for a discussion of our acquisitions and other significant events.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES We believe our judgments and related estimates associated with the valuation and impairment testing of our cable franchise rights and the accounting for income taxes and legal contingencies are critical in the preparation of our financial statements. Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting judgments and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors, and the Audit Committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to them presented below. Valuation and Impairment Testing of Cable Franchise Rights Our cable systems are constructed and operated under non exclusive franchises granted by state or local governmental authorities for varying lengths of time. As of December 31, 2004, we served approximately 4,500 franchise areas in the United States. We have concluded that our cable franchise rights have an indefinite useful life since there are no legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other factors limiting the period over which these rights will contribute to our cash flows. Accordingly, our cable franchise rights are not subject to amortization but are assessed periodically for impairment in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" ("SFAS No. 142"). We have acquired these cable franchise rights either directly from local franchise authorities or through many separate cable system acquisitions that include multiple franchise territories. Upon acquisition, we integrate the individual franchise territories into our national footprint, typically by incorporating the management of those territories into our existing geographic regions. We control the sourcing of content, pricing, marketing and branding, and capital deployment throughout the company as if our cable franchise rights were a single asset. Therefore, we have concluded that we operate our cable franchise rights as a single asset within our cable segment. From time to time, however, certain cable franchise rights may be separated and sold in units below the cable segment level. We have concluded that Emerging Issues Task Force 02 07, "Unit of Accounting for Testing Impairment of Indefinite Lived Intangible Assets," supports the testing of our cable franchise rights for impairment at a level no higher than where the assets are both operated together and essentially inseparable. Upon the adoption of SFAS No. 142 in 2002, we tested our cable franchise rights for impairment at the cable segment level. Effective in the first quarter of 2004, we changed the unit of accounting used for testing impairment to geographic regions. We assess the recoverability of our cable franchise rights annually or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. We estimate the fair value of our cable franchise rights primarily based on multiples of operating income before depreciation and amortization generated by the underlying assets, discounted cash flow analyses, analyses of current market transactions, and profitability information, including estimated future operating results, trends or other determinants of fair value. If the value of our cable franchise rights determined by these evaluations is less than its carrying amount, an impairment charge would be recognized for the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of the assets. Future adverse changes in market conditions or in the operating results of the related business may indicate an inability to recover the carrying value of the assets, thereby possibly requiring a future impairment charge. The carrying amount of cable franchise rights related to some of our historical cable systems is significantly less than their current estimated fair value largely because we acquired many of these rights directly from local franchise authorities rather than through separate cable system acquisitions. Conversely, the carrying amount of cable franchise rights for our more recent cable system acquisitions has not been significantly reduced through amortization (and has not been reduced at all for acquisitions made subsequent to the adoption of SFAS No. 142). Nevertheless, testing for impairment at a level higher than the individual franchise agreement or cable system level reduces the likelihood of a future impairment charge related to our cable franchise rights. Income Taxes Our provision for income taxes is based on our current period income, changes in deferred income tax assets and liabilities, income tax rates, and tax planning opportunities available in the jurisdictions in which we operate. From time to time, we engage in transactions in which the tax consequences may be subject to some uncertainty. Examples of such transactions include business acquisitions and disposals, including like kind exchanges, issues related to consideration paid or received in connection with 21 acquisitions, and certain financing transactions. Significant judgment is required in assessing and estimating the tax consequences of these transactions. We prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations. In the normal course of business, our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities. Such examinations may result in future tax and interest assessments by these taxing authorities, and we record a liability when we believe that it is probable that we will be assessed. We adjust our estimates periodically because of ongoing examinations by and settlements with the various taxing authorities, as well as changes in tax laws, regulations and precedent. The financial statement effects of income tax uncertainties that arise in connection with business combinations and those associated with entities acquired in business combinations are discussed in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. The consolidated tax provision of any given year includes adjustments to prior year income tax provisions that are considered appropriate and any related estimated interest. We believe that adequate accruals have been made for income taxes. Differences between the estimated and actual amounts determined upon ultimate resolution, individually or in the aggregate, are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position but could possibly be material to our consolidated results of operations or cash flow of any one period. Legal Contingencies We are subject to legal, regulatory and other proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of our business and, in certain cases, those that we assume from an acquired entity in a business combination. We record an estimated liability for those proceedings and claims arising in the ordinary course of business based upon the probable and reasonably estimable criteria contained in SFAS No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies." For those litigation contingencies assumed in a business combination subsequent to the adoption of SFAS No. 142, we record a liability based on estimated fair value when such fair value is determinable. We review outstanding claims with internal as well as external counsel to assess probability and estimates of loss. The risk of loss is reassessed as new information becomes available and liabilities are adjusted, as appropriate. The actual cost of resolving a claim may be substantially different from the amount of the liability recorded. Significant and Subjective Estimates The following discussion and analysis of our results of operations and financial condition is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and contingent liabilities. We base our judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making estimates about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Refer to Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 for a discussion of our accounting policies with respect to these and other items.  RESULTS OF CONTINUING OPERATIONS Consolidated Operating Results Revenues Consolidated revenues for the years 2004 and 2003 increased $1.959 billion and $10.246 billion, respectively, from the previous year. Of these increases, $1.824 billion and $10.142 billion, respectively, relate to our cable segment and $159 million and $107 million, respectively, relate to our content segment, which are both discussed separately below. The remaining changes primarily relate to our other business activities, primarily Comcast Spectacor. Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses Consolidated operating, selling, general and administrative expenses for the years 2004 and 2003 increased $820 million and $6.690 billion, respectively, from the previous year. Of these increases, $703 million and $6.590 billion, respectively, relate to our cable segment and $108 million and $63 million, respectively, relate to our content segment, both of which are discussed separately below. The remaining increases relate to our other business activities, primarily Comcast Spectacor and corporate activities. Depreciation The changes in depreciation expense for the years 2004 and 2003 are primarily attributable to our cable segment. The increase in our cable segment for the year 2004 compared to the previous year is principally due to the higher level of depreciation associated with capital expenditures related to our cable systems upgrade. The increase in our cable segment for the year 2003 compared to the previous year is principally due to the effects of the Broadband acquisition, as well as our increased level of capital expenditures. 22 Amortization The changes in amortization expense for the years 2004 and 2003 are primarily attributable to our cable segment. The decrease in our cable segment for the year 2004 compared to the previous year relates to decreases in the amortization of our franchise related customer relationship intangible assets. As a result of the Broadband acquisition, we recorded approximately $3.4 billion of franchise related customer relationship intangible assets, which we are amortizing over their average estimated useful life of approximately four years. In the fourth quarter of 2003, we reduced the value of these intangible assets because we obtained updated valuation reports, which resulted in lower amortization expense. This decrease was partially offset by amortization associated with intangibles acquired in the Gemstar transaction. This decrease was also offset by our content segment, principally associated with intangibles acquired in the TechTV and Liberty exchange transactions. (See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 for further discussion about these transactions). The increase in our cable segment for the year 2003 compared to the previous year relates principally to the effects of the Broadband acquisition. 2003 to 2002 Historical Comparisons On November 18, 2002, we completed the acquisition of AT&T Corp.s broadband business, which we refer to as "Broadband" and "the Broadband Acquisition." The Broadband acquisition substantially increased the size of our cable operations and caused significant changes in our capital structure, including a substantially higher amount of debt. As a result, direct comparisons of our consolidated results of operations for periods prior to November 18, 2002, to subsequent periods are not meaningful. Please refer to our 2003 to 2002 historical and pro forma cable segment discussion below. Segment Operating Results Operating income before depreciation and amortization is the primary basis we use to measure the operational strength and performance of our segments. Operating income before depreciation and amortization is defined as operating income before depreciation and amortization, impairment charges, if any, related to fixed and intangible assets, and gains or losses from the sale of assets, if any. As such, it eliminates the significant level of non cash depreciation and amortization expense that results from the capital intensive nature of our businesses and from intangible assets recognized in business combinations, and it is unaffected by our capital structure or investment activities. Our management and Board of Directors use this measure in evaluating our consolidated operating performance and the operating performance of all of our operating segments. This metric is used to allocate resources and capital to our operating segments and is a significant component of our annual incentive compensation programs. We believe that this measure is also useful to investors as it is one of the bases for comparing our operating performance with other companies in our industries, although our measure may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other companies. Because we use operating income before depreciation and amortization as the measure of our segment profit or loss, we reconcile it to operating income, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP"), in the business segment footnote to our consolidated financial statements. This measure should not be considered a substitute for operating income (loss), net income (loss), net cash provided by operating activities or other measures of performance or liquidity reported in accordance with GAAP. All percentages are calculated based on actual amounts. Minor differences may exist due to rounding. Cable Segment The following table presents our cable segment operating results (dollars in millions): 2004 to 2003 Historical Comparisons Increase (Decrease) 2004 2003 $ % Video $ 12,892 $ 12,096 $ 796 6.6 % High speed Internet 3,124 2,255 869 38.5 Phone 701 801 (100 ) (12.5 ) Advertising sales 1,287 1,112 175 15.7 Other 666 620 46 7.4 Franchise fees 646 608 38 6.3 Revenues 19,316 17,492 1,824 10.4 Operating expenses 7,170 6,762 408 6.0 Selling, general and administrative expenses 4,675 4,380 295 6.7 Operating income before depreciation and amortization $ 7,471 $ 6,350 $ 1,121 17.6 % 23 The following tables present our subscriber and monthly average revenue statistics on both a historical and a pro forma basis. The pro forma adjustments reflect the addition of approximately 72,000 video subscribers acquired in various small acquisitions during the years presented as though the acquisitions occurred on January 1, 2003. The impact of these acquisitions on our segment operating results was not material (subscribers in thousands). Historical December 31, Pro forma December 31, 2004 2003 2004 2003 Video subscribers 21,548 21,468 21,548 21,540 High speed Internet subscribers 6,992 5,284 6,992 5,285 Phone subscribers 1,223 1,267 1,223 1,267 Historical Years Ended December 31, Pro forma Years Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2004 2003 Monthly average video revenue per video subscriber $ 49.87 $ 47.11 $ 49.89 $ 47.01 Monthly average high speed Internet revenue per high speed Internet subscriber $ 42.41 $ 42.08 $ 42.41 $ 42.20 Monthly average phone revenue per phone subscriber $ 46.89 $ 49.33 $ 46.90 $ 49.33 Revenues. Video revenue consists of our basic, expanded basic, premium, pay per view and digital cable services, as well as equipment rentals. The increase in video revenue from 2003 to 2004 is attributable to subscriber growth in our digital video service and rate increases. During 2004, we added approximately 990,000 digital subscribers. The growth in our digital cable subscribers was driven by an increase in consumer demand for new digital services and features, such as VOD, DVRs and HDTV programming, and enhancements in digital service packages. We expect continued growth in our video revenue. The increase in high speed Internet revenue from 2003 to 2004 is primarily due to the addition of approximately 1,708,000 high speed Internet subscribers in 2004. The growth in high speed Internet subscribers reflects increased consumer demand for the faster and more reliable Internet service provided over our cable networks. We expect continued growth in our high speed Internet revenue. The decrease in phone revenue from 2003 to 2004 is primarily a result of our focus on operating efficiencies to drive profitability in the phone business rather than focusing on subscriber growth. As a result, during 2004, our phone subscribers decreased by approximately 44,000 subscribers. The increase in advertising sales revenue from 2003 to 2004 is primarily due to the effects of growth in regional/national advertising as a result of the continued success of our regional interconnects, a stronger local advertising market and an increase in political advertising. We expect continued growth in our advertising sales revenue. Other revenue includes installation revenues, revenue from our regional sports and news networks, guide revenues, commissions from electronic retailing, revenue from commercial data services and revenue from other service offerings. The increase in franchise fees collected from our cable subscribers from 2003 to 2004 is primarily attributable to the increase in our revenues upon which the fees apply. Operating Expenses. Programming expenses represent our single largest operating expense and are fees paid to license programming from cable networks that we distribute, package and sell to our video subscribers. Programming expenses are impacted by changes in programming rates, the number of subscribers and the programming packages offered to subscribers. In 2004, programming costs increased $240 million to $4.149 billion, or 6.1%, from 2003. We anticipate our programming expenses will increase in the future primarily as a result of increased costs to purchase programming and as additional programming is provided to our subscribers. We anticipate that these increases will be mitigated, to some extent, by additional volume discounts. Other operating expenses increased $168 million, or 5.9%, from 2003, primarily driven by increases in personnel associated with the growth in our high speed Internet and digital cable services. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $295 million from 2003, primarily driven by increases in marketing costs and the administrative costs associated with growth in our business. 2003 to 2002 Historical Comparisons The following discussion of our cable segment operating results first presents a comparison of the 2003 and 2002 periods on a historical basis, which only includes the Broadband results subsequent to November 18, 2002. In order to provide additional 24 information relating to our cable segment operating results, we also present a comparison of 2003 actual results to 2002 results on a pro forma basis. Increase (Dollars in millions) 2003 2002 $ % Video $ 12,096 $ 5,516 $ 6,580 119.3 % High speed Internet 2,255 715 1,540 215.4 Phone 801 127 674 530.7 Advertising sales 1,112 474 638 134.6 Other 620 275 345 125.5 Franchise fees 608 243 365 150.2 Revenues 17,492 7,350 10,142 138.0 Operating expenses 6,762 2,685 4,077 151.8 Selling, general and administrative expenses 4,380 1,867 2,513 134.6 Operating income before depreciation and amortization $ 6,350 $ 2,798 $ 3,552 126.9 % Revenues. Video revenues increased $6.580 billion from 2002 to 2003, of which $6.286 billion is attributable to the effects of the Broadband acquisition and $294 million relates to changes in rates and subscriber growth in our historical operations, driven principally by growth in digital subscribers. During 2003, we added approximately 1,033,000 digital subscribers. The increase in high speed Internet revenue from 2002 to 2003 is primarily due to the effects of the Broadband acquisition and growth in high speed Internet subscribers. During 2003, we added approximately 1,692,000 high speed Internet subscribers. The increases in phone, advertising sales and other revenue from 2002 to 2003 are primarily attributable to the effects of the Broadband acquisition. Our historical operations prior to the Broadband acquisition did not contain significant phone revenue. The increase in franchise fees collected from our cable subscribers from 2002 to 2003 is primarily attributable to the increase in our revenues upon which the fees apply. Operating Expenses. Programming expenses increased $2.271 billion to $3.909 billion from 2002 to 2003, primarily due to the effects of the Broadband acquisition. The increase in other operating expenses from 2002 to 2003 is primarily attributable to the effects of the Broadband acquisition, the effects of an increase in labor costs and other volume related expenses, and, to a lesser extent, the effects of high speed Internet subscriber growth. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses from 2002 to 2003 is primarily attributable to the effects of the Broadband acquisition. 2003 to 2002 Pro Forma Comparisons Management uses pro forma data to evaluate performance when significant acquisitions or dispositions occur. Historical data reflects results of acquired businesses only after the acquisition dates, while pro forma data enhances comparability of financial information between periods by adjusting the data as if the acquisitions (or dispositions) occurred at the beginning of the prior year. Our pro forma data is only adjusted for the timing of acquisitions and does not include adjustments for costs related to integration activities, cost savings or synergies that have or may be achieved by the combined businesses. In the opinion of management, this information is not indicative of what our results would have been had we operated Broadband since January 1, 2002, nor is it indicative of our future results. The following table presents our cable segment operating results for 2002 on a pro forma basis and a reconciliation to historical and pro forma data (dollars in millions): 2003 to 2002 Increase/(Decrease) Pro Forma 2002 Preacquisition Broadband 2003 As reported $ % Video $ 12,096 $ 11,460 $ 5,944 $ 5,516 $ 636 5.5 % High speed Internet 2,255 1,486 771 715 769 51.7 Phone 801 818 691 127 (17 ) (2.2 ) Advertising sales 1,112 1,036 562 474 76 7.4 Other 620 667 392 275 (47 ) (7.2 ) Franchise fees 608 570 327 243 38 6.8 Revenues 17,492 16,037 8,687 7,350 1,455 9.1 Operating expenses 6,762 6,756 4,071 2,685 6 (0.0 ) Selling, general and administrative expenses 4,380 4,812 2,945 1,867 (432 ) (9.0 ) Operating income before depreciation and amortization $ 6,350 $ 4,469 $ 1,671 $ 2,798 $ 1,881 42.1 % 25  The following tables present our subscriber and monthly average revenue statistics on a pro forma basis as though acquisitions during these years occurred on January 1, 2002 (subscribers in thousands). December 31, 2003 2002 Increase/(Decrease) Video subscribers 21,468 21,327 141 0.7 % High speed Internet subscribers 5,284 3,620 1,664 45.9 % Phone subscribers 1,267 1,438 (171 ) (11.9 %) Years Ended December 31, 2003 2002 Increase/(Decrease) Monthly average video revenue per video subscriber $ 47.15 $ 44.54 $ 2.61 5.9 % Monthly average high speed Internet revenue per high speed Internet subscriber $ 42.44 $ 41.81 $ 0.63 1.5 % Monthly average phone revenue per phone subscriber $ 48.90 $ 54.35 $ (5.45 ) (10.0 %) Revenues. The increase in video revenue from 2002 to 2003 is primarily due to increases in monthly average revenue per video subscriber as a result of rate increases in our traditional video service, growth in digital subscribers, and repricing and repackaging of the digital and premium channel services in the Broadband systems. During 2003, we added approximately 1,033,000 digital subscribers. The increase in high speed Internet revenue from 2002 to 2003 is primarily due to the addition in 2003 of approximately 1,692,000 high speed Internet subscribers and is also due to the effects of an increase in monthly average revenue per subscriber. The decrease in phone revenue from 2002 to 2003 is primarily a result of our focusing on operating efficiencies to drive profitability in the phone business, rather than focusing on subscriber growth. As a result, during 2003, our phone subscribers decreased by approximately 171,000 subscribers. The increase in advertising sales revenue from 2002 to 2003 is primarily due to the effects of growth in regional/national advertising as a result of the continued success of our regional interconnects, offset by reduced growth in a soft local advertising market. Other revenue includes revenue from our regional sports programming networks, installation revenues, guide revenues, commissions from electronic retailing and reduced revenue from other service offerings. The increase in franchise fees collected from our cable subscribers from 2002 to 2003 is primarily attributable to the increase in our revenues upon which the fees apply. Operating Expenses. Programming expenses increased $87 million to $3.909 billion, or 2.3%, in 2003 compared to 2002, primarily because we were able to negotiate reductions in programming rates, principally in premium channels, during 2003. Other operating expenses decreased $81 million in 2003 from 2002, primarily due to the effects of cost reductions in the integration of the Broadband systems. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $432 million in 2003 from 2002, primarily driven by reductions in headcount and elimination of redundancies in 2003. In addition, the 2002 amounts include $425 million of acquisition and employee termination related costs recorded by Broadband. Content Segment 2004, 2003 and 2002 Historical Comparisons The following table presents our content segment operating results (dollars in millions): 2004 2003 2002 Revenues $ 787 $ 628 $ 521 Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses 522 414 351 Operating income before depreciation and amortization $ 265 $ 214 $ 170 Our content segment consists of the national networks E! Entertainment and Style Network (E! Networks), The Golf Channel, Outdoor Life Network, G4 and International Channel Networks. Revenues. Our content segment revenue increased $159 million and $107 million, or 25.3% and 20.5%, for the years 2004 and 2003, respectively, compared to the previous year. The increases in 2004 and 2003 revenue reflect increases in distribution and advertising revenue for all of the networks and the 2004 acquisitions of TechTV and International Channel Networks. 26 Operating, Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses increased $108 million and $63 million, or 26.1% and 17.9%, for the years 2004 and 2003, respectively, compared to the previous year. Expenses increased in 2004 and 2003 as a result of higher development and marketing expenses for signature events and other original programming in all of our networks, as well as to the effects of our acquisitions of TechTV and International Channel Networks during 2004. Consolidated Other Income (Expense) Items 2004, 2003 and 2002 Historical Comparisions Interest Expense. The decrease in interest expense for the year 2004 from 2003 is a result of our debt reduction during 2003 and 2004 and due to the effects of our interest rate risk management program. This decrease was offset somewhat by the effects of the write off of unamortized debt issue costs to interest expense in connection with the refinancing of our previously existing revolving credit facilities and by the early redemption of a portion of the Comcast exchangeable notes. The costs during 2004 associated with the refinancing and the redemption totaled $38 million and $31 million, respectively. The decrease for 2004 from 2003 was also offset by the effects of our adoption of SFAS No. 150, "Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity" ("SFAS No. 150"), on July 1, 2003. As a result of the adoption of SFAS No. 150, interest expense for 2004 and 2003 includes $100 million and $53 million, respectively, of dividends on a subsidiarys preferred stock, which were classified as minority interest prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 150. The increase in interest expense for 2003 from 2002 is due to our increased amount of debt outstanding in 2003 as a result of the Broadband acquisition. Investment Income (Loss), Net. Investment income (loss), net for the years ended December, 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 is comprised of the following (dollars in millions): 2004 2003 2002 Interest and dividend income $ 160 $ 166 $ 53 Gains (losses) on sales and exchanges of investments, net 45 28 (48 ) Investment impairment charges (16 ) (72 ) (247 ) Unrealized gains (losses) on trading securities 378 965 (1,569 ) Mark to market adjustments on derivatives related to trading securities (120 ) (818 ) 1,284 Mark to market adjustments on derivatives and hedged items 25 (353 ) (16 ) Investment income (loss), net $ 472 $ (84 ) $ (543 ) The investment impairment charges for 2003 and 2002 relate principally to other than temporary declines in our investment in AT&T. We have entered into derivative financial instruments that we account for at fair value and which economically hedge the market price fluctuations in the common stock of most (as of December 31, 2004) of our investments accounted for as trading securities. The differences between the unrealized gains (losses) on trading securities and the mark to market adjustments on derivatives related to trading securities, as presented in the table above, result from one or more of the following: we did not maintain an economic hedge for our entire investment in the security during some portion or for all of the period, the security to which the derivative relates changed due to a corporate reorganization of the issuing company to a security with a different volatility rate, the issuing company paid a new or an increased dividend to the shareholders of the security, or the change in the time value component of the derivative value during the period. The mark to market adjustments on derivatives and hedged items consist principally of the fair value adjustments related to the derivative component of the notes exchangeable into Comcast stock. We are exposed to changes in the fair value of this derivative since the underlying shares of Comcast Class A Special common stock that we hold in treasury are carried at our historical cost and not adjusted for changes in fair value. As of December 31, 2004, approximately 8.4 million shares of Comcast Class A Special common stock collateralize the outstanding Comcast exchangeable notes. Equity in Net Losses of Affiliates. The increase in equity in net losses of affiliates from 2003 to 2004 results principally from the effects of our additional investments and changes in the net income or loss of our equity method investees. Other Income. The increase in other income from 2003 to 2004 is primarily attributable to the $250 million reduction in the estimated fair value liability associated with the AT&T securities litigation recorded as part of the Broadband acquisition and the $94 million gain recognized on the sale of our 20% interest in DHC Ventures, LLC (Discovery Health Channel). Refer to Notes 6 27 and 13 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 for a discussion of this settlement and this sale. The increase in other income from 2002 to 2003 is primarily attributable to lease rental income related to certain assets acquired in the Broadband acquisition. Income Tax (Expense) Benefit. The changes in income tax (expense) benefit are primarily the result of the effects of changes in our income (loss) from continuing operations before taxes and minority interest. Minority Interest. The decrease in minority interest from 2003 to 2004 is attributable to the effects of our adoption of SFAS No. 150 on July 1, 2003, upon which we now record our subsidiary preferred dividends, previously included within minority interest, to interest expense and, to a lesser extent, to increases in the net losses of some of our less than wholly owned consolidated subsidiaries. The increase in minority interest from 2002 to 2003 is attributable to increases in the net income of our less than wholly owned consolidated subsidiaries and to dividends recorded to minority interest related to certain subsidiaries acquired in the Broadband acquisition prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 150 on July 1, 2003. Discontinued operations. Income from discontinued operations decreased from 2002 to 2003 primarily as a result of the 2003 periods including the results of QVC through August 31, while the 2002 period includes QVCs results for the full year. As a result of the sale of QVC, we recognized a $3.290 billion gain, net of approximately $2.865 billion of related income taxes.  STOCK OPTION ACCOUNTING In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), "Share Based Payment" ("SFAS No. 123R"), which replaces SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation" ("SFAS No. 123") and supercedes APB Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees." SFAS No. 123R requires all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values, beginning with the first interim or annual period after June 15, 2005, with early adoption encouraged. In addition, SFAS No. 123R will cause unrecognized expense (based on the amounts in our pro forma footnote disclosure) related to options vesting after the date of initial adoption to be recognized as a charge to results of operations over the remaining vesting period. We are required to adopt SFAS No. 123R in our third quarter of 2005, beginning July 1, 2005. Under SFAS No. 123R, we must determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share based payments, the amortization method for compensation cost and the transition method to be used at the date of adoption. The transition alternatives include prospective and retroactive adoption methods. Under the retroactive methods, prior periods may be restated either as of the beginning of the year of adoption or for all periods presented. The prospective method requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options and share awards at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of SFAS No. 123R, while the retroactive methods would record compensation expense for all unvested stock options and share awards beginning with the first period restated. We are evaluating the requirements of SFAS No. 123R and we expect that the adoption of SFAS No. 123R will have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and earnings per share. We have not determined the method of adoption or the effect of adopting SFAS No. 123R.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES During 2004, we continued to strengthen our balance sheet through the repayment and refinancing of debt, and improved our liquidity through the sales or exchanges of our investments, which are more fully described below. We believe that we will be able to meet our current and long term liquidity and capital requirements, including fixed charges, through our cash flows from operating activities, existing cash, cash equivalents and investments; through available borrowings under our existing credit facilities; and through our ability to obtain future external financing. Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations amounted to $5.930 billion for the year ended December 31, 2004, due principally to our operating income before depreciation and amortization, the effects of interest and income tax payments, proceeds from sales or exchanges of trading securities, and changes in operating assets and liabilities. During 2004, we made cash payments for interest totaling $1.898 billion. We anticipate that, for the foreseeable future, our cash paid for interest will decline modestly as average debt balances decline but will remain significant. During 2004, we made cash payments for income taxes totaling $205 million, primarily as a result of state income taxes associated with our net income. Offsetting the cash payments were federal income tax refunds received during 2004 of approximately $591 million. We anticipate that our income tax payments will increase as our income increases and certain tax audits are settled. Also contributing to the increase in our cash flow from operating activities was $680 million of proceeds received on the sale or exchange of our trading securities, including $547 million received in connection with the Liberty exchange transaction in July 2004 and $128 million received in connection with our sale of 3 million shares of Liberty International common stock in December 2004. Although the presentation of these proceeds within cash provided by operating activities is in accordance with 28 generally accepted accounting principles, these amounts are not indicative of our recurring operations, but result from sales of investments. During 2004, the net change in our operating assets and liabilities was $331 million. The changes in operating assets and liabilities are primarily a result of $515 million in cash payments for liabilities recorded associated with the Broadband acquisition. Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations was $2.516 billion for the year ended December 31, 2004, and consists principally of our net repayments of debt of $1.293 billion and repurchases of common stock of $1.324 billion. During the year ended December 31, 2004, our debt repayments and borrowings consisted of the following: Repayments $867 million under senior and medium term notes, $700 million under revolving credit facilities, $609 million of Comcast exchangeable debt and $147 million under capital leases and other debt instruments. Borrowings $700 million under revolving credit facilities, $320 million, net under our commercial paper program and $10 million under other debt instruments. We have made, and may, from time to time in the future, make optional repayments on our debt obligations, which may include open market repurchases of our outstanding public notes and debentures, depending on various factors, such as market conditions. Commercial Paper Program. In June 2004, we entered into a commercial paper program to provide a lower cost borrowing source of liquidity to fund our short term working capital requirements. The program allows for a maximum of $2.25 billion of commercial paper to be issued at any one time. Our revolving bank credit facility supports this program. As of December 31, 2004, amounts outstanding under the program totaled $320 million with a weighted average interest rate of 2.68%. Available Borrowings Under Credit Facilities. We have traditionally maintained significant availability under our lines of credit to meet our short term liquidity requirements. In January 2004, we refinanced three of our existing revolving credit facilities with a new $4.5 billion, five year revolving bank credit facility due January 2009. The interest rate for borrowings under this revolver is LIBOR plus 0.625% based on our current credit ratings. We have four lines of credit aggregating $4.872 billion and, as of December 31, 2004, amounts available under our lines of credit totaled $4.062 billion. The Cross Guarantee Structure. We and a number of our wholly owned subsidiaries that hold substantially all of our cable assets have unconditionally guaranteed each others debt securities and indebtedness for borrowed money, including amounts outstanding under the $4.5 billion bank credit facility. As of December 31, 2004, $20.223 billion of our debt was included in the cross guarantee structure. Comcast Holdings Corporation, our immediate predecessor and now a subsidiary, is not a guarantor and none of its debt is guaranteed under the cross guarantee structure. As of December 31, 2004, $950 million of our debt was outstanding at Comcast Holdings. Debt Covenants. We and our cable subsidiaries that have provided guarantees are subject to the covenants and restrictions set forth in the indentures governing our public debt securities and in the credit agreement governing our bank credit facilities. We and the guarantors are in compliance with the covenants and we believe that neither the covenants nor the restrictions in our indentures or loan documents will limit our ability to operate our business or raise additional capital. The two financial covenants in our bank credit facility are tested on an ongoing basis and measure our leverage and interest coverage. We have significant headroom under these financial covenants. Future compliance with these financial covenants is not dependent on further debt reduction or on improved operating results. Exchangeable Notes. We have outstanding notes exchangeable into the common stock of Cablevision Class A common stock, Microsoft common stock, Vodafone ADRs and Comcast Class A Special common stock (together, the "Exchangeable Notes"). At maturity the Exchangeable Notes are mandatorily redeemable at our option into (i) a number of shares of common stock or ADRs equal to the underlying shares multiplied by an exchange ratio (as defined), or (ii) its cash equivalent. The maturity value of 29 the Exchangeable Notes varies based upon the fair market value of the security to which it is indexed. The Exchangeable Notes are collateralized by our investments in Cablevision, Microsoft and Vodafone, respectively. The Comcast exchangeable notes are collateralized by our Class A Special common stock held in treasury. We have settled and intend in the future to settle all of the Comcast exchangeable notes using cash. During 2004 and 2003, we settled an aggregate of $847 million face amount and $638 million face amount, respectively, of our obligations relating to our notes exchangeable into Comcast stock by delivering cash to the counterparty upon maturity of the instruments, and the equity collar agreements related to the underlying shares expired or were settled. During 2004 and 2003, we settled $2.359 billion face amount and $1.213 billion face amount, respectively, of our obligations relating to our Exchangeable Notes by delivering the underlying shares of common stock to the counterparty upon maturity of the investments. As of December 31, 2004, our debt includes an aggregate of $1.699 billion of Exchangeable Notes, including $1.645 billion within current portion of long term debt. As of December 31, 2004, the securities we hold collateralizing the Exchangeable Notes were sufficient to substantially satisfy the debt obligations associated with the outstanding Exchangeable Notes. Stock Repurchases. During 2004, under our Board authorized, $2 billion share repurchase program, we repurchased 46.9 million shares of our Class A Special common stock for $1.328 billion. We expect such repurchases to continue from time to time in the open market or in private transactions, subject to market conditions. Refer to Notes 8 and 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 for a discussion of our financing activities. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was $4.512 billion for the year ended December 31, 2004, and consists primarily of capital expenditures of $3.660 billion, additions to intangible and other noncurrent assets of $628 million and the acquisition of TechTV for approximately $300 million. Capital Expenditures. Our most significant recurring investing activity has been and is expected to continue to be capital expenditures. The following table illustrates the capital expenditures we incurred in our cable segment during 2004 and expect to incur in 2005 (dollars in millions): 2004 2005 Deployment of cable modems, digital converters, and new service offerings $ 2,106 $ 2,300 Upgrading of cable systems 902 200 Recurring capital projects 614 500 Total cable segment capital expenditures $ 3,622 $ 3,000 The amount of our capital expenditures for 2005 and for subsequent years will depend on numerous factors, some of which are beyond our control, including competition, changes in technology and the timing and rate of deployment of new services. Additions to Intangibles. Additions to intangibles during 2004 primarily relate to our investment in a $250 million long term strategic license agreement with Gemstar, multiple dwelling unit contracts of approximately $133 million and other licenses and software intangibles of approximately $168 million. Investments. Proceeds from sales, settlements and restructurings of investments totaled $228 million during 2004, related to the sales of our non strategic investments, including our 20% interest in DHC Ventures, LLC (Discovery Health Channel) for approximately $149 million. We consider investments that we determine to be non strategic, highly valued, or both to be a source of liquidity. We consider our investment in $1.5 billion in Time Warner common equivalent preferred stock to be an anticipated source of liquidity. We do not have any significant contractual funding commitments with respect to any of our investments. Refer to Notes 6 and 7 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 for a discussion of our investments and our intangible assets, respectively.  OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS We do not have any significant off balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. 30  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS Our unconditional contractual obligations as of December 31, 2004, which consist primarily of our debt obligations, and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods, are summarized in the following table (dollars in millions): Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations Total Year 1 Years 2 3 Years 4 5 More than 5 years Debt obligations, excluding Exchangeable Notes(1) $ 21,820 $ 1,835 $ 2,390 $ 2,844 $ 14,751 Exchangeable Notes 1,699 1,645 54 Capital lease obligations 73 19 38 9 7 Operating lease obligations 987 190 295 203 299 Purchase obligations(2) 7,214 2,222 1,774 1,159 2,059 Other long term liabilities reflected on the balance sheet: Acquisition related obligations(3) 509 294 172 32 11 Other long term obligations(4) 3,693 238 312 140 3,003 Total $ 35,995 $ 6,443 $ 5,035 $ 4,387 $ 20,130 Refer to Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 for a discussion of our long term debt. Refer to Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our operating lease and purchase obligations. Refer to Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our acquisition related obligations. (1)Excludes interest payments. (2)Purchase obligations consist of agreements to purchase goods and services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, price provisions and timing of the transaction. Our purchase obligations include payments under the employment agreements that we, through Comcast Spectacor, have with both players and coaches of our professional sports teams that are guaranteed regardless of employee injury or termination. Some of these agreements may be covered by disability insurance if certain conditions are met. Also included are payments under license agreements that our programming networks have entered into for programs and sporting events that will be available for telecast subsequent to December 31, 2004. Also included are the minimum guaranteed payments under programming contracts that our cable segment enters into for the purchase of programming from cable network providers. We have also included commitments to purchase cable related equipment. We did not include contracts with immaterial future commitments. (3)Acquisition related obligations consist primarily of costs related to terminating employees, costs relating to exiting contractual obligations, and other assumed contractual obligations of the acquired entity. (4)Other long term obligations consist principally of our prepaid forward transactions on equity securities we hold, subsidiary preferred shares, deferred compensation obligations, pension, post retirement and post employment benefit obligations, and program rights payable under license agreements. Affiliation Agreements Our content subsidiaries enter into multi year affiliation agreements with various cable and satellite television system operators for carriage of their respective programming. In connection with these affiliation agreements, we, at times, have paid a fee to the cable or satellite television operator for the initial or renewal agreement based upon the number of subscribers. During 2005, we expect to incur fees of approximately $25 million related to these affiliation agreements, excluding amounts applicable to our cable systems.  INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT We are exposed to the market risk of adverse changes in interest rates. In order to manage the cost and volatility relating to our interest cost of our outstanding debt, we maintain a mix of fixed and variable rate debt and enter into various interest rate risk management derivative transactions pursuant to our policies. We monitor our interest rate risk exposures using techniques including market value and sensitivity analyses. We do not hold or issue any derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes and are not a party to leveraged instruments. We manage the credit risks associated with our derivative financial instruments through the evaluation and monitoring of the creditworthiness of the counterparties. Although we may be exposed to losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties, we do not expect such losses, if any, to be significant. These derivative financial instruments, which can include swaps, rate locks, caps and collars, represent an integral part of our interest rate risk management program. During 2004, we decreased our interest expense by approximately $66 million through 31 this program. Our derivative financial instruments did not have a significant effect on interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002. However, interest rate risk management instruments may have a significant effect on our interest expense in the future. The table set forth below summarizes the fair values and contract terms of financial instruments subject to interest rate risk maintained by us as of December 31, 2004 (dollars in millions): 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 Thereafter Total Fair Value at 12/31/04 Debt Fixed Rate $ 2,547 $ 1,690 $ 725 $ 1,486 $ 1,015 $ 14,756 $ 22,219 $ 25,086 Average Interest Rate 7.4 % 7.4 % 8.2 % 7.2 % 7.3 % 7.8 % 7.7 % Variable Rate $ 952 $ 7 $ 61 $ 10 $ 343 $ 1,373 $ 1,373 Average Interest Rate 3.8 % 3.9 % 4.5 % 4.5 % 5.0 % 4.2 % Interest Rate Instruments Variable to Fixed Swaps (notional amounts) $ 488 $ 488 $ 8 Average Pay Rate 7.6 % 7.6 % Average Receive Rate 3.5 % 3.5 % Fixed to Variable Swaps (notional amounts) $ 400 $ 600 $ 750 $ 2,150 $ 3,900 $ 9 Average Pay Rate 6.7 % 7.0 % 6.8 % 5.6 % 6.1 % Average Receive Rate 6.4 % 6.2 % 6.9 % 6.0 % 6.3 % The notional amounts of interest rate instruments, as presented in the table above, are used to measure interest to be paid or received and do not represent the amount of exposure to credit loss. The estimated fair value approximates the proceeds necessary to settle the outstanding contracts. We estimate interest rates on variable debt using the average implied forward London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") rates for the year of maturity based on the yield curve in effect at December 31, 2004, plus the borrowing margin in effect for each credit facility at December 31, 2004. We estimate the floating rates on our swaps using the average implied forward LIBOR rates for the year of maturity based on the yield curve in effect at December 31, 2004. Excluding the effects of interest rate risk management instruments, 5.8% of our total debt as of December 31, 2004, was at variable rates, compared to 8.2% at December 31, 2003. As a matter of practice, we typically do not structure our financial contracts to include credit ratings based triggers that could affect our liquidity. In the ordinary course of business, some of our swaps could be subject to termination provisions if we do not maintain investment grade credit ratings. As of December 31, 2004, the estimated fair value of the proceeds to be received related to those swaps was immaterial. The amount due or to be received upon termination, if any, would be based upon the fair value of those outstanding contracts at that time.  EQUITY PRICE RISK MANAGEMENT We are exposed to the market risk of changes in the equity prices of some of our investments accounted for as trading securities. We enter into various derivative transactions pursuant to our policies to manage the volatility relating to these exposures. We monitor our equity price risk exposures to ensure that the instruments are matched with the underlying assets or liabilities, reduce our risks relating to equity prices, and through market value and sensitivity analyses, maintain a high correlation to the risk inherent in the hedged item. We use the following derivative financial instruments, which we account for at fair value, to limit our exposure to and benefits from price fluctuations in the common stock of some of our investments accounted for as trading securities: Cashless collar agreements ("equity collars"); Prepaid forward sales agreements ("prepaid forward sales"); Indexed debt instruments ("exchangeable notes"). Except as described in Results of Continuing Operations Investment Income (Loss), Net on page 27, the changes in the fair value of our investments accounted for as trading securities were substantially offset by the changes in the fair values of the equity collars and the derivative components of the exchangeable notes and the prepaid forward sales. Refer to Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 for a discussion of our accounting policies with respect to derivative financial instruments and to Notes 6 and 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 for discussions of our derivative financial instruments. 32  ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) The components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) primarily are unrealized losses on our rate locks, offset by unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities. Changes to these components account for the change in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) from December 31, 2003, to December 31, 2004. Refer to Notes 6 and 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 for more information about these components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). We believe that our operations are not materially affected by inflation.
