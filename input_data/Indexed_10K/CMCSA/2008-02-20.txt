Item 7: Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Introduction and Overview We are the largest cable operator in the United States and offer a variety of entertainment and communications products and services. As of December 31, 2007, our cable systems served approximately 24.1 million video subscribers, 13.2 million high speed Internet subscribers and 4.6 million phone subscribers and passed approximately 48.5 million homes in 39 states and the District of Columbia. We classify our operations in two reportable segments: Cable and Programming. Our Cable segment, which generates approximately 95% of our consolidated revenues, manages and operates our cable systems. Our Programming segment consists primarily of our national programming networks. During 2007, our operations generated consolidated revenues of approximately $30.9 billion. Our Cable segment earns revenues primarily through subscriptions to our video, high speed Internet and phone services (cable services). We market our cable services individually and as bundled services primarily to residential customers. We are beginning to offer bundled cable services to small and medium sized businesses. Our video services range from a limited basic service and a digital starter service to our full digital cable service. Our full digital cable service provides access to over 250 channels, including premium and pay per view channels; video on demand (which allows access to a library of movies, sports and news and the ability to start a selection at any time and to pause, rewind and fast forward selections); music channels; and an interactive, on screen program guide (which allows the subscriber to navigate the channel lineup and the video on demand library). Digital cable subscribers may also subscribe to additional digital cable services, including digital video recorder (DVR) (which allows digital recording of programs and pausing and rewinding of live television) and high definition television (HDTV) (which provides multiple channels in high definition). As of December 31, 2007, approximately 50% of the homes in the areas we serve subscribed to our video service and approximately 63% of those video subscribers subscribed to at least one of our digital cable services. Our high speed Internet service provides Internet access at downstream speeds of up to 16 Mbps depending on the level of service selected. As of December 31, 2007, approximately 28% of the homes in the areas we serve subscribed to our high speed Internet service. Our digital phone service provides unlimited local and domestic long distance calling and other features and is our most recent cable service offering. As of December 31, 2007, approximately 10% of the homes in the areas we serve subscribed to our digital phone service. In addition to cable services, other Cable segment revenue sources include advertising and the operations of our regional sports and news networks. Our Programming segment consists primarily of our consolidated national programming networks, including E!, The Golf Channel, VERSUS, G4 and Style. Revenue from our Programming segment is earned primarily from the sale of advertising and from monthly per subscriber license fees paid by multichannel video programming distributors (MVPDs). Our other business interests include Comcast Spectacor and Comcast Interactive Media. Comcast Spectacor owns the Philadelphia Flyers, the Philadelphia 76ers and two large, multipurpose arenas in Philadelphia, and manages other facilities for sporting events, concerts and other events. Comcast Interactive Media develops and operates Comcasts Internet businesses focused on entertainment, information and communication, including Comcast.net, Fancast, thePlatform and Fandango. Comcast Spectacor, Comcast Interactive Media and all other consolidated businesses not included in our Cable or Programming segments are included in Corporate and Other activities. We operate our businesses in an intensely competitive environment. We compete with a number of different companies that offer a broad range of services through increasingly diverse means. Competition for the cable services we offer consists primarily of DBS operators and telephone companies. In 2007, many of these competitors have expanded their service areas, added features and adopted aggressive pricing and packaging for services and features that are comparable to the services and features we offer. A substantial portion of our revenues comes from residential subscribers whose spending patterns may be affected by prevailing economic conditions. Intensifying competition and a weakening economy affected our net subscriber additions during the second half of 2007 and may, if these conditions continue, adversely impact our results of operations in the future. 2007 Developments consolidated revenue increased 23.7% to approximately $30.9 billion and consolidated operating income increased 20.8% to approximately $5.6 billion, both driven by results in our Cable segment Cable segment revenue increased 21.9% to approximately $29.3 billion and operating income before depreciation and amortization increased 23.3% to approximately $11.9 billion, both driven by acquisitions, as well as growth in our digital cable, high speed Internet and digital phone services; during 2007, excluding subscribers obtained through acquisitions, we added approximately 2.5 million digital cable subscribers, approximately 1.7 million high speed Internet subscribers and approximately 2.5 million digital phone subscribers while the number of basic video subscribers decreased 180,000  Comcast 2007 Annual Report on Form 10 K 20 Table of Contents an increase in Cable segment capital expenditures of 41.2% to approximately $6.0 billion, primarily as a result of (i) the installation of advanced set top boxes, modems and other equipment associated with the increase in subscribers to our digital video, high speed Internet and digital phone services; (ii) network improvements to handle the growth in subscribers and to provide service improvements and enhancements; (iii) capital expenditures related to commercial services to small and medium sized businesses; and (iv) integration of our newly acquired cable systems acquisitions of (i) cable system serving Houston, Texas (approximately 700,000 video subscribers), resulting from the dissolution of Texas and Kansas City Cable Partners (the Houston transaction), in January 2007 and (ii) the cable system of Patriot Media, serving approximately 81,000 video subscribers in central New Jersey, in August 2007 other acquisitions of (i) Fandango, an online entertainment site and movie ticket service, in April 2007 and (ii) Rainbow Media Holdings LLCs 60% interest in Bay Area SportsNet and its 50% interest in Sports Channel New England, expanding our regional sports networks, in June 2007 repurchase of approximately 133 million shares of our Class A common stock and Class A Special common stock under our Board authorized share repurchase program for approximately $3.1 billion; in October 2007 our Board of Directors authorized a $7 billion addition to the existing share repurchase program Further details of our consolidated financial statements, including discussion of our results of operations and our liquidity and capital resources, are presented below. The Areas We Serve The map below highlights our 40 major markets with emphasis on our operations in the top 25 U.S. TV markets. Approximately 92% of our video subscribers are in the markets listed (subscribers in thousands). 21 Comcast 2007 Annual Report on Form 10 K Table of Contents Consolidated Operating Results The comparability of our results of operations and subscriber information is impacted by the effects of the Houston transaction in January 2007, the acquisition of Patriot Media in August 2007, the Adelphia and Time Warner transactions in July 2006, the acquisition of the cable systems of Susquehanna Communications in April 2006, and other smaller acquisitions. We collectively refer to the cable systems acquired in these transactions as the newly acquired cable systems. The newly acquired cable systems contributed 81,000 video subscribers, 58,000 high speed Internet subscribers and 16,000 phone subscribers in 2007. The newly acquired cable systems contributed 3.5 million video subscribers, 1.7 million high speed Internet subscribers and 173,000 phone subscribers in 2006, including the Cable system serving Houston, Texas for Cable segment purposes (see Segment Operating Results below). As a result of transferring our previously owned cable systems located in Los Angeles, Cleveland and Dallas (Comcast Exchange Systems) as part of the Adelphia and Time Warner transactions, the operating results of the Comcast Exchange Systems are reported as discontinued operations for 2006 and 2005. The comparability of our results of operations is also impacted by the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123R, Share Based Payment (SFAS No. 123R) on January 1, 2006. See Item 8, Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the adoption of SFAS No. 123R.

Minor differences may exist due to rounding. Consolidated Revenues Our Cable and Programming segments accounted for substantially all of the increases in consolidated revenues for 2007 and 2006. Cable segment and Programming segment revenues are discussed separately below in Segment Operating Results. The remaining changes relate to our other business activities, primarily Comcast Spectacor and growth in Comcast Interactive Media. Consolidated Operating, Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Our Cable and Programming segments accounted for substantially all of the increases in consolidated operating, selling, general and administrative expenses for 2007 and 2006. Cable segment and Programming segment operating, selling, general and administrative expenses are discussed separately below in Segment Operating Results. The remaining changes relate to our other business activities, including expanding our Comcast Interactive Media business, the settlement of litigation in 2007 and player contract termination costs at Comcast Spectacor in 2007. Comcast 2007 Annual Report on Form 10 K 22 Table of Contents Consolidated Depreciation and Amortization The increases in depreciation expense for 2007 and 2006 are primarily a result of the effects of capital expenditures by our Cable segment, which resulted in increased depreciation of approximately $700 million and $100 million, respectively, and acquisitions of cable systems, which resulted in increased depreciation of approximately $530 million and $200 million, respectively. The increase in amortization expense for 2007 is primarily a result of the increases in the amortization of our franchise related customer relationship intangible assets associated with our newly acquired cable systems, purchases of software related intangibles and the write down of intangible assets of approximately $30 million related to the planned shutdown of the AZN network in 2008. The decrease in amortization expense for 2006 is primarily a result of decreases in the amortization of our franchise related customer relationship intangible assets, which were partially offset by increased amortization expense related to software related intangibles acquired in various transactions and the newly acquired cable systems. Segment Operating Results Certain adjustments have been made in our 2005 and 2006 segment presentation to be consistent with our 2007 management reporting presentation. These adjustments are primarily related to certain segment reclassifications and are further discussed in Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements. The Cable segment includes the operating results for the Houston cable system beginning August 1, 2006. However, the operating results of the Houston cable system were eliminated in our consolidated financial statements for 2006 as we continued to account for Texas and Kansas City Cable Partners as an equity method investment for external financial reporting purposes until the Houston cable system was acquired on January 1, 2007. To measure the performance of our operating segments, we use operating income before depreciation and amortization, excluding impairment charges related to fixed and intangible assets, and gains or losses from the sale of assets, if any. This measure eliminates the significant level of noncash depreciation and amortization expense that results from the capital intensive nature of our businesses and from intangible assets recognized in business combinations. It is also unaffected by our capital structure or investment activities. We use this measure to evaluate our consolidated operating performance and the operating performance of our operating segments, and to allocate resources and capital to our operating segments. It is also a significant performance measure in our annual incentive compensation programs. We believe that this measure is useful to investors because it is one of the bases for comparing our operating performance with other companies in our industries, although our measure may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other companies. Because we use this metric to measure our segment profit or loss, we reconcile it to operating income, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP) in the business segment footnote to our consolidated financial statements ( see Note 15). You should not consider this measure a substitute for operating income (loss), net income (loss), net cash provided by operating activities, or other measures of performance or liquidity we have reported in accordance with GAAP. Cable Segment Overview Our cable systems simultaneously deliver video, high speed Internet and phone services to our subscribers. The majority of our Cable segment revenue is earned from subscriptions to these cable services. Subscribers typically pay us monthly, based on their chosen level of service, number of services and features and the type of equipment they use, and generally may discontinue service at any time. Our revenue and operating income before depreciation and amortization have increased as a result of the effects of our recent acquisitions, continued demand for our products and services (including our bundled offerings), as well as other factors discussed below. The newly acquired cable systems accounted for approximately $2.6 billion and $1.7 billion of the increases in revenues in 2007 and 2006, respectively. However, intensifying competition and a weakening economy affected our net subscriber additions during the second half of 2007 and may, if these conditions continue, adversely impact our results of operations in 2008, including as a result of a decline in the number of subscribers to our basic cable services. 23 Comcast 2007 Annual Report on Form 10 K Table of Contents Cable Segment Results of Operations Year ended December 31 (in millions) 2007 2006 2005 % Change2006 to 2007 % Change2005 to 2006 Video $ 17,686 $ 15,062 $ 12,887 17.4 % 16.9 % High speed Internet 6,402 4,953 3,737 29.2 32.5 Phone 1,766 911 617 93.9 47.6 Advertising 1,537 1,468 1,249 4.5 17.6 Other 1,087 927 859 17.5 7.9 Franchise fees 827 721 638 14.7 13.1 Revenues 29,305 24,042 19,987 21.9 20.3 Operating expenses 10,416 8,513 7,047 22.3 20.8 Selling, general and administrative expenses 6,967 5,862 5,001 18.9 17.2 Operating income before depreciation and amortization $ 11,922 $ 9,667 $ 7,939 23.3 % 21.8 % Cable Segment Revenues Video. We offer a full range of video services ranging from a limited basic service and a digital starter service to our full digital cable service. Digital cable subscribers may also subscribe to additional digital cable services, including DVR and HDTV. As of December 31, 2007, 63% of our video subscribers subscribed to at least one of our digital cable services, compared to 52% and 45% as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Revenues increased as a result of higher pricing on our basic video service, subscriber growth in our digital cable services, including demand for digital features such as video on demand, DVR and HDTV, and the addition of our newly acquired cable systems. During 2007 and 2006, we added approximately 2.5 million and 1.9 million digital cable subscribers, respectively, while the number of basic subscribers decreased by 180,000 in 2007. In 2007, approximately $1.6 billion of the increases in our video revenue were attributable to our newly acquired cable systems. In 2006, the amount was approximately $1.1 billion. Our average monthly video revenue per video subscriber increased from approximately $53 in 2005 to approximately $57 in 2006 and to approximately $61 in 2007. High Speed Internet. We offer high speed Internet service with Internet access at downstream speeds of up to 16 Mbps depending on the level of service selected. This service also includes our interactive portal, Comcast.net, which provides multiple e mail addresses and online storage, as well as a variety of proprietary content and value added features and enhancements that are designed to take advantage of the speed of the Internet services we provide. Revenues increased in 2007 and 2006 as a result of subscriber growth and the addition of our newly acquired cable systems. As of December 31, 2007, 28% of the homes in the areas we serve subscribed to our high speed Internet service, compared to 25% and 21% as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. In 2007, approximately $640 million of the increases in our high speed Internet revenue were attributable to our newly acquired cable systems. In 2006, the amount was approximately $370 million. Average monthly revenue per high speed Internet subscriber has remained relatively stable, between $42 and $43, from 2005 through 2007. Comcast 2007 Annual Report on Form 10 K 24 Table of Contents Phone. We offer our interconnected VoIP digital phone service that provides unlimited local and domestic long distance calling and includes such features as voice mail, caller ID and call waiting. Our digital phone service was available to approximately 42 million or 87% of the homes in the areas we serve, as of December 31, 2007. We expect that by the end of 2008 approximately 91% of our homes passed will have access to our digital phone service. In some areas, we provide circuit switched local phone service. Revenues increased in 2007 and 2006 as a result of increases in the number of digital phone subscribers. These increases were partially offset by the loss of approximately 470,000 and 330,000 circuit switched phone subscribers in 2007 and 2006, respectively. In 2007, approximately $100 million of the increases in our phone revenue were attributable to our newly acquired cable systems. In 2006, the amount was $40 million. Our circuit switched phone service subscribers will continue to decrease as we phase out this service in 2008. Advertising. As part of our programming license agreements with programming networks, we receive an allocation of scheduled advertising time that we may sell to local, regional and national advertisers. We also coordinate the advertising sales efforts of other cable operators in some markets, and in other markets we have formed and operate advertising interconnects, which establish a physical, direct link between multiple cable systems and provide for the sale of regional and national advertising across larger geographic areas than could be provided by a single cable operator. Advertising revenues increased in 2007 as a result of our newly acquired cable systems. Absent the growth from the newly acquired cable systems, advertising revenue decreased slightly in 2007, reflecting continued weakness across the television advertising market, a decline in political advertising and one less week in the broadcast calendar during 2007. Advertising revenue increased in 2006 as a result of strong political advertising and the addition of our newly acquired cable systems. Other. We also generate revenues from our regional sports and news networks, installation services, commissions from third party electronic retailing and fees for other services, such as providing businesses with data connectivity and networked applications. Our regional sports and news networks include Comcast SportsNet (Philadelphia), Comcast SportsNet Mid Atlantic (Baltimore/Washington), Cable Sports Southeast, CN8 The Comcast Network, Comcast SportsNet Chicago, Comcast SportsNet West (Sacramento), Comcast SportsNet NorthWest, Comcast SportsNet New England (Boston), Bay Area SportsNet (San Francisco) and Comcast MountainWest Sports Network. These networks earn revenue through the sale of advertising time and receive programming license fees paid by MVPDs. Other revenues increased in 2007 as a result of our regional sports network acquisitions and our newly acquired cable systems. Other revenues increased in 2006 as a result of the addition of our newly acquired cable systems. Franchise Fees. Our franchise fee revenues represent the pass through to our subscribers of the fees required to be paid to state and local franchising authorities. Under the terms of our franchise agreements, we are generally required to pay an amount based on our gross video revenues to the local franchising authority. The increases in franchise fees collected from our cable subscribers are primarily a result of the increases in our revenues on which the fees apply. Total Cable Segment Revenue. As a result of the growth in revenues from our products and services, we have been able to increase our total average monthly revenue per video subscriber (including all Cable segment revenue sources) from approximately $82 in 2005 to approximately $95 in 2006 and to approximately $102 in 2007. Cable Segment Expenses We continue to focus on controlling the growth of expenses. Our operating margins (operating income before depreciation and 25 Comcast 2007 Annual Report on Form 10 K Table of Contents amortization as a percentage of revenue) for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 were 40.7%, 40.2% and 39.8%, respectively. Cable Segment Operating Expenses. Cable programming expenses, our largest expense, are the fees we pay to programming networks to license the programming we package, offer and distribute to our cable subscribers. These expenses are affected by changes in the rates charged by programming networks, the number of subscribers and the programming options we offer to subscribers. Cable programming expenses increased to $5.8 billion in 2007 from $4.9 billion in 2006 and $4.1 billion in 2005 as a result of increases in rates and the newly acquired cable systems. We anticipate our cable programming expenses will increase in the future, as the fees charged by programming networks increase and as we provide additional channels and video on demand programming options to our subscribers. Other operating expenses increased to $4.6 billion in 2007, from $3.6 billion in 2006 and $2.9 billion in 2005. In 2007 and 2006, our newly acquired cable systems contributed approximately $950 million and $650 million, respectively, to the increases in other operating expenses. The remaining increases in 2007 and 2006 were primarily a result of the growth in the number of subscribers, which required additional personnel to handle service calls and provide in house customer support, and costs associated with the delivery of those services. Cable Segment Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to approximately $7.0 billion in 2007. In 2007 and 2006, our newly acquired cable systems contributed approximately $450 million and $400 million, respectively, to our increases in Cable segment selling, general and administrative expenses. The remaining increases in 2007 and 2006 were primarily a result of additional employees needed to provide customer and other administrative services, as well as additional marketing costs associated with attracting and retaining subscribers. Programming Segment Overview Our Programming segment consists primarily of our consolidated national programming networks. The table below presents a summary of our most significant consolidated national programming networks: Programming Network ApproximateU.S. Subscribers (in millions) Description E! 82 Pop culture and entertainment related programming The Golf Channel 67 Golf and golf related programming VERSUS 64 Sports and leisure programming G4 55 Gamer lifestyle programming Style 48 Lifestyle related programming We also own interests in MGM (20%), iN DEMAND (51%), TV One (33%), PBS KIDS Sprout (40%), and FEARnet (33%).

For 2007, 2006 and 2005, approximately 11% to 13% of our Programming segment revenues were generated from our Cable segment. These amounts are eliminated in our consolidated financial statements but are included in the amounts presented above. Programming Segment Operating, Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses consist mainly of the cost of producing television programs and live events, the purchase of programming rights, the marketing and promotion of our programming networks, and administrative costs. Programming expenses for 2007, 2006 and 2005 increased as a result of an increase in the production of, and programming rights costs for, new and live event programming for our programming networks, including the PGA Tour on The Golf Channel and the NHL on VERSUS, as well as a corresponding increase in marketing expenses for this programming. We have invested and expect to continue to invest in new and live event programming that will cause our Programming segment expenses to increase in the future. Consolidated Other Income (Expense) Items Year ended December 31 (in millions) 2007 2006 2005 Interest expense $ (2,289 ) $ (2,064 ) $ (1,795 ) Investment income (loss), net 601 990 89 Equity in net (losses) income of affiliates, net (63 ) (124 ) (42 ) Other income (expense) 522 173 (53 ) Total $ (1,229 ) $ (1,025 ) $ (1,801 ) Interest Expense The increases in interest expense for 2007 from 2006 were primarily the result of increases in our average debt outstanding. The increase for 2006 from 2005 was primarily the result of an increase in our average debt outstanding and higher interest rates on our variable rate debt, as well as $57 million of gains recognized in 2005 in connection with the early extinguishment of some of our debt facilities. Investment Income (Loss), Net The components of investment income (loss), net for 2007, 2006 and 2005 are presented in a table in Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements. In connection with the Adelphia and Time Warner transactions, we recognized investment income of approximately $646 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. We have entered into derivative financial instruments that we account for at fair value and which economically hedge the market price fluctuations in the common stock of substantially all of our investments accounted for as trading securities. The differences between the unrealized gains (losses) on trading securities and the mark to market adjustments on derivatives related to trading securities, as presented in the table in Note 6, result from one or more of the following: we did not maintain an economic hedge for our entire investment in the security during some or all of the period there were changes in the derivative valuation assumptions such as interest rates, volatility and dividend policy the magnitude of the difference between the market price of the underlying security to which the derivative relates and the strike price of the derivative the change in the time value component of the derivative value during the period the security to which the derivative relates changed due to a corporate reorganization of the issuing company to a security with a different volatility rate Equity in Net (Losses) Income of Affiliates, Net The decrease in equity in net losses of affiliates for 2007 from 2006 and the increase in equity in net losses of affiliates for 2006 from 2005 were primarily a result of $59 million of other than temporary impairment charges recognized in 2006. Other Income (Expense) Other income for 2007 consists primarily of a gain of approximately $500 million on the sale of our 50% interest in the Kansas City Asset Pool in connection with the Houston transaction. Other income for 2006 consists primarily of $170 million of gains on the sales of investment assets. Other expense for 2005 consists primarily of a $170 million payment representing our share of the settlement amount related to certain of AT&Ts litigation with At Home, partially offset by a $24 million gain on the exchange of one of our equity method investments and $62 million of gains recognized on the sale or restructuring of investment assets. 27 Comcast 2007 Annual Report on Form 10 K Table of Contents Income Tax Expense Our effective income tax rate for 2007, 2006 and 2005 was 41.4%, 37.5% and 50.7%, respectively. Income tax expense reflects an effective income tax rate that differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to state income taxes and interest on uncertain tax positions. Our tax rate in 2006 was impacted by adjustments to uncertain tax positions, primarily related to the favorable resolution of issues and revised estimates of the outcome of unresolved issues with various taxing authorities. Our tax rate in 2005 was impacted by taxes associated with other investments. We expect our 2008 annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 40% to 45%. Discontinued Operations The operating results of our previously owned cable systems located in Los Angeles, Dallas and Cleveland, which were reported as discontinued operations for 2006 and 2005, included seven months of operations in 2006 because the closing date of the transaction was July 31, 2006. For 2005, results include 12 months of operations. As a result of the exchange of these systems in the Adelphia and Time Warner transactions, we recognized a gain of $195 million, net of tax of $541 million ( see Note 5) in 2006. The effective tax rate on the gain is higher than the federal statutory rate primarily as a result of the nondeductible amounts attributed to goodwill. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our businesses generate significant cash flow from operating activities. The proceeds from monetizing our nonstrategic investments have also provided us with a significant source of cash flow. We believe that we will be able to meet our current and long term liquidity and capital requirements, including fixed charges, through our cash flow from operating activities, existing cash, cash equivalents and investments; through available borrowings under our existing credit facilities; and through our ability to obtain future external financing. We anticipate continuing to use a substantial portion of our cash flow to fund our capital expenditures, invest in business opportunities and return capital to investors, through stock repurchases and dividends. The credit markets have been and continue to be volatile due primarily to difficulties in the residential mortgage markets as well as the slowing economy. We do not hold any cash equivalents or short term investments whose liquidity or value has been affected by these negative trends in the financial markets.

Proceeds from sales of trading securities are presented within cash provided by operating activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. These amounts are not related to operations but result from the sales of investments. The increase in interest payments from 2005 to 2007 was primarily the result of an increase in our average debt outstanding. The increase in tax payments from 2005 to 2007 was primarily the result of the effects of increases in income, sales of investments and the settlement of federal and state tax audits. Financing Activities Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities consists primarily of our proceeds from borrowings offset by our debt repayments and our repurchases of our Class A and Class A Special common stock. We have made, and may from time to time in the future make, optional repayments on our debt obligations, which may include repurchases of our outstanding public notes and debentures, depending on various factors, such as market conditions. See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our financing activities, including details of our debt repayments and borrowings. Long Term Debt Borrowings, Repayments and Redemptions Proceeds from borrowings fluctuates from year to year based on the levels of acquisitions and scheduled debt repayments. The higher level of borrowings in 2006 was primarily a result of the Houston transaction, the Adelphia and Time Warner transactions, the acquisition of the remaining portion of E! Entertainment Television that we did not already own and our investment in SpectrumCo, LLC (SpectrumCo). Available Borrowings Under Credit Facilities We traditionally maintain significant availability under lines of credit and our commercial paper program to meet our short term liquidity requirements. As of December 31, 2007, amounts available under these facilities totaled approximately $4.370 billion. In January 2008, we entered into an amended and restated revolving bank credit facility which may be used for general corporate purposes. This amendment increased the size of the credit facility from $5.0 billion to $7.0 billion and extended the maturity of the loan commitment from October 2010 to January 2013. Debt Covenants We and our cable subsidiaries that have provided guarantees ( see Note 17) are subject to the covenants and restrictions set forth in the indentures governing our public debt securities and in the credit agreements governing our bank credit facilities. We and the guarantors are in compliance with the covenants, and we believe that neither the covenants nor the restrictions in our indentures or loan documents will limit our ability to operate our business or raise additional capital. Our credit facilities covenants are tested on an ongoing basis. The only financial covenant in our $5.0 billion revolving credit facility and our amended and restated $7.0 billion revolving credit facility relates to leverage (ratio of debt to operating income before depreciation and amortization). As of December 31, 2007, we met our financial covenant in our $5 billion revolving credit facility by a significant margin. Our ability to comply with this financial covenant in the future does not depend on further debt reduction or on improved operating results. Share Repurchase Program and Dividends In October 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a $7 billion addition to our existing share repurchase program. As of December 31, 2007, we had approximately $6.9 billion of availability remaining under the share repurchase authorization, which we intend to fully utilize by the end of 2009, subject to market conditions. On February 13, 2008 our Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.0625 per share, which will be payable in April 2008. This represents the first payment of a planned annual dividend of $0.25 per share. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities consisted primarily of cash paid for capital expenditures, acquisitions and investments, partially offset by proceeds from sales and restructurings of investments. 29 Comcast 2007 Annual Report on Form 10 K Table of Contents Capital Expenditures Our most significant recurring investing activity has been capital expenditures in our Cable segment and we expect that this will continue in the future. A significant portion of our capital expenditures is based on the level of growth and the technology being deployed. The following table summarizes the capital expenditures we incurred in our Cable segment from 2005 through 2007: Year ended December 31 (in millions) 2007 2006 2005 Customer premise equipment(a) $ 3,164 $ 2,321 $ 1,769 Scalable infrastructure(b) 1,014 906 824 Line extensions(c) 352 275 287 Support capital(d) 792 435 279 Upgrades(e) 520 307 250 Commercial(f) 151 Total $ 5,993 $ 4,244 $ 3,409 (a) Customer premise equipment includes costs incurred to connect our services at the subscribers home. The equipment deployed typically includes standard digital converters, HD converters, digital video recorders, remote controls, high speed Internet modems and digital phone modems. Customer premise equipment also includes the cost of installing such equipment for new subscribers as well as the material and labor cost incurred to install the cable that connects a subscribers dwelling to the network. (b) Scalable infrastructure includes costs incurred to secure growth in subscribers, revenue units or to provide service enhancements, other than those related to customer premise equipment. Such equipment includes equipment that controls signal reception, processing and transmission throughout our distribution network as well as equipment that controls and communicates with the customer premise equipment residing within a subscribers home. Also included in scalable infrastructure is certain equipment necessary for content aggregation and distribution (video on demand equipment) and equipment necessary to provide certain video, high speed Internet and digital phone service features (voice mail, e mail, etc.). (c) Line extensions include the costs of extending our distribution network into new service areas. These costs typically include network design, purchase and installation of fiber optic and coaxial cable, and certain electronic equipment. (d) Support capital includes costs associated with the replacement or enhancement of non network assets due to technical or physical obsolescence and wear out. These costs typically include vehicles, computer and office equipment, furniture and fixtures, tools and test equipment. (e) Upgrades include costs to enhance or replace existing fiber/coaxial cable networks, including recurring betterments. (f) Commercial includes costs incurred related to the rollout of our services to small and medium sized businesses. Such equipment typically includes high speed Internet modems and phone modems and the costs of installing such equipment for new customers as well as materials and labor incurred to install the cable that connects a customers business to the closest point of the main distribution network. Cable capital expenditures increased 41.2% from 2006 to 2007 and 24.5% from 2005 to 2006 primarily as a result of the rollout of our digital phone service and an increase in demand for advanced set top boxes (including DVR and HDTV) and high speed Internet modems. These increases were accelerated by the introduction of our triple play bundle in late 2005 and as a result of regulatory changes in 2007. We also incurred additional capital expenditures in our newly acquired cable systems. In anticipation of this growth, we have continued to improve the capacity and reliability of our network in order to handle the additional volume and advanced services. We have also expanded our service area through line extensions and now pass more than 48 million homes. The amounts of capital expenditures in our Programming segment and our other business activities have not been significant. Consolidated 2007 capital expenditures include approximately $110 million related to the consolidation of offices in Pennsylvania and relocation of our corporate headquarters. The amounts of our capital expenditures for 2008 and for subsequent years will depend on numerous factors, including acquisitions, competition, changes in technology, regulatory changes and the timing and rate of deployment of new services. Acquisitions In 2007, acquisitions were primarily related to our acquisitions of Patriot Media, Sports Channel New England, Bay Area SportsNet and Fandango. In 2006, acquisitions were primarily related to the Adelphia and Time Warner transactions, the acquisition of the cable systems of Susquehanna Communications and the acquisition of our additional interest in E! Entertainment Television. Proceeds from Sale of Investments In 2007 and 2006, proceeds from the sales and restructurings of investments were primarily related to the disposition of our ownership interests in Time Warner Inc. Purchases of Investments In 2007, purchases of investments consisted primarily of our additional investment in Insight Midwest, L.P. and our purchase of available for sale securities. In 2006, purchases of investments were primarily related to the purchase of our interest in SpectrumCo and to our additional investment in Texas and Kansas City Cable Partners. Comcast 2007 Annual Report on Form 10 K 30 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations Our unconditional contractual obligations as of December 31, 2007, which consist primarily of our debt obligations and the associated payments due in future periods, are presented in the table below: Payments Due by Period (in millions) Total Year 1 Years 23 Years 45 More than5 years Debt obligations(a) $ 31,251 $ 1,479 $ 3,718 $ 2,638 $ 23,416 Capital lease obligations 72 16 35 6 15 Operating lease obligations 2,016 323 521 337 835 Purchase obligations(b) 13,382 3,057 3,273 2,671 4,381 Other long term liabilities reflected on the balance sheet: Acquisition related obligations(c) 231 149 65 9 8 Other long term obligations(d) 4,448 153 378 246 3,671 Total $ 51,400 $ 5,177 $ 7,990 $ 5,907 $ 32,326 Refer to Note 8 (long term debt) and Note 14 (commitments) to our consolidated financial statements. (a) Excludes interest payments. (b) Purchase obligations consist of agreements to purchase goods and services that are legally binding on us and specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased and price provisions. Our purchase obligations are primarily related to our Cable segment, including contracts with programming networks, customer premise equipment manufacturers, communication vendors, other cable operators for which we provide advertising sales representation, and other contracts entered into in the normal course of business. We also have purchase obligations through Comcast Spectacor for the players and coaches of our professional sports teams. We did not include contracts with immaterial future commitments. (c) Acquisition related obligations consist primarily of costs related to exiting contractual obligations and other assumed contractual obligations of the acquired entity. (d) Other long term obligations consist primarily of our prepaid forward sales transactions of equity securities we hold; subsidiary preferred shares; effectively settled tax positions and related interest; deferred compensation obligations; pension, post retirement and post employment benefit obligations; and programming rights payable under license agreements. Reserves for uncertain tax positions of approximately $1.5 billion are not included in the table above. We have not yet entered into substantive settlement discussions with taxing authorities and therefore cannot reasonably estimate the amounts or timing of payments related to any such positions. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any significant off balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. Critical Accounting Judgments and Estimates The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and contingent liabilities. We base our judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making estimates about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe our judgments and related estimates associated with the valuation and impairment testing of our cable franchise rights and the accounting for income taxes and legal contingencies are critical in the preparation of our financial statements. Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting judgments and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors, and the Audit Committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to them, which are presented below. Refer to Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our accounting policies with respect to these and other items. 31 Comcast 2007 Annual Report on Form 10 K Table of Contents Valuation and Impairment Tests of Cable Franchise Rights Our largest asset, our cable franchise rights, results from agreements we have with state and local governments that allow us to construct and operate a cable business within a specified geographic area. The value of a franchise is derived from the economic benefits we receive from the right to solicit new subscribers and to market new services, such as additional digital cable services and high speed Internet and phone services, in a particular service area. The amounts we record for cable franchise rights are primarily the result of cable system acquisitions. Typically when we acquire a cable system, the most significant asset we record is the value of the cable franchise rights. Often these cable system acquisitions include multiple franchise areas. We currently serve approximately 6,000 franchise areas in the United States. We have concluded that our cable franchise rights have an indefinite useful life since there are no legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other factors which limit the period over which these rights will contribute to our cash flows. Accordingly, we do not amortize our cable franchise rights but assess the carrying value of our cable franchise rights annually, or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may exceed its fair value (the impairment test), in accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (SFAS No. 142). We estimate the fair value of our cable franchise rights primarily based on a discounted cash flow analysis that involves significant judgment in developing individual assumptions, including long term growth rate and discount rate assumptions. If we determine the value of our cable franchise rights is less than the carrying amount, we recognize an impairment charge for the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of the assets. For the purpose of our impairment tests, we have grouped the recorded values of our various cable franchise rights into our five cable divisions or units of account. We evaluate the unit of account periodically to ensure our impairment tests are performed at an appropriate level. Before 2007, we used our cable regions as the unit of account. Frequent reorganizations of our regions and further management centralization of our cable operations led us to conclude that our cable divisions are more reflective of how we manage and operate the assets and, therefore, are the appropriate unit of account. Consequently, effective April 1, 2007 (our annual impairment test date), we changed the unit of account to five cable divisions from 29 cable regions. We tested for impairment at the region level before combining our regions into divisions to confirm that no impairment existed before the change. We have not recorded any significant impairment charges as a result of our impairment tests. A future change in the unit of account could result in recognition of an impairment charge. We could record impairment charges in the future if there are long term changes in market conditions, expected future operating results or federal or state regulations that prevent us from recovering the carrying value of these cable franchise rights. For example, increased competition and a slowdown in the economy impacted our operating results during the second half of 2007. Assumptions made about the continuation of these market conditions on a longer term basis could impact the valuations to be used in the April 1, 2008 annual impairment test and result in a reduction of fair values from those determined in the April 1, 2007 annual impairment test. Such assumptions and fair values will not be determined until the annual impairment test is performed. The following table illustrates the impairment charge related to our various cable divisions that would have occurred had the hypothetical reductions in fair value existed at our last annual impairment test date. Percent Hypothetical Reduction in Fair Value andRelated Impairment Charge (in millions) 10% 15% 20% 25% Eastern Division $ $ $ $ (537 ) Midwest Division (102 ) (675 ) NorthCentral Division (287 ) (955 ) (1,623 ) Southern Division West Division (438 ) (1,268 ) $ $ (287 ) $ (1,495 ) $ (4,103 ) Income Taxes Our provision for income taxes is based on our current period income, changes in deferred income tax assets and liabilities, income tax rates, changes in estimates of our uncertain tax positions and tax planning opportunities available in the jurisdictions in which we operate. We prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations, and we record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations. We adopted the provisions of FIN 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48) effective January 1, 2007. We evaluate our tax positions using the recognition threshold and measurement attribute in accordance with this interpretation. From time to time, we engage in transactions in which the tax consequences may be subject to uncertainty. Examples of such transactions include business acquisitions and disposals, including consideration paid or received in connection with such transactions, and certain financing transactions. Significant judgment is required in assessing and estimating the tax consequences of these transactions. We determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of Comcast 2007 Annual Report on Form 10 K 32 Table of Contents the position. In evaluating whether a tax position has met the more likely than not recognition threshold, we presume that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. A tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to be recognized in the financial statements. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We adjust our estimates periodically because of ongoing examinations by and settlements with the various taxing authorities, as well as changes in tax laws, regulations and precedent. The effects on our financial statements of income tax uncertainties that arise in connection with business combinations and those associated with entities acquired in business combinations are discussed in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements. We believe that adequate accruals have been made for income taxes. Differences between the estimated and actual amounts determined upon ultimate resolution, individually or in the aggregate, are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position but could possibly be material to our consolidated results of operations or cash flow for any one period. Legal Contingencies We are subject to legal, regulatory and other proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of our business and, in certain cases, those that we assume from an acquired entity in a business combination. We record an estimated liability for those proceedings and claims arising in the ordinary course of business based upon the probable and reasonably estimable criteria contained in SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies. We review outstanding claims with internal as well as external counsel to assess the probability and the estimates of loss. We reassess the risk of loss as new information becomes available, and we adjust liabilities as appropriate. The actual cost of resolving a claim may be substantially different from the amount of the liability recorded. Differences between the estimated and actual amounts determined upon ultimate resolution, individually or in the aggregate, are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position but could possibly be material to our consolidated results of operations or cash flow for any one period. 33 Comcast 2007 Annual Report on Form 10 K Table of Contents Item 7A: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest Rate Risk Management We maintain a mix of fixed rate and variable rate debt. Approximately 95% of our total debt of $31.3 billion is at fixed rates with the remaining debt at variable rates. We are exposed to the market risk of adverse changes in interest rates. In order to manage the cost and volatility relating to the interest cost of our outstanding debt, we enter into various interest rate risk management derivative transactions in accordance with our policies. We monitor our interest rate risk exposures using techniques that include market value and sensitivity analyses. We do not engage in any speculative derivative transactions, and we are not a party to any leveraged derivative instruments. We manage the credit risks associated with our derivative financial instruments through the evaluation and monitoring of the creditworthiness of the counterparties. Although we may be exposed to losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties, we do not expect such losses, if any, to be significant. Our interest rate derivative financial instruments, which can include swaps, rate locks, caps and collars, represent an integral part of our interest rate risk management program. Our interest rate derivative financial instruments reduced the portion of our total debt at fixed rates from 95% to 85% as of December 31, 2007. The effect of our interest rate derivative financial instruments increased our interest expense by approximately $43 million and $39 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively, and decreased our interest expense by approximately $16 million in 2005. Interest rate risk management instruments may have a significant effect on our interest expense in the future. The table below summarizes the fair values and contract terms of financial instruments subject to interest rate risk maintained by us as of December 31, 2007: (in millions) 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Total Fair Value12/31/07 Debt Fixed Rate $ 1,484 $ 1,022 $ 1,163 $ 1,759 $ 843 $ 23,431 $ 29,702 $ 30,949 Average Interest Rate 7.2 % 7.3 % 5.7 % 6.3 % 9.2 % 7.1 % 7.0 % Variable Rate $ 11 $ 1,258 $ 310 $ 13 $ 29 $ $ 1,621 $ 1,616 Average Interest Rate 5.0 % 3.8 % 5.0 % 5.4 % 5.6 % % 4.1 % Interest Rate Instruments Fixed to Variable Swaps $ 600 $ 750 $ 200 $ 750 $ $ 900 $ 3,200 $ 17 Average Pay Rate 7.4 % 6.7 % 4.8 % 5.7 % % 4.8 % 5.9 % Average Receive Rate 6.2 % 6.9 % 5.9 % 5.5 % % 5.3 % 5.9 % Comcast 2007 Annual Report on Form 10 K 34 Table of Contents We use the notional amounts on the instruments to calculate the interest to be paid or received. The notional amounts do not represent the amount of our exposure to credit loss. The estimated fair value approximates the payments necessary or proceeds to be received to settle the outstanding contracts. We estimate interest rates on variable debt and swaps using the average implied forward London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) for the year of maturity based on the yield curve in effect on December 31, 2007, plus the applicable margin in effect on December 31, 2007. As a matter of practice, we typically do not structure our financial contracts to include credit ratings based triggers that could affect our liquidity. In the ordinary course of business, some of our swaps could be subject to termination provisions if we do not maintain investment grade credit ratings. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, the estimated fair value of those swaps was a liability of $3 million and $60 million, respectively. The amount to be paid or received upon termination, if any, would be based on the fair value of the outstanding contracts at that time. Equity Price Risk Management We are exposed to the market risk of changes in the equity prices of our investments in marketable securities. We enter into various derivative transactions in accordance with our policies to manage the volatility relating to these exposures. Through market value and sensitivity analyses, we monitor our equity price risk exposures to ensure that the instruments are matched with the underlying assets or liabilities, reduce our risks relating to equity prices and maintain a high correlation to the risk inherent in the hedged item. To limit our exposure to and benefits from price fluctuations in the common stock of some of our investments, we use equity derivative financial instruments. These derivative financial instruments, which are accounted for at fair value, include equity collar agreements, prepaid forward sales agreements and indexed or exchangeable debt instruments. Except as described above in Investment Income (Loss), Net, the changes in the fair value of the investments that we accounted for as trading securities were substantially offset by the changes in the fair values of the equity derivative financial instruments. Refer to Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our accounting policies for derivative financial instruments and to Note 6 and Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for discussions of our derivative financial instruments. 35 Comcast 2007 Annual Report on Form 10 K Table of Contents
