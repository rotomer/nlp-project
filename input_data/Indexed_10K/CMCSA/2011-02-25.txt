Item 7: Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Introduction and Overview We are a leading provider of video, high speed Internet and phone services (cable services) to residential and business customers in the United States. On January 28, 2011, we closed our transaction with General Electric Company (GE) in which we acquired control of the businesses of NBCUniversal, Inc. (now named NBCUniversal Media, LLC (NBCUniversal)), a leading media and entertainment company that develops, produces and distributes entertainment, news, sports and other content to global audiences. Further details about the transaction are presented below under the heading NBCUniversal Transaction. Our Cable segment generates revenue primarily from subscriptions to our cable services, which we market individually and in packages. In addition to cable services, other Cable segment revenue sources include the sale of advertising and, as of December 31, 2010, the operations of our regional sports and news networks. As of December 31, 2010, our cable systems served approximately 22.8 million video customers, 17.0 million high speed Internet customers and 8.6 million phone customers and passed more than 51 million homes and businesses in 39 states and the District of Columbia. In 2010, our Cable segment generated approximately 94% of our consolidated revenue. Our video services range from a limited analog service to a full digital service with access to hundreds of channels, including premium and pay per view channels, On Demand, music channels, and an interactive, on screen program guide. Digital video customers also may subscribe to our advanced services, which consist of high definition television (HDTV) and digital video recorder (DVR), and access certain of our programming online based on their level of video service. Our high speed Internet services provide Internet access at downstream speeds of up to 105 Mbps, depending on the service selected and subject to geographic market availability. Our phone services provide local and long distance calling and other features. We also offer our cable services to small and medium sized businesses (business services). As of December 31, 2010, our Programming segment consisted primarily of our consolidated national programming networks, E!, Golf Channel, VERSUS, Style and G4. During 2010, our Programming segment generated consolidated revenue of $1.7 billion. Revenue from our Programming segment is generated primarily from monthly per subscriber license fees paid by multichannel video providers, the sale of advertising and the licensing of our programming internationally. As of December 31, 2010, our other business interests included Comcast Interactive Media and Comcast Spectacor. Comcast Interactive Media develops and operates our Internet businesses, including Comcast.net, Xfinity TV, Fandango, Plaxo and DailyCandy. Revenue from Comcast Interactive Media is generated primarily from the sale of advertising. Comcast Spectacor owns two professional sports teams, the Philadelphia 76ers and the Philadelphia Flyers, and a large, multipurpose arena in Philadelphia, the Wells Fargo Center, and provides facilities management and food services for sporting events, concerts and other events. Comcast Interactive Media, Comcast Spectacor and all other consolidated businesses not included in our Cable or Programming segments were included in Corporate and Other activities as of December 31, 2010. We operate our businesses in an intensely competitive environment. Competition for the cable services we offer primarily includes direct broadcast satellite (DBS) operators and phone companies. In 2010, our competitors for cable services continued to add features and adopt aggressive pricing and packaging for services that are comparable to the services we offer. A substantial portion of our Cable segment revenue comes from customers whose spending patterns may be affected by prevailing economic conditions. 2010 Developments In addition to the NBCUniversal transaction discussed below, the following are the more significant developments in our businesses during 2010: an increase in consolidated revenue of 6.1% to $37.9 billion and an increase in consolidated operating income of 10.6% to $8.0 billion an increase in Cable segment revenue of 5.6% to $35.8 billion and an increase in Cable segment operating income before depreciation and amortization of 6.4% to $14.6 billion an increase in Programming segment revenue of 11.8% to $1.7 billion and an increase in Programming segment operating income before depreciation and amortization of 20.6% to $469 million the addition of 1.1 million high speed Internet customers and 988,000 phone customers; and a decrease of 757,000 video customers a reduction in Cable segment capital expenditures of 3.8% to $4.8 billion the continued investment in our cable distribution system, including the ongoing transition from analog to digital transmission of the channels we distribute (our all digital conversion); the continued deployment of DOCSIS 3.0 wideband technology; expanding the offering of certain cable network programming to Comcast 2010 Annual Report on Form 10 K 36 Table of Contents our customers online; and the continued deployment of 4G wireless high speed Internet service in certain markets an increase in our total debt outstanding of $2.3 billion to $31.4 billion, which is primarily due to the issuance of $3.4 billion aggregate principal amount of notes, the proceeds of which were primarily used to repay debt at its maturity in 2010 and finance the NBCUniversal transaction in 2011 the repurchase of approximately 70 million shares of our Class A Special common stock under our share repurchase authorization for approximately $1.2 billion the declaration and payment of dividends of $1.1 billion NBCUniversal Transaction On January 28, 2011, we closed our transaction with GE to form a new company named NBCUniversal, LLC (NBCUniversal Holdings). We now control and own 51% of NBCUniversal Holdings, and GE owns the remaining 49%. As part of the NBCUniversal transaction, GE contributed the historical businesses of NBCUniversal, which is now a wholly owned subsidiary of NBCUniversal Holdings. The NBCUniversal contributed businesses include its national cable programming networks, the NBC network and its owned NBC affiliated local television stations, the Telemundo network and its owned Telemundo affiliated local television stations, Universal Pictures filmed entertainment, the Universal Studios Hollywood theme park and other related assets. We contributed our national cable programming networks, our regional sports and news networks, certain of our Internet businesses, including DailyCandy and Fandango and other related assets (Comcast Content Business). In addition to contributing the Comcast Content Business to NBCUniversal, we made a cash payment of $6.2 billion at the closing. As a result of the NBCUniversal transaction, beginning in 2011 we expect to present five reportable segments, Cable Distribution (currently presented in our Cable segment), Cable Networks, Broadcast Networks, Filmed Entertainment and Theme Parks. Our Programming segment, our regional sports and news networks (currently presented in our Cable segment) and our contributed Comcast Interactive Media businesses (currently in Corporate and Other) will be presented with NBCUniversals businesses in the new segments. The businesses of Comcast Interactive Media that were not contributed to NBCUniversal will be included in our Cable Distribution segment. In connection with the NBCUniversal transaction, we have incurred incremental expenses related to legal, accounting and valuation services, which are reflected in operating, selling, general and administrative expenses. We also incurred certain financing costs and other shared costs with GE associated with debt facilities that were entered into in December 2009 and with the issuance of NBCUniversals senior notes in 2010, which are reflected in other income (expense) and interest expense. The table below presents the amounts related to these expenses included in our consolidated statement of operations. Year ended December 31, 2010 (in millions) Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses $ 80 Other expense $ 129 Interest expense $ 7 In connection with the NBCUniversal transaction, NBCUniversal issued $9.1 billion of senior debt securities with maturities ranging from 2014 to 2041 and repaid approximately $1.7 billion of existing debt during 2010. Immediately prior to the closing, NBCUniversal distributed approximately $7.4 billion to GE. Under the terms of the operating agreement of NBCUniversal Holdings, during the six month period beginning on July 28, 2014 GE has the right to cause NBCUniversal Holdings to redeem half of GEs interest in NBCUniversal Holdings, and during the six month period beginning January 28, 2018, GE has the right to cause NBCUniversal Holdings to redeem GEs remaining interest, if any. If GE exercises its first redemption right, we have the immediate right to purchase the remainder of GEs interest. If GE does not exercise its first redemption right, during the six month period beginning on January 28, 2016, we have the right to purchase half of GEs interest in NBCUniversal Holdings. During the six month period beginning January 28, 2019, we have the right to purchase GEs remaining interest, if any, in NBCUniversal Holdings. The purchase price to be paid in connection with any purchase described in this paragraph will be equal to the ownership percentage being purchased multiplied by an amount equal to 120% of the fully distributed public market trading value of NBCUniversal Holdings (determined pursuant to an appraisal process if NBCUniversal Holdings is not then publicly traded), less 50% of an amount (not less than zero) equal to the excess of 120% of the fully distributed public market trading value over $28.4 billion. Subject to various limitations, we are committed to fund up to $2.875 billion in cash or our common stock for each of the two redemptions (up to an aggregate of $5.75 billion, with amounts not used in the first redemption to be available for the second redemption) to the extent NBCUniversal Holdings cannot fund the redemptions. Until July 28, 2014, GE may not directly or indirectly transfer its interest in NBCUniversal Holdings. Thereafter, GE may transfer its interest to a third party, subject to our right of first offer. The right of first offer would permit us to purchase all, but not less than all, of the interests proposed to be transferred. In the event that GE makes a registration request in accordance with certain registration rights that are granted to it under the agreement, we will have the right to purchase, for cash at the market value (determined pursuant to an appraisal process if NBCUniversal Holdings is not then publicly traded), all of GEs interest in NBCUniversal Holdings that GE is seeking to register. 37 Comcast 2010 Annual Report on Form 10 K Table of Contents Consolidated Operating Results Year ended December 31 (in millions) 2010 2009 2008 % Change 2009 to 2010 % Change 2008 to 2009 Revenue $ 37,937 $ 35,756 $ 34,423 6.1 % 3.9 % Costs and expenses: Operating, selling, general and administrative (excluding depreciation and amortization) 23,341 22,042 21,291 5.9 % 3.5 % Depreciation 5,539 5,483 5,457 1.0 % 0.5 % Amortization 1,077 1,017 943 5.9 % 7.8 % Operating income 7,980 7,214 6,732 10.6 % 7.2 % Other income (expense) items, net (1,876 ) (2,108 ) (2,674 ) (11.0 )% (21.2 )% Income before income taxes 6,104 5,106 4,058 19.5 % 25.8 % Income tax expense (2,436 ) (1,478 ) (1,533 ) 64.8 % (3.6 )% Net income from consolidated operations 3,668 3,628 2,525 1.1 % 43.7 % Net (income) loss attributable to noncontrolling interests (33 ) 10 22 NM (54.5 )% Net income attributable to Comcast Corporation $ 3,635 $ 3,638 $ 2,547 (0.1 )% 42.8 % All percentages are calculated based on actual amounts.

The remaining changes related to our other business activities, primarily Comcast Interactive Media and Comcast Spectacor. Cable segment revenue and Programming segment revenue are discussed separately under the heading Segment Operating Results. Consolidated Operating, Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Our Cable and Programming segments accounted for substantially all of the increases in consolidated operating, selling, general and administrative expenses for 2010 and 2009. The remaining changes related to our other business activities, primarily Comcast Interactive Media and Comcast Spectacor, and costs associated with the NBCUniversal transaction. Cable segment and Program ming segment operating, selling, general and administrative expenses are discussed separately under the heading Segment Operating Results. Consolidated Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation expense for 2010 and 2009 remained relatively stable primarily due to decreases in capital spending in recent years. The increase in amortization expense for 2010 was primarily related to goodwill impairment charges taken in our Programming segment and in Corporate and Other totaling $76 million. The increase in amortization expense for 2009 was primarily due to an increase in software intangibles. Segment Operating Results Our segment operating results are presented based on how we assess operating performance and internally report financial information. To measure the performance of our operating segments, we use operating income (loss) before depreciation and amortization, excluding impairments related to fixed and intangible assets, and gains or losses from the sale of assets, if any. This measure eliminates the significant level of noncash depreciation and amortization expense that results from the capital intensive nature of our businesses and from intangible assets recognized in business combinations. Additionally, it is unaffected by our capital structure or investment activities. We use this measure to evaluate our consolidated operating performance and the operating performance of our operating segments and to allocate resources and capital to our operating segments. It is also a significant performance measure in our annual incentive compensation programs. Comcast 2010 Annual Report on Form 10 K 38 Table of Contents We believe that this measure is useful to investors because it is one of the bases for comparing our operating performance with that of other companies in our industries, although our measure may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other companies. Because we use this metric to measure our segment profit or loss, we reconcile it to operating income, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP) in the business segment footnote to our consolidated financial statements (see Note 19 to our consolidated financial statements). This measure should not be considered a substitute for operating income (loss), net income (loss) attributable to Comcast Corporation, net cash provided by operating activities, or other measures of performance or liquidity we have reported in accordance with GAAP. Cable Segment Overview Our cable systems allow us to deliver video, high speed Internet and phone services to our residential and business customers. The majority of our Cable segment revenue is generated from subscriptions to these cable services. Customers are billed monthly based on the services and features they receive and the type of equipment they use. Residential customers may generally discontinue service at any time, while business customers may only discontinue service in accordance with the terms of their respective contracts, which typically have 1 to 3 year terms. Our revenue and operating income before depreciation and amortization increased as a result of continued demand for our services (including our bundled and advanced service offerings) and the effects of recent acquisitions, as well as other factors discussed below.

The increases in average monthly total revenue per video customer are primarily due to increases in the number of customers receiving multiple services, rate adjustments, contributions from business services and advertising revenue. Video We offer video services ranging from a limited analog service to a full digital service with access to hundreds of channels, including premium and pay per view channels. As of December 31, 2010, approximately 44% of the homes in the areas we serve subscribed to our video services. As of December 31, 2010, 87% of those video customers subscribed to at least one of our digital video services, compared to 78% and 70% as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Digital video customers may also subscribe to our advanced services, HDTV and DVR. As of December 31, 2010, approximately 51% of our digital video customers subscribed to at least one of our advanced services. Our video revenue continued to grow in 2010 and 2009 due to rate adjustments and customer upgrades to our digital and advanced services, which were offset by declines in the number of analog residential video customers in both years. During 2010 and 2009, the number of video customers decreased by approximately 757,000 and 623,000, respectively. These decreases were primarily due to the loss of customers upon expiration of discounted promotions in 2010, competitive pressures in our service areas and weakness in the economy. We expect further declines in the number of residential video customers during 2011 for similar reasons. During 2010 and 2009, we added or upgraded to our digital video service approximately 1.3 million customers and 1.4 million customers, respectively, including those customers added or upgraded in connection with our all digital conversion. High Speed Internet We offer high speed Internet services with Internet access at downstream speeds of up to 105 Mbps, depending on the service selected and subject to geographic market availability. These services also include our Internet portal, Comcast.net, which provides multiple e mail addresses and online storage, as well as a variety of content and features and enhancements that are designed to take advantage of the speed of the Internet services we provide. Our high speed Internet service for business customers also includes a website hosting service and an online tool that allows customers to share, coordinate and store documents. As of December 31, 2010, 33% of the homes in the areas we serve subscribed to our high speed Internet services, compared to 31% and 30% as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Our high speed Internet revenue increased in 2010 and 2009 primarily due to increases in the number of residential and business customers and, in 2010, due to rate adjustments. During 2010 and 2009, we added approximately 1.1 million and 1.0 million high speed Internet customers, respectively. Phone We offer phone services that provide local and long distance calling and include features such as voice mail, caller ID and call waiting. Our phone service for business customers also includes a business directory listing and the option to add multiple phone lines. As of December 31, 2010, our phone services were available to substantially all of the homes in the areas we serve. As of December 31, 2010, approximately 17% of the homes in the areas we serve subscribed to our phone services, compared to 16% and 14% as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Our phone revenue increased in 2010 and 2009 primarily due to increases in the number of residential and business customers. During 2010 and 2009, we added approximately 988,000 and 1.1 million phone customers, respectively. Advertising As part of our programming license agreements with programming networks, we generally receive an allocation of scheduled advertising time that we may sell to local, regional and national advertisers. In most cases, the available advertising time is sold by our sales force. In some cases, we work with representation firms as an extension of our sales force to sell a portion of the advertising time allocated to us. We also coordinate the advertising sales efforts of other cable operators in some markets, and in some markets we operate advertising interconnects. These interconnects establish a physical, direct link among multiple providers for the sale of regional and national advertising across larger geographic areas than could be provided by a single cable operator. Advertising revenue increased in 2010 primarily due to improvements in the overall television advertising market, including political advertising. Advertising revenue decreased in 2009 primarily due to a decline in the overall television advertising market as a result of weak economic conditions and a decline in political advertising. Other We also generate revenue from our regional sports and news networks, our digital media center, commissions from electronic retailing networks and fees from other services. Our regional sports and news networks include Comcast SportsNet (Philadelphia), Comcast SportsNet Mid Atlantic (Baltimore/Washington), Cable Sports Southeast, Comcast SportsNet Chicago, MountainWest Sports Network, Comcast SportsNet California (Sacramento), Comcast SportsNet New England (Boston), Comcast SportsNet Northwest (Portland), Comcast Sports Southwest (Houston), Comcast SportsNet Bay Area (San Francisco), New England Cable News (Boston), Comcast Network Philadelphia and Comcast Network Mid Atlantic (Baltimore/Washington). These networks generate revenue from program Comcast 2010 Annual Report on Form 10 K 40 Table of Contents ming license agreements with multichannel video providers and through the sale of advertising. These networks were contributed to NBCUniversal at the close of the NBCUniversal transaction on January 28, 2011. Franchise and Other Regulatory Fees Our franchise and other regulatory fee revenue represents the pass through to our customers of the fees required to be paid to federal, state and local authorities. Under the terms of our franchise agreements, we are generally required to pay to the franchising authority an amount based on our gross video revenue. The increases in franchise and other regulatory fees collected from our cable customers in 2010 and 2009 were primarily due to increases in the revenue on which the fees apply. Cable Segment Expenses We continue to focus on controlling the growth of expenses. Our operating margin (operating income before depreciation and amortization as a percentage of revenue) for 2010, 2009 and 2008 was 40.7%, 40.4% and 40.3%, respectively. Cable Segment Operating Expenses Year ended December 31 (in millions) 2010 2009 2008 % Change2009 to 2010 % Change2008 to 2009 Video programming $ 7,438 $ 7,046 $ 6,479 5.6 % 8.8 % Technical labor(a) 2,263 2,295 2,188 (1.4 )% 4.9 % High speed Internet(a) 499 524 526 (4.9 )% (0.4 )% Phone(a) 566 567 699 (0.1 )% (18.8 )% Other(a) 3,498 3,090 2,965 13.3 % 4.2 % Total operating expenses(a) $ 14,264 $ 13,522 $ 12,857 5.5 % 5.2 % (a) Reclassifications have been made to the prior years amounts to conform to classifications used in 2010. Video programming expenses, our largest operating expense, are the fees we pay to programming networks to license the programming we distribute to our video customers. These expenses are affected by changes in the fees charged by programming networks, the number of video customers we serve and the number of channels and programs we provide. Video programming expenses increased in 2010 and 2009, primarily due to increased rates, additional digital customers and additional programming options offered. The increase in 2009 was also due to the introduction of fees incurred for retransmission of broadcast networks. We anticipate that our video programming expenses will continue to increase as the fees charged by programming networks increase, as new fees for retransmission of broadcast networks are incurred, and as we provide additional channels and video on demand programming options to our customers. Technical labor expenses include the internal and external labor costs to complete service call and installation activities in the home as well as network operations, fulfillment and provisioning costs. These expenses remained relatively stable in 2010. Technical labor expenses increased in 2009 primarily due to increases in customer service activity levels, which required additional personnel to handle service calls and provide in home customer support, and due to activity associated with the transition by broadcasters from analog to digital transmission and our all digital conversion. High speed Internet expenses and phone expenses include certain direct costs for providing these services but do not fully reflect the amount of operating expenses that would be necessary to provide these services on a stand alone basis. Other related costs associated with providing these services are generally shared among all our cable services and are not allocated to these items. The decreases in high speed Internet expenses in 2010 and 2009 were primarily due to lower support service costs that were the result of operating efficiencies. Phone expenses in 2010 remained consistent with 2009 expenses despite increases in customer volume. Phone expenses decreased in 2009 primarily due to lower support service costs that were the result of operating efficiencies. Other operating expenses include franchise fees, pole rentals, plant maintenance, vehicle related costs, expenses related to our regional sports and news networks, advertising representation and commission fees, and expenses associated with our business services. These expenses increased in 2010 and 2009 primarily due to increases in advertising activity, the continued expansion of business services, and other service enhancement initiatives.

Customer service expenses increased in 2009 primarily due to activity associated with the transition by broadcasters from analog to digital transmission and our all digital conversion. Marketing expenses increased in 2010 primarily due to an increase in direct sales efforts and additional marketing costs associated with attracting and retaining customers, as well as the launch of our Xfinity brand. Marketing expenses decreased in 2009 primarily due to lower costs and volume for media advertising, partially offset by an increase in direct sales efforts. During 2010, 2009 and 2008, we implemented personnel and cost reduction programs that were focused on streamlining our Cable operations. In connection with these initiatives, we recorded $66 million, $81 million and $126 million of severance costs during 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Administrative and other expenses decreased in 2009 primarily due to the impact of the programs initiated in 2008. Programming Segment Overview As of December 31, 2010, our Programming segment consisted primarily of our consolidated national programming networks. The businesses in our Programming segment were contributed to NBCUniversal at the close of the NBCUniversal transaction on January 28, 2011. The table below presents a summary of our consolidated national programming networks.

In 2010, 2009 and 2008, advertising accounted for approximately 40%, 41% and 43%, respectively, of total Programming revenue. In 2010, 2009 and 2008, approximately 12% of our Programming revenue was generated from our Cable segment. These amounts are eliminated in our consolidated financial statements but are included in the amounts presented above. Programming Segment Operating, Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Programming operating, selling, general and administrative expenses consist mainly of the cost of producing television programs and live events, the purchase of programming rights, the marketing and promotion of our programming networks, and administrative costs. Comcast 2010 Annual Report on Form 10 K 42 Table of Contents Consolidated Other Income (Expense) Items Year ended December 31 (in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Interest expense $ (2,156 ) $ (2,348 ) $ (2,439 ) Investment income (loss), net 288 282 89 Equity in net income (losses) of affiliates, net (141 ) (64 ) (39 ) Other income (expense) 133 22 (285 ) Total $ (1,876 ) $ (2,108 ) $ (2,674 ) Interest Expense The decrease in interest expense for 2010 is primarily due to $175 million of early extinguishment losses, net of early extinguishment gains, associated with the repayment of debt obligations prior to their scheduled maturity that were recognized in 2009 and decreases in interest rates on debt subject to variable interest rate swap agreements. Interest expense decreased in 2009 primarily due to a decrease in our average debt outstanding, decreases in interest rates on debt subject to variable interest rate swap agreements, and decreases in interest rates on our variable rate debt, partially offset by an increase in early extinguishment costs in 2009. During 2009 and 2008, interest expense included $175 million and $64 million, respectively, of early extinguishment losses, net of early extinguishment gains, associated with the repayment of debt obligations prior to their scheduled maturity. Investment Income (Loss), Net The components of investment income (loss), net for 2010, 2009 and 2008 are presented in a table in Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements. We have entered into derivative financial instruments that we account for at fair value and that economically hedge the market price fluctuations in the common stock of all of our investments accounted for as trading securities and substantially all of our investments accounted for as available for sale securities. The differences between the unrealized gains or losses on securities underlying prepaid forward sale agreements and the mark to market adjustments on the derivative component of prepaid forward sale agreements, as presented in a table in Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements, result from one or more of the following: there were unusual changes in the derivative valuation assumptions such as interest rates, volatility and dividend policy the magnitude of the difference between the market price of the underlying security to which the derivative relates and the strike price of the derivative the change in the time value component of the derivative value during the period the security to which the derivative relates changed due to a corporate reorganization of the issuing company to a security with a different volatility rate Other Income (Expense) In connection with the NBCUniversal transaction, we agreed to share with GE certain financing and other costs associated with debt facilities that were entered into in December 2009 and with the issuance of NBCUniversals senior notes in 2010. Other income (expense) for 2010 includes $129 million of expenses for our share of these costs. Other income (expense) for 2010 also includes income of $141 million related to the sale of one of our equity method investments and $108 million related to recoveries in connection with the resolution of a contingency of an acquired company. Other expense for 2008 includes an impairment of approximately $600 million related to our investment in Clearwire LLC partially offset by a gain of approximately $235 million related to the Insight transaction (see Note 5 and Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements). Income Tax Expense Our effective income tax rate for 2010, 2009 and 2008 was 39.9%, 28.9% and 37.8%, respectively. Income tax expense reflects an effective income tax rate that differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to state income taxes and interest on uncertain tax positions. Our 2009 income tax expense was reduced by approximately $566 million primarily due to the recognition of tax benefits associated with settlements and adjustments of uncertain tax positions and related interest and certain subsidiary reorganizations that impacted deferred state income taxes. Our 2008 income tax expense was reduced by approximately $154 million, primarily due to the settlement of an uncertain tax position and the net impact of certain state tax law changes, which primarily affected our deferred income tax liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities, and the future deductibility of certain deferred compensation arrangements. Our income tax expense may in the future continue to be impacted by adjustments to uncertain tax positions and related interest and changes in state tax laws. We expect our 2011 annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 35% to 40% due to the partnership structure of NBCUniversal Holdings. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our businesses generate significant cash flows from operating activities. We believe that we will be able to continue to meet our current and long term liquidity and capital requirements, including fixed charges, through our cash flows from operating activities, existing cash, cash equivalents and investments, available borrowings under our existing credit facilities, and our ability to obtain future external financing. 43 Comcast 2010 Annual Report on Form 10 K Table of Contents We anticipate that we will continue to use a substantial portion of our cash flows to fund our capital expenditures, to invest in business opportunities, to meet our debt repayment obligations and to return capital to shareholders. We traditionally maintain significant availability under our lines of credit and our commercial paper program to meet our short term liquidity requirements. As of December 31, 2010, amounts available under all of our credit facilities totaled approximately $6.4 billion. As of the closing of the NBCUniversal transaction on January 28, 2011, NBCUniversal had a $750 million three year revolving credit facility. We and our Cable subsidiaries that have provided guarantees are subject to the covenants and restrictions set forth in the indentures governing our public debt securities and in the credit agreements governing our bank credit facilities (see Note 22 to our consolidated financial statements). We and the guarantors are in compliance with the covenants, and we believe that neither the covenants nor the restrictions in our indentures or loan documents will limit our ability to operate our businesses or raise additional capital. We test our compliance with our credit facilities covenants on an ongoing basis. The only financial covenant in our $6.8 billion revolving credit facility due 2013 pertains to leverage (ratio of debt to operating income before depreciation and amortization). As of December 31, 2010, we met this financial covenant by a significant margin. We do not expect to have to further reduce debt or improve operating results in order to continue to comply with this financial covenant. In connection with the NBCUniversal transaction, we were required to make a cash payment of $6.2 billion. We funded this payment with cash on hand and $650 million of commercial paper borrowings. The cash paid will be adjusted after the close to reflect final balances of certain working capital accounts and other closing adjustments. The transaction also calls for the payment to GE, in the future, of certain tax benefits to the extent realized by us. Beginning in 2011, we will consolidate $9.1 billion of NBCUniversal senior debt securities with maturities ranging from 2014 to 2041. We do not guarantee NBCUniversals debt obligations. Any future redemptions of GEs stake in NBCUniversal Holdings are expected to be funded primarily through NBCUniversals cash flows from operating activities and its borrowing capacity. If any borrowings by NBCUniversal to fund either of GEs two potential redemptions would result in NBCUniversal exceeding a certain leverage ratio or losing investment grade status or if it cannot otherwise fund such redemptions, we are committed to fund up to $2.875 billion in cash or our common stock for each of the two potential redemptions (for an aggregate of up to $5.75 billion, with amounts not used in the first redemption to be available for the second redemption) to the extent NBCUniversal Holdings cannot fund the redemptions. Operating Activities Components of Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities Year ended December 31 (in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Operating income $ 7,980 $ 7,214 $ 6,732 Depreciation and amortization 6,616 6,500 6,400 Operating income before depreciation and amortization 14,596 13,714 13,132 Noncash share based compensation 300 257 258 Changes in operating assets and liabilities (20 ) (450 ) (251 ) Cash basis operating income 14,876 13,521 13,139 Payments of interest (1,983 ) (2,040 ) (2,256 ) Payments of income taxes (1,864 ) (1,303 ) (762 ) Proceeds from interest, dividends and other nonoperating items 154 103 125 Excess tax benefit under share based compensation presented in financing activities (4 ) (15 ) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 11,179 $ 10,281 $ 10,231 The changes in operating assets and liabilities in 2010 and 2009 primarily relate to the timing of payments of operating items and payroll. In 2009, there was a significant reduction in accrued liabilities due to a payroll period occurring at the end of the year. The decrease in interest payments in 2010 was primarily due to the effects of early extinguishment costs associated with the repayment of our debt obligations in connection with a cash tender offer in July 2009. The decrease in interest payments in 2009 was primarily due to decreases in interest rates on debt subject to variable interest rate swap agreements, the effects of our debt repayments and the maturity of certain higher rate debt in 2008. The increase in income tax payments in 2010 was primarily due to increases in 2010 taxable income, partially offset by tax payments made in 2009 that related to prior years. The increase in income tax payments in 2009 was primarily due to increases in 2009 taxable income, the settlements of uncertain tax positions and a tax payment made in 2009 that related to 2008, partially offset by the net benefits of approximately $341 million from the 2008 and 2009 economic stimulus legislation. Comcast 2010 Annual Report on Form 10 K 44 Table of Contents Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities consists primarily of cash paid for capital expenditures, intangible assets, acquisitions and investments. Capital Expenditures Our most significant recurring investing activity has been capital expenditures in our Cable segment, and we expect that this will continue in the future. A significant portion of our capital expenditures is based on the level of customer growth and technologies being deployed. The table below summarizes the capital expenditures we incurred in our Cable segment from 2008 through 2010. Year ended December 31 (in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Customer premises equipment $ 2,715 $ 2,934 $ 3,147 Scalable infrastructure 800 855 1,024 Line extensions 100 120 212 Support capital 373 421 522 Upgrades (capacity expansion) 363 356 407 Business services 496 351 233 Total $ 4,847 $ 5,037 $ 5,545 Cable capital expenditures decreased 3.8% and 9.2% in 2010 and 2009, respectively, primarily due to fewer residential unit additions and improved equipment pricing, partially offset by increased investment in our business services and strategic initiatives such as our all digital conversion and the continued deployment of DOCSIS 3.0 wideband technology. Capital expenditures in our Programming segment were not significant in 2010, 2009 or 2008. In 2008, our Corporate and Other business activities included approximately $137 million of capital expenditures related to the consolidation of offices and the relocation of our corporate headquarters. Capital expenditures for 2011 and for subsequent years will depend on numerous factors, including acquisitions, competition, changes in technology, regulatory changes and the timing and rate of deployment of new services. Acquisitions On January 28, 2011, we closed the NBCUniversal transaction (see Note 21 to our consolidated financial statements). Our 2010 and 2009 acquisitions were not significant. In 2008, acquisitions were primarily related to our acquisition of an additional interest in Comcast SportsNet Bay Area, our acquisition of the remaining interest in G4 that we did not already own, and our acquisitions of Plaxo and DailyCandy. Proceeds from Sales of Investments In 2008, proceeds from the sales of investments were primarily related to the disposition of available for sale debt securities. Purchases of Investments In 2010, purchases of investments consisted primarily of the purchase of an equity method investment in the Houston Regional Sports Network. In 2009, purchases of investments consisted primarily of our additional investment in Clearwire. In 2008, purchases of investments consisted primarily of the funding of our initial investment in Clearwire. Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities consists primarily of proceeds from borrowings, offset by our repurchases and repayments of debt, repurchases of our common stock and dividend payments. Proceeds from borrowings fluctuate from year to year based on the amounts paid to fund acquisitions and debt repayments. We have made, and may from time to time in the future make, optional repayments on our debt obligations, which may include repurchases of our outstanding public notes and debentures, depending on various factors, such as market conditions. In 2009, we made $1.6 billion of optional repurchases of our outstanding public bonds and ZONES debt. In July 2009, we completed a cash tender to repurchase approximately $1.3 billion aggregate principal amount of certain of our outstanding notes for approximately $1.5 billion. We recognized additional interest expense of approximately $180 million primarily associated with the premiums incurred in the tender offer. The premiums related to the tender offer are included in other financing activities. See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our financing activities, including details of our debt repayments and borrowings. Share Repurchases and Dividends In 2010, we repurchased approximately 70 million shares of our Class A Special common stock under our share repurchase authorization for approximately $1.2 billion. As of December 31, 2010, we had approximately $2.1 billion of availability remaining under our share repurchase authorization. We intend to complete repurchases under the current share repurchase authorization by the end of 2011, subject to market conditions. 45 Comcast 2010 Annual Report on Form 10 K Table of Contents Our Board of Directors declared quarterly dividends totaling $1.1 billion in 2010. We paid dividends of $1.1 billion in 2010. In January 2011, our Board of Directors approved an increase of 19% to our planned annual dividend to $0.45 per share and approved the first quarterly dividend of $0.1125 per share to be paid in April 2011. We expect to continue to pay quarterly dividends, although each dividend is subject to approval by our Board of Directors. The table below sets forth information on our share repurchases and dividends paid in 2010, 2009 and 2008. Contractual Obligations The table below presents our future contractual obligations as of December 31, 2010. For information on NBCUniversals obligations, see the NBCUniversal section below. Payment Due by Period (in millions) Total Year 1 Years 23 Years 45 Morethan 5 Debt obligations(a) $ 31,377 $ 1,785 $ 3,263 $ 3,532 $ 22,797 Capital lease obligations 38 15 13 4 6 Operating lease obligations 2,006 324 486 367 829 Purchase obligations(b) 19,653 4,124 4,291 3,000 8,238 Other long term liabilities reflected on the balance sheet: Acquisition related obligations(c) 28 20 5 2 1 Other long term obligations(d) 5,974 379 1,563 1,810 2,222 Total $ 59,076 $ 6,647 $ 9,621 $ 8,715 $ 34,093 Refer to Note 9 (long term debt) and Note 18 (commitments and contingencies) to our consolidated financial statements. (a) Excludes interest payments. (b) Purchase obligations consist of agreements to purchase goods and services that are legally binding on us and specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased and price provisions. Our purchase obligations related to our Cable segment include contracts with programming networks, CPE manufacturers, communication vendors, other cable operators for which we provide advertising sales representation and other contracts entered into in the normal course of business. We also have purchase obligations through Comcast Spectacor for the players and coaches of our professional sports teams. Purchase obligations do not include contracts with immaterial future commitments. (c) Acquisition related obligations consist primarily of costs related to exiting contractual obligations and other assumed contractual obligations of the acquired entity. (d) Other long term obligations consist primarily of prepaid forward sale agreements of equity securities we hold; subsidiary preferred shares; deferred compensation obligations; pension, postretirement and postemployment benefit obligations; and programming rights payable under license agreements. Reserves for uncertain tax positions of approximately $1.3 billion are not included in the table above because we cannot make a reliable estimate of the period in which the unrecognized tax benefits will be recognized. Comcast 2010 Annual Report on Form 10 K 46 Table of Contents NBCUniversal The table below presents the contractual obligations related to the NBCUniversal contributed businesses as of December 31, 2010, excluding NBCUniversals payment of $7.4 billion to GE at the close of the NBCUniversal transaction on January 28, 2011 and other acquisition related obligations. Payment Due by Period (in millions) Total Year 1 Years 2 3 Years 4 5 More than 5 Debt obligations(a) $ 9,100 $ $ $ 1,900 $ 7,200 Purchase obligations(b) 8,568 3,370 3,877 950 371 Operating leases 1,455 252 386 261 556 Other long term obligations(c) 852 444 296 62 50 Total $ 19,975 $ 4,066 $ 4,559 $ 3,173 $ 8,177 (a) Excludes interest payments and the principal amount due on an $816 million senior secured note as described under Station Venture Note below. (b) Purchase obligations consist primarily of the commitments to acquire film and television programming, including U.S. television rights to the future Olympic Games, NBCs Sunday Night Football through the 2013 2014 season and the NFL Super Bowl in 2012; and obligations under various creative talent and employment agreements, including obligations to actors, producers, television personalities and executives, and various other television commitments. (c) Other long term obligations consist primarily of programming obligations payable under NBCUniversals license arrangements. Payments of $1.6 billion of participations and residuals are not included in the table above because we cannot make a reliable estimate of the period in which the obligations will become payable. Additionally, we have not reflected incremental obligations that may arise as a result of the NBCUniversal transaction. Station Venture Note NBCUniversal owns an economic interest of approximately 79% and a 50% voting interest in Station Venture Holdings, LLC (Station Venture). Station Venture, through its ownership interests in Station Venture Operations, LP (Station LP), holds an indirect interest in the NBC Network affiliated local television stations in Dallas, Texas and San Diego, California. The remaining interests in these television stations are held by LIN TV, Corp (LIN TV). Station Venture is the obligor on an $816 million senior secured note due in 2023, which is non recourse to NBCUniversal and is due to General Electric Capital Corporation, a subsidiary of GE. The note is collateralized by substantially all of the assets of Station Venture and Station LP, and is guaranteed by LIN TV. In connection with the closing of the NBCUniversal transaction, GE has indemnified NBCUniversal for all liabilities NBCUniversal incurs as a result of the note, or under any related credit support, risk of loss or similar arrangement in existence prior to the closing of the NBCUniversal transaction on January 28, 2011. As a result of the indemnification from GE, we have not included the $816 million note in NBCUniversals debt obligations in the table above. NBCUniversal Guarantees NBCUniversal has certain contingent commitments that are not included in the table above. NBCUniversal guarantees an obligation of its 50% joint venture, Universal City Development Partners, (UCDP), which owns Universal Studios Florida and Islands of Adventure in Orlando, Florida. UCDP pays fees to a consultant equal to a percentage of revenue from NBCUniversal facilities located in Orlando and from defined comparable projects outside Orlando. NBCUniversal directly pays the fees due under the consulting agreement on behalf of UCDP with respect to Universal Studios Japan and Universal Studios Singapore. The consulting agreement does not have a termination date and the consultant has an option to terminate the consulting agreement in exchange for a lump sum payment established by a formula in the consulting agreement. The consultants right to elect a lump sum payment cannot be exercised prior to June 2017. If UCDP cannot pay the fees owed under the consulting agreement or, if elected, the lump sum payment for termination of the consulting agreement, NBCUniversal could be liable for the entire unpaid amounts. Additionally, affiliates of the Blackstone Group L.P. hold a 50% interest in UCDP through their equity interests in UCDPs general and limited partners. Those Blackstone Group affiliates entered into a five year loan agreement in November 2009 with a syndicate of lenders in the amount of $305 million, including prefunded interest and amortization, which is secured by their equity interests in UCDP. NBCUniversal guaranteed the loan on a deficiency basis and received a fee for the guarantee. Future distributions, other than tax distributions, from UCDP to the Blackstone Group affiliate borrowers are applied to the repayment of the loan. NBCUniversal Film Financing NBCUniversal enters into film co financing arrangements with third parties, including both studio and non studio entities, to jointly finance or distribute many of its film productions. These arrangements can take various forms. In most cases, the form of the arrangement involves the grant of an economic interest in a film to an investor. Investors typically assume the full risks and rewards of ownership proportionate to their ownership in the film. Accordingly, NBCUniversals proceeds in these arrangements are accounted for as a reduction of the capitalized cost of the film. Any 47 Comcast 2010 Annual Report on Form 10 K Table of Contents amounts due to third parties under these arrangements are accounted for as participations and residual liabilities. GE Redemption Rights In connection with the terms of the NBCUniversal Holdings operating agreement, during the six month period beginning July 28, 2014, GE has the right to cause NBCUniversal Holdings to redeem half of GEs interest in NBCUniversal Holdings, and during the six month period beginning January 28, 2018, GE has the right to cause NBCUniversal Holdings to redeem GEs remaining interest, if any. Subject to various limitations, we are committed to fund up to $2.875 billion in cash or our common stock for each of the two redemptions (for an aggregate of up to $5.75 billion, with amounts not used in the first redemption to be available for the second redemption) to the extent NBCUniversal Holdings cannot fund the redemptions. None of these amounts are included in either of the tables above. See NBCUniversal Transaction under Introduction and Overview for additional details. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 31, 2010, we did not have any significant off balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. NBCUniversal Trade Receivables Monetization As of December 31, 2010, NBCUniversal monetized its trade accounts receivable through two programs established with GE and various GE subsidiaries. Through these programs, NBCUniversal retained limited interests in the assets sold and provided reserves for all expected losses with respect to these interests. As a result of the NBCUniversal transaction, NBCUniversal has terminated its existing programs and has since established new third party monetization programs with a syndicate of banks, of which the primary relationship is with General Electric Capital Corporation, a subsidiary of GE, and another third party bank. Comcast 2010 Annual Report on Form 10 K 48 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Judgments and Estimates The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and contingent liabilities. We base our judgments on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making estimates about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe our judgments and related estimates associated with the valuation and impairment testing of our cable franchise rights and the accounting for income taxes are critical in the preparation of our financial statements. Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting judgments and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors, and the Audit Committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to them, which are presented below. Refer to Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our accounting policies with respect to these and other items. Valuation and Impairment Testing of Cable Franchise Rights Our largest asset, our cable franchise rights, results from agreements we have with state and local governments that allow us to construct and operate a cable business within a specified geographic area. The value of a franchise is derived from the economic benefits we receive from the right to solicit new customers and to market new services, such as advanced video services and high speed Internet and phone services, in a particular service area. The amounts we record for cable franchise rights are primarily a result of cable system acquisitions. Typically when we acquire a cable system, the most significant asset we record is the value of the cable franchise rights. Often these cable system acquisitions include multiple franchise areas. We currently serve approximately 6,400 franchise areas in the United States. We have concluded that our cable franchise rights have an indefinite useful life since there are no legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other factors which limit the period over which these rights will contribute to our cash flows. Accordingly, we do not amortize our cable franchise rights but assess the carrying value of our cable franchise rights annually, or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may exceed the fair value (impairment testing). We estimate the fair value of our cable franchise rights primarily based on a discounted cash flow analysis that involves significant judgment. When analyzing the fair values indicated under the discounted cash flow models, we also consider multiples of operating income before depreciation and amortization generated by under lying assets, current market transactions and profitability information. If we were to determine that the value of our cable franchise rights was less than the carrying amount, we would recognize an impairment charge for the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of the assets. For purposes of our impairment testing, we have grouped the recorded values of our various cable franchise rights into our Cable divisions or units of account. We evaluate the unit of account periodically to ensure our impairment testing is performed at an appropriate level. Since the adoption of the accounting guidance related to goodwill and intangible assets in 2002, we have not recorded any significant impairment charges to cable franchise rights as a result of our impairment testing. A future change in the unit of account could result in the recognition of an impairment charge. We could also record impairment charges in the future if there are changes in long term market conditions, in expected future operating results, or in federal or state regulations that prevent us from recovering the carrying value of these cable franchise rights. Assumptions made about increased competition and economic conditions could also impact the valuations used in future annual impairment testing and result in a reduction of fair values from those determined in the July 1, 2010 annual impairment testing. The table below illustrates the impairment related to our Cable divisions that would have occurred had the hypothetical reductions in fair value existed at the time of our last annual impairment testing. Percent Hypothetical Reduction in Fair Value and RelatedImpairment (in millions) 10% 15% 20% 25% Eastern Division $ (711 ) $ (1,566 ) $ (2,421 ) $ (3,276 ) NorthCentral Division (843 ) (1,778 ) (2,713 ) Southern Division West Division (869 ) $ (711 ) $ (2,409 ) $ (4,199 ) $ (6,858 ) The Cable divisions represent the unit of account we use to test for impairment. In November 2010, our Cable division management structure was reorganized from four divisions to three, with certain regions from the prior divisions being moved to a different division within the new management structure. We re performed our impairment testing immediately before the reorganization and no impairment was indicated. Income Taxes We base our provision for income taxes on our current period income, changes in our deferred income tax assets and liabilities, income tax rates, changes in estimates of our uncertain tax posi 49 Comcast 2010 Annual Report on Form 10 K Table of Contents tions, and tax planning opportunities available in the jurisdictions in which we operate. We prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations, and we record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations. From time to time, we engage in transactions in which the tax consequences may be subject to uncertainty. In these cases, we evaluate our tax positions using the recognition threshold and the measurement attribute in accordance with the accounting guidance related to uncertain tax positions. Examples of these transactions include business acquisitions and disposals, including consideration paid or received in connection with these transactions, and certain financing transactions. Significant judgment is required in assessing and estimating the tax consequences of these transactions. We determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained on examination, including the resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. In evaluating whether a tax position has met the more likely than not recognition threshold, we presume that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. A tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to be recognized in our financial statements. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized when the position is ultimately resolved. We adjust our estimates periodically to reflect changes in circumstances in ongoing examinations by and settlements with the various taxing authorities, as well as changes in tax laws, regulations and precedent. We believe that adequate accruals have been made for income taxes. When uncertain tax positions are ultimately resolved, either individually or in the aggregate, differences between our estimated amounts and the actual amounts are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position but could possibly be material to our consolidated results of operations or cash flow for any one period. As of December 31, 2010, our uncertain tax positions and related accrued interest were approximately $1.3 billion and $604 million, respectively. Comcast 2010 Annual Report on Form 10 K 50 Table of Contents Item 7A: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest Rate Risk Management We maintain a mix of fixed rate and variable rate debt. We are exposed to the market risk of adverse changes in interest rates. In order to manage the cost and volatility relating to the interest cost of our outstanding debt, we enter into various interest rate risk management derivative transactions in accordance with our policies. We monitor our interest rate risk exposures using techniques that include market value and sensitivity analyses. We do not engage in any speculative or leveraged derivative transactions. Our interest rate derivative financial instruments, which can include swaps, rate locks, caps and collars, represent an integral part of our interest rate risk management program. Our interest rate derivative financial instruments reduced the portion of our total debt at fixed rates from 99.7% to 82.9% as of December 31, 2010. In 2010, 2009 and 2008, the effect of our interest rate derivative financial instruments was a decrease in our interest expense of approximately $132 million, $104 million and $34 million, respectively. Interest rate derivative financial instruments may have a significant effect on our interest expense in the future. The table below summarizes the fair values and contract terms of financial instruments subject to interest rate risk maintained by us as of December 31, 2010. (in millions) 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Thereafter Total Estimated Fair Value12/31/2010 Debt Fixed rate $ 1,799 $ 818 $ 2,435 $ 1,110 $ 2,369 $ 22,802 $ 31,333 $ 34,230 Average interest rate 6.3 % 9.6 % 8.6 % 5.0 % 6.9 % 6.6 % 6.8 % Variable rate $ 1 $ 3 $ 20 $ 57 $ $ 1 $ 82 $ 82 Average interest rate 10.2 % 5.1 % 6.4 % 4.0 % 8.1 % 8.5 % 4.8 % Interest rate instruments Fixed to variable swaps $ 750 $ 300 $ 1,700 $ 900 $ $ 1,650 $ 5,300 $ 273 Average pay rate 2.0 % 9.2 % 6.7 % 1.8 % 0.0 % 4.9 % 4.8 % Average receive rate 5.5 % 9.8 % 8.1 % 5.3 % 0.0 % 5.8 % 6.6 % We use the notional amounts on the instruments to calculate the interest to be paid or received. The notional amounts do not represent the amount of our exposure to credit loss. Estimated fair value approximates the amount of payments to be made or proceeds to be received to settle the outstanding contracts. We estimate interest rates on variable debt and swaps using the average implied forward London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) for the year of maturity based on the yield curve in effect on December 31, 2010, plus the applicable borrowing margin on December 31, 2010. Certain of our financial contracts include credit ratings based triggers that could affect our liquidity. In the ordinary course of business, some of our swaps could be subject to termination provisions if we do not maintain investment grade credit ratings. As of both December 31, 2010 and 2009, the estimated fair value of those swaps was an asset of $26 million. The amount to be paid or received upon termination, if any, would be based on the fair value of the outstanding contracts at that time. Refer to Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our accounting policies for derivative financial instruments and to Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our derivative financial instruments. Equity Price Risk Management We are exposed to the market risk of changes in the equity prices of our investments in marketable securities. We enter into various derivative transactions in accordance with our policies to manage the volatility relating to these exposures. Through market value and sensitivity analyses, we monitor our equity price risk exposures to ensure that the instruments are matched with the underlying assets or liabilities, reduce our risks relating to equity prices and maintain a high correlation to the risk inherent in the hedged item. To limit our exposure to and benefits from price fluctuations in the common stock of some of our investments, we use equity derivative financial instruments. These derivative financial instruments, which are accounted for at fair value, include equity collar agreements, prepaid forward sale agreements and indexed debt instruments. 51 Comcast 2010 Annual Report on Form 10 K Table of Contents Except as described above in Investment Income (Loss), Net, the changes in the fair value of the investments that we accounted for as trading or available for sale securities were substantially offset by the changes in the fair values of the equity derivative financial instruments. Refer to Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our accounting policies for derivative financial instruments and to Note 6 and Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our investments and derivative financial instruments. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Management We are exposed to the market risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as they relate to our foreign currency denominated debt obligations. Cross currency swaps are used to effectively convert fixed rate foreign currency denominated debt to fixed rate U.S. dollar denominated debt, hedging the risk that the cash flows related to annual interest payments and the payment of principal at maturity may be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates. The gains and losses on the cross currency swaps offset changes in the U.S. dollar equivalent value of the related exposures. As of December 31, 2010, we had cross currency swaps on all of our outstanding &pound;625 million of 5.50% senior notes due 2029. Other foreign currency denominated balances were not significant as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. The NBCUniversal transaction will increase our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk. Refer to Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our accounting policies for derivative financial instruments and to Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our derivative financial instruments. Counterparty Credit Risk Management We manage the credit risks associated with our derivative financial instruments through diversification and the evaluation and monitoring of the creditworthiness of the counterparties. Although we may be exposed to losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties, we do not expect such losses, if any, to be significant. We have agreements with certain counterparties that include collateral provisions. These provisions require a party with an aggregate unrealized loss position in excess of certain thresholds to post cash collateral for the amount in excess of the threshold. The threshold levels in our collateral agreements are based on our and the counterparties credit ratings. As of December 31, 2010, neither we nor any of the counterparties were required to post collateral under the terms of the agreements. Comcast 2010 Annual Report on Form 10 K 52 Table of Contents
