Item 7: Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Introduction and Overview We are a leading provider of entertainment, information and communication products and services. On January 28, 2011, we closed our transaction with GE in which we acquired a 51% controlling interest in the businesses of NBCUniversal. As a result of the NBCUniversal transaction, we report our operations as the following five reportable business segments: Cable Communications (previously our Cable segment), Cable Networks, Broadcast Television, Filmed Entertainment and Theme Parks. The operations of our national cable networks (previously in our Programming segment), our regional sports and news networks (previously in our Cable segment) and certain Comcast Interactive Media businesses (previously in Corporate and Other) were contributed to NBCUniversal and are now presented in the Cable Networks segment. The Cable Networks, Broadcast Television, Filmed Entertainment and Theme Parks segments comprise the NBCUniversal businesses and are collectively referred to as the NBCUniversal segments. Additional information about the transaction is discussed below under the heading NBCUniversal Transaction. Cable Communications We are one of the nations leading providers of video, high speed Internet and voice services to residential and business customers. As of December 31, 2011, our cable systems served 22.3 million video customers, 18.1 million high speed Internet customers and 9.3 million voice customers and passed more than 52 million homes and businesses in 39 states and the District of Columbia. Our Cable Communications segment generates revenue primarily from subscriptions to our cable services, which we market individually and in packages, and from the sale of advertising. A substantial portion of our Cable Communications revenue comes from residential customers whose spending patterns may be affected by prevailing economic conditions. In 2011, our Cable Communications segment generated 67% of our consolidated revenue and 83% of our operating income before depreciation and amortization. Our cable systems allow us to deliver video, high speed Internet and voice services to our residential customers and to small to medium sized businesses. The majority of our Cable Communications segment revenue is generated from subscriptions to these cable services. Customers are billed monthly based on the services and features they receive and the type of equipment they use. Residential customers may generally discontinue service at any time, while business customers may only discontinue service in accordance with the terms of their respective contracts, which typically have 1 to 3 year terms. We offer a broad variety of video services with access to hundreds of channels, including premium networks and pay per view channels, On Demand, music channels, and an interactive, on screen program guide. Our video customers may also subscribe to a higher level of video service, including our HDTV service and DVR. Our video customers generally have the ability to view some of our On Demand content, browse program listings, and schedule and manage DVR recordings online and through our mobile applications for smartphones and tablets. In 2012, we began streaming certain live television programming online and through our mobile applications in some of our markets. Our high speed Internet services provide Internet access at downstream speeds of up to 105 Mbps, subject to geographic market availability. Our high speed Internet service for business customers also includes a website hosting service and an interactive tool that allows customers to share, coordinate and store documents online. Our voice services provide local and long distance calling and other features. Our voice service for business customers also includes a business directory listing and the option to add up to 24 phone lines. Our business services also offer Metro Ethernet data and cell backhaul services. 43 Comcast 2011 Annual Report on Form 10 K Table of Contents NBCUniversal NBCUniversal is a leading media and entertainment company that develops, produces and distributes entertainment, news and information, sports and other content for global audiences. In 2011, our NBCUniversal segments generated 34% of our consolidated revenue and 19% of our operating income before depreciation and amortization. Cable Networks Our Cable Networks segment consists primarily of our national cable entertainment networks (USA Network, Syfy, E!, Bravo, Oxygen, Style, G4, Chiller, Cloo (formerly Sleuth) and Universal HD); our national cable news and information networks (CNBC, MSNBC and CNBC World); our national cable sports networks (Golf Channel and NBC Sports Network (formerly VERSUS)); our 13 regional sports and news networks; our international cable networks (including CNBC Europe, CNBC Asia and our Universal Networks International portfolio of networks); our cable television production studio; and our related digital media properties, which consist primarily of brand aligned and other websites, such as DailyCandy, Fandango and iVillage. Our Cable Networks segment generates revenue primarily from the distribution of our cable network programming to multichannel video providers, the sale of advertising and the licensing and sale of our owned programming. Broadcast Television Our Broadcast Television segment consists primarily of the NBC and Telemundo broadcast networks, our NBC and Telemundo owned local television stations, our broadcast television production operations, and our related digital media properties, which consist primarily of brand aligned websites. Our Broadcast Television segment generates revenue primarily from the sale of advertising, the licensing of our owned programming, the sale of our owned programming on standard definition video discs and Blu ray discs (together, DVDs), through digital media platforms and from the licensing of our brands and characters for consumer products. Filmed Entertainment Our Filmed Entertainment segment consists of the operations of Universal Pictures, including Focus Features, which produces, acquires, markets and distributes filmed entertainment worldwide in various media formats for theatrical, home entertainment, television and other distribution platforms. We also develop, produce and license stage plays. Our Filmed Entertainment segment generates revenue primarily from the worldwide theatrical release of our owned and acquired films, the licensing of owned and acquired films to broadcast and cable networks and the licensing and sale of our owned and acquired films on DVD and in various digital formats. We also generate revenue from distributing third parties filmed entertainment, producing stage plays, publishing music and licensing consumer products. Theme Parks Our Theme Parks segment consists primarily of our Universal theme parks in Orlando and Hollywood. We also receive fees from intellectual property licenses and other services from third parties that own and operate Universal Studios Japan and Universal Studios Singapore. Through June 30, 2011, we held a 50% equity interest in, and received special and other fees from, Universal City Development Partners, Ltd. (Universal Orlando), which owns Universal Studios Florida and Universals Islands of Adventure in Orlando. On July 1, 2011, NBCUniversal completed the acquisition of the remaining 50% equity interest in Universal Orlando that it did not already own for $1 billion. As a result, Universal Orlando is now a wholly owned consolidated subsidiary of NBCUniversal, and its operating results have been consolidated with our results following the acquisition. Our Theme Parks segment generates revenue primarily from theme park attendance and per capita spending, as well as from management, licensing and other fees. Per capita spending includes ticket price and in park spending on food, beverage and merchandise. Comcast 2011 Annual Report on Form 10 K 44 Table of Contents Other Our other business interests primarily include Comcast Spectacor, which owns the Philadelphia Flyers and the Wells Fargo Center, a large, multipurpose arena in Philadelphia. Comcast Spector also owns Global Spectrum, which provides facilities management, and Ovations Food Services, which provides food services, for sporting events, concerts and other events. 2011 Developments The following are the more significant developments in our businesses during 2011: the close of the NBCUniversal transaction on January 28, 2011; see NBCUniversal Transaction below for additional information an increase in consolidated revenue of 47.2% to $55.8 billion and an increase in consolidated operating income of 34.3% to $10.7 billion; the NBCUniversal acquired businesses contributed $14.5 billion to revenue and $1.4 billion to operating income an increase in Cable Communications segment revenue of 5.3% to $37.2 billion and an increase in Cable Communications segment operating income before depreciation and amortization of 6.9% to $15.3 billion the entry into an agreement by SpectrumCo to sell its advanced wireless services spectrum licenses to Verizon Wireless, subject to regulatory approval, for $3.6 billion, of which our portion of the proceeds is expected to be $2.3 billion, and the entry into agency agreements with Verizon Wireless providing, among other things, for Verizon Wireless sale of our cable services and our sale of Verizon Wireless products and services NBCUniversals entry into several significant sports broadcast rights agreements, including with the NFL, the International Olympic Committee, the NHL, FIFA and the PGA TOUR NBCUniversals acquisition of the 50% equity interest that it did not already own in Universal Orlando for $1 billion on July 1, 2011 NBCUniversal Transaction On January 28, 2011, we closed our transaction with GE to form a new company named NBCUniversal, LLC (NBCUniversal Holdings). We now control and own 51% of NBCUniversal Holdings, and GE owns the remaining 49%. As part of the NBCUniversal transaction, GE contributed the businesses of NBCUniversal, which is now a wholly owned subsidiary of NBCUniversal Holdings. The NBCUniversal businesses that were contributed included its national cable networks, the NBC and Telemundo broadcast networks and its NBC and Telemundo owned local television stations, Universal Pictures, the Universal Studios Hollywood theme park, and other related assets. We contributed our national cable networks, our regional sports and news networks, certain of our Internet businesses, including DailyCandy and Fandango, and other related assets (the Comcast Content Business). In addition to contributing the Comcast Content Business to NBCUniversal, we made a cash payment to GE of $6.2 billion, which included transaction related costs. We expect to receive tax benefits related to the transaction and have agreed to share with GE certain of these future tax benefits as they are realized. We have incurred significant transaction costs directly related to the NBCUniversal transaction. The incremental expenses related to legal, accounting and valuation services and investment banking fees are reflected in operating costs and expenses. We also incurred certain financing costs and other shared costs with GE associated with NBCUniversal debt facilities that were entered into in December 2009 and the issuance of NBCUniversals senior notes in 2010, which are included in other expense and interest expense. In addition, during 2011, NBCUniversal incurred transaction related costs associated with severance and other related compensation charges, which are included in operating costs and expenses. 45 Comcast 2011 Annual Report on Form 10 K Table of Contents The table below presents the amounts related to these expenses included in our consolidated statement of income.

The net assets of the NBCUniversal contributed businesses were recorded at their estimated fair value. In valuing acquired assets and liabilities, fair value estimates are based on, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows, market rate assumptions for contractual obligations, actuarial assumptions for benefit plans and appropriate discount rates. The Comcast Content Business continues at its historical or carry over basis.

Comcast 2011 Annual Report on Form 10 K 46 Table of Contents The comparability of our consolidated results of operations was impacted by the NBCUniversal transaction, which closed on January 28, 2011, and the Universal Orlando transaction, which closed on July 1, 2011. NBCUniversals and Universal Orlandos results of operations are included in our consolidated financial statements following their respective acquisition dates. 2011 Consolidated Operating Results Consolidated Revenue The increase in consolidated revenue for 2011 was primarily due to the NBCUniversal transaction and an increase in our Cable Communications segment revenue. The NBCUniversal contributed businesses accounted for $14.5 billion of the increase in consolidated revenue. In 2010, our Cable Communications segment and our Cable Networks segment accounted for substantially all of the increase in consolidated revenue. The remaining changes in consolidated revenue for both 2011 and 2010 related to our other business activities, primarily Comcast Spectacor. Revenue for our Cable Communications and NBCUniversal segments are discussed separately under the heading Segment Operating Results. Consolidated Operating Costs and Expenses The increase in consolidated operating costs and expenses for 2011 was primarily due to the NBCUniversal transaction and an increase in our Cable Communications segment. The NBCUniversal contributed businesses accounted for $12.3 billion of the increase in consolidated operating costs and expenses. For 2010, our Cable Communications segment and our Cable Networks segment accounted for substantially all of the increase in consolidated operating costs and expenses. The remaining changes in consolidated operating costs and expenses for both 2011 and 2010 related to our other business activities, primarily Comcast Spectacor, and costs associated with the NBCUniversal transaction. Operating costs and expenses for our Cable Communications and NBCUniversal segments are discussed separately under the heading Segment Operating Results. Consolidated Depreciation and Amortization Consolidated depreciation and amortization increased for 2011 primarily as a result of the NBCUniversal transaction. For 2011, $976 million of the increases in consolidated depreciation and amortization were related to the addition of the NBCUniversal contributed businesses, including the impact of acquisition accounting adjustments, as well as from the addition of Universal Orlando since July 2011. Depreciation expense for 2010 remained relatively stable primarily due to decreases in capital spending in recent years. The increase in amortization expense for 2010 was primarily related to goodwill impairment charges taken in our Cable Networks segment totaling $76 million. 47 Comcast 2011 Annual Report on Form 10 K Table of Contents Segment Operating Results Beginning in the first quarter of 2011, we changed our reporting segments as a result of the close of the NBCUniversal transaction. We have recast our segment presentation for 2010 and 2009 to reflect our current operating segments. Our segment operating results are presented based on how we assess operating performance and internally report financial information. We use operating income (loss) before depreciation and amortization, excluding impairments related to fixed and intangible assets and gains or losses from the sale of assets, if any, as the measure of profit or loss for our operating segments. This measure eliminates the significant level of noncash depreciation and amortization expense that results from the capital intensive nature of certain of our businesses and from intangible assets recognized in business combinations. Additionally, it is unaffected by our capital structure or investment activities. We use this measure to evaluate our consolidated operating performance and the operating performance of our operating segments and to allocate resources and capital to our operating segments. It is also a significant performance measure in our annual incentive compensation programs. We believe that this measure is useful to investors because it is one of the bases for comparing our operating performance with that of other companies in our industries, although our measure may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other companies. Because we use operating income (loss) before depreciation and amortization to measure our segment profit or loss, we reconcile it to operating income, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP) in the business segment footnote to our consolidated financial statements (see Note 20 to our consolidated financial statements). This measure should not be considered a substitute for operating income (loss), net income (loss) attributable to Comcast Corporation, net cash provided by operating activities, or other measures of performance or liquidity we have reported in accordance with GAAP. Competition The results of operations of our reporting segments may be affected by competition, as all of our businesses operate in intensely competitive industries and compete with a growing number of companies that provide a broad range of communications products and services and entertainment, news and information content to consumers. Technological changes are further intensifying and complicating the competitive landscape, as companies continue to emerge that offer services or devices that enable Internet video streaming and downloading of movies, television shows and other video programming and as wireless services and devices continue to evolve. Moreover, newer services that distribute video programming are also beginning to produce or acquire their own original content. This competition is further complicated by federal and state legislative bodies and various regulatory agencies, such as the FCC, which can adopt laws and policies that provide a favorable operating environment for some of our existing and potential new competitors. See Business Competition for additional information. Seasonality and Cyclicality Each of our businesses is subject to seasonal and cyclical variations. In our Cable Communications segment, our results are impacted by the seasonal nature of customers receiving our cable services in college and vacation markets. This generally results in weaker customer metrics in the second calendar quarter. Revenue in our Cable Communications, Cable Networks and Broadcast Television segments are subject to cyclical advertising patterns and changes in viewership levels. Our U.S. advertising revenue is generally higher in the second and fourth calendar quarters of each year, due in part to increases in consumer advertising in the spring and in the period leading up to and including the holiday season. U.S. advertising revenue is also cyclical, benefiting in even numbered years from advertising related to candidates running for political office and issue oriented advertising. Broadcast Television revenue and operating costs and expenses also are Comcast 2011 Annual Report on Form 10 K 48 Table of Contents cyclical as a result of our periodic broadcasts of the Olympic Games and Super Bowls. Our advertising revenue generally increases in the period of these broadcasts from increased demand for advertising time, and our operating costs and expenses also increase as a result of our production costs and amortization of the related rights fees. Our results of operations and cash flows may be negatively impacted if the amount of advertising revenue generated does not exceed the associated costs of broadcasting such events. Revenue in our Cable Networks, Broadcast Television and Filmed Entertainment segments also fluctuates due to the timing and performance of theatrical, home entertainment and television releases. Release dates are determined by several factors, including competition and the timing of vacation and holiday periods. As a result, revenue tends to be seasonal, with increases experienced during the summer months, around holidays and in the fourth calendar quarter of each year. Revenue in our Cable Networks, Broadcast Television and Filmed Entertainment segments also fluctuates due to the timing of when our owned content is made available to licensees. Revenue in our Theme Parks segment fluctuates with changes in theme park attendance resulting from the seasonal nature of vacation travel, local entertainment offerings and seasonal weather variations. Our theme parks experience peak attendance generally during the summer months when schools are closed and during early winter and spring holiday periods.

Cable Communications Segment Revenue Our average monthly total revenue per video customer increased to $137 in 2011 from $127 in 2010 and $117 in 2009. The increases in average monthly total revenue per video customer were primarily due to increases in the number of residential customers receiving multiple services, rate adjustments, higher contributions from business services and declines in the total number of video customers. Video Our video revenue increased in 2011 and 2010 primarily due to rate adjustments and additional customers receiving higher levels of service, offset by declines in the number of residential video customers in both years. During 2011 and 2010, the number of video customers decreased by 460,000 and 757,000, respectively. These decreases were primarily due to competitive pressures in our service areas and weakness in the economy and, in 2010, the loss of customers upon expiration of discounted promotions. We expect further declines in the number of residential video customers during 2012. During 2011 and 2010, we added or upgraded to our digital video service 816,000 customers and 1.3 million customers, respectively, including those customers added or upgraded in 2010 in connection with our all digital conversion. As of December 31, 2011, 43% of the homes in the areas we serve subscribed to our video services. As of December 31, 2011, 53% of our digital video customers subscribed to at least one of our advanced HDTV and DVR services. Comcast 2011 Annual Report on Form 10 K 50 Table of Contents High Speed Internet As of December 31, 2011, 35% of the homes in the areas we serve subscribed to our high speed Internet services, compared to 33% and 31% as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Our high speed Internet revenue increased in 2011 and 2010 primarily due to increases in the number of residential customers, rate adjustments and additional customers receiving higher levels of service. Voice As of December 31, 2011, 18% of the homes in the areas we serve subscribed to our voice services, compared to 17% and 15% as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Our voice revenue increased in 2011 and 2010 primarily due to increases in the number of residential customers. Advertising As part of our programming license agreements with cable networks, we generally receive an allocation of scheduled advertising time that we may sell to local, regional and national advertisers. In most cases, the available advertising time is sold by our sales force. In some cases, we work with representation firms as an extension of our sales force to sell a portion of the advertising time allocated to us. We also coordinate the advertising sales efforts of other multichannel video providers in some markets, and in some markets we operate advertising interconnects. In addition, we generate revenue from the sale of advertising on XFINITY.com and our On Demand service. Advertising revenue is affected by the strength of the local advertising market and general economic conditions. Our advertising revenue declined slightly in 2011 due to lower political advertising. Our advertising revenue increased in 2010 primarily due to improvements in the overall television advertising market, including political advertising. Business Services Our business services revenue increased in 2011 and 2010 primarily due to increases in the number of customers across all cable services. Other We receive revenue related to franchise and other regulatory fees, our digital media center, commissions from electronic retailing networks, and fees from other services. Our franchise and regulatory fees represent the fees required to be paid to federal, state and local authorities that we pass through to our customers. Under the terms of our franchise agreements, we are generally required to pay to the franchising authority an amount based on our gross video revenue. The changes in franchise and other regulatory fees collected from our cable services customers are generally due to changes in the revenue on which the fees apply. Cable Communications Segment Operating Costs and Expenses We continue to focus on controlling the growth of expenses. Our operating margin (operating income before depreciation and amortization as a percentage of revenue) for 2011, 2010 and 2009 was 41.1%, 40.4% and 40.1%, respectively. Programming Expenses Programming expenses, our largest operating expense, are the fees we pay to license the programming we distribute to our video customers. These expenses are affected by changes in the fees charged by cable networks, the number of video customers we serve, the number of channels and programs we provide, and the fees for retransmission of broadcast networks. Programming expenses increased in 2011 and 2010, primarily due to increases in rates, additional digital video customers and additional programming options offered. We anticipate that our programming expenses will continue to increase as the fees charged by programming networks increase; as we provide additional channels and On Demand programming to our 51 Comcast 2011 Annual Report on Form 10 K Table of Contents customers and increase the number of delivery platforms, such as online and through our mobile applications for smartphones and tablets; and as fees for retransmission of broadcast networks increase. Technical Labor Expenses Technical labor expenses include the internal and external labor costs to complete service call and installation activities, as well as network operations, fulfillment and provisioning costs. These expenses remained relatively stable in 2011 and 2010 due to improvements in our service call metrics and decreases in customer activity. Customer Service Expenses Customer service expenses include the personnel and other costs associated with handling service calls and customer support. Customer service expenses remained relatively stable in 2011. Customer service expenses decreased in 2010 primarily due to operating efficiencies and due to higher levels of activity in 2009 related to the transition by broadcasters from analog to digital transmission and our all digital conversion. Marketing Expenses Marketing expenses increased in 2011 and 2010 primarily due to increases in spending associated with the continued expansion of business services and costs associated with the XFINITY&reg; brand and competitive marketing, and due to increases in direct sales efforts. Other Costs and Expenses Other operating costs and expenses include franchise fees, pole rentals, plant maintenance, vehicle related costs, advertising and representation fees, and expenses associated with our business services. These expenses increased in 2011 and 2010 primarily due to the continued expansion of business services and other service enhancement initiatives. During 2011, 2010 and 2009, we implemented personnel and cost reduction programs that were focused on streamlining our Cable Communications operations. In connection with these initiatives, during 2011, 2010 and 2009, we recorded $36 million, $66 million and $81 million, respectively, of severance costs. NBCUniversal Segments Overview The discussion below compares the NBCUniversal segments pro forma combined results for 2011 and 2010, as well as our Cable Networks segment actual results for 2010 and 2009. Management believes reviewing our operating results by combining actual and pro forma results for the NBCUniversal segments for 2011 and 2010 is more useful in identifying trends in, or reaching conclusions regarding, the overall operating performance of these segments for the current year. Our pro forma segment information includes adjustments as if the NBCUniversal and Universal Orlando transactions had occurred on January 1, 2010. Our pro forma data was also adjusted for the effects of acquisition accounting and the elimination of costs and expenses directly related to the transactions but does not include adjustments for costs related to integration activities, cost savings or synergies that have been or may be achieved by the combined businesses. Pro forma amounts are not necessarily indicative of what our results would have been had we operated the NBCUniversal contributed businesses or Universal Orlando since January 1, 2010, nor of our future results.

Cable Networks Segment Revenue Distribution Distribution revenue is generated from distribution agreements with multichannel video providers and is affected by the number of subscribers receiving our cable networks and the fees we charge per subscriber. Pro forma combined distribution revenue increased in 2011 primarily due to rate increases and increases in the number of subscribers to our cable networks. In 2011, 13% of our Cable Networks segment actual revenue was generated from our Cable Communications segment. These amounts are eliminated in our consolidated financial statements but are included in the amounts presented above. Advertising Advertising revenue is generated from the sale of advertising time on our cable networks and related digital media properties. Our advertising revenue depends on audience ratings, the value of the demographics of our cable networks viewers to advertisers and the number of advertising units we can place in our cable networks programming schedules. Advertising revenue is affected by the strength of the advertising market, general economic conditions and the success of our programming. Pro forma combined advertising revenue increased in 2011 primarily due to increases in the price of advertising units sold. Comcast 2011 Annual Report on Form 10 K 54 Table of Contents Other We also generate revenue from the licensing and sale of our owned programming. Pro forma combined other revenue increased in 2011 primarily due to increases in the licensing of our owned content from our cable production studio. Cable Networks Segment Operating Costs and Expenses Our Cable Networks segment operating costs and expenses consist primarily of programming and production expenses, advertising and marketing expenses, and other operating costs and expenses. Programming and production expenses include the amortization of owned and acquired programming, direct production costs, residual and participation payments, production overhead, and on air talent costs. Advertising and marketing expenses primarily consist of the costs incurred in promoting our cable networks, costs associated with digital media, and the costs of licensing our programming to third party networks and other distribution platforms. Other operating costs and expenses include salaries, employee benefits, rent and other overhead expenses. Our pro forma combined operating costs and expenses increased in 2011 primarily due to higher programming and production expenses associated with an increase in the volume of original programming. Cable Networks Segment 2010 and 2009 Actual Results of Operations During 2010 and 2009, the actual results of operations for our Cable Networks segment consisted of the Comcast Content Business.

(c) Pro forma combined amounts represent our pro forma results of operations as if the NBCUniversal transaction had occurred on January 1, 2010 but are not necessarily indicative of what the results would have been had we operated the businesses since January 1, 2010. Broadcast Television Segment Revenue Advertising Advertising revenue is generated from the sale of advertising time on our broadcast networks, owned local television stations and related digital media properties. Our advertising revenue is generally based on audience ratings, the value of our viewer demographics to advertisers, and the number of advertising units we can place in our broadcast networks and owned television stations programming schedules. Advertising revenue is affected by the strength of the national and local advertising markets, general economic conditions and the success of our programming. Our pro forma combined advertising revenue decreased in 2011 primarily due to $601 million of revenue recognized in 2010 related to the 2010 Vancouver Olympics. Excluding the impact of the 2010 Vancouver Olympics, pro forma combined advertising revenue increased $44 million in 2011 primarily due to an increase in the price of advertising units sold, which exceeded the adverse effects of the decline in audience ratings in our primetime schedule. Content Licensing Content licensing revenue is generated from the licensing of our owned programming in the United States and internationally. Content licensing revenue depends on the length and terms of the initial network license for our owned programming, consumer acceptance of our programming and our ability to subsequently license that programming to other networks, both in the United States and internationally, and to individual local U.S. television stations. In recent years, the production and distribution costs related to our owned programming have exceeded the revenue generated from the initial network license by an increasing amount. Comcast 2011 Annual Report on Form 10 K 56 Table of Contents The licensing of our owned television programming after the initial network licensing is critical to the financial success of a television series. Our pro forma combined content licensing revenue increased in 2011 primarily due to the impact of licensing agreements that we entered into during 2011, which included the licensing of certain prior season and library content. Other Other revenue includes distribution revenue associated with the broadcast of the Olympic Games on our Cable Networks. We also generate revenue from the sale of our owned programming on DVDs, through electronic sell through and other formats, and from the licensing of our brands and characters for consumer products. This revenue is driven primarily by the popularity of our broadcast networks and programming series and, therefore, fluctuates based on consumer spending and acceptance. Our pro forma combined other revenue decreased in 2011 primarily due to the absence of the 2010 Vancouver Olympics and a decline in DVD sales. Broadcast Television Segment Operating Costs and Expenses Our Broadcast Television segment operating costs and expenses consist primarily of programming and production expenses, advertising and marketing expenses, and other operating costs and expenses. Programming and production expenses relate to content originating on our broadcast networks and owned local television stations and include the amortization of owned and acquired programming costs, direct production costs, residual and participation payments, production overhead, and on air talent costs. Advertising and marketing expenses consist primarily of the costs incurred in promoting our owned television programming, as well as the replication, distribution and marketing costs of DVDs, costs associated with digital media, and the costs of licensing our programming to third parties and other distribution platforms. Other operating costs and expenses include salaries, employee benefits, rent and other overhead expenses. Our pro forma combined operating costs and expenses decreased in 2011 primarily due to $1 billion of programming and production expenses recognized in 2010 associated with the 2010 Vancouver Olympics. Excluding the impact of the 2010 Vancouver Olympics, operating costs and expenses increased in 2011 primarily due to higher programming and production expenses associated with a greater number of original primetime series in 2011. 57 Comcast 2011 Annual Report on Form 10 K Table of Contents Filmed Entertainment Segment Actual and Pro Forma Results of Operations 2011 2010 Actual(a) Pro Forma(b) Pro FormaCombined(c) Pro Forma(b) (in millions) For the periodJanuary 29throughDecember 31 For the periodJanuary 1throughJanuary 28 Year endedDecember 31 Year endedDecember 31 % Change2010 to 2011 Revenue Theatrical $ 983 $ 58 $ 1,041 $ 900 15.6 % Content licensing 1,234 171 1,405 1,336 5.2 % Home entertainment 1,559 96 1,655 1,732 (4.4 )% Other 463 28 491 608 (19.3 )% Total revenue 4,239 353 4,592 4,576 0.3 % Operating costs and expenses 4,212 356 4,568 4,346 5.1 % Operating income (loss) before depreciation and amortization $ 27 $ (3 ) $ 24 $ 230 (89.7 )% (a) Actual amounts include the results of operations for the NBCUniversal acquired businesses for the period January 29, 2011 through December 31, 2011.

(c) Pro forma combined amounts represent our pro forma results of operations as if the NBCUniversal transaction had occurred on January 1, 2010 but are not necessarily indicative of what the results would have been had we operated the businesses since January 1, 2010. Filmed Entertainment Segment Revenue Theatrical Theatrical revenue is generated from the worldwide theatrical release of our owned and acquired films and is significantly affected by the timing and number of our theatrical releases, as well as their acceptance by consumers. Theatrical release dates are determined by several factors, including production schedules, vacation and holiday periods, and the timing of competitive releases. Theatrical revenue is also affected by the number of exhibition screens, ticket prices, the percentage of ticket sale retention by theatrical exhibitors and the popularity of competing films at the time our films are released. The theatrical success of a film is a significant factor in determining the revenue a film is likely to generate in succeeding distribution platforms. Our pro forma combined theatrical revenue increased in 2011 primarily due to an increase in the number of theatrical releases in our 2011 slate and the strong performance of the second quarter 2011 releases of Fast Five and Bridesmaids. Content Licensing Content licensing revenue is generated primarily from the licensing of our owned and acquired films to broadcast, cable and premium networks, as well as other distribution platforms. Our pro forma combined content licensing revenue increased in 2011 primarily due to the timing of when our owned and acquired films were made available to licensees. Comcast 2011 Annual Report on Form 10 K 58 Table of Contents Home Entertainment Home entertainment revenue is generated from the license and sale of our owned and acquired films through DVD sales to retail stores, rental kiosks and subscription by mail, as well as through digital media platforms, including electronic sell through. Home entertainment revenue is significantly affected by the timing and number of our home entertainment releases and their acceptance by consumers. Home entertainment release dates are determined by several factors, including the timing of the theatrical exhibition of a film, holiday periods and the timing of competitive releases. Our pro forma combined home entertainment revenue decreased in 2011 primarily due to the overall decline in the DVD market and fewer titles released in 2011. Sales of DVDs have continued to decline. Several factors have contributed to the overall decline in the DVD market, including weak economic conditions, the maturation of the standard definition DVD format, piracy, and intense competition for consumer discretionary spending and leisure time. DVD sales have also been negatively affected by an increasing shift by consumers toward subscription rental services, discount rental kiosks and digital forms of entertainment, such as video on demand services, which generate less revenue per transaction than DVD sales. Other We also generate revenue from distributing third parties filmed entertainment, producing stage plays, publishing music and licensing consumer products. Our pro forma combined other revenue decreased in 2011 primarily due to decreases in revenue generated from our stage plays as a result of fewer shows. Filmed Entertainment Segment Operating Costs and Expenses Our Filmed Entertainment segment operating costs and expenses consist primarily of amortization of capitalized film production and acquisition costs, residual and participation payments, and distribution and marketing expenses. Residual payments represent amounts payable to certain of our employees, including freelance and temporary employees, who are represented by labor unions or guilds, such as the Writers Guild of America, the Screen Actors Guild and the Directors Guild of America, and are based on post theatrical revenue. Participation payments are primarily based on film performance and represent contingent consideration payable to creative talent and other parties involved in the production of a film, including producers, writers, directors, actors, and technical and production personnel, under employment or other agreements and to our film cofinancing partners under cofinancing agreements. Distribution and marketing expenses consist primarily of the costs associated with theatrical prints and advertising and the replication, distribution and marketing of DVDs. Other operating costs and expenses include salaries, employee benefits, rent and other overhead expenses. We incur significant marketing expenses before and throughout the theatrical release of a film and in connection with the release of a film on other distribution platforms. As a result, we typically incur losses on a film prior to and during the films theatrical exhibition and may not realize profits, if any, until the film generates home entertainment and content licensing revenue. The costs of producing and marketing films have generally increased in recent years and may continue to increase in the future, particularly if competition within the filmed entertainment industry continues to intensify. Pro forma combined operating costs and expenses increased in 2011 primarily due to an increase in marketing expenses associated with promoting our 2011 theatrical releases. 59 Comcast 2011 Annual Report on Form 10 K Table of Contents Theme Parks Segment Actual and Pro Forma Results of Operations The table below includes 100% of the results of operation for Universal Orlando for all periods presented in order to reflect our current profit measure of operating income (loss) before depreciation and amortization for our Theme Parks segment. 2011 2010 Actual(a) Pro Forma(b) Pro FormaCombined(c) Pro Forma(b) (in millions) For the periodJanuary 29throughDecember 31 For the periodJanuary 1throughJanuary 28 Year endedDecember 31 Year endedDecember 31 % Change2010 to 2011 Revenue $ 1,874 $ 115 $ 1,989 $ 1,600 24.3 % Operating costs and expenses 1,044 78 1,122 1,009 11.2 % Operating income before depreciation and amortization $ 830 $ 37 $ 867 $ 591 46.6 % (a) Actual amounts include the results of operations for the NBCUniversal acquired businesses and Universal Orlando for the period January 29, 2011 through December 31, 2011.

(c) Pro forma combined amounts represent our pro forma results of operations as if the NBCUniversal and Universal Orlando transactions had occurred on January 1, 2010 but are not necessarily indicative of what the results would have been had we operated the businesses since January 1, 2010. Theme Parks Segment Revenue Our Theme Parks segment revenue is generated primarily from theme park attendance and per capita spending, as well as from management, licensing and other fees. Attendance at our theme parks and per capita spending depend heavily on the general environment for travel and tourism, including consumer spending on travel and other recreational activities. License and other fees relate primarily to our agreements with third parties that operate the Universal Studios Japan and the Universal Studios Singapore theme parks to license the Universal Studios brand name, certain characters and other intellectual property. Our pro forma combined revenue increased in 2011 primarily due to an increase in attendance and per capita spending at our Universal theme parks driven primarily by the continued strong performance of The Wizarding World of Harry Potter attraction in Orlando and the King Kong attraction in Hollywood. Theme Parks Segment Operating Costs and Expenses Our Theme Parks segment operating costs and expenses consist primarily of theme park operations, including repairs and maintenance and related administrative expenses; costs of food, beverage and merchandise; labor costs; and sales and marketing costs. Our pro forma combined operating costs and expenses increased in 2011 primarily due to additional variable costs associated with increases in attendance and per capita spending at our Universal theme parks in Orlando and Hollywood. Comcast 2011 Annual Report on Form 10 K 60 Table of Contents Headquarters, Other and Eliminations Headquarters and Other operating costs and expenses incurred by our NBCUniversal businesses include overhead, employee benefit expenses, expenses related to the NBCUniversal transaction and corporate initiatives. Our pro forma combined operating costs and expenses increased in 2011 primarily due to transaction related costs, including severance and other compensation related costs. Eliminations include the results of operations for Universal Orlando for the period January 29, 2011 through June 30, 2011. Our Theme Parks segment includes the results of operations of Universal Orlando for this period because these amounts reflect our current segment performance measure. These amounts are not included when we measure total NBCUniversal and our consolidated results of operations because we recorded Universal Orlando as an equity method investment for the period January 29, 2011 through June 30, 2011. Consolidated Other Income (Expense) Items Year ended December 31 (in millions) 2011 2010 2009 Interest expense $ (2,505 ) $ (2,156 ) $ (2,348 ) Investment income (loss), net 159 288 282 Equity in net income (losses) of investees, net (35 ) (141 ) (64 ) Other income (expense), net (133 ) 133 22 Total $ (2,514 ) $ (1,876 ) $ (2,108 ) Interest Expense Interest expense increased in 2011 primarily due to the effects of the NBCUniversal and Universal Orlando transactions and the consolidation of their respective outstanding debt obligations. Interest expense decreased in 2010 primarily due to $175 million of early extinguishment losses, net of early extinguishment gains, associated with the repayment of debt obligations prior to their scheduled maturity that were recognized in 2009. Investment Income (Loss), Net The components of investment income (loss), net for 2011, 2010 and 2009 are presented in a table in Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements. We have entered into derivative financial instruments that we account for at fair value and that economically hedge the market price fluctuations in the common stock of substantially all of our investments accounted for as trading securities and available for sale securities. The differences between the unrealized gains or losses on securities underlying prepaid forward sale agreements and the mark to market adjustments on the derivative component of prepaid forward sale agreements result from one or more of the following: there were unusual changes in the derivative valuation assumptions such as interest rates, volatility and dividend policy the magnitude of the difference between the market price of the underlying security to which the derivative relates and the strike price of the derivative the change in the time value component of the derivative value during the period the security to which the derivative relates changed due to a corporate reorganization of the issuing company to a security with a different volatility rate 61 Comcast 2011 Annual Report on Form 10 K Table of Contents Equity in Net Income (Losses) of Investees, Net The decrease in equity in net losses of investees, net for 2011 was primarily due to the acquisition of NBCUniversal and its equity method investments, including A&E Television Networks and The Weather Channel, offset by losses related to our investment in Clearwire LLC. Other Income (Expense), Net In connection with the NBCUniversal transaction, we agreed to share with GE certain financing and other costs associated with debt facilities that were entered into in December 2009 and with the issuance of NBCUniversals senior notes in 2010. Other income (expense) for 2011 and 2010 includes $16 million and $129 million, respectively, of expenses for our share of these costs. Other income (expense) for 2011 also includes $57 million of expenses related to contractual obligations involving perpetual financial interests held by third parties in certain of our businesses. The obligations were recorded at fair value in connection with the NBCUniversal and Universal Orlando transactions, with subsequent changes in fair value recorded in other income (expense). Other income (expense) for 2010 also includes income of $141 million related to the sale of one of our equity method investments and income of $108 million related to recoveries in connection with the resolution of a contingency of an acquired company. Consolidated Income Tax Expense Our effective income tax rate for 2011, 2010 and 2009 was 37.2%, 39.9% and 28.9%, respectively. Income tax expense reflects an effective income tax rate that differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to state income taxes, interest on uncertain tax positions, and, in 2011 due to the partnership structure of NBCUniversal Holdings and foreign income taxes. Our 2011 income tax expense was increased by $137 million due to certain changes in state tax laws. Our 2009 income tax expense was reduced by $566 million primarily due to the recognition of tax benefits associated with settlements and adjustments of uncertain tax positions and related interest and certain subsidiary reorganizations that impacted deferred state income taxes. Our income tax expense may in the future continue to be impacted by adjustments to uncertain tax positions and related interest and changes in state tax laws. We expect our 2012 annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 35% to 40%. Consolidated Net (Income) Loss Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests The increase in net (income) loss attributable to noncontrolling interests for 2011 was primarily due to the NBCUniversal transaction. GEs interest in NBCUniversal Holdings is recorded as a redeemable noncontrolling interest in our consolidated financial statements due to the redemption provisions outlined in Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements. Net (income) loss attributable to noncontrolling interests includes GEs allocated share of the earnings of NBCUniversal Holdings and NBCUniversal. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our businesses generate significant cash flows from operating activities. We believe that we will be able to continue to meet our current and long term liquidity and capital requirements, including fixed charges, as well as potential future redemptions of GEs noncontrolling equity interest in NBCUniversal, through our cash flows from operating activities, existing cash, cash equivalents and investments, available borrowings under our existing credit facilities, and our ability to obtain future external financing. We anticipate that we will continue to use a substantial portion of our cash flows to meet our debt repayment obligations, to fund our capital expenditures, to invest in business opportunities, and to return capital to shareholders. The cash flows generated from our Cable Communications segment and other businesses are used to invest in their core businesses and return capital to shareholders. The cash flows generated from Comcast 2011 Annual Report on Form 10 K 62 Table of Contents NBCUniversal are used to invest in its core businesses and to fund potential future redemptions of GEs noncontrolling interest in NBCUniversal. We maintain significant availability under our lines of credit and our commercial paper programs to meet our short term liquidity requirements. As of December 31, 2011, $6.5 billion was available under Comcasts and Comcast Cable Communications revolving credit facilities and $934 million was available under NBCUniversals revolving credit facility. We and our Cable Communications subsidiaries that have provided guarantees are subject to the covenants and restrictions set forth in the indentures governing Comcasts public debt securities and in the credit agreements governing Comcasts and Comcast Cable Communications credit facilities (see Note 22 to our consolidated financial statements). NBCUniversal is subject to the covenants and restrictions set forth in the indentures governing its public debt securities and in the credit agreement governing its credit facility. We test for compliance with the covenants for each of our credit facilities on an ongoing basis. The only financial covenant in each of our credit facilities pertains to leverage (ratio of debt to operating income before depreciation and amortization). As of December 31, 2011, we and NBCUniversal each met this financial covenant by a significant margin. Neither we nor NBCUniversal expect to have to further reduce debt or improve operating results in order to continue to comply with this financial covenant. NBCUniversal Transaction We made a cash payment of $6.2 billion to GE at the close of the NBCUniversal transaction. We funded this payment with cash on hand and through the issuance of $650 million of commercial paper. We also agreed to share with GE certain tax benefits as they are realized, related to the form and structure of the transaction. As of the close of the NBCUniversal transaction on January 28, 2011, we consolidated $9.1 billion of NBCUniversal senior debt securities with maturities ranging from 2014 to 2041. We do not guarantee NBCUniversals debt obligations. Any future redemptions of GEs stake in NBCUniversal Holdings are expected to be funded primarily through NBCUniversals cash flows from operating activities and its borrowing capacity. If any borrowings by NBCUniversal to fund either of GEs two potential redemptions would result in NBCUniversal exceeding a certain leverage ratio or losing investment grade status or if it cannot otherwise fund such redemptions, we are committed to fund up to $2.875 billion in cash or our common stock for each of the two potential redemptions (for an aggregate of up to $5.75 billion, with amounts not used in the first redemption to be available for the second redemption) to the extent NBCUniversal Holdings cannot fund the redemptions. Universal Orlando Transaction On July 1, 2011, NBCUniversal acquired the remaining 50% equity interest in Universal Orlando that it did not already own for $1 billion. NBCUniversal funded this transaction with cash on hand, borrowings under its revolving credit facility and a $250 million 1 year note due to us, which was repaid in December 2011. Borrowings under the NBCUniversal revolving credit facility, along with cash on hand at Universal Orlando, were used to terminate Universal Orlandos existing $801 million term loan immediately following the acquisition. Receivables Monetization NBCUniversal monetizes certain of its accounts receivable under programs with a syndicate of banks. The effects of NBCUniversals monetization transactions are a component of net cash provided by operating activities in our consolidated statement of cash flows. See Note 18 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information. Film Financing In response to the high cost of producing films, we have entered into film cofinancing arrangements with third parties to jointly finance or distribute certain of our film productions. These arrangements can take various 63 Comcast 2011 Annual Report on Form 10 K Table of Contents forms. In most cases, the form of the arrangement involves the grant of an economic interest in a film to a third party investor. Investors generally assume the full risks and rewards of ownership proportionate to their ownership in the film. We account for our proceeds as a reduction to our capitalized film cost, and the related cash flows are a component of net cash provided by operating activities. Operating Activities Components of Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities Year ended December 31 (in millions) 2011 2010 2009 Operating income $ 10,721 $ 7,980 $ 7,214 Depreciation and amortization 7,636 6,616 6,500 Operating income before depreciation and amortization 18,357 14,596 13,714 Noncash share based compensation 344 300 257 Changes in operating assets and liabilities (603 ) (20 ) (450 ) Cash basis operating income 18,098 14,876 13,521 Payments of interest (2,441 ) (1,983 ) (2,040 ) Payments of income taxes (1,626 ) (1,864 ) (1,303 ) Proceeds from interest, dividends and other nonoperating items 314 150 103 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 14,345 $ 11,179 $ 10,281 The changes in operating assets and liabilities in 2011 and 2010 primarily relate to the timing of payments of operating items and payroll, and, in 2011 to an increase in film and television costs. The increase in interest payments in 2011 was primarily due to an increase in our outstanding debt as a result of the NBCUniversal transaction. The decrease in interest payments in 2010 was primarily due to the effects of early extinguishment costs associated with the repayment in 2009 of certain of our debt obligations prior to their maturity. The decrease in income tax payments in 2011 was primarily due to the net income tax benefit in 2011 of the 2010 economic stimulus legislation. The increase in income tax payments in 2010 was primarily due to increases in 2010 taxable income, partially offset by tax payments made in 2009 that related to prior years. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities consists primarily of cash paid for acquisitions, capital expenditures, intangible assets and investments. Capital Expenditures Our most significant recurring investing activity has been capital expenditures in our Cable Communications segment, and we expect that this will continue in the future. The table below summarizes the capital expenditures we incurred in our Cable Communications segment from 2009 through 2011. Year ended December 31 (in millions) 2011 2010 2009 Cable distribution system $ 1,715 $ 1,553 $ 1,570 Customer premises equipment 2,594 2,864 3,013 Vehicles and other equipment 446 388 399 Buildings and building improvements 51 48 48 Land 1 Total $ 4,806 $ 4,853 $ 5,031 Comcast 2011 Annual Report on Form 10 K 64 Table of Contents Cable Communications capital expenditures decreased slightly in 2011 primarily due to fewer equipment purchases and improved equipment pricing, partially offset by increased investment in business services and network capacity. Cable Communications capital expenditures decreased 3.5% in 2010 primarily due to improved equipment pricing, partially offset by increased investment in business services and strategic initiatives such as our all digital conversion and the continued deployment of DOCSIS 3.0 wideband technology. Capital expenditures in our NBCUniversal segments were not significant in 2011. Capital expenditures for 2012 and for subsequent years will depend on numerous factors, including acquisitions, competition, changes in technology, regulatory changes and the timing and rate of deployment of new services. In addition, we have invested and expect to continue to invest in existing and new attractions at our theme parks. Cash Paid for Intangible Assets In 2011, cash paid for intangible assets consisted primarily of software, as well as payments associated with the acquisition of intellectual property rights for use in our theme parks. Acquisitions On January 28, 2011, we closed the NBCUniversal transaction. On July 1, 2011, NBCUniversal acquired the remaining 50% equity interest in Universal Orlando that it did not already own. Our 2010 and 2009 acquisitions were not significant. See Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our acquisitions. Proceeds from Sales of Businesses and Investments In 2011, proceeds from sales of businesses and investments consisted primarily of the sale of the Philadelphia 76ers, NBCUniversals sale of a Spanish language local television station, and other investments. Purchases of Investments In 2011, we did not purchase any individually significant investments. In 2010, purchases of investments consisted primarily of the purchase of an equity method investment in the Houston Regional Sports Network. In 2009, purchases of investments consisted primarily of our additional investment in Clearwire. Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities consists primarily of repayments of debt, repurchases of our common stock and dividend payments, offset by proceeds from borrowings, net of repayments. Proceeds from borrowings fluctuate from year to year based on the amounts paid to fund acquisitions and debt repayments. We have made, and may from time to time in the future make, optional repayments on our debt obligations, which may include repurchases of our outstanding public notes and debentures, depending on various factors, such as market conditions. See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our financing activities, including details of our debt repayments and borrowings. Share Repurchases and Dividends In 2011, we repurchased 95 million shares of our Class A Special common stock for $2.1 billion, exhausting the then remaining availability under our share repurchase authorization. In February 2012, our Board of Directors approved a $6.5 billion share repurchase authorization, which does not have an expiration date. Under this authorization, we may repurchase shares in the open market or in private transactions. We intend to repurchase $3.0 billion during 2012, subject to market conditions. 65 Comcast 2011 Annual Report on Form 10 K Table of Contents Our Board of Directors declared quarterly dividends totaling $1.2 billion in 2011. We paid dividends of $1.2 billion in 2011. In February 2012, our Board of Directors approved an increase of 44% to $0.65 per share on an annualized basis and approved the first quarterly dividend of $0.1625 per share to be paid in April 2012. We expect to continue to pay quarterly dividends, although each dividend is subject to approval by our Board of Directors. The table below sets forth information on our share repurchases and dividends paid in 2011, 2010 and 2009. Contractual Obligations The table below presents our future contractual obligations as of December 31, 2011 by period in which the payments are due. Payment Due by Period (in millions) Total Year 1 Years 2 3 Years 4 5 More than 5 Debt obligations(a) $ 39,277 $ 1,352 $ 4,396 $ 6,606 $ 26,923 Capital lease obligations 32 15 7 5 5 Operating lease obligations 3,447 548 836 653 1,410 Purchase obligations(b) 39,690 7,391 7,319 6,179 18,801 Other long term liabilities reflected on the balance sheet(c) 8,752 403 3,427 961 3,961 Total(d) $ 91,198 $ 9,709 $ 15,985 $ 14,404 $ 51,100 Refer to Note 9 (long term debt) and Note 19 (commitments and contingencies) to our consolidated financial statements. (a) Excludes interest payments. (b) Purchase obligations consist of agreements to purchase goods and services that are legally binding on us and specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased and price provisions. Our purchase obligations related to our Cable Communications segment include programming contracts with cable networks and contracts with CPE manufacturers, communication vendors and other multichannel video providers for which we provide advertising sales representation and other contracts entered into in the normal course of business. Cable Communications programming contracts in the table above include amounts payable under fixed or minimum guaranteed commitments and do not represent the total fees that are expected to be paid under programming contracts, which we expect to be higher because these contracts are generally based on the number of subscribers receiving the programming. Our purchase obligations related to our NBCUniversal segments consist primarily of the commitments to acquire film and television programming, including U.S. television rights to future Olympic Games through 2020, NBCs Sunday Night Football through the 2022 23 season, including the Super Bowls in 2012, 2015, 2018 and 2021, NHL games through the 2020 21 season, Spanish language U.S. television rights to FIFA World Cup games through 2022, and certain PGA TOUR golf events through 2021; and obligations under various creative talent and employment agreements, including obligations to actors, producers, television personalities and executives, and various other television commitments. Purchase obligations do not include contracts with immaterial future commitments. (c) Other long term obligations consist primarily of prepaid forward sale agreements of equity securities we hold; subsidiary preferred shares; deferred compensation obligations; pension, postretirement and postemployment benefit obligations; the contingent consideration obligation related to the NBCUniversal transaction; and certain contractual obligations acquired in connection with the NBCUniversal and Universal Orlando transactions. These contractual obligations involve perpetual financial interests held by third parties in certain NBCUni Comcast 2011 Annual Report on Form 10 K 66 Table of Contents versal businesses and are based upon a percentage of future revenue of the specified businesses. One of these contractual obligations provides the third party with the option, beginning in 2017, to require NBCUniversal to purchase the interest for cash in an amount equal to the fair value of the estimated future payments. Reserves for uncertain tax positions of $1.4 billion are not included in the table above because we cannot make a reliable estimate of the period in which the unrecognized tax benefits will be recognized. Payments of $1.7 billion of participations and residuals and a $482 million liability that represents the fair value, as of the date of the acquisition, of certain assets we consolidate that serve as collateral for a debt obligation of an equity method investee are also not included in the table above because we cannot make a reliable estimate of the period in which these obligations will become payable. (d) Total contractual obligations are made up of the following components. (in millions) Liabilities recorded on the balance sheet $ 49,078 Commitments not recorded on the balance sheet 42,120 Total $ 91,198 GE Redemption Rights Under the terms of the operating agreement of NBCUniversal Holdings, during the six month period beginning July 28, 2014, GE has the right to cause NBCUniversal Holdings to redeem, in cash, half of GEs interest in NBCUniversal Holdings, and during the six month period beginning January 28, 2018, GE has the right to cause NBCUniversal Holdings to redeem GEs remaining interest, if any. Subject to various limitations, we are committed to fund up to $2.875 billion in cash or our common stock for each of the two redemptions (up to an aggregate of $5.75 billion) to the extent NBCUniversal Holdings cannot fund the redemptions, with amounts not used in the first redemption to be available for the second redemption. None of these amounts are included in the table above. See NBCUniversal Transaction under Introduction and Overview for additional details. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 31, 2011, we did not have any material off balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. Critical Accounting Judgments and Estimates The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and contingent liabilities. We base our judgments on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making estimates about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe our judgments and related estimates associated with the valuation and impairment testing of our cable franchise rights and the accounting for income taxes are critical in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. As a result of the NBCUniversal transaction, two additional areas have been identified as critical in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. The two critical accounting judgments and estimates are associated with the accounting for film and television costs and the valuation of acquisition related assets and liabilities. Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting judgments and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors, and the Audit Committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to them, which are presented below. See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our accounting policies with respect to these and other items. 67 Comcast 2011 Annual Report on Form 10 K Table of Contents Valuation and Impairment Testing of Cable Franchise Rights Our largest asset, our cable franchise rights, results from agreements we have with state and local governments that allow us to construct and operate a cable business within a specified geographic area. The value of a franchise is derived from the economic benefits we receive from the right to solicit new customers and to market new services, such as advanced video services and high speed Internet and voice services, in a particular service area. The amounts we record for cable franchise rights are primarily a result of cable system acquisitions. Typically when we acquire a cable system, the most significant asset we record is the value of the cable franchise rights. Often these cable system acquisitions include multiple franchise areas. We currently serve approximately 6,400 franchise areas in the United States. We have concluded that our cable franchise rights have an indefinite useful life since there are no legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other factors which limit the period over which these rights will contribute to our cash flows. Accordingly, we do not amortize our cable franchise rights but assess the carrying value of our cable franchise rights annually, or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may exceed the fair value (impairment testing). We estimate the fair value of our cable franchise rights primarily based on a discounted cash flow analysis that involves significant judgment. When analyzing the fair values indicated under the discounted cash flow models, we also consider multiples of operating income before depreciation and amortization generated by underlying assets, current market transactions and profitability information. If we were to determine that the value of our cable franchise rights was less than the carrying amount, we would recognize an impairment charge for the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of the assets. For purposes of our impairment testing, we have grouped the recorded values of our various cable franchise rights into our Cable Communications divisions or units of account. We evaluate the unit of account periodically to ensure our impairment testing is performed at an appropriate level. Since the adoption of the accounting guidance related to goodwill and intangible assets in 2002, we have not recorded any significant impairment charges to cable franchise rights as a result of our impairment testing. A future change in the unit of account could result in the recognition of an impairment charge. We could also record impairment charges in the future if there are changes in long term market conditions, in expected future operating results, or in federal or state regulations that prevent us from recovering the carrying value of these cable franchise rights. Assumptions made about increased competition and economic conditions could also impact the valuations used in future annual impairment testing and result in a reduction of fair values from those determined in the July 1, 2011 annual impairment testing. The table below illustrates the impairment related to our Cable Communications divisions that would have occurred had the hypothetical reductions in fair value existed at the time of our last annual impairment testing. Percent Hypothetical Reduction in Fair Value and Related Impairment (in millions) 10% 15% 20% 25% Northeast Division $ $ (492 ) $ (1,842 ) $ (3,192 ) Central Division (576 ) West Division (423 ) $ $ (492 ) $ (1,842 ) $ (4,191 ) Comcast 2011 Annual Report on Form 10 K 68 Table of Contents Income Taxes We base our provision for income taxes on our current period income, changes in our deferred income tax assets and liabilities, income tax rates, changes in estimates of our uncertain tax positions, and tax planning opportunities available in the jurisdictions in which we operate. We prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations, and we record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations. From time to time, we engage in transactions in which the tax consequences may be subject to uncertainty. In these cases, we evaluate our tax positions using the recognition threshold and the measurement attribute in accordance with the accounting guidance related to uncertain tax positions. Examples of these transactions include business acquisitions and disposals, including consideration paid or received in connection with these transactions, and certain financing transactions. Significant judgment is required in assessing and estimating the tax consequences of these transactions. We determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained on examination, including the resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. In evaluating whether a tax position has met the more likely than not recognition threshold, we presume that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. A tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to be recognized in our financial statements. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized when the position is ultimately resolved. We adjust our estimates periodically to reflect changes in circumstances in ongoing examinations by and settlements with the various taxing authorities, as well as changes in tax laws, regulations and precedent. We believe that adequate accruals have been made for income taxes. When uncertain tax positions are ultimately resolved, either individually or in the aggregate, differences between our estimated amounts and the actual amounts are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position but could possibly be material to our consolidated results of operations or cash flow for any one period. As of December 31, 2011, our uncertain tax positions and related accrued interest were $1.4 billion and $698 million, respectively. Film and Television Costs As a result of the NBCUniversal transaction, we capitalize film and television production costs, including direct costs, production overhead, print costs, development costs and interest. We amortize capitalized film and television production costs, as well as associated participation and residual payments, using the ratio of the current periods actual revenue to estimated total remaining gross revenue from all sources (ultimate revenue). Estimates of ultimate revenue have a significant impact on how quickly capitalized costs are amortized and, therefore, are updated regularly. Our estimates of ultimate revenue for films generally include revenue from all sources that are expected to be earned within 10 years from the date of a films initial release. These estimates are based on the historical performance of similar content, as well as factors unique to the content itself. The most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of ultimate revenue for a film intended for theatrical release is the films theatrical performance, as subsequent license revenue has historically exhibited a high correlation to theatrical performance. Upon a films release, our estimates of revenue from succeeding markets, including home entertainment and other distribution platforms, are revised based on historical relationships and an analysis of current market trends. With respect to television series or other owned television programming, the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of ultimate revenue is whether the series can be successfully licensed beyond its initial license. Initial estimates of ultimate revenue are limited to the amount of revenue contracted for each episode under the initial license. Once it is determined that a series can be licensed in subsequent platforms, revenue esti 69 Comcast 2011 Annual Report on Form 10 K Table of Contents mates for these platforms, such as U.S. and international syndication, home entertainment, and other distribution platforms, are included in ultimate revenue. In the case of television series and owned television programming, revenue estimates for produced episodes include revenue expected to be earned within 10 years of delivery of the initial episode or, if still in production, five years from the delivery of the most recent episode, if later. Capitalized film and television costs are subject to impairment testing when certain triggering events are identified. If the fair value of a film or owned television programming falls below its unamortized cost, we would recognize an impairment charge. The fair value assessment is generally based on estimated future discounted cash flows, which are supported by our internal forecasts. Fair Value of Acquisition Related Assets and Liabilities We allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities based on their estimated fair values. In determining fair value, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the recorded amounts. Managements estimates of fair value are based on assumptions believed to be reasonable but that are inherently uncertain. To assist in the estimation process, third party valuation specialists are engaged to assist in the valuation of certain of these assets and liabilities. Our judgments used to determine the estimated fair value assigned to each class of acquired assets and liabilities, as well as asset lives, have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. For instance, the determination of asset lives impacts our results of operations as different types of assets have different useful lives and certain assets may even be considered to have indefinite useful lives. Below is a summary of the methodologies and significant assumptions used in estimating the fair value of certain of NBCUniversals assets and liabilities, GEs redeemable noncontrolling interest and the preliminary fair value of Universal Orlandos assets and liabilities. Film and Television Costs Film and television costs consist of our estimates of fair value for released films and television series; completed, not released theatrical films; and television series and theatrical films in production and in development. Released theatrical films and television series and completed, not released theatrical films were valued using a multiperiod cash flow model, a form of the income approach. This measure of fair value requires considerable judgments about the timing of cash flows. Television series, theatrical films in production and in development and acquired programming rights were valued using a replacement cost method. Investments The estimates of fair value for significant investments in nonpublic investees were determined using an income approach. This method starts with a forecast of all of the expected future net cash flows associated with the investment and then involves adjusting the forecast to present value by applying an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk factors associated with the cash flow streams of the underlying business. Property and Equipment The estimated fair value of acquired property and equipment was primarily determined using a market approach for land, and a replacement cost approach for depreciable property and equipment. The market approach for land assets represents a sales comparison that measures the value of an asset through an analysis of sales of comparable properties. The replacement cost approach used for depreciable property and equipment measures the value of an asset by estimating the cost to acquire or construct comparable assets and adjusts for age and condition of the asset. Comcast 2011 Annual Report on Form 10 K 70 Table of Contents Intangible Assets Intangible assets primarily consist of our estimates of fair value for customer relationships with advertisers and multichannel video providers, each with an estimated useful life not to exceed 20 years, and indefinite lived trade names and FCC licenses. Relationships with advertisers and multichannel video providers were valued using a multiperiod cash flow model, a form of the income approach. This measure of fair value requires considerable judgments about future events, including contract renewal estimates, attrition and technology changes. In determining the estimated lives and method of amortization for finite lived intangibles, we use the method and life that most closely follows the undiscounted cash flows over the estimated life of the asset. Trade names were valued using the relief from royalty method, a form of the income approach. This measure of fair value requires considerable judgment about the value a market participant would be willing to pay in order to achieve the benefits associated with the trade name. FCC licenses were valued using the Greenfield method, a form of the income approach. This measure of fair value captures the future income potential assuming the license is used by a hypothetical start up operation. Guarantees and Other Obligations Contractual obligations were adjusted to market rates using a combination of discounted cash flows or market assumptions, when available. Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest The fair value component of the redeemable noncontrolling interest in NBCUniversal Holdings is based on an income approach, including assumptions related to expected future net cash flows, the timing and nature of tax attributes, and the redemption features. Item 7A: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest Rate Risk Management We maintain a mix of fixed rate and variable rate debt and we are exposed to the market risk of adverse changes in interest rates. In order to manage the cost and volatility relating to the interest cost of our outstanding debt, we enter into various interest rate risk management derivative transactions in accordance with our policies. We monitor our exposure to the risk of adverse changes in interest rates through the use of techniques that include market value and sensitivity analyses. We do not engage in any speculative or leveraged derivative transactions. Our interest rate derivative financial instruments, which may include swaps, rate locks, caps and collars, represent an integral part of our interest rate risk management program. Our interest rate derivative financial instruments reduced the portion of our total debt at fixed rates to 87.1% from 98.5% as of December 31, 2011. In 2011, 2010 and 2009, the effect of our interest rate derivative financial instruments was a decrease in our interest expense of approximately $136 million, $132 million and $104 million, respectively. Interest rate derivative financial instruments may have a significant effect on our interest expense in the future. 71 Comcast 2011 Annual Report on Form 10 K Table of Contents The table below summarizes the fair values and contract terms of financial instruments subject to interest rate risk maintained by us as of December 31, 2011.

The notional amounts do not represent our exposure to credit loss. The estimated fair value approximates the amount of payments to be made or proceeds to be received to settle the outstanding contracts, including accrued interest. We estimate interest rates on variable debt and swaps using the average implied forward London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) through the year of maturity based on the yield curve in effect on December 31, 2011, plus the applicable borrowing margin on December 31, 2011. Certain of our financial contracts include credit ratings based triggers that could affect our liquidity. In the ordinary course of business, some of our swaps could be subject to termination provisions if we do not maintain investment grade credit ratings. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, the estimated fair value of those swaps was an asset of $19 million and $26 million, respectively. The amount to be paid or received upon termination, if any, would be based on the fair value of the outstanding contracts at that time. See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our accounting policies for derivative financial instruments and Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our derivative financial instruments. Foreign Exchange Risk Management NBCUniversal has significant operations in a number of countries outside the U.S., and certain of NBCUniversals operations are conducted in foreign currencies. The value of these currencies fluctuates relative to the U.S. dollar. These changes could adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of our non U.S. revenue and operating costs and expenses and reduce international demand for our content, all of which could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations in a given period or in specific territories. As part of our overall strategy to manage the level of exposure to the risk of foreign exchange rate fluctuations, we enter into derivative financial instruments related to a significant portion of our foreign currency exposures. We enter into foreign currency forward contracts that change in value as foreign exchange rates change to protect the U.S. dollar equivalent value of our foreign currency assets, liabilities, commitments, and forecasted foreign currency revenue and expenses. In accordance with our policy, we hedge forecasted foreign currency transactions for periods generally not to exceed one year. In certain circumstances, we may hedge a transaction not to exceed 18 months. As of December 31, 2011, we had foreign exchange contracts on a total notional value of $767 million. As of December 31, 2011, these foreign exchange contracts had an aggregate estimated fair value loss of $2 million. Comcast 2011 Annual Report on Form 10 K 72 Table of Contents We have analyzed our foreign currency exposures related to NBCUniversals operations as of December 31, 2011, including our hedging contracts, to identify assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than their relevant functional currency. For these assets and liabilities, we then evaluated the effects of a 10% shift in currency exchange rates between those currencies and the U.S. dollar. The analysis of such shift in exchange rates indicated that there would be an immaterial effect on our 2011 income. We are also exposed to the market risks associated with fluctuations in foreign exchange rates as they relate to our foreign currency denominated debt obligations. Cross currency swaps are used to effectively convert fixed rate foreign currency denominated debt to fixed rate U.S. dollar denominated debt, hedging the risk that the cash flows related to annual interest payments and the payment of principal at maturity may be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates. The gains and losses on the cross currency swaps offset changes in the U.S. dollar equivalent value of the related exposures. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, the fair value of our cross currency swaps on our &pound;625 million principal amount of 5.50% senior notes due 2029 was a liability of $69 million and $29 million, respectively. See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our accounting policies for derivative financial instruments and Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our derivative financial instruments. Equity Price Risk Management We are exposed to the market risk of changes in the equity prices of our investments in marketable securities. We enter into various derivative transactions in accordance with our policies to manage the volatility relating to these exposures. Through market value and sensitivity analyses, we monitor our equity price risk exposures to ensure that the instruments are matched with the underlying assets or liabilities, reduce our risks relating to equity prices and maintain a high correlation to the risk inherent in the hedged item. To limit our exposure to and the benefits from price fluctuations in the common stock of some of our investments, we use equity derivative financial instruments. These derivative financial instruments, which are accounted for at fair value, may include equity collar agreements, prepaid forward sale agreements and indexed debt instruments. Except as described above in Item 7 under the heading Investment Income (Loss), Net, the changes in the fair value of the investments that we accounted for as available for sale or trading securities were substantially offset by the changes in the fair values of the equity derivative financial instruments. See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our accounting policies for derivative financial instruments and Note 6 and Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our investments and derivative financial instruments. Counterparty Credit Risk Management We manage the credit risks associated with our derivative financial instruments through diversification and the evaluation and monitoring of the creditworthiness of the counterparties. Although we may be exposed to losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties, we do not expect such losses, if any, to be significant. We have agreements with certain counterparties that include collateral provisions. These provisions require a party with an aggregate unrealized loss position in excess of certain thresholds to post cash collateral for the amount in excess of the threshold. The threshold levels in our collateral agreements are based on our and the counterparties credit ratings. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, neither we nor any of the counterparties were required to post collateral under the terms of the agreements. 73 Comcast 2011 Annual Report on Form 10 K Table of Contents
