MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS You should read the following discussion together with Item 6. Selected Consolidated Financial Data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. The discussion contains forward looking statements involving risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause our results to differ materially from expectations. Factors that might cause such differences include those described in Item 1A. Risk Factors under the heading Cautionary Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements, and elsewhere in this report. Overview Chipotle operates fast casual, fresh Mexican food restaurants serving burritos, tacos, bowls and salads. We began with a simple philosophy: demonstrate that food served fast doesnt have to be a traditional fast food experience. Over the years, that vision has evolved. Today, were working to change the way people think about and eat fast food. We do this by avoiding a formulaic approach when creating our restaurant experience, looking to fine dining restaurants for inspiration. We use high quality raw ingredients, classic cooking methods and a distinctive interior design, and have friendly people to take care of each customer features that are more frequently found in the world of fine dining. Our approach is also guided by our belief in an idea we call Food With Integrity which to us means finding the best raw ingredients from the best sources to include in the food we serve. Quite simply, we combine these ideas in a way that continues making Chipotle better all the time. As of December 31, 2006, we had 581 restaurants in 26 states throughout the United States and in the District of Columbia, including eight restaurants operated by franchisees. New restaurants have contributed substantially to our restaurant sales growth in the last three years. We opened 94 company operated restaurants during 2006, including 14 restaurants in six new markets. We expect to open between 95 and 105 restaurants in 2007 with approximately 10% to 15% of those openings located in new markets. We define a new market as one in which no restaurant was open as of the end of the prior year. In addition to growing our number of restaurants, we have experienced increases in our average restaurant sales of 11.9% in 2006 and 5.8% in 2005, driven primarily by strong comparable restaurant sales increases. We define average restaurant sales as the average trailing 12 month sales for company owned restaurants in operation for at least 13 months. Comparable restaurant sales include company owned restaurants only and represent the change in period over period sales for restaurants beginning in their 13th full month of operation. We expect our average restaurant sales to continue to increase in 2007, driven by comparable restaurant sales increases in the low to mid single digits. Comparable restaurant sales reflect positive period to period growth due to an increase in the number of transactions as well as menu price increases. However, as a result of several years of double digit comparable restaurant sales increases, we believe that comparable restaurant sales will not continue to increase at the rates we have achieved over the past several years. Highlights Initial Public Offering. On January 25, 2006, we completed our initial public offering of our class A common stock with net proceeds of $120.9 million. In conjunction with the offering, we issued a one time broad based grant of 774,150 stock options. The options vest on the third anniversary of the grant date. Compensation expense is generally recognized equally over the three year vesting period. McDonalds Disposition. In October 2006, McDonalds completed its disposition of its interest in us. Historically our relationship with McDonalds allowed us to obtain pricing benefits for some products and services. As a result of our separation from McDonalds, we have implemented new employee benefit plans, as well as new insurance, accounting, information technology, payroll and internal audit arrangements. We estimate the incremental costs of these new plans and arrangements, combined with additional supply costs as a result of our separation from McDonalds, to be between $1.0 million and $2.0 million in this first year of separation. 22 Table of Contents Promoting from Within. During 2006, we focused on ensuring our employee practices are as exceptional as our food. In an effort to achieve this, we initiated the Restaurateur program which is designed to encourage the restaurant manager position as a career opportunity for our top performing restaurant managers. In addition to excelling in providing quality food and customer service, restaurant managers are expected to contribute substantially to the development of their crew. Restaurateurs compensation is partially dependent on achieving these expectations. As a result, we expect this program will help us retain top performing restaurant managers. We currently have exceptional managers in the program, and we expect to promote more managers to Restaurateurs during 2007. We have seen that restaurant managers who were previously crew members operate better restaurants and are less likely to leave the company. Therefore, in addition to the Restaurateur program, we have created a new restaurant staffing structure to facilitate the development of crew members into restaurant managers. One primary goal of the new structure is to increase the number of restaurant managers hired from within our company and lower restaurant manager turnover. We implemented the new staffing structure in over 50% of our restaurants during 2006 and the remaining restaurants are expected to be converted in 2007. While we are still early in the programs, we have seen some positive results. Over half of the restaurant manager positions we filled in 2006 were staffed with internal promotions, up from 31% in 2005. Our turnover among restaurant management has decreased approximately 12% in 2006. We have not seen the full impact of the initiatives in our financial results in 2006, as implementing the Restaurateur program and the new staffing structure have resulted in incremental staff training and development costs. In 2007 and future years, we expect these initiatives to result in a majority of restaurant managers being hired through internal promotions. Throughput. We deliver our best customer service and hottest food when the line moves efficiently. During 2006, we continued to emphasize increasing the number of customers we serve during our busiest hours. We increased the number of fax and internet production lines in our restaurants which moved big orders off the front line, made improvements in the line and equipment configurations, and emphasized optimal utilization of our second cash register. We have seen success in this initiative through increased transactions during peak lunch and dinner hours and shorter wait time. We plan to continue this focus into 2007, including installing change machines in most of our restaurants as well as evaluating other equipment configurations and technological process improvements. Food With Integrity. During 2006, in addition to continuing to serve naturally raised pork in all of our restaurants, we made progress with our Food With Integrity initiative by increasing the amount of naturally raised beef and chicken we serve in our restaurants. In addition, now all of the sour cream we buy is made from milk that comes from cows that are not given growth hormones to stimulate milk production. We also continue to investigate the use of more sustainably grown produce and produce that is locally grown. 23 Table of Contents Restaurant Openings, Relocations and Closures The following table details restaurant unit data for our company owned and franchised locations for the years indicated. For the year ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Company owned Beginning of year 481 401 298 Openings 94 80 104 Relocations (1 ) Closures (1 ) Franchise sale (1 ) End of year 573 481 401 Franchises Beginning of year 8 8 7 Franchise purchase 1 End of year 8 8 8 Total restaurants at end of year 581 489 409 Results of Operations Our results of operations as a percentage of revenue and period over period variances are discussed in the following section. As our business grows, as we open more restaurants and hire more employees, our restaurant operating costs increase. Restaurant Sales For the years ended December 31, %increase2006 over2005 %increase2005 over2004 2006 2005 2004 (dollars in millions) Restaurant sales $ 819.8 $ 625.1 $ 468.6 31.1 % 33.4 % Average restaurant sales $ 1.611 $ 1.440 $ 1.361 Comparable restaurant sales increase 13.7 % 10.2 % 13.3 % Number of company operated restaurants as of the end of the year 573 481 401 Number of company operated restaurants opened in the year, net of closures and relocations 92 80 103 The significant factors contributing to our increase in sales in 2006 were new restaurant openings and strong comparable restaurant sales performance. Restaurant sales from restaurants not yet in the comparable base contributed to $110.8 million of the increase in sales in 2006, of which $46.5 million was attributable to restaurants opened during the year. In 2005, restaurant sales from restaurants not yet in the comparable restaurant base contributed to $109.1 million of the increase in sales, of which $47.3 million was attributable to restaurants opened in 2005. Comparable restaurant sales increases contributed to $84.1 million and $47.4 million of the increase in restaurant sales in 2006 and 2005, respectively. Comparable restaurant sales increases were driven primarily by an increasing awareness of our brand and our focus on improving service time. The substantial majority of our comparable restaurant sales growth was due to an increase in the number of transactions, and the remainder was driven primarily by menu price increases in markets in conjunction with the introduction of naturally raised beef or chicken. 24 Table of Contents Food, Beverage and Packaging Costs For the years ended December 31, %increase2006 over2005 %increase2005 over2004 2006 2005 2004 (dollars in millions) Food, beverage and packaging $ 258.0 $ 202.3 $ 154.1 27.5 % 31.2 % As a percentage of revenue 31.4 % 32.2 % 32.7 % Food, beverage and packaging costs decreased as a percentage of revenue in 2006 and 2005 due primarily to menu price increases and favorable commodity costs, partially offset by increased food costs associated with our Food With Integrity initiative. In 2005, the favorable commodity costs were partially offset by increased fuel costs. We do not expect the favorable commodity costs that we have seen over the past couple years to continue into 2007. We have already seen cost pressures as a result of the winter freeze in California and the southwestern U.S., which impacted citrus and avocado crops. Additionally, due to increased demand for ethanol the cost of corn has increased substantially, which we expect will lead to inflationary pressures on corn sourced ingredients including chicken and beef. Labor Costs For the years ended December 31, %increase2006 over2005 %increase2005 over2004 2006 2005 2004 (dollars in millions) Labor costs $ 231.1 $ 178.7 $ 139.5 29.3 % 28.1 % As a percentage of revenue 28.1 % 28.5 % 29.6 % In 2006, labor costs as a percentage of revenue decreased primarily due to higher average restaurant sales, partially offset by additional staffing costs as we transition to our new restaurant structure. We launched the new restaurant management structure in the second quarter of 2006 focusing on developing a defined path for crew to become restaurant managers. We expect that this will enable more promotions from within our existing crew, which we believe will lower turnover, result in better managers and decrease training costs. In 2005, labor costs as a percentage of revenue decreased largely due to improved employee efficiency. Employee efficiency resulted in increased number of transactions which did not require a corresponding increase in staff, and a gradual improvement over time in staffing our restaurants with the most appropriate number of crew members for each restaurant. Occupancy Costs For the years ended December 31, %increase2006 over2005 %increase2005 over2004 2006 2005 2004 (dollars in millions) Occupancy costs $ 58.8 $ 47.6 $ 36.2 23.4 % 31.6 % As a percentage of revenue 7.1 % 7.6 % 7.7 % In 2006 and 2005, occupancy costs decreased as a percentage of revenue due to higher average restaurant sales on a partially fixed cost base. The improvement in 2005 was partially offset by inflationary pressure on rents and the opening of restaurants in more expensive locations such as New York City. 25 Table of Contents Other Operating Costs For the years ended December 31, %increase2006 over2005 %increase2005 over2004 2006 2005 2004 (dollars in millions) Other operating costs $ 102.7 $ 83.0 $ 64.3 23.8 % 29.1 % As a percentage of revenue 12.5 % 13.2 % 13.7 % Other operating costs as a percentage of revenue declined primarily due to the effect of higher average restaurant sales on a partially fixed cost base and operating efficiencies that are realized as we both grow in size and become more experienced. We also realized a benefit in 2006 related to our promote from within strategy which reduced the dollars we spent on training external hires. General and Administrative Expenses For the years endedDecember 31, %increase2006 over2005 %increase2005 over2004 2006 2005 2004 (dollars in millions) General and administrative expense $ 65.3 $ 52.0 $ 44.8 25.6 % 15.9 % As a percentage of revenue 7.9 % 8.3 % 9.5 % The increase in general and administrative expenses in 2006 primarily resulted from increased employee related expenses driven by hiring more employees over the past two years, increase in stock based compensation expense resulting from the one time broad based option grant in conjunction with our initial public offering, incremental legal and audit costs due to growth and becoming a public company, costs incurred in conjunction with the secondary and exchange offers related to McDonalds disposition of its interest in us, and increases in severance expense. The increase in general and administrative expenses in 2005 primarily resulted from hiring more employees as we grew and an increase in stock based compensation expense resulting from the adoption of FASB Statement No. 123(R), Stock based Compensation (FAS 123R). The increase in expense in 2005 was offset by the $4.0 million charge in 2004 to establish a reserve related to potential credit card liabilities. As a percentage of total revenue, general and administrative expenses decreased in 2006 and 2005 due primarily to the effect of higher restaurant sales on a partially fixed cost base. Depreciation and amortization For the years endedDecember 31, %increase2006 over2005 %increase2005 over2004 2006 2005 2004 (dollars in millions) Depreciation and amortization $ 34.3 $ 28.0 $ 21.8 22.2 % 28.5 % As a percentage of revenue 4.2 % 4.5 % 4.6 % Depreciation and amortization increased in 2006 and 2005 primarily due to the 278 total restaurants openings from January 1, 2004 to December 31, 2006. In addition, in 2006 we accelerated depreciation on certain restaurant and office locations as a result of relocations or closures which have occurred or will occur. As a percentage of total revenue, depreciation and amortization has decreased as a result of higher average restaurant sales on a partially fixed cost base. 26 Table of Contents Pre opening costs For the years endedDecember 31, %increase2006 over2005 %decrease2005 over2004 2006 2005 2004 (dollars in millions) Pre opening costs $ 6.8 $ 2.0 $ 2.2 * (10.1 )% As a percentage of revenue 0.8 % 0.3 % 0.5 % * not meaningful Pre opening costs increased in 2006 primarily as a result of the adoption of FASB Staff Position No. FAS 13 1, Accounting for Rental Costs Incurred during a Construction Period (FSP 13 1). FSP 13 1 requires rental costs associated with ground or building operating leases incurred during a construction period to be recognized as expense. FSP 13 1 applies to reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2005. Accordingly, we recognized additional pre opening costs of $3.8 million in 2006 under this principle. Had FSP 13 1 been effective prior to 2006, we would have recognized additional pre opening costs of approximately $4.2 million in 2005 and $3.6 million in 2004. Loss on Disposal of Assets For the years endedDecember 31, %increase2006 over2005 %increase2005 over2004 2006 2005 2004 (dollars in millions) Loss on disposal of assets $ 4.0 $ 3.1 $ 1.7 27.7 % 85.9 % As a percentage of revenue 0.5 % 0.5 % 0.4 % The increase in 2006 in loss on disposal of assets was due to a pending closure of one restaurant at the landlords request, the closure of one restaurant due to structural damage in the leased space and the write off of obsolete or unused equipment. The increase in 2005 was largely due to additional write offs associated with investigating potential restaurant sites that we considered but subsequently rejected, as well as write offs of obsolete equipment as a result of software upgrades. Interest Income For the years endedDecember 31, %increase2006 over2005 %increase2005 over2004 2006 2005 2004 (dollars in millions) Interest income $ 6.6 $ 0.2 * * As a percentage of revenue 0.8 % * not meaningful Interest income increased as a result of investing our incremental cash and cash equivalents in short term investments with maturities of three months or less. Our incremental cash and cash equivalents resulted from our initial public offering proceeds and cash from operations. Income Tax (Provision) Benefit For the years endedDecember 31, %increase2006 over2005 %increase2005 over2004 2006 2005 2004 (dollars in millions) Income tax (provision) benefit $ (26.8 ) $ 7.5 * * As a percentage of revenue (3.3 )% 1.2 % * not meaningful 27 Table of Contents The total tax provision for 2006 of $26.8 million represents a 39.3% effective tax rate. During 2005, we determined that it was more likely than not we would realize our deferred tax assets and we reversed our valuation allowance of $20.3 million resulting in a $7.5 million tax benefit and an effective tax rate benefit of 24.7%. Excluding the $20.3 million non recurring tax benefit, the effective tax rate for 2005 would have been 42.6%. The decrease in the effective tax rate is largely due to a decrease in the estimated statutory state rate for enacted changes in state tax laws, the favorable impact of changes in our state tax footprint due to growth, the declining impact of meals and entertainment disallowance as taxable income increases, our investing in tax exempt securities and a permanent difference related to stock based compensation in 2005. Quarterly Financial Data/Seasonality The following table presents consolidated statement of income data for each of the eight quarters ended December 31, 2006. The operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results for any subsequent quarter. 2006 Quarters Ended Mar. 31 June 30 Sept. 30 Dec. 31 (dollars in millions) Revenue $ 187.0 $ 204.9 $ 211.3 $ 219.7 Operating income $ 12.7 $ 15.9 $ 17.9 $ 15.5 Net income $ 8.0 $ 10.8 $ 11.8 $ 10.8 Number of restaurants opened in quarter 15 14 30 35 Comparable restaurant sales increase 19.7 % 14.5 % 11.6 % 10.1 % 2005 Quarters Ended Mar. 31 June 30 Sept. 30 Dec. 31 (dollars in millions) Revenue $ 133.4 $ 156.3 $ 164.7 $ 173.3 Operating income $ 4.4 $ 9.3 $ 9.5 $ 7.7 Net income $ 2.6 $ 25.7 $ 5.1 $ 4.3 Number of restaurants opened in quarter 18 17 17 28 Comparable restaurant sales increase 4.1 % 9.6 % 11.5 % 14.3 % Seasonal factors cause our profitability to fluctuate from quarter to quarter. Historically, our restaurant sales are lower in the first and fourth quarters due, in part, to the holiday season and because fewer people eat out during periods of inclement weather (the winter months) than during periods of mild or warm weather (the spring, summer and fall months). Other factors also have a seasonal effect on our results. For example, restaurants located near colleges and universities generally do more business during the academic year. The number of trading days in a quarter can also affect our results. Overall, on an annual basis, changes in trading dates do not have a significant impact on our results. Our quarterly results are also affected by other factors such as the number of new restaurants opened in a quarter and unanticipated events. New restaurants typically have lower margins following opening as a result of the expenses associated with opening new restaurants and their operating inefficiencies in the months immediately following opening. Because we have tended to open more new restaurants later in the fiscal year, our fourth quarter net income may be lower than in other quarters. In addition, unanticipated events also impact our results. For example, in the second quarter of 2005, we determined that it was more likely than not that we would realize our deferred tax assets and we reversed our valuation allowance of $20.3 million, resulting in a net tax benefit of $16.7 million in that quarter. Accordingly, results for a particular quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary liquidity and capital requirements are for new restaurant construction, working capital and general corporate needs. Until our initial public offering, we had financed these requirements primarily through 28 Table of Contents equity sales to McDonalds and others as well as through cash flows from operations. In January 2006 we completed our initial public offering of class A common stock, receiving net proceeds of approximately $120.9 million. We expect to use the net proceeds from the offering, together with cash flow from operations, to provide additional long term capital to support the growth of our business (primarily through opening restaurants), to continue to maintain our existing restaurants and for general corporate purposes. In October 2006, we entered into a revolving line of credit with a principal amount of $10 million which expires in August 2007. The line of credit is for support of letters of credit we issue in the normal course of business and bears interest at our option at the Prime rate, a fixed rate determined by the bank or an adjusted LIBOR rate. We havent required significant working capital because customers pay using cash or credit cards and because our operations do not require significant receivables, nor do they require significant inventories due, in part, to our use of various fresh ingredients. In addition, we generally have the right to pay for the purchase of food, beverage and supplies some time after the receipt of those items, generally within ten days, thereby reducing the need for incremental working capital to support growth. Operating Activities. Net cash provided by operating activities was $103.6 million for 2006 compared to $77.4 million for 2005. The $26.2 million increase was primarily attributable to a $24.1 million improvement in net income, excluding the $20.3 million one time non cash tax benefit from the reversal of the valuation allowance. The increase in net income was driven by higher average restaurant sales, higher restaurant margins and significantly more restaurants in operation. Net cash provided by operating activities was $77.4 million for 2005 compared to $39.7 million for 2004. The $37.8 million increase was primarily attributable to a $31.6 million improvement in net income driven by higher average restaurant sales, higher restaurant margins and significantly more restaurants in operation. Investing Activities. Net cash used in investing activities was $97.3 million for 2006 compared to $83.0 million for 2005. The $14.3 million increase related to higher capital expenditures in 2006 as we opened 94 restaurants in 2006, compared with 80 restaurants in 2005. Net cash used in investing activities was $83.0 million for 2005 compared to $95.6 million in 2004. The $12.6 million decrease related to lower capital expenditures in 2005 as we opened 80 restaurants in 2005, compared with 104 restaurants in 2004. We categorize our restaurants as either end caps (at the end of a line of restaurants), in lines (in a line of restaurants), free standing or urban. As we expand into central urban areas, our average costs to open new restaurants will increase due to more significant reconstruction work that often needs to be done on those sites. Our total capital expenditures for 2006 were $97.3 million, and we expect to incur capital expenditures of about $115 million in 2007, relating primarily to our construction of new restaurants in both periods. In 2006, we spent on average about $860,000 in development and construction costs per restaurant, with end caps costing about $680,000, in lines costing about $795,000, free standing costing about $1.3 million and urban costing about $2.2 million (in each case, reduced for landlord reimbursements). The average development and construction costs per restaurant decreased from $910,000 in 2005 due to a decline in the number of free standing restaurants, adding smaller stores to the mix and a focus on cost control. In 2007, we expect average development and construction costs to be approximately $900,000 per restaurant as a result of developing in higher cost markets such as Boston and Philadelphia, a slight increase in free standing restaurants as well as inflation in construction costs. Financing Activities. Net cash provided by financing activities was $147.3 million in 2006 compared to $5.7 million in 2005. The $141.6 million increase was attributable to $120.9 million net proceeds from our initial public offering and the $19.5 million tax sharing payment received from McDonalds. Net cash provided by financing activities was $5.7 million in 2005 compared to $55.9 million in 2004. The $50.3 million decrease was attributable to decreased financing requirements as a result of improvements in net cash provided by operating activities and fewer restaurant openings in 2005 as compared to 2004. 29 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Expenditures. We expect to use the proceeds from the initial public offering to provide additional long term capital to support the growth of our business (primarily through opening restaurants) and to continue to maintain our existing restaurants and for general corporate purposes. In accordance with a tax allocation agreement we have with McDonalds, McDonalds agreed to compensate us for NOLs and tax credits it used that were attributable to our operations. We expect to receive payment for the federal and some state NOLs that we have not utilized on a stand alone basis as we make estimated tax payments, but no later than the first quarter of 2008. As of December 31, 2006, the amount owed by McDonalds totaled $8.8 million. We believe that cash from operations, together with the net proceeds from the initial public offering will be enough to meet ongoing capital expenditures, working capital requirements and other cash needs over at least the next 24 months. Contractual Obligations Our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2006 were as follows: Payments Due by Period Total 1 year 2 3 years 4 5 years After 5 years (in thousands) Operating leases $ 1,086,224 $ 61,641 $ 124,490 $ 123,616 $ 776,477 Deemed landlord financing 7,756 371 742 775 5,868 Other contractual obligations1 13,361 13,266 95 Total contractual cash obligations $ 1,107,341 $ 75,278 $ 125,327 $ 124,391 $ 782,345 1 We enter into various purchase obligations in the ordinary course of business. Those that are binding primarily relate to amounts owed under contractor and subcontractor agreements and orders submitted for equipment for restaurants under construction. Were obligated under non cancelable leases for our restaurants and administrative offices. Our leases generally have initial terms of either five to ten years with two or more five year extensions, for end cap and in line restaurants, or 15 to 20 years with several five year extensions, for free standing restaurants. Our leases generally require us to pay a proportionate share of real estate taxes, insurance, common charges and other operating costs. Some restaurant leases provide for contingent rental payments based on sales thresholds, although we generally do not expect to pay significant contingent rent on these properties based on the thresholds in those leases. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, we had no off balance sheet arrangements or obligations. Inflation The primary areas of our operations affected by inflation are food, fuel, labor, insurance, and utility costs and materials used in the construction of our restaurants. Although almost all of our crew members make more than the minimum wage, increases in the applicable federal or state minimum wage will have an impact on our labor costs. Additionally, many of our leases require us to pay taxes, maintenance, utilities and insurance, all of which are generally subject to inflationary increases. Critical Accounting Estimates We describe our significant accounting policies in Note 1 of our consolidated financial statements. Critical accounting estimates are those that we believe are both significant and that require us to make difficult, 30 Table of Contents subjective or complex judgments, often because we need to estimate the effect of inherently uncertain matters. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experiences and various other factors that we believe to be appropriate under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates, and we might obtain different estimates if we used different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting estimates affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements: Leases We lease most of our restaurant locations. Our leases contain escalating rentals over the lease term as well as optional renewal periods. We account for our leases under FASB Statement No. 13, Accounting for Leases (FAS 13) which requires rent to be recognized on a straight line basis over the lease term including reasonably assured renewal periods. We have estimated that our lease term, including reasonably assured renewal periods, is the lesser of the lease term or 20 years. If the estimate of our reasonably assured lease terms were changed our depreciation and rent expense could differ materially. Stock based Compensation Effective January 1, 2005, we adopted FAS 123R which requires recognition of the fair value of stock based compensation over the vesting period of the option. We use the Black Scholes valuation model to determine the fair value of our stock options, which requires assumptions to be made regarding our stock price volatility, the expected life of the option and expected dividend rates. The volatility assumptions were derived from our annual independent stock valuations and historical volatilities of competitors whose shares are traded in the public markets and are adjusted to reflect anticipated behavior specific to us. Had we arrived at different assumptions of stock price volatility or expected lives of our options, our stock based compensation expense and results of operations could have been different. Insurance Liability We maintain various insurance policies for employee health, workers compensation, general liability and property damage. Pursuant to these policies we are either responsible for losses up to certain limits or are self insured but have third party insurance coverage to limit exposure to these claims. We record a liability that represents our estimated cost of claims incurred and unpaid as of the balance sheet date. Our estimated liability is not discounted and is based on a number of assumptions and factors, including historical trends, actuarial assumptions and economic conditions, and is closely monitored and adjusted when warranted by changing circumstances. In addition, our history of claims experience is short and our significant growth rate could affect the accuracy of estimates based on historical experience. Should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what was estimated or medical costs increase beyond what was expected, our accrued liabilities might not be sufficient and additional expenses may be recorded. Actual claims experience could also be more favorable than estimated resulting in expense reductions. Unanticipated changes may produce materially different amounts of expense than that reported under these programs. Reserves/Contingencies for Litigation and Other Matters We are involved in various claims and legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of business. These actions are subject to many uncertainties, and we cannot predict the outcomes with any degree of certainty. Consequently, we were unable to ascertain the ultimate aggregate amount of monetary liability or financial impact with respect to these matters as of December 31, 2006 and 2005. Once resolved, however, these actions may affect our operating results and cash flows. In addition, were involved in claims relating to the possible theft of our customers credit and debit card data. In 2004, we recorded charges of $4.0 million to establish a reserve for claims seeking reimbursement for purportedly fraudulent credit and debit card charges and the cost of replacing cards and monitoring expenses and fees. As of December 31, 2006, the remaining reserve was $1.2 million. As the situation develops and more information becomes available, the amount of the reserve may increase or decrease accordingly. See Item 1A. Risk Factors We may have experienced a security breach with 31 Table of Contents respect to certain customer credit and debit card data, and weve incurred and may continue to incur substantial costs as a result of this matter. We may also incur costs resulting from other security risks we may face in connection with our electronic processing and transmission of confidential customer information. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) issued EITF Issue No. 06 2, Accounting for Sabbatical Leave and Other Similar Benefits Pursuant to FASB Statement No. 43 Accounting for Compensated Absences (EITF 06 2). The EITF concluded that sabbatical leave accumulates pursuant to the criteria of FASB Standard No. 43 Accounting for Compensated Absences (FAS 43) and therefore the benefit should be accrued if the remaining criteria of FAS 43 are met. EITF 06 2 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. EITF 06 2 can be applied as a change in accounting principle either as a cumulative effect adjustment to beginning retained earnings in the year of adoption or as retrospective application to all prior periods. We have elected to adopt EITF 06 2 as a cumulative effect adjustment to beginning retained earnings. The actuarially determined estimated accrued sabbatical balance as of December 31, 2006, is $2.6 million. In September 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48). FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance on de recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. The interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. The cumulative effect upon adoption of applying the provision shall be reported as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings for that fiscal year, presented separately. We do not expect the adoption of FIN 48 to have a material impact on our financial statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position AUG AIR 1, Accounting for Planned Major Maintenance Activities (FSP AUG 1). FSP AUG 1 prohibits the use of the accrue in advance method of accounting for costs of planned major maintenance projects. The statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. We do not utilize the accrue in advance method and therefore do not expect the adoption of FSP AUG 1 to have a material impact on our financial statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued FASB Standard No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (FAS 157). FAS 157 provides a definition of fair value and acceptable methods of measuring fair value. We do not expect the adoption of FAS 157 to have a material impact on our financial statements. In September 2006, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements (SAB 108). SAB 108 provides guidance on how prior year misstatements should be taken into consideration when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements for purposes of determining whether the current years financial statements are materially misstated. SAB 108 permits registrants to record the cumulative effect of initial adoption by recording the necessary correcting adjustments to the carrying values of assets and liabilities as of the beginning of that year with the offsetting adjustment recorded to the opening balance of retained earnings only if material under the dual method. SAB 108 is effective for fiscal years ending on or after November 15, 2006. We have assessed the effect of adopting this guidance and has determined that there will be no impact on our consolidated financial statements. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK Changing Interest Rates Were exposed to interest rate risk through the investment of our cash and cash equivalents. Since the completion of our initial public offering we have invested our cash in short term investments with maturities of three months or less. Changes in interest rates affect the interest income we earn, and therefore impact our cash flows and results of operations. As of December 31, 2006, we had $150.0 million deposited in short term investments bearing a weighted average interest rate of 4.61%. 32 Table of Contents Commodity Price Risks Were also exposed to commodity price risks. Many of the ingredients we use to prepare our food, as well as our packaging materials, are commodities that are affected by weather, seasonality, production, availability and other factors outside our control. We work closely with our suppliers and use a mix of forward pricing protocols under which we agree with our supplier on fixed prices for deliveries at sometime in the future, fixed pricing protocols under which we agree on a fixed price with our supplier for the duration of that protocol, and formula pricing protocols under which the prices we pay are based on specified formula related to the prices of the goods, such as spot prices. Though we do not have long term supply contracts or guaranteed purchase amounts, our pricing protocols with suppliers can remain in effect for periods ranging from one month to a year, depending on the outlook for prices of the particular ingredient. We also sometimes buy supplies at current market or spot prices. Weve tried to increase, where necessary, the number of suppliers for our ingredients, which we believe can help mitigate pricing volatility, and we follow industry news, trade issues, weather, crises and other world events that may affect supply prices. Long term increases in ingredient prices could adversely affect our future results if we could not increase menu prices at the same pace for competitive or other reasons. Similarly, if we believe the ingredient price increase to be short in duration we may choose not to pass on the cost increases, which could adversely affect our short term financial results. 33 Table of Contents 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS You should read the following discussion together with Item 6. Selected Consolidated Financial Data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. The discussion contains forward looking statements involving risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause our results to differ materially from expectations. Factors that might cause such differences include those described in Item 1A. Risk Factors under the heading Cautionary Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements, and elsewhere in this report. Overview Chipotle operates fast casual, fresh Mexican food restaurants serving burritos, tacos, bowls and salads. We began with a simple philosophy: demonstrate that food served fast doesnt have to be a traditional fast food experience. Over the years, that vision has evolved. Today, were working to change the way people think about and eat fast food. We do this by avoiding a formulaic approach when creating our restaurant experience, looking to fine dining restaurants for inspiration. We use high quality raw ingredients, classic cooking methods and a distinctive interior design, and have friendly people to take care of each customer features that are more frequently found in the world of fine dining. Our approach is also guided by our belief in an idea we call Food With Integrity which to us means finding the best raw ingredients from the best sources to include in the food we serve. Quite simply, we combine these ideas in a way that continues making Chipotle better all the time. As of December 31, 2006, we had 581 restaurants in 26 states throughout the United States and in the District of Columbia, including eight restaurants operated by franchisees. New restaurants have contributed substantially to our restaurant sales growth in the last three years. We opened 94 company operated restaurants during 2006, including 14 restaurants in six new markets. We expect to open between 95 and 105 restaurants in 2007 with approximately 10% to 15% of those openings located in new markets. We define a new market as one in which no restaurant was open as of the end of the prior year. In addition to growing our number of restaurants, we have experienced increases in our average restaurant sales of 11.9% in 2006 and 5.8% in 2005, driven primarily by strong comparable restaurant sales increases. We define average restaurant sales as the average trailing 12 month sales for company owned restaurants in operation for at least 13 months. Comparable restaurant sales include company owned restaurants only and represent the change in period over period sales for restaurants beginning in their 13th full month of operation. We expect our average restaurant sales to continue to increase in 2007, driven by comparable restaurant sales increases in the low to mid single digits. Comparable restaurant sales reflect positive period to period growth due to an increase in the number of transactions as well as menu price increases. However, as a result of several years of double digit comparable restaurant sales increases, we believe that comparable restaurant sales will not continue to increase at the rates we have achieved over the past several years. Highlights Initial Public Offering. On January 25, 2006, we completed our initial public offering of our class A common stock with net proceeds of $120.9 million. In conjunction with the offering, we issued a one time broad based grant of 774,150 stock options. The options vest on the third anniversary of the grant date. Compensation expense is generally recognized equally over the three year vesting period. McDonalds Disposition. In October 2006, McDonalds completed its disposition of its interest in us. Historically our relationship with McDonalds allowed us to obtain pricing benefits for some products and services. As a result of our separation from McDonalds, we have implemented new employee benefit plans, as well as new insurance, accounting, information technology, payroll and internal audit arrangements. We estimate the incremental costs of these new plans and arrangements, combined with additional supply costs as a result of our separation from McDonalds, to be between $1.0 million and $2.0 million in this first year of separation. 22 Table of Contents Promoting from Within. During 2006, we focused on ensuring our employee practices are as exceptional as our food. In an effort to achieve this, we initiated the Restaurateur program which is designed to encourage the restaurant manager position as a career opportunity for our top performing restaurant managers. In addition to excelling in providing quality food and customer service, restaurant managers are expected to contribute substantially to the development of their crew. Restaurateurs compensation is partially dependent on achieving these expectations. As a result, we expect this program will help us retain top performing restaurant managers. We currently have exceptional managers in the program, and we expect to promote more managers to Restaurateurs during 2007. We have seen that restaurant managers who were previously crew members operate better restaurants and are less likely to leave the company. Therefore, in addition to the Restaurateur program, we have created a new restaurant staffing structure to facilitate the development of crew members into restaurant managers. One primary goal of the new structure is to increase the number of restaurant managers hired from within our company and lower restaurant manager turnover. We implemented the new staffing structure in over 50% of our restaurants during 2006 and the remaining restaurants are expected to be converted in 2007. While we are still early in the programs, we have seen some positive results. Over half of the restaurant manager positions we filled in 2006 were staffed with internal promotions, up from 31% in 2005. Our turnover among restaurant management has decreased approximately 12% in 2006. We have not seen the full impact of the initiatives in our financial results in 2006, as implementing the Restaurateur program and the new staffing structure have resulted in incremental staff training and development costs. In 2007 and future years, we expect these initiatives to result in a majority of restaurant managers being hired through internal promotions. Throughput. We deliver our best customer service and hottest food when the line moves efficiently. During 2006, we continued to emphasize increasing the number of customers we serve during our busiest hours. We increased the number of fax and internet production lines in our restaurants which moved big orders off the front line, made improvements in the line and equipment configurations, and emphasized optimal utilization of our second cash register. We have seen success in this initiative through increased transactions during peak lunch and dinner hours and shorter wait time. We plan to continue this focus into 2007, including installing change machines in most of our restaurants as well as evaluating other equipment configurations and technological process improvements. Food With Integrity. During 2006, in addition to continuing to serve naturally raised pork in all of our restaurants, we made progress with our Food With Integrity initiative by increasing the amount of naturally raised beef and chicken we serve in our restaurants. In addition, now all of the sour cream we buy is made from milk that comes from cows that are not given growth hormones to stimulate milk production. We also continue to investigate the use of more sustainably grown produce and produce that is locally grown. 23 Table of Contents Restaurant Openings, Relocations and Closures The following table details restaurant unit data for our company owned and franchised locations for the years indicated. For the year ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Company owned Beginning of year 481 401 298 Openings 94 80 104 Relocations (1 ) Closures (1 ) Franchise sale (1 ) End of year 573 481 401 Franchises Beginning of year 8 8 7 Franchise purchase 1 End of year 8 8 8 Total restaurants at end of year 581 489 409 Results of Operations Our results of operations as a percentage of revenue and period over period variances are discussed in the following section. As our business grows, as we open more restaurants and hire more employees, our restaurant operating costs increase. Restaurant Sales For the years ended December 31, %increase2006 over2005 %increase2005 over2004 2006 2005 2004 (dollars in millions) Restaurant sales $ 819.8 $ 625.1 $ 468.6 31.1 % 33.4 % Average restaurant sales $ 1.611 $ 1.440 $ 1.361 Comparable restaurant sales increase 13.7 % 10.2 % 13.3 % Number of company operated restaurants as of the end of the year 573 481 401 Number of company operated restaurants opened in the year, net of closures and relocations 92 80 103 The significant factors contributing to our increase in sales in 2006 were new restaurant openings and strong comparable restaurant sales performance. Restaurant sales from restaurants not yet in the comparable base contributed to $110.8 million of the increase in sales in 2006, of which $46.5 million was attributable to restaurants opened during the year. In 2005, restaurant sales from restaurants not yet in the comparable restaurant base contributed to $109.1 million of the increase in sales, of which $47.3 million was attributable to restaurants opened in 2005. Comparable restaurant sales increases contributed to $84.1 million and $47.4 million of the increase in restaurant sales in 2006 and 2005, respectively. Comparable restaurant sales increases were driven primarily by an increasing awareness of our brand and our focus on improving service time. The substantial majority of our comparable restaurant sales growth was due to an increase in the number of transactions, and the remainder was driven primarily by menu price increases in markets in conjunction with the introduction of naturally raised beef or chicken. 24 Table of Contents Food, Beverage and Packaging Costs For the years ended December 31, %increase2006 over2005 %increase2005 over2004 2006 2005 2004 (dollars in millions) Food, beverage and packaging $ 258.0 $ 202.3 $ 154.1 27.5 % 31.2 % As a percentage of revenue 31.4 % 32.2 % 32.7 % Food, beverage and packaging costs decreased as a percentage of revenue in 2006 and 2005 due primarily to menu price increases and favorable commodity costs, partially offset by increased food costs associated with our Food With Integrity initiative. In 2005, the favorable commodity costs were partially offset by increased fuel costs. We do not expect the favorable commodity costs that we have seen over the past couple years to continue into 2007. We have already seen cost pressures as a result of the winter freeze in California and the southwestern U.S., which impacted citrus and avocado crops. Additionally, due to increased demand for ethanol the cost of corn has increased substantially, which we expect will lead to inflationary pressures on corn sourced ingredients including chicken and beef. Labor Costs For the years ended December 31, %increase2006 over2005 %increase2005 over2004 2006 2005 2004 (dollars in millions) Labor costs $ 231.1 $ 178.7 $ 139.5 29.3 % 28.1 % As a percentage of revenue 28.1 % 28.5 % 29.6 % In 2006, labor costs as a percentage of revenue decreased primarily due to higher average restaurant sales, partially offset by additional staffing costs as we transition to our new restaurant structure. We launched the new restaurant management structure in the second quarter of 2006 focusing on developing a defined path for crew to become restaurant managers. We expect that this will enable more promotions from within our existing crew, which we believe will lower turnover, result in better managers and decrease training costs. In 2005, labor costs as a percentage of revenue decreased largely due to improved employee efficiency. Employee efficiency resulted in increased number of transactions which did not require a corresponding increase in staff, and a gradual improvement over time in staffing our restaurants with the most appropriate number of crew members for each restaurant. Occupancy Costs For the years ended December 31, %increase2006 over2005 %increase2005 over2004 2006 2005 2004 (dollars in millions) Occupancy costs $ 58.8 $ 47.6 $ 36.2 23.4 % 31.6 % As a percentage of revenue 7.1 % 7.6 % 7.7 % In 2006 and 2005, occupancy costs decreased as a percentage of revenue due to higher average restaurant sales on a partially fixed cost base. The improvement in 2005 was partially offset by inflationary pressure on rents and the opening of restaurants in more expensive locations such as New York City. 25 Table of Contents Other Operating Costs For the years ended December 31, %increase2006 over2005 %increase2005 over2004 2006 2005 2004 (dollars in millions) Other operating costs $ 102.7 $ 83.0 $ 64.3 23.8 % 29.1 % As a percentage of revenue 12.5 % 13.2 % 13.7 % Other operating costs as a percentage of revenue declined primarily due to the effect of higher average restaurant sales on a partially fixed cost base and operating efficiencies that are realized as we both grow in size and become more experienced. We also realized a benefit in 2006 related to our promote from within strategy which reduced the dollars we spent on training external hires. General and Administrative Expenses For the years endedDecember 31, %increase2006 over2005 %increase2005 over2004 2006 2005 2004 (dollars in millions) General and administrative expense $ 65.3 $ 52.0 $ 44.8 25.6 % 15.9 % As a percentage of revenue 7.9 % 8.3 % 9.5 % The increase in general and administrative expenses in 2006 primarily resulted from increased employee related expenses driven by hiring more employees over the past two years, increase in stock based compensation expense resulting from the one time broad based option grant in conjunction with our initial public offering, incremental legal and audit costs due to growth and becoming a public company, costs incurred in conjunction with the secondary and exchange offers related to McDonalds disposition of its interest in us, and increases in severance expense. The increase in general and administrative expenses in 2005 primarily resulted from hiring more employees as we grew and an increase in stock based compensation expense resulting from the adoption of FASB Statement No. 123(R), Stock based Compensation (FAS 123R). The increase in expense in 2005 was offset by the $4.0 million charge in 2004 to establish a reserve related to potential credit card liabilities. As a percentage of total revenue, general and administrative expenses decreased in 2006 and 2005 due primarily to the effect of higher restaurant sales on a partially fixed cost base. Depreciation and amortization For the years endedDecember 31, %increase2006 over2005 %increase2005 over2004 2006 2005 2004 (dollars in millions) Depreciation and amortization $ 34.3 $ 28.0 $ 21.8 22.2 % 28.5 % As a percentage of revenue 4.2 % 4.5 % 4.6 % Depreciation and amortization increased in 2006 and 2005 primarily due to the 278 total restaurants openings from January 1, 2004 to December 31, 2006. In addition, in 2006 we accelerated depreciation on certain restaurant and office locations as a result of relocations or closures which have occurred or will occur. As a percentage of total revenue, depreciation and amortization has decreased as a result of higher average restaurant sales on a partially fixed cost base. 26 Table of Contents Pre opening costs For the years endedDecember 31, %increase2006 over2005 %decrease2005 over2004 2006 2005 2004 (dollars in millions) Pre opening costs $ 6.8 $ 2.0 $ 2.2 * (10.1 )% As a percentage of revenue 0.8 % 0.3 % 0.5 % * not meaningful Pre opening costs increased in 2006 primarily as a result of the adoption of FASB Staff Position No. FAS 13 1, Accounting for Rental Costs Incurred during a Construction Period (FSP 13 1). FSP 13 1 requires rental costs associated with ground or building operating leases incurred during a construction period to be recognized as expense. FSP 13 1 applies to reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2005. Accordingly, we recognized additional pre opening costs of $3.8 million in 2006 under this principle. Had FSP 13 1 been effective prior to 2006, we would have recognized additional pre opening costs of approximately $4.2 million in 2005 and $3.6 million in 2004. Loss on Disposal of Assets For the years endedDecember 31, %increase2006 over2005 %increase2005 over2004 2006 2005 2004 (dollars in millions) Loss on disposal of assets $ 4.0 $ 3.1 $ 1.7 27.7 % 85.9 % As a percentage of revenue 0.5 % 0.5 % 0.4 % The increase in 2006 in loss on disposal of assets was due to a pending closure of one restaurant at the landlords request, the closure of one restaurant due to structural damage in the leased space and the write off of obsolete or unused equipment. The increase in 2005 was largely due to additional write offs associated with investigating potential restaurant sites that we considered but subsequently rejected, as well as write offs of obsolete equipment as a result of software upgrades. Interest Income For the years endedDecember 31, %increase2006 over2005 %increase2005 over2004 2006 2005 2004 (dollars in millions) Interest income $ 6.6 $ 0.2 * * As a percentage of revenue 0.8 % * not meaningful Interest income increased as a result of investing our incremental cash and cash equivalents in short term investments with maturities of three months or less. Our incremental cash and cash equivalents resulted from our initial public offering proceeds and cash from operations. Income Tax (Provision) Benefit For the years endedDecember 31, %increase2006 over2005 %increase2005 over2004 2006 2005 2004 (dollars in millions) Income tax (provision) benefit $ (26.8 ) $ 7.5 * * As a percentage of revenue (3.3 )% 1.2 % * not meaningful 27 Table of Contents The total tax provision for 2006 of $26.8 million represents a 39.3% effective tax rate. During 2005, we determined that it was more likely than not we would realize our deferred tax assets and we reversed our valuation allowance of $20.3 million resulting in a $7.5 million tax benefit and an effective tax rate benefit of 24.7%. Excluding the $20.3 million non recurring tax benefit, the effective tax rate for 2005 would have been 42.6%. The decrease in the effective tax rate is largely due to a decrease in the estimated statutory state rate for enacted changes in state tax laws, the favorable impact of changes in our state tax footprint due to growth, the declining impact of meals and entertainment disallowance as taxable income increases, our investing in tax exempt securities and a permanent difference related to stock based compensation in 2005. Quarterly Financial Data/Seasonality The following table presents consolidated statement of income data for each of the eight quarters ended December 31, 2006. The operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results for any subsequent quarter. 2006 Quarters Ended Mar. 31 June 30 Sept. 30 Dec. 31 (dollars in millions) Revenue $ 187.0 $ 204.9 $ 211.3 $ 219.7 Operating income $ 12.7 $ 15.9 $ 17.9 $ 15.5 Net income $ 8.0 $ 10.8 $ 11.8 $ 10.8 Number of restaurants opened in quarter 15 14 30 35 Comparable restaurant sales increase 19.7 % 14.5 % 11.6 % 10.1 % 2005 Quarters Ended Mar. 31 June 30 Sept. 30 Dec. 31 (dollars in millions) Revenue $ 133.4 $ 156.3 $ 164.7 $ 173.3 Operating income $ 4.4 $ 9.3 $ 9.5 $ 7.7 Net income $ 2.6 $ 25.7 $ 5.1 $ 4.3 Number of restaurants opened in quarter 18 17 17 28 Comparable restaurant sales increase 4.1 % 9.6 % 11.5 % 14.3 % Seasonal factors cause our profitability to fluctuate from quarter to quarter. Historically, our restaurant sales are lower in the first and fourth quarters due, in part, to the holiday season and because fewer people eat out during periods of inclement weather (the winter months) than during periods of mild or warm weather (the spring, summer and fall months). Other factors also have a seasonal effect on our results. For example, restaurants located near colleges and universities generally do more business during the academic year. The number of trading days in a quarter can also affect our results. Overall, on an annual basis, changes in trading dates do not have a significant impact on our results. Our quarterly results are also affected by other factors such as the number of new restaurants opened in a quarter and unanticipated events. New restaurants typically have lower margins following opening as a result of the expenses associated with opening new restaurants and their operating inefficiencies in the months immediately following opening. Because we have tended to open more new restaurants later in the fiscal year, our fourth quarter net income may be lower than in other quarters. In addition, unanticipated events also impact our results. For example, in the second quarter of 2005, we determined that it was more likely than not that we would realize our deferred tax assets and we reversed our valuation allowance of $20.3 million, resulting in a net tax benefit of $16.7 million in that quarter. Accordingly, results for a particular quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary liquidity and capital requirements are for new restaurant construction, working capital and general corporate needs. Until our initial public offering, we had financed these requirements primarily through 28 Table of Contents equity sales to McDonalds and others as well as through cash flows from operations. In January 2006 we completed our initial public offering of class A common stock, receiving net proceeds of approximately $120.9 million. We expect to use the net proceeds from the offering, together with cash flow from operations, to provide additional long term capital to support the growth of our business (primarily through opening restaurants), to continue to maintain our existing restaurants and for general corporate purposes. In October 2006, we entered into a revolving line of credit with a principal amount of $10 million which expires in August 2007. The line of credit is for support of letters of credit we issue in the normal course of business and bears interest at our option at the Prime rate, a fixed rate determined by the bank or an adjusted LIBOR rate. We havent required significant working capital because customers pay using cash or credit cards and because our operations do not require significant receivables, nor do they require significant inventories due, in part, to our use of various fresh ingredients. In addition, we generally have the right to pay for the purchase of food, beverage and supplies some time after the receipt of those items, generally within ten days, thereby reducing the need for incremental working capital to support growth. Operating Activities. Net cash provided by operating activities was $103.6 million for 2006 compared to $77.4 million for 2005. The $26.2 million increase was primarily attributable to a $24.1 million improvement in net income, excluding the $20.3 million one time non cash tax benefit from the reversal of the valuation allowance. The increase in net income was driven by higher average restaurant sales, higher restaurant margins and significantly more restaurants in operation. Net cash provided by operating activities was $77.4 million for 2005 compared to $39.7 million for 2004. The $37.8 million increase was primarily attributable to a $31.6 million improvement in net income driven by higher average restaurant sales, higher restaurant margins and significantly more restaurants in operation. Investing Activities. Net cash used in investing activities was $97.3 million for 2006 compared to $83.0 million for 2005. The $14.3 million increase related to higher capital expenditures in 2006 as we opened 94 restaurants in 2006, compared with 80 restaurants in 2005. Net cash used in investing activities was $83.0 million for 2005 compared to $95.6 million in 2004. The $12.6 million decrease related to lower capital expenditures in 2005 as we opened 80 restaurants in 2005, compared with 104 restaurants in 2004. We categorize our restaurants as either end caps (at the end of a line of restaurants), in lines (in a line of restaurants), free standing or urban. As we expand into central urban areas, our average costs to open new restaurants will increase due to more significant reconstruction work that often needs to be done on those sites. Our total capital expenditures for 2006 were $97.3 million, and we expect to incur capital expenditures of about $115 million in 2007, relating primarily to our construction of new restaurants in both periods. In 2006, we spent on average about $860,000 in development and construction costs per restaurant, with end caps costing about $680,000, in lines costing about $795,000, free standing costing about $1.3 million and urban costing about $2.2 million (in each case, reduced for landlord reimbursements). The average development and construction costs per restaurant decreased from $910,000 in 2005 due to a decline in the number of free standing restaurants, adding smaller stores to the mix and a focus on cost control. In 2007, we expect average development and construction costs to be approximately $900,000 per restaurant as a result of developing in higher cost markets such as Boston and Philadelphia, a slight increase in free standing restaurants as well as inflation in construction costs. Financing Activities. Net cash provided by financing activities was $147.3 million in 2006 compared to $5.7 million in 2005. The $141.6 million increase was attributable to $120.9 million net proceeds from our initial public offering and the $19.5 million tax sharing payment received from McDonalds. Net cash provided by financing activities was $5.7 million in 2005 compared to $55.9 million in 2004. The $50.3 million decrease was attributable to decreased financing requirements as a result of improvements in net cash provided by operating activities and fewer restaurant openings in 2005 as compared to 2004. 29 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Expenditures. We expect to use the proceeds from the initial public offering to provide additional long term capital to support the growth of our business (primarily through opening restaurants) and to continue to maintain our existing restaurants and for general corporate purposes. In accordance with a tax allocation agreement we have with McDonalds, McDonalds agreed to compensate us for NOLs and tax credits it used that were attributable to our operations. We expect to receive payment for the federal and some state NOLs that we have not utilized on a stand alone basis as we make estimated tax payments, but no later than the first quarter of 2008. As of December 31, 2006, the amount owed by McDonalds totaled $8.8 million. We believe that cash from operations, together with the net proceeds from the initial public offering will be enough to meet ongoing capital expenditures, working capital requirements and other cash needs over at least the next 24 months. Contractual Obligations Our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2006 were as follows: Payments Due by Period Total 1 year 2 3 years 4 5 years After 5 years (in thousands) Operating leases $ 1,086,224 $ 61,641 $ 124,490 $ 123,616 $ 776,477 Deemed landlord financing 7,756 371 742 775 5,868 Other contractual obligations1 13,361 13,266 95 Total contractual cash obligations $ 1,107,341 $ 75,278 $ 125,327 $ 124,391 $ 782,345 1 We enter into various purchase obligations in the ordinary course of business. Those that are binding primarily relate to amounts owed under contractor and subcontractor agreements and orders submitted for equipment for restaurants under construction. Were obligated under non cancelable leases for our restaurants and administrative offices. Our leases generally have initial terms of either five to ten years with two or more five year extensions, for end cap and in line restaurants, or 15 to 20 years with several five year extensions, for free standing restaurants. Our leases generally require us to pay a proportionate share of real estate taxes, insurance, common charges and other operating costs. Some restaurant leases provide for contingent rental payments based on sales thresholds, although we generally do not expect to pay significant contingent rent on these properties based on the thresholds in those leases. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, we had no off balance sheet arrangements or obligations. Inflation The primary areas of our operations affected by inflation are food, fuel, labor, insurance, and utility costs and materials used in the construction of our restaurants. Although almost all of our crew members make more than the minimum wage, increases in the applicable federal or state minimum wage will have an impact on our labor costs. Additionally, many of our leases require us to pay taxes, maintenance, utilities and insurance, all of which are generally subject to inflationary increases. Critical Accounting Estimates We describe our significant accounting policies in Note 1 of our consolidated financial statements. Critical accounting estimates are those that we believe are both significant and that require us to make difficult, 30 Table of Contents subjective or complex judgments, often because we need to estimate the effect of inherently uncertain matters. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experiences and various other factors that we believe to be appropriate under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates, and we might obtain different estimates if we used different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting estimates affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements: Leases We lease most of our restaurant locations. Our leases contain escalating rentals over the lease term as well as optional renewal periods. We account for our leases under FASB Statement No. 13, Accounting for Leases (FAS 13) which requires rent to be recognized on a straight line basis over the lease term including reasonably assured renewal periods. We have estimated that our lease term, including reasonably assured renewal periods, is the lesser of the lease term or 20 years. If the estimate of our reasonably assured lease terms were changed our depreciation and rent expense could differ materially. Stock based Compensation Effective January 1, 2005, we adopted FAS 123R which requires recognition of the fair value of stock based compensation over the vesting period of the option. We use the Black Scholes valuation model to determine the fair value of our stock options, which requires assumptions to be made regarding our stock price volatility, the expected life of the option and expected dividend rates. The volatility assumptions were derived from our annual independent stock valuations and historical volatilities of competitors whose shares are traded in the public markets and are adjusted to reflect anticipated behavior specific to us. Had we arrived at different assumptions of stock price volatility or expected lives of our options, our stock based compensation expense and results of operations could have been different. Insurance Liability We maintain various insurance policies for employee health, workers compensation, general liability and property damage. Pursuant to these policies we are either responsible for losses up to certain limits or are self insured but have third party insurance coverage to limit exposure to these claims. We record a liability that represents our estimated cost of claims incurred and unpaid as of the balance sheet date. Our estimated liability is not discounted and is based on a number of assumptions and factors, including historical trends, actuarial assumptions and economic conditions, and is closely monitored and adjusted when warranted by changing circumstances. In addition, our history of claims experience is short and our significant growth rate could affect the accuracy of estimates based on historical experience. Should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what was estimated or medical costs increase beyond what was expected, our accrued liabilities might not be sufficient and additional expenses may be recorded. Actual claims experience could also be more favorable than estimated resulting in expense reductions. Unanticipated changes may produce materially different amounts of expense than that reported under these programs. Reserves/Contingencies for Litigation and Other Matters We are involved in various claims and legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of business. These actions are subject to many uncertainties, and we cannot predict the outcomes with any degree of certainty. Consequently, we were unable to ascertain the ultimate aggregate amount of monetary liability or financial impact with respect to these matters as of December 31, 2006 and 2005. Once resolved, however, these actions may affect our operating results and cash flows. In addition, were involved in claims relating to the possible theft of our customers credit and debit card data. In 2004, we recorded charges of $4.0 million to establish a reserve for claims seeking reimbursement for purportedly fraudulent credit and debit card charges and the cost of replacing cards and monitoring expenses and fees. As of December 31, 2006, the remaining reserve was $1.2 million. As the situation develops and more information becomes available, the amount of the reserve may increase or decrease accordingly. See Item 1A. Risk Factors We may have experienced a security breach with 31 Table of Contents respect to certain customer credit and debit card data, and weve incurred and may continue to incur substantial costs as a result of this matter. We may also incur costs resulting from other security risks we may face in connection with our electronic processing and transmission of confidential customer information. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) issued EITF Issue No. 06 2, Accounting for Sabbatical Leave and Other Similar Benefits Pursuant to FASB Statement No. 43 Accounting for Compensated Absences (EITF 06 2). The EITF concluded that sabbatical leave accumulates pursuant to the criteria of FASB Standard No. 43 Accounting for Compensated Absences (FAS 43) and therefore the benefit should be accrued if the remaining criteria of FAS 43 are met. EITF 06 2 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. EITF 06 2 can be applied as a change in accounting principle either as a cumulative effect adjustment to beginning retained earnings in the year of adoption or as retrospective application to all prior periods. We have elected to adopt EITF 06 2 as a cumulative effect adjustment to beginning retained earnings. The actuarially determined estimated accrued sabbatical balance as of December 31, 2006, is $2.6 million. In September 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48). FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance on de recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. The interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. The cumulative effect upon adoption of applying the provision shall be reported as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings for that fiscal year, presented separately. We do not expect the adoption of FIN 48 to have a material impact on our financial statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position AUG AIR 1, Accounting for Planned Major Maintenance Activities (FSP AUG 1). FSP AUG 1 prohibits the use of the accrue in advance method of accounting for costs of planned major maintenance projects. The statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. We do not utilize the accrue in advance method and therefore do not expect the adoption of FSP AUG 1 to have a material impact on our financial statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued FASB Standard No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (FAS 157). FAS 157 provides a definition of fair value and acceptable methods of measuring fair value. We do not expect the adoption of FAS 157 to have a material impact on our financial statements. In September 2006, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements (SAB 108). SAB 108 provides guidance on how prior year misstatements should be taken into consideration when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements for purposes of determining whether the current years financial statements are materially misstated. SAB 108 permits registrants to record the cumulative effect of initial adoption by recording the necessary correcting adjustments to the carrying values of assets and liabilities as of the beginning of that year with the offsetting adjustment recorded to the opening balance of retained earnings only if material under the dual method. SAB 108 is effective for fiscal years ending on or after November 15, 2006. We have assessed the effect of adopting this guidance and has determined that there will be no impact on our consolidated financial statements. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK Changing Interest Rates Were exposed to interest rate risk through the investment of our cash and cash equivalents. Since the completion of our initial public offering we have invested our cash in short term investments with maturities of three months or less. Changes in interest rates affect the interest income we earn, and therefore impact our cash flows and results of operations. As of December 31, 2006, we had $150.0 million deposited in short term investments bearing a weighted average interest rate of 4.61%. 32 Table of Contents Commodity Price Risks Were also exposed to commodity price risks. Many of the ingredients we use to prepare our food, as well as our packaging materials, are commodities that are affected by weather, seasonality, production, availability and other factors outside our control. We work closely with our suppliers and use a mix of forward pricing protocols under which we agree with our supplier on fixed prices for deliveries at sometime in the future, fixed pricing protocols under which we agree on a fixed price with our supplier for the duration of that protocol, and formula pricing protocols under which the prices we pay are based on specified formula related to the prices of the goods, such as spot prices. Though we do not have long term supply contracts or guaranteed purchase amounts, our pricing protocols with suppliers can remain in effect for periods ranging from one month to a year, depending on the outlook for prices of the particular ingredient. We also sometimes buy supplies at current market or spot prices. Weve tried to increase, where necessary, the number of suppliers for our ingredients, which we believe can help mitigate pricing volatility, and we follow industry news, trade issues, weather, crises and other world events that may affect supply prices. Long term increases in ingredient prices could adversely affect our future results if we could not increase menu prices at the same pace for competitive or other reasons. Similarly, if we believe the ingredient price increase to be short in duration we may choose not to pass on the cost increases, which could adversely affect our short term financial results. 33 Table of Contents
