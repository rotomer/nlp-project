MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS You should read the following discussion together with Item 6. Selected Consolidated Financial Data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. The discussion contains forward looking statements involving risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause our results to differ materially from expectations. Factors that might cause such differences include those described in Item 1A. Risk Factors and elsewhere in this report. Overview Chipotle operates fresh Mexican food restaurants serving burritos, tacos, burrito bowls (a burrito without the tortilla) and salads. We began with a simple philosophy: demonstrate that food served fast doesnt have to be a traditional fast food experience. Over the years, that vision has evolved. Today, our vision is to change the way people think about and eat fast food. We do this by avoiding a formulaic approach when creating our restaurant experience, looking to fine dining restaurants for inspiration. We use high quality raw ingredients, classic cooking methods and a distinctive interior design, and have friendly people to take care of each customer features that are more frequently found in the world of fine dining. Our approach is also guided by our belief in an idea we call Food With Integrity. Our objective is to find the highest quality ingredients we can ingredients that are grown or raised with respect for the environment, animals and people who grow or raise the food. 2007 Highlights Restaurant Development. As of December 31, 2007, we had 704 restaurants in 33 states throughout the United States and in the District of Columbia. New restaurants have contributed substantially to our restaurant sales. We opened 125 company operated restaurants during 2007, including 10 restaurants in 5 new markets. We define a new market as one in which no restaurant was open as of the end of the prior year. We expect to open between 130 and 140 restaurants in 2008, including one in Toronto, Canada. Sales Growth. In addition to growing our number of restaurants, we have experienced increases in our average restaurant sales of 7.6% in 2007 and 11.9% in 2006, driven primarily by strong comparable restaurant sales increases. We define average restaurant sales as the average trailing 12 month sales for company operated restaurants in operation for at least 12 full calendar months. Comparable restaurant sales include company operated restaurants only and represent the change in period over period sales for restaurants beginning in their 13th full month of operation. Comparable restaurant sales increases were due mainly to an increase in the number of transactions processed at our registers and menu price increases. We expect our average restaurant sales to continue to increase in 2008, driven by comparable restaurant sales increases in the low to mid single digits. However, as a result of several years of double digit comparable restaurant sales increases and the potential impact of weaker consumer spending, we believe that comparable restaurant sales will not continue to increase at the rates we have achieved over the past several years. Food Costs. As a result of freezes in California and Chile, we experienced increased costs for avocados during 2007 and we expect the pricing pressures for avocados to continue through 2008. Additionally, the cost of many basic foods for humans and animals, including corn, wheat, rice and oil has increased. This has resulted in upward pricing pressures on almost all of our raw ingredients including chicken, beef, tortillas and rice, and we expect that pressure to continue through 2008 as well. We also will have a significant increase in cheese prices for 2008 as a result of the expiration of the pricing protocols under which we operated during 2007. 22 Table of Contents Labor. Labor costs as a percentage of revenue decreased in 2007 primarily due to more effective management of staffing through the implementation of a national labor matrix, improved employee efficiency as average restaurant sales increased faster than our need to add labor and lower insurance claims experience benefiting us as we became self insured in the fourth quarter of 2006. The national labor matrix prescribes labor hours based on projected sales volumes. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in hourly employee wages in part from the restaurant structure introduced in 2006. Although we have not been directly impacted by recent minimum wage increases, we anticipate some upward pressure on our restaurant wages in 2008. In addition, because we have now operated a full year with the national labor matrix and self insurance structures in place, we do not expect to see the same level of labor improvements during 2008 as 2007. We continue to focus on ensuring our employee practices are as exceptional as our food. In an effort to achieve this, we continue to develop the Restaurateur program which is designed to encourage the restaurant manager position as a career opportunity for our top performing restaurant managers. During 2008, we plan to leverage our Restaurateurs leadership in neighboring restaurants with opportunities for improvement. In addition to excelling in providing quality food and customer service, restaurant managers are expected to contribute substantially to the development of their crew. Our restaurant management structure is designed to facilitate the development of crew members into restaurant managers. During 2008, these efforts will continue, ensuring we have an effective and efficient field support system for restaurant managers that supports our efforts to identify people with potential, develops crew into managers and ensures high operating standards of our restaurants. Throughput. We deliver our best customer service and hottest food when the line moves efficiently. Through effective restaurant staffing and training, we continue to increase the number of customers we serve during our busiest hours. By the first quarter of 2007, change machines had been installed at the cashier station in virtually all of our restaurants. We also began testing a hand held point of sale terminal in a small number of our restaurants which allows customers to pay with credit cards while waiting in line. We continue to review other equipment and kitchen design innovations to improve the speed of service. Food With Integrity. In addition to continuing to serve naturally raised pork in all our restaurants, we made progress with our Food With Integrity initiative by increasing the number of our restaurants that serve naturally raised beef and chicken. We now serve naturally raised chicken in about 84% of our restaurants and naturally raised beef in about 53%. We define naturally raised as coming from animals that are fed a pure vegetarian diet, never given antibiotics or hormones, and raised humanely in open pastures or deeply bedded pens. All of the sour cream and cheese we serve is made from milk that comes from cows that are not given rBGH, or recombinant bovine growth hormone, to stimulate milk production. In 2008, 30% of all the beans we buy will be organically grown, up from 25% in 2007. We continue to investigate the use of more sustainably grown produce and performed a limited test of the use of locally grown green peppers, onions, and lettuce during 2007. We expect to increase the amount of locally grown produce purchased during 2008. Franchise Acquisitions. In March 2007, we completed the acquisition of four franchised restaurants from two franchisees for an aggregate purchase price of $2.5 million. The remaining four franchised restaurants were acquired on April 30, 2007 for a purchase price of $3.2 million. Commitments and Contingencies. In June 2007, after determining the reserve for claims seeking reimbursement for purportedly fraudulent credit and debit card transactions and related costs was no longer needed, we reversed the remaining $1.2 million reserve into income. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. 23 Table of Contents Restaurant Openings, Relocations and Closures The following table details restaurant unit data for our company operated and franchised locations for the years indicated. For the years ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Company operated Beginning of year 573 481 401 Openings 125 94 80 Relocations and closures (2 ) (2 ) Franchise acquisitions 8 End of year 704 573 481 Franchises Beginning of year 8 8 8 Franchise acquisitions (8 ) End of year 8 8 Total restaurants at end of year 704 581 489 Results of Operations Our results of operations as a percentage of revenue and period over period variances are discussed in the following section. As our business grows, as we open more restaurants and hire more employees, our restaurant operating costs increase. Restaurant Sales For the years endedDecember 31, %increase2007 over2006 %increase2006 over2005 2007 2006 2005 (dollars in millions) Restaurant sales $ 1,085.0 $ 819.8 $ 625.1 32.4 % 31.1 % Average restaurant sales $ 1.734 $ 1.611 $ 1.440 7.6 % 11.9 % Comparable restaurant sales increase 10.8 % 13.7 % 10.2 % Number of company operated restaurants as of the end of the year 704 573 481 22.9 % 19.1 % Number of company operated restaurants opened in the year, net of closures and relocations 123 92 80 The significant factors contributing to our increases in sales were new restaurant openings and strong comparable restaurant sales performance. Restaurant sales from restaurants not yet in the comparable base contributed to $167.2 million of the increase in sales in 2007, of which $83.8 million was attributable to restaurants opened during the year. In 2006, restaurant sales from restaurants not yet in the comparable restaurant base contributed to $110.8 million of the increase in sales, of which $46.5 million was attributable to restaurants opened in 2006. Comparable restaurant sales increases contributed to $98.1 million and $84.1 million of the increase in restaurant sales in 2007 and 2006, respectively. We believe comparable restaurant sales increases were driven primarily by an increasing awareness of our brand, increased customer loyalty and our focus on improving service time. The substantial majority of our comparable restaurant sales growth was due to an increase in the 24 Table of Contents number of transactions, and the remainder was driven primarily by menu price increases in markets in conjunction with the introduction of naturally raised beef or chicken. Food, Beverage and Packaging Costs For the years endedDecember 31, %increase2007 over2006 %increase2006 over2005 2007 2006 2005 (dollars in millions) Food, beverage and packaging $ 346.4 $258.0 $ 202.3 34.3 % 27.5 % As a percentage of revenue 31.9 % 31.4 % 32.2 % Food, beverage and packaging costs increased as a percentage of revenue in 2007 due to increased product cost, primarily avocados, chicken and steak, partially offset by menu price increases in selected markets in conjunction with the introduction of naturally raised beef or chicken, as well as an improvement in food controls. We have seen cost pressures as a result of freezes in California and Chile, which impacted citrus and avocado crops and we expect these cost pressures, along with pressure from significantly higher food costs for items such as wheat and corn, to continue into 2008. In 2006, food costs decreased as a percentage of revenue due primarily to menu price increases and favorable commodity costs, partially offset by increased food costs associated with our Food With Integrity initiative. Labor Costs For the years endedDecember 31, %increase2007 over2006 %increase2006 over2005 2007 2006 2005 (dollars in millions) Labor costs $ 289.4 $ 231.1 $ 178.7 25.2 % 29.3 % As a percentage of revenue 26.7 % 28.1 % 28.5 % Labor costs decreased as a percentage of revenue in 2007 primarily due to more effective management of staffing, improved employee efficiency as average restaurant sales increased faster than our need to add labor and lower insurance claims benefiting us as we became self insured in the fourth quarter of 2006. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in hourly employee wages. In 2006, labor costs as a percentage of revenue decreased primarily due to higher average restaurant sales, partially offset by additional staffing costs as we transitioned to our enhanced restaurant structure. We launched the enhanced restaurant management structure in the second quarter of 2006 focusing on developing a defined path for crew to become restaurant managers. This has enabled more promotions from within our existing crew, which has lowered turnover and decreased training costs in 2007. Occupancy Costs For the years endedDecember 31, %increase2007 over2006 %increase2006 over2005 2007 2006 2005 (dollars in millions) Occupancy costs $ 75.9 $ 58.8 $ 47.6 29.1 % 23.4 % As a percentage of revenue 7.0 % 7.1 % 7.6 % In 2007 and 2006, occupancy costs decreased as a percentage of revenue due to higher average restaurant sales on a partially fixed cost base, partially offset by higher rents for new locations. 25 Table of Contents Other Operating Costs For the years endedDecember 31, %increase2007 over2006 %increase2006 over2005 2007 2006 2005 (dollars in millions) Other operating costs $ 131.5 $ 102.7 $ 83.0 28.0 % 23.8 % As a percentage of revenue 12.1 % 12.5 % 13.2 % Other operating costs as a percentage of revenue declined in 2007 and 2006 primarily due to the effect of higher average restaurant sales on a partially fixed cost base and operating efficiencies that are realized as we both grow in size and become more experienced. We also realized a benefit in 2007 and 2006 related to our promote from within strategy which reduced the dollars we spent on training external hires. General and Administrative Expenses For the years endedDecember 31, %increase2007 over2006 %increase2006 over2005 2007 2006 2005 (dollars in millions) General and administrative expense $ 75.0 $ 65.3 $ 52.0 14.9 % 25.6 % As a percentage of revenue 6.9 % 7.9 % 8.3 % The increase in general and administrative expenses in 2007 primarily resulted from hiring more employees as we grew and an increase in stock based compensation expense resulting from the stock based compensation awards granted in 2007 and the one time broad based option award granted in 2006 in conjunction with our initial public offering. The 2007 increase was partially offset by the reversal of the credit card contingency reserve in the second quarter of 2007 and costs incurred for the exchange offer conducted by McDonalds in the third quarter of 2006, a secondary offering of our common stock in the second quarter of 2006 and severance costs incurred in the first and second quarters of 2006. The increase in general and administrative expenses in 2006 primarily resulted from increased employee related expenses driven by hiring more employees, increase in stock based compensation expense resulting from the one time broad based option grant in conjunction with our initial public offering, incremental legal and audit costs due to growth and becoming a public company, costs incurred in conjunction with the secondary and exchange offers related to McDonalds disposition of its interest in us, and increases in severance expense. As a percentage of revenue, general and administrative expenses decreased in 2007 and 2006 due primarily to the effect of higher restaurant sales on a partially fixed cost base, the reversal of the credit card contingency in the second quarter of 2007 and the costs incurred for the secondary and exchange offers and severance negatively impacting 2006. Depreciation and Amortization For the years endedDecember 31, %increase2007 over2006 %increase2006 over2005 2007 2006 2005 (dollars in millions) Depreciation and amortization $ 43.6 $ 34.3 $ 28.0 27.3 % 22.2 % As a percentage of revenue 4.0 % 4.2 % 4.5 % Depreciation and amortization increased in 2007 and 2006 primarily due to the increase of 303 restaurants from January 1, 2005 to December 31, 2007. In addition, in 2007 and 2006 we accelerated depreciation on 26 Table of Contents certain restaurant and office locations as a result of relocations or closures which have occurred or will occur. As a percentage of total revenue, depreciation and amortization has decreased as a result of higher average restaurant sales on a partially fixed cost base. Pre opening Costs For the years endedDecember 31, %increase2007 over2006 %increase2006 over2005 2007 2006 2005 (dollars in millions) Pre opening costs $ 9.6 $ 6.8 $ 2.0 41.4 % * As a percentage of revenue 0.9 % 0.8 % 0.3 % Restaurant openings 125 94 80 * not meaningful Pre opening costs increased in 2007 primarily due to an increase in restaurant openings in 2007. Pre opening costs increased in 2006 primarily as a result of the adoption of FASB Staff Position No. FAS 13 1, Accounting for Rental Costs Incurred during a Construction Period (FSP 13 1). FSP 13 1 requires rental costs associated with ground or building operating leases incurred during a construction period to be recognized as expense. Had FSP 13 1 been effective prior to 2006, we would have recognized additional pre opening costs of approximately $4.2 million in 2005. Loss on Disposal of Assets For the years endedDecember 31, %increase2007 over2006 %increase2006 over2005 2007 2006 2005 (dollars in millions) Loss on disposal of assets $ 6.2 $ 4.0 $ 3.1 54.9 % 27.7 % As a percentage of revenue 0.6 % 0.5 % 0.5 % The increase in 2007 in loss on disposal of assets was due to an increase in both the age and number of restaurants, the upgrade of restaurant security systems and an increase in the write offs associated with investigating potential restaurant sites that we considered but subsequently rejected. The increase in 2006 in loss on disposal of assets was due to a pending closure of one restaurant at the landlords request, the closure of one restaurant due to structural damage in the leased space and the write off of obsolete or unused equipment. Interest Income For the years endedDecember 31, %decrease2007 over2006 %increase2006 over2005 2007 2006 2005 (dollars in millions) Interest income $ 6.1 $ 6.6 7.0 % * As a percentage of revenue 0.6 % 0.8 % * not meaningful In 2007 interest income decreased primarily due to an increase in investments in tax exempt securities which have lower interest rates but are exempt from federal income taxes. In 2006 interest income increased as a result of investing our incremental cash and cash equivalents in short term investments with maturities of three months or less. Our incremental cash and cash equivalents resulted from our initial public offering proceeds and cash from operations. 27 Table of Contents Income Tax (Provision) Benefit For the years endedDecember 31, %increase2007 over2006 %increase2006 over2005 2007 2006 2005 (dollars in millions) Income tax (provision) benefit $ (43.4 ) $ (26.8 ) $ 7.5 61.9 % * As a percentage of revenue (4.0 )% (3.3 )% 1.2 % Effective tax rate 38.1 % 39.3 % (24.7 )% * not meaningful The 2007 effective tax rate decreased primarily due to increased investments in tax exempt securities and a decrease in our estimated statutory state tax rate. The improvement was partially offset by a $0.5 million tax effect from non deductible costs associated with the secondary offering and split off transaction in 2006. The total tax provision for 2006 of $26.8 million represents a 39.3% effective tax rate. During 2005, we determined that it was more likely than not we would realize our deferred tax assets and we reversed our valuation allowance of $20.3 million resulting in a $7.5 million tax benefit and an effective tax rate benefit of 24.7%. Excluding the $20.3 million non recurring tax benefit, the effective tax rate for 2005 would have been 42.6%. The decrease in the effective tax rate is largely due to a decrease in the estimated statutory state rate for enacted changes in state tax laws, the favorable impact of changes in our state tax footprint due to growth, the declining impact of meals and entertainment disallowance as taxable income increases, our investing in tax exempt securities and a permanent difference related to stock based compensation in 2005. Quarterly Financial Data/Seasonality The following table presents consolidated statement of income data for each of the eight quarters in the period ended December 31, 2007. The operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results for any subsequent quarter. 2007 Quarters Ended Mar. 31 June 30 Sept. 30 Dec. 31 (dollars in millions) Revenue $ 236.1 $ 274.3 $ 286.4 $ 289.0 Operating income $ 18.6 $ 30.7 $ 31.4 $ 27.5 Net income $ 12.4 $ 20.0 $ 20.6 $ 17.6 Number of restaurants opened in quarter 28 32 28 37 Comparable restaurant sales increase 8.3 % 11.6 % 12.4 % 10.6 % 2006 Quarters Ended Mar. 31 June 30 Sept. 30 Dec. 31 (dollars in millions) Revenue $ 187.0 $ 204.9 $ 211.3 $ 219.7 Operating income $ 12.7 $ 15.9 $ 17.9 $ 15.5 Net income $ 8.0 $ 10.8 $ 11.8 $ 10.8 Number of restaurants opened in quarter 15 14 30 35 Comparable restaurant sales increase 19.7 % 14.5 % 11.6 % 10.1 % Seasonal factors cause our profitability to fluctuate from quarter to quarter. Historically, our restaurant sales are lower in the first and fourth quarters due, in part, to the holiday season and because fewer people eat out during periods of inclement weather (the winter months) than during periods of mild or warm weather (the spring, summer and fall months). Other factors also have a seasonal effect on our results. For example, restaurants located near colleges and universities generally do more business during the academic year. The 28 Table of Contents number of trading days in a quarter can also affect our results. Overall, on an annual basis, changes in trading dates do not have a significant impact on our results. Our quarterly results are also affected by other factors such as the number of new restaurants opened in a quarter and unanticipated events. New restaurants typically have lower margins following opening as a result of the expenses associated with opening new restaurants and their operating inefficiencies in the months immediately following opening. In addition, unanticipated events also impact our results. Accordingly, results for a particular quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary liquidity and capital requirements are for new restaurant construction, working capital and general corporate needs. We have a cash, cash equivalent, and short term investment balance of $171.2 million that we expect to utilize, along with cash flow from operations, to provide capital to support the growth of our business (primarily through opening restaurants), and to continue to maintain our existing restaurants and for general corporate purposes. We believe that cash from operations, together with our cash balance, will be enough to meet ongoing capital expenditures, working capital requirements and other cash needs over at least the next 24 months. In August 2007, we entered into a revolving line of credit with a principal amount of $15 million which expires in August 2008. The line of credit is for support of letters of credit we issue in the normal course of business and normal short term working capital needs. The line of credit bears interest at our option at the prime rate, a fixed rate determined by the bank or an adjusted LIBOR rate. As of December 31, 2007, no amounts were outstanding. We havent required significant working capital because customers pay using cash or credit cards and because our operations do not require significant receivables, nor do they require significant inventories due, in part, to our use of various fresh ingredients. In addition, we generally have the right to pay for the purchase of food, beverage and supplies some time after the receipt of those items, generally within ten days, thereby reducing the need for incremental working capital to support our growth. While operations continue to provide cash, our primary use of cash is in new restaurant development. As we expand into more urban areas, our average costs to open new restaurants will increase due to more significant reconstruction work that often needs to be done on those sites. Our total capital expenditures for 2007 were $141 million, and we expect to incur capital expenditures of about $150 million in 2008, relating primarily to our construction of new restaurants in both periods. In 2007, we spent on average about $880,000 in development and construction costs per restaurant, with end caps costing about $740,000, in lines costing about $930,000, free standing costing about $1.1 million and urban costing about $1.4 million (in each case, reduced for landlord reimbursements). The average development and construction costs per restaurant increased from $860,000 in 2006 due to opening a larger portion of our restaurants in urban locations being partially offset by a decline in the percentage of free standing restaurant openings and decreasing our average restaurant size. In 2008, we expect average development and construction costs to be approximately $900,000 per restaurant as a result of developing in higher cost markets as well as inflation in construction costs. 29 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations Our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2007 were as follows: Payments Due by Period Total 1 year 2 3 years 4 5 years After5 years (in thousands) Operating leases $ 1,410,566 $ 76,469 $ 155,795 $ 157,452 $ 1,020,850 Deemed landlord financing 7,395 366 740 785 5,504 Other contractual obligations(1) 12,271 12,271 Total contractual cash obligations $ 1,430,232 $ 89,106 $ 156,535 $ 158,237 $ 1,026,354 (1) We enter into various purchase obligations in the ordinary course of business. Those that are binding primarily relate to amounts owed under contractor and subcontractor agreements, orders submitted for equipment for restaurants under construction, and corporate sponsorships. Were obligated under non cancelable leases for our restaurants and administrative offices. Our leases generally have initial terms of either five to ten years with two or more five year extensions, for end cap and in line restaurants, or 15 to 20 years with several five year extensions, for free standing restaurants. Our leases generally require us to pay a proportionate share of real estate taxes, insurance, common charges and other operating costs. Some restaurant leases provide for contingent rental payments based on sales thresholds, although we generally do not expect to pay significant contingent rent on these properties based on the thresholds in those leases. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, we had no off balance sheet arrangements or obligations. Inflation The primary areas of our operations affected by inflation are food, labor, fuel, insurance, utility costs and materials used in the construction of our restaurants. Although almost all of our crew members make more than the minimum wage, increases in the applicable federal or state minimum wage will have an impact on our labor costs. Additionally, many of our leases require us to pay taxes, maintenance, utilities and insurance, all of which are generally subject to inflationary increases. Critical Accounting Estimates We describe our significant accounting policies in Note 1 of our consolidated financial statements. Critical accounting estimates are those that we believe are both significant and that require us to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often because we need to estimate the effect of inherently uncertain matters. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experiences and various other factors that we believe to be appropriate under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates, and we might obtain different estimates if we used different assumptions or factors. We believe the following critical accounting estimates affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements: Leases We lease most of our restaurant locations. Our leases contain escalating rentals over the lease term as well as optional renewal periods. We account for our leases under FASB Statement No. 13, Accounting for Leases (FAS 13) which requires rent to be recognized on a straight line basis over the lease term including reasonably 30 Table of Contents assured renewal periods. We have estimated that our lease term, including reasonably assured renewal periods, is the lesser of the lease term or 20 years. If the estimate of our reasonably assured lease terms were changed our depreciation and rent expense could differ materially. Stock based Compensation We recognize compensation expense for equity awards over the vesting period based on the awards fair value. We use the Black Scholes valuation model to determine the fair value of our stock options, which requires assumptions to be made regarding our stock price volatility, the expected life of the option and expected dividend rates. The volatility assumptions were derived primarily from historical volatilities of competitors whose shares are traded in the public markets and are adjusted to reflect anticipated behavior specific to us and our volatility while a public company. Had we arrived at different assumptions of stock price volatility or expected lives of our options, our stock based compensation expense and result of operations could have been different. Insurance Liability We maintain various insurance policies for employee health, workers compensation, general liability and property damage. Pursuant to these policies we are either responsible for losses up to certain limits or are self insured but have third party insurance coverage to limit exposure to these claims. We record a liability that represents our estimated cost of claims incurred and unpaid as of the balance sheet date. Our estimated liability is not discounted and is based on a number of assumptions and factors, including historical trends, actuarial assumptions and economic conditions, and is closely monitored and adjusted when warranted by changing circumstances. In addition, our history of claims experience is short and our significant growth rate could affect the accuracy of estimates based on historical experience. Should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what was estimated or medical costs increase beyond what was expected, our accrued liabilities might not be sufficient and additional expenses may be recorded. Actual claims experience could also be more favorable than estimated resulting in expense reductions. Unanticipated changes may produce materially different amounts of expense than that reported under these programs. Reserves/Contingencies for Litigation and Other Matters We are involved in various claims and legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of business. These actions are subject to many uncertainties, and we cannot predict the outcomes with any degree of certainty. Consequently, we were unable to ascertain the ultimate aggregate amount of monetary liability or financial impact with respect to these matters as of December 31, 2007 and 2006. Once resolved, however, these actions may affect our operating results and cash flows. Sabbatical Liability We offer our employees a sabbatical leave after each ten years of service they complete. We record a liability for our estimate of the accumulated sabbatical expense as of the balance sheet date. Our estimated liability is based on a number of factors including actuarial assumptions and historical trends. Changes in assumptions and trends could result in a materially different liability and expense. Adoption of New Accounting Standards In September 2006, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) issued EITF Issue No. 06 2, Accounting for Sabbatical Leave and Other Similar Benefits Pursuant to FASB Statement No. 43 Accounting for Compensated Absences (EITF 06 2). The EITF concluded that sabbatical leave accumulates pursuant to the criteria of Statement of Accounting Standard No. 43 Accounting for Compensated Absences (FAS 43) and therefore the benefit should be accrued if the remaining criteria of FAS 43 are met. EITF 06 2 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. EITF 06 2 can be applied as a change in accounting principle either as a 31 Table of Contents cumulative effect adjustment to beginning retained earnings in the year of adoption or as retrospective application to all prior periods. We offer sabbatical leave to employees who have provided ten years of services. Previously, we expensed sabbatical costs as incurred. We determined an estimated accrued sabbatical balance as of December 31, 2006 of $2.6 million which we recognized as a cumulative effect adjustment to beginning retained earnings in the first quarter of 2007. During 2007, the assumptions used were changed to estimate the accrual for only the sabbatical currently being earned. In addition, the tax impact of the cumulative effect adjustment had been excluded. As a result, we adjusted the amount of the cumulative effect adjustment that was recorded to retained earnings effective January 1, 2007 to $1.0 million (net of taxes of $675,000). We have deemed the impact of the adjustment to be immaterial to the consolidated balance sheet for each of the 2007 quarterly reports. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we accrued sabbatical expense of $331,000 (net of taxes of $212,000). Effective January 1, 2007, we adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48). FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance on de recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. Adoption of FIN 48 did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, (FAS 159). FAS 159 allows entities the option to measure eligible financial instruments at fair value as of specified dates. Unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected are reported in earnings. FAS 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. We do not expect to elect the option to measure any existing financial instruments at fair value, therefore, we do not expect the adoption of FAS 159 to have an impact on our consolidated financial statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, (FAS 157). FAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities, and expands disclosure about fair value measurements. FAS 157 applies whenever other statements require or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value and is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. We do not expect the adoption of FAS 157 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK Changing Interest Rates Were exposed to interest rate risk through the investment of our cash, cash equivalents, and available for sale securities. Changes in interest rates affect the interest income we earn, and therefore impact our cash flows and results of operations. As of December 31, 2007, we had $163.5 million deposited in short term investments and available for sale securities bearing a weighted average interest rate of 3.6% (approximately 5.2% tax equivalent). Commodity Price Risks Were also exposed to commodity price risks. Many of the ingredients we use to prepare our food, as well as our packaging materials, are commodities that are affected by weather, seasonality, production, availability and other factors outside our control. We work closely with our suppliers and use a mix of forward pricing protocols under which we agree with our supplier on fixed prices for deliveries at sometime in the future, fixed pricing protocols under which we agree on a fixed price with our supplier for the duration of that protocol, and formula 32 Table of Contents pricing protocols under which the prices we pay are based on specified formula related to the prices of the goods, such as spot prices. Though we do not have long term supply contracts or guaranteed purchase amounts, our pricing protocols with suppliers can remain in effect for periods ranging from one month to a year, depending on the outlook for prices of the particular ingredient. We also sometimes buy supplies at current market or spot prices. Weve tried to increase, where necessary, the number of suppliers for our ingredients, which we believe can help mitigate pricing volatility, and we follow industry news, trade issues, weather, crises and other world events that may affect supply prices. Long term increases in ingredient prices could adversely affect our future results if we could not increase menu prices at the same pace for competitive or other reasons. Similarly, if we believe the ingredient price increase to be short in duration we may choose not to pass on the cost increases, which could adversely affect our short term financial results. 33 Table of Contents 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS You should read the following discussion together with Item 6. Selected Consolidated Financial Data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. The discussion contains forward looking statements involving risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause our results to differ materially from expectations. Factors that might cause such differences include those described in Item 1A. Risk Factors and elsewhere in this report. Overview Chipotle operates fresh Mexican food restaurants serving burritos, tacos, burrito bowls (a burrito without the tortilla) and salads. We began with a simple philosophy: demonstrate that food served fast doesnt have to be a traditional fast food experience. Over the years, that vision has evolved. Today, our vision is to change the way people think about and eat fast food. We do this by avoiding a formulaic approach when creating our restaurant experience, looking to fine dining restaurants for inspiration. We use high quality raw ingredients, classic cooking methods and a distinctive interior design, and have friendly people to take care of each customer features that are more frequently found in the world of fine dining. Our approach is also guided by our belief in an idea we call Food With Integrity. Our objective is to find the highest quality ingredients we can ingredients that are grown or raised with respect for the environment, animals and people who grow or raise the food. 2007 Highlights Restaurant Development. As of December 31, 2007, we had 704 restaurants in 33 states throughout the United States and in the District of Columbia. New restaurants have contributed substantially to our restaurant sales. We opened 125 company operated restaurants during 2007, including 10 restaurants in 5 new markets. We define a new market as one in which no restaurant was open as of the end of the prior year. We expect to open between 130 and 140 restaurants in 2008, including one in Toronto, Canada. Sales Growth. In addition to growing our number of restaurants, we have experienced increases in our average restaurant sales of 7.6% in 2007 and 11.9% in 2006, driven primarily by strong comparable restaurant sales increases. We define average restaurant sales as the average trailing 12 month sales for company operated restaurants in operation for at least 12 full calendar months. Comparable restaurant sales include company operated restaurants only and represent the change in period over period sales for restaurants beginning in their 13th full month of operation. Comparable restaurant sales increases were due mainly to an increase in the number of transactions processed at our registers and menu price increases. We expect our average restaurant sales to continue to increase in 2008, driven by comparable restaurant sales increases in the low to mid single digits. However, as a result of several years of double digit comparable restaurant sales increases and the potential impact of weaker consumer spending, we believe that comparable restaurant sales will not continue to increase at the rates we have achieved over the past several years. Food Costs. As a result of freezes in California and Chile, we experienced increased costs for avocados during 2007 and we expect the pricing pressures for avocados to continue through 2008. Additionally, the cost of many basic foods for humans and animals, including corn, wheat, rice and oil has increased. This has resulted in upward pricing pressures on almost all of our raw ingredients including chicken, beef, tortillas and rice, and we expect that pressure to continue through 2008 as well. We also will have a significant increase in cheese prices for 2008 as a result of the expiration of the pricing protocols under which we operated during 2007. 22 Table of Contents Labor. Labor costs as a percentage of revenue decreased in 2007 primarily due to more effective management of staffing through the implementation of a national labor matrix, improved employee efficiency as average restaurant sales increased faster than our need to add labor and lower insurance claims experience benefiting us as we became self insured in the fourth quarter of 2006. The national labor matrix prescribes labor hours based on projected sales volumes. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in hourly employee wages in part from the restaurant structure introduced in 2006. Although we have not been directly impacted by recent minimum wage increases, we anticipate some upward pressure on our restaurant wages in 2008. In addition, because we have now operated a full year with the national labor matrix and self insurance structures in place, we do not expect to see the same level of labor improvements during 2008 as 2007. We continue to focus on ensuring our employee practices are as exceptional as our food. In an effort to achieve this, we continue to develop the Restaurateur program which is designed to encourage the restaurant manager position as a career opportunity for our top performing restaurant managers. During 2008, we plan to leverage our Restaurateurs leadership in neighboring restaurants with opportunities for improvement. In addition to excelling in providing quality food and customer service, restaurant managers are expected to contribute substantially to the development of their crew. Our restaurant management structure is designed to facilitate the development of crew members into restaurant managers. During 2008, these efforts will continue, ensuring we have an effective and efficient field support system for restaurant managers that supports our efforts to identify people with potential, develops crew into managers and ensures high operating standards of our restaurants. Throughput. We deliver our best customer service and hottest food when the line moves efficiently. Through effective restaurant staffing and training, we continue to increase the number of customers we serve during our busiest hours. By the first quarter of 2007, change machines had been installed at the cashier station in virtually all of our restaurants. We also began testing a hand held point of sale terminal in a small number of our restaurants which allows customers to pay with credit cards while waiting in line. We continue to review other equipment and kitchen design innovations to improve the speed of service. Food With Integrity. In addition to continuing to serve naturally raised pork in all our restaurants, we made progress with our Food With Integrity initiative by increasing the number of our restaurants that serve naturally raised beef and chicken. We now serve naturally raised chicken in about 84% of our restaurants and naturally raised beef in about 53%. We define naturally raised as coming from animals that are fed a pure vegetarian diet, never given antibiotics or hormones, and raised humanely in open pastures or deeply bedded pens. All of the sour cream and cheese we serve is made from milk that comes from cows that are not given rBGH, or recombinant bovine growth hormone, to stimulate milk production. In 2008, 30% of all the beans we buy will be organically grown, up from 25% in 2007. We continue to investigate the use of more sustainably grown produce and performed a limited test of the use of locally grown green peppers, onions, and lettuce during 2007. We expect to increase the amount of locally grown produce purchased during 2008. Franchise Acquisitions. In March 2007, we completed the acquisition of four franchised restaurants from two franchisees for an aggregate purchase price of $2.5 million. The remaining four franchised restaurants were acquired on April 30, 2007 for a purchase price of $3.2 million. Commitments and Contingencies. In June 2007, after determining the reserve for claims seeking reimbursement for purportedly fraudulent credit and debit card transactions and related costs was no longer needed, we reversed the remaining $1.2 million reserve into income. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. 23 Table of Contents Restaurant Openings, Relocations and Closures The following table details restaurant unit data for our company operated and franchised locations for the years indicated. For the years ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Company operated Beginning of year 573 481 401 Openings 125 94 80 Relocations and closures (2 ) (2 ) Franchise acquisitions 8 End of year 704 573 481 Franchises Beginning of year 8 8 8 Franchise acquisitions (8 ) End of year 8 8 Total restaurants at end of year 704 581 489 Results of Operations Our results of operations as a percentage of revenue and period over period variances are discussed in the following section. As our business grows, as we open more restaurants and hire more employees, our restaurant operating costs increase. Restaurant Sales For the years endedDecember 31, %increase2007 over2006 %increase2006 over2005 2007 2006 2005 (dollars in millions) Restaurant sales $ 1,085.0 $ 819.8 $ 625.1 32.4 % 31.1 % Average restaurant sales $ 1.734 $ 1.611 $ 1.440 7.6 % 11.9 % Comparable restaurant sales increase 10.8 % 13.7 % 10.2 % Number of company operated restaurants as of the end of the year 704 573 481 22.9 % 19.1 % Number of company operated restaurants opened in the year, net of closures and relocations 123 92 80 The significant factors contributing to our increases in sales were new restaurant openings and strong comparable restaurant sales performance. Restaurant sales from restaurants not yet in the comparable base contributed to $167.2 million of the increase in sales in 2007, of which $83.8 million was attributable to restaurants opened during the year. In 2006, restaurant sales from restaurants not yet in the comparable restaurant base contributed to $110.8 million of the increase in sales, of which $46.5 million was attributable to restaurants opened in 2006. Comparable restaurant sales increases contributed to $98.1 million and $84.1 million of the increase in restaurant sales in 2007 and 2006, respectively. We believe comparable restaurant sales increases were driven primarily by an increasing awareness of our brand, increased customer loyalty and our focus on improving service time. The substantial majority of our comparable restaurant sales growth was due to an increase in the 24 Table of Contents number of transactions, and the remainder was driven primarily by menu price increases in markets in conjunction with the introduction of naturally raised beef or chicken. Food, Beverage and Packaging Costs For the years endedDecember 31, %increase2007 over2006 %increase2006 over2005 2007 2006 2005 (dollars in millions) Food, beverage and packaging $ 346.4 $258.0 $ 202.3 34.3 % 27.5 % As a percentage of revenue 31.9 % 31.4 % 32.2 % Food, beverage and packaging costs increased as a percentage of revenue in 2007 due to increased product cost, primarily avocados, chicken and steak, partially offset by menu price increases in selected markets in conjunction with the introduction of naturally raised beef or chicken, as well as an improvement in food controls. We have seen cost pressures as a result of freezes in California and Chile, which impacted citrus and avocado crops and we expect these cost pressures, along with pressure from significantly higher food costs for items such as wheat and corn, to continue into 2008. In 2006, food costs decreased as a percentage of revenue due primarily to menu price increases and favorable commodity costs, partially offset by increased food costs associated with our Food With Integrity initiative. Labor Costs For the years endedDecember 31, %increase2007 over2006 %increase2006 over2005 2007 2006 2005 (dollars in millions) Labor costs $ 289.4 $ 231.1 $ 178.7 25.2 % 29.3 % As a percentage of revenue 26.7 % 28.1 % 28.5 % Labor costs decreased as a percentage of revenue in 2007 primarily due to more effective management of staffing, improved employee efficiency as average restaurant sales increased faster than our need to add labor and lower insurance claims benefiting us as we became self insured in the fourth quarter of 2006. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in hourly employee wages. In 2006, labor costs as a percentage of revenue decreased primarily due to higher average restaurant sales, partially offset by additional staffing costs as we transitioned to our enhanced restaurant structure. We launched the enhanced restaurant management structure in the second quarter of 2006 focusing on developing a defined path for crew to become restaurant managers. This has enabled more promotions from within our existing crew, which has lowered turnover and decreased training costs in 2007. Occupancy Costs For the years endedDecember 31, %increase2007 over2006 %increase2006 over2005 2007 2006 2005 (dollars in millions) Occupancy costs $ 75.9 $ 58.8 $ 47.6 29.1 % 23.4 % As a percentage of revenue 7.0 % 7.1 % 7.6 % In 2007 and 2006, occupancy costs decreased as a percentage of revenue due to higher average restaurant sales on a partially fixed cost base, partially offset by higher rents for new locations. 25 Table of Contents Other Operating Costs For the years endedDecember 31, %increase2007 over2006 %increase2006 over2005 2007 2006 2005 (dollars in millions) Other operating costs $ 131.5 $ 102.7 $ 83.0 28.0 % 23.8 % As a percentage of revenue 12.1 % 12.5 % 13.2 % Other operating costs as a percentage of revenue declined in 2007 and 2006 primarily due to the effect of higher average restaurant sales on a partially fixed cost base and operating efficiencies that are realized as we both grow in size and become more experienced. We also realized a benefit in 2007 and 2006 related to our promote from within strategy which reduced the dollars we spent on training external hires. General and Administrative Expenses For the years endedDecember 31, %increase2007 over2006 %increase2006 over2005 2007 2006 2005 (dollars in millions) General and administrative expense $ 75.0 $ 65.3 $ 52.0 14.9 % 25.6 % As a percentage of revenue 6.9 % 7.9 % 8.3 % The increase in general and administrative expenses in 2007 primarily resulted from hiring more employees as we grew and an increase in stock based compensation expense resulting from the stock based compensation awards granted in 2007 and the one time broad based option award granted in 2006 in conjunction with our initial public offering. The 2007 increase was partially offset by the reversal of the credit card contingency reserve in the second quarter of 2007 and costs incurred for the exchange offer conducted by McDonalds in the third quarter of 2006, a secondary offering of our common stock in the second quarter of 2006 and severance costs incurred in the first and second quarters of 2006. The increase in general and administrative expenses in 2006 primarily resulted from increased employee related expenses driven by hiring more employees, increase in stock based compensation expense resulting from the one time broad based option grant in conjunction with our initial public offering, incremental legal and audit costs due to growth and becoming a public company, costs incurred in conjunction with the secondary and exchange offers related to McDonalds disposition of its interest in us, and increases in severance expense. As a percentage of revenue, general and administrative expenses decreased in 2007 and 2006 due primarily to the effect of higher restaurant sales on a partially fixed cost base, the reversal of the credit card contingency in the second quarter of 2007 and the costs incurred for the secondary and exchange offers and severance negatively impacting 2006. Depreciation and Amortization For the years endedDecember 31, %increase2007 over2006 %increase2006 over2005 2007 2006 2005 (dollars in millions) Depreciation and amortization $ 43.6 $ 34.3 $ 28.0 27.3 % 22.2 % As a percentage of revenue 4.0 % 4.2 % 4.5 % Depreciation and amortization increased in 2007 and 2006 primarily due to the increase of 303 restaurants from January 1, 2005 to December 31, 2007. In addition, in 2007 and 2006 we accelerated depreciation on 26 Table of Contents certain restaurant and office locations as a result of relocations or closures which have occurred or will occur. As a percentage of total revenue, depreciation and amortization has decreased as a result of higher average restaurant sales on a partially fixed cost base. Pre opening Costs For the years endedDecember 31, %increase2007 over2006 %increase2006 over2005 2007 2006 2005 (dollars in millions) Pre opening costs $ 9.6 $ 6.8 $ 2.0 41.4 % * As a percentage of revenue 0.9 % 0.8 % 0.3 % Restaurant openings 125 94 80 * not meaningful Pre opening costs increased in 2007 primarily due to an increase in restaurant openings in 2007. Pre opening costs increased in 2006 primarily as a result of the adoption of FASB Staff Position No. FAS 13 1, Accounting for Rental Costs Incurred during a Construction Period (FSP 13 1). FSP 13 1 requires rental costs associated with ground or building operating leases incurred during a construction period to be recognized as expense. Had FSP 13 1 been effective prior to 2006, we would have recognized additional pre opening costs of approximately $4.2 million in 2005. Loss on Disposal of Assets For the years endedDecember 31, %increase2007 over2006 %increase2006 over2005 2007 2006 2005 (dollars in millions) Loss on disposal of assets $ 6.2 $ 4.0 $ 3.1 54.9 % 27.7 % As a percentage of revenue 0.6 % 0.5 % 0.5 % The increase in 2007 in loss on disposal of assets was due to an increase in both the age and number of restaurants, the upgrade of restaurant security systems and an increase in the write offs associated with investigating potential restaurant sites that we considered but subsequently rejected. The increase in 2006 in loss on disposal of assets was due to a pending closure of one restaurant at the landlords request, the closure of one restaurant due to structural damage in the leased space and the write off of obsolete or unused equipment. Interest Income For the years endedDecember 31, %decrease2007 over2006 %increase2006 over2005 2007 2006 2005 (dollars in millions) Interest income $ 6.1 $ 6.6 7.0 % * As a percentage of revenue 0.6 % 0.8 % * not meaningful In 2007 interest income decreased primarily due to an increase in investments in tax exempt securities which have lower interest rates but are exempt from federal income taxes. In 2006 interest income increased as a result of investing our incremental cash and cash equivalents in short term investments with maturities of three months or less. Our incremental cash and cash equivalents resulted from our initial public offering proceeds and cash from operations. 27 Table of Contents Income Tax (Provision) Benefit For the years endedDecember 31, %increase2007 over2006 %increase2006 over2005 2007 2006 2005 (dollars in millions) Income tax (provision) benefit $ (43.4 ) $ (26.8 ) $ 7.5 61.9 % * As a percentage of revenue (4.0 )% (3.3 )% 1.2 % Effective tax rate 38.1 % 39.3 % (24.7 )% * not meaningful The 2007 effective tax rate decreased primarily due to increased investments in tax exempt securities and a decrease in our estimated statutory state tax rate. The improvement was partially offset by a $0.5 million tax effect from non deductible costs associated with the secondary offering and split off transaction in 2006. The total tax provision for 2006 of $26.8 million represents a 39.3% effective tax rate. During 2005, we determined that it was more likely than not we would realize our deferred tax assets and we reversed our valuation allowance of $20.3 million resulting in a $7.5 million tax benefit and an effective tax rate benefit of 24.7%. Excluding the $20.3 million non recurring tax benefit, the effective tax rate for 2005 would have been 42.6%. The decrease in the effective tax rate is largely due to a decrease in the estimated statutory state rate for enacted changes in state tax laws, the favorable impact of changes in our state tax footprint due to growth, the declining impact of meals and entertainment disallowance as taxable income increases, our investing in tax exempt securities and a permanent difference related to stock based compensation in 2005. Quarterly Financial Data/Seasonality The following table presents consolidated statement of income data for each of the eight quarters in the period ended December 31, 2007. The operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results for any subsequent quarter. 2007 Quarters Ended Mar. 31 June 30 Sept. 30 Dec. 31 (dollars in millions) Revenue $ 236.1 $ 274.3 $ 286.4 $ 289.0 Operating income $ 18.6 $ 30.7 $ 31.4 $ 27.5 Net income $ 12.4 $ 20.0 $ 20.6 $ 17.6 Number of restaurants opened in quarter 28 32 28 37 Comparable restaurant sales increase 8.3 % 11.6 % 12.4 % 10.6 % 2006 Quarters Ended Mar. 31 June 30 Sept. 30 Dec. 31 (dollars in millions) Revenue $ 187.0 $ 204.9 $ 211.3 $ 219.7 Operating income $ 12.7 $ 15.9 $ 17.9 $ 15.5 Net income $ 8.0 $ 10.8 $ 11.8 $ 10.8 Number of restaurants opened in quarter 15 14 30 35 Comparable restaurant sales increase 19.7 % 14.5 % 11.6 % 10.1 % Seasonal factors cause our profitability to fluctuate from quarter to quarter. Historically, our restaurant sales are lower in the first and fourth quarters due, in part, to the holiday season and because fewer people eat out during periods of inclement weather (the winter months) than during periods of mild or warm weather (the spring, summer and fall months). Other factors also have a seasonal effect on our results. For example, restaurants located near colleges and universities generally do more business during the academic year. The 28 Table of Contents number of trading days in a quarter can also affect our results. Overall, on an annual basis, changes in trading dates do not have a significant impact on our results. Our quarterly results are also affected by other factors such as the number of new restaurants opened in a quarter and unanticipated events. New restaurants typically have lower margins following opening as a result of the expenses associated with opening new restaurants and their operating inefficiencies in the months immediately following opening. In addition, unanticipated events also impact our results. Accordingly, results for a particular quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary liquidity and capital requirements are for new restaurant construction, working capital and general corporate needs. We have a cash, cash equivalent, and short term investment balance of $171.2 million that we expect to utilize, along with cash flow from operations, to provide capital to support the growth of our business (primarily through opening restaurants), and to continue to maintain our existing restaurants and for general corporate purposes. We believe that cash from operations, together with our cash balance, will be enough to meet ongoing capital expenditures, working capital requirements and other cash needs over at least the next 24 months. In August 2007, we entered into a revolving line of credit with a principal amount of $15 million which expires in August 2008. The line of credit is for support of letters of credit we issue in the normal course of business and normal short term working capital needs. The line of credit bears interest at our option at the prime rate, a fixed rate determined by the bank or an adjusted LIBOR rate. As of December 31, 2007, no amounts were outstanding. We havent required significant working capital because customers pay using cash or credit cards and because our operations do not require significant receivables, nor do they require significant inventories due, in part, to our use of various fresh ingredients. In addition, we generally have the right to pay for the purchase of food, beverage and supplies some time after the receipt of those items, generally within ten days, thereby reducing the need for incremental working capital to support our growth. While operations continue to provide cash, our primary use of cash is in new restaurant development. As we expand into more urban areas, our average costs to open new restaurants will increase due to more significant reconstruction work that often needs to be done on those sites. Our total capital expenditures for 2007 were $141 million, and we expect to incur capital expenditures of about $150 million in 2008, relating primarily to our construction of new restaurants in both periods. In 2007, we spent on average about $880,000 in development and construction costs per restaurant, with end caps costing about $740,000, in lines costing about $930,000, free standing costing about $1.1 million and urban costing about $1.4 million (in each case, reduced for landlord reimbursements). The average development and construction costs per restaurant increased from $860,000 in 2006 due to opening a larger portion of our restaurants in urban locations being partially offset by a decline in the percentage of free standing restaurant openings and decreasing our average restaurant size. In 2008, we expect average development and construction costs to be approximately $900,000 per restaurant as a result of developing in higher cost markets as well as inflation in construction costs. 29 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations Our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2007 were as follows: Payments Due by Period Total 1 year 2 3 years 4 5 years After5 years (in thousands) Operating leases $ 1,410,566 $ 76,469 $ 155,795 $ 157,452 $ 1,020,850 Deemed landlord financing 7,395 366 740 785 5,504 Other contractual obligations(1) 12,271 12,271 Total contractual cash obligations $ 1,430,232 $ 89,106 $ 156,535 $ 158,237 $ 1,026,354 (1) We enter into various purchase obligations in the ordinary course of business. Those that are binding primarily relate to amounts owed under contractor and subcontractor agreements, orders submitted for equipment for restaurants under construction, and corporate sponsorships. Were obligated under non cancelable leases for our restaurants and administrative offices. Our leases generally have initial terms of either five to ten years with two or more five year extensions, for end cap and in line restaurants, or 15 to 20 years with several five year extensions, for free standing restaurants. Our leases generally require us to pay a proportionate share of real estate taxes, insurance, common charges and other operating costs. Some restaurant leases provide for contingent rental payments based on sales thresholds, although we generally do not expect to pay significant contingent rent on these properties based on the thresholds in those leases. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, we had no off balance sheet arrangements or obligations. Inflation The primary areas of our operations affected by inflation are food, labor, fuel, insurance, utility costs and materials used in the construction of our restaurants. Although almost all of our crew members make more than the minimum wage, increases in the applicable federal or state minimum wage will have an impact on our labor costs. Additionally, many of our leases require us to pay taxes, maintenance, utilities and insurance, all of which are generally subject to inflationary increases. Critical Accounting Estimates We describe our significant accounting policies in Note 1 of our consolidated financial statements. Critical accounting estimates are those that we believe are both significant and that require us to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often because we need to estimate the effect of inherently uncertain matters. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experiences and various other factors that we believe to be appropriate under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates, and we might obtain different estimates if we used different assumptions or factors. We believe the following critical accounting estimates affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements: Leases We lease most of our restaurant locations. Our leases contain escalating rentals over the lease term as well as optional renewal periods. We account for our leases under FASB Statement No. 13, Accounting for Leases (FAS 13) which requires rent to be recognized on a straight line basis over the lease term including reasonably 30 Table of Contents assured renewal periods. We have estimated that our lease term, including reasonably assured renewal periods, is the lesser of the lease term or 20 years. If the estimate of our reasonably assured lease terms were changed our depreciation and rent expense could differ materially. Stock based Compensation We recognize compensation expense for equity awards over the vesting period based on the awards fair value. We use the Black Scholes valuation model to determine the fair value of our stock options, which requires assumptions to be made regarding our stock price volatility, the expected life of the option and expected dividend rates. The volatility assumptions were derived primarily from historical volatilities of competitors whose shares are traded in the public markets and are adjusted to reflect anticipated behavior specific to us and our volatility while a public company. Had we arrived at different assumptions of stock price volatility or expected lives of our options, our stock based compensation expense and result of operations could have been different. Insurance Liability We maintain various insurance policies for employee health, workers compensation, general liability and property damage. Pursuant to these policies we are either responsible for losses up to certain limits or are self insured but have third party insurance coverage to limit exposure to these claims. We record a liability that represents our estimated cost of claims incurred and unpaid as of the balance sheet date. Our estimated liability is not discounted and is based on a number of assumptions and factors, including historical trends, actuarial assumptions and economic conditions, and is closely monitored and adjusted when warranted by changing circumstances. In addition, our history of claims experience is short and our significant growth rate could affect the accuracy of estimates based on historical experience. Should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what was estimated or medical costs increase beyond what was expected, our accrued liabilities might not be sufficient and additional expenses may be recorded. Actual claims experience could also be more favorable than estimated resulting in expense reductions. Unanticipated changes may produce materially different amounts of expense than that reported under these programs. Reserves/Contingencies for Litigation and Other Matters We are involved in various claims and legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of business. These actions are subject to many uncertainties, and we cannot predict the outcomes with any degree of certainty. Consequently, we were unable to ascertain the ultimate aggregate amount of monetary liability or financial impact with respect to these matters as of December 31, 2007 and 2006. Once resolved, however, these actions may affect our operating results and cash flows. Sabbatical Liability We offer our employees a sabbatical leave after each ten years of service they complete. We record a liability for our estimate of the accumulated sabbatical expense as of the balance sheet date. Our estimated liability is based on a number of factors including actuarial assumptions and historical trends. Changes in assumptions and trends could result in a materially different liability and expense. Adoption of New Accounting Standards In September 2006, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) issued EITF Issue No. 06 2, Accounting for Sabbatical Leave and Other Similar Benefits Pursuant to FASB Statement No. 43 Accounting for Compensated Absences (EITF 06 2). The EITF concluded that sabbatical leave accumulates pursuant to the criteria of Statement of Accounting Standard No. 43 Accounting for Compensated Absences (FAS 43) and therefore the benefit should be accrued if the remaining criteria of FAS 43 are met. EITF 06 2 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. EITF 06 2 can be applied as a change in accounting principle either as a 31 Table of Contents cumulative effect adjustment to beginning retained earnings in the year of adoption or as retrospective application to all prior periods. We offer sabbatical leave to employees who have provided ten years of services. Previously, we expensed sabbatical costs as incurred. We determined an estimated accrued sabbatical balance as of December 31, 2006 of $2.6 million which we recognized as a cumulative effect adjustment to beginning retained earnings in the first quarter of 2007. During 2007, the assumptions used were changed to estimate the accrual for only the sabbatical currently being earned. In addition, the tax impact of the cumulative effect adjustment had been excluded. As a result, we adjusted the amount of the cumulative effect adjustment that was recorded to retained earnings effective January 1, 2007 to $1.0 million (net of taxes of $675,000). We have deemed the impact of the adjustment to be immaterial to the consolidated balance sheet for each of the 2007 quarterly reports. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we accrued sabbatical expense of $331,000 (net of taxes of $212,000). Effective January 1, 2007, we adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48). FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance on de recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. Adoption of FIN 48 did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, (FAS 159). FAS 159 allows entities the option to measure eligible financial instruments at fair value as of specified dates. Unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected are reported in earnings. FAS 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. We do not expect to elect the option to measure any existing financial instruments at fair value, therefore, we do not expect the adoption of FAS 159 to have an impact on our consolidated financial statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, (FAS 157). FAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities, and expands disclosure about fair value measurements. FAS 157 applies whenever other statements require or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value and is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. We do not expect the adoption of FAS 157 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK Changing Interest Rates Were exposed to interest rate risk through the investment of our cash, cash equivalents, and available for sale securities. Changes in interest rates affect the interest income we earn, and therefore impact our cash flows and results of operations. As of December 31, 2007, we had $163.5 million deposited in short term investments and available for sale securities bearing a weighted average interest rate of 3.6% (approximately 5.2% tax equivalent). Commodity Price Risks Were also exposed to commodity price risks. Many of the ingredients we use to prepare our food, as well as our packaging materials, are commodities that are affected by weather, seasonality, production, availability and other factors outside our control. We work closely with our suppliers and use a mix of forward pricing protocols under which we agree with our supplier on fixed prices for deliveries at sometime in the future, fixed pricing protocols under which we agree on a fixed price with our supplier for the duration of that protocol, and formula 32 Table of Contents pricing protocols under which the prices we pay are based on specified formula related to the prices of the goods, such as spot prices. Though we do not have long term supply contracts or guaranteed purchase amounts, our pricing protocols with suppliers can remain in effect for periods ranging from one month to a year, depending on the outlook for prices of the particular ingredient. We also sometimes buy supplies at current market or spot prices. Weve tried to increase, where necessary, the number of suppliers for our ingredients, which we believe can help mitigate pricing volatility, and we follow industry news, trade issues, weather, crises and other world events that may affect supply prices. Long term increases in ingredient prices could adversely affect our future results if we could not increase menu prices at the same pace for competitive or other reasons. Similarly, if we believe the ingredient price increase to be short in duration we may choose not to pass on the cost increases, which could adversely affect our short term financial results. 33 Table of Contents
