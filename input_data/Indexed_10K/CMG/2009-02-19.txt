MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS You should read the following discussion together with Item 6. Selected Consolidated Financial Data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. The discussion contains forward looking statements involving risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause our results to differ materially from expectations. Factors that might cause such differences include those described in Item 1A. Risk Factors and elsewhere in this report. Overview Chipotle operates fresh Mexican food restaurants serving burritos, tacos, burrito bowls (a burrito without the tortilla) and salads. We began with a simple philosophy: demonstrate that food served fast doesnt have to be a traditional fast food experience. Over the years, that vision has evolved. Today, our vision is to change the way people think about and eat fast food. We do this by avoiding a formulaic approach when creating our restaurant experience, looking to fine dining restaurants for inspiration. We use high quality raw ingredients, classic cooking methods and a distinctive interior design, and have friendly people to take care of each customer features that are more frequently found in the world of fine dining. Our approach is also guided by our belief in an idea we call Food With Integrity. Our objective is to find the highest quality ingredients we can ingredients that are grown or raised with respect for the environment, animals and people who grow or raise the food. 2008 Highlights and Trends Restaurant Development. As of December 31, 2008, we operated 837 restaurants in 33 states throughout the United States, the District of Columbia, and Toronto, Canada. New restaurants have contributed substantially to our restaurant sales growth. We opened 136 restaurants in 2008. We expect to open between 120 and 130 restaurants in 2009, including one in London. Sales Growth. In addition to growing our number of restaurants, we have experienced increases in our average restaurant sales from $1.734 million as of December 31, 2007 to $1.763 million as of December 31, 2008 driven by comparable restaurant sales increases. Our comparable restaurant sales increases were 5.8% in 2008 and 10.8% in 2007. Comparable restaurant sales increases in 2008 were due mainly to menu price increases. Our comparable restaurant sales increases decelerated during 2008, which we believe was due primarily to the weakened economy. We define average restaurant sales as the average trailing 12 month sales for company operated restaurants in operation for at least 12 full calendar months. Comparable restaurant sales include company operated restaurants only and represent the change in period over period sales for restaurants beginning in their 13th full month of operation. We expect our comparable restaurant sales increases in 2009 to be in the low single digits driven primarily by menu price increases implemented in the fourth quarter of 2008, partially or fully offset by a decrease in customer visits. Due to fluctuations in consumer spending as a result of economic uncertainty, potential traffic declines as a result of our recent menu price increases and variability in prior year comparisons, we could experience rapid and large changes in our comparable restaurant sales trends during the year. Food Costs. The cost of many basic foods for humans and animals, including corn, wheat, rice and oil increased over 2007 prices. This resulted in upward pricing pressures on almost all of our raw ingredients including chicken, beef, tortillas and rice. In addition, freezes during 2007 in California and Chile put pricing pressure on avocados during 2008. We experienced a significant increase in cheese prices throughout 2008 as a result of the expiration of the pricing protocols under which we operated during 2007. We also experienced significant increases in the cost of rice, soy oil and sweet corn in conjunction with the renewal of those pricing protocols at the end of the third quarter of 2008. In response to the increasing raw ingredient prices, we instituted menu price increases in the fourth quarter of 2008 for most of the country. This increase, combined with some easing of commodity costs will likely result in flat food costs as a percentage of revenue for 2009. 25 Table of Contents Labor. Although we have not been directly impacted by recent minimum wage increases, we experienced some upward pressure on our restaurant wages in 2008 and expect further pressure into 2009. As a result, we do not expect to see improvements in our labor expense as a percentage of revenue into 2009. In addition to excelling in providing quality food and customer service, restaurant managers are expected to contribute substantially to the development of their crew. Our restaurant management structure is designed to facilitate the development of crew members into restaurant managers, and we emphasized the importance of hiring and developing great crew at our first all managers conference we held in August. We continue to focus on ensuring our employee practices are as exceptional as our food. We have sought to ensure that we have an effective and efficient field support system for restaurant managers that supports our efforts to identify people with potential, develops crew into managers and ensures high operating standards of our restaurants. In an effort to achieve this we continue to develop the Restaurateur program, which is designed to encourage the restaurant manager position as a career opportunity for our top performing restaurant managers. We have also been working to leverage our Restaurateurs leadership by giving select Restaurateurs responsibility for mentoring nearby restaurants. This provides the opportunity for Restaurateurs to develop into field leadership roles as well. Food With Integrity. In addition to continuing to serve naturally raised pork in all our restaurants, we now serve naturally raised chicken in all of our restaurants in the United States and naturally raised beef in about 60%. However, current economic conditions have led to natural chicken supply shortages. As a result, we temporarily suspended serving naturally raised chicken in certain limited restaurants for a short period of time. We define naturally raised as coming from animals that are fed a pure vegetarian diet, never given antibiotics or hormones, and raised humanely in open pastures or deeply bedded pens which is more stringent than the USDAs new standard for naturally raised marketing claims. In 2008, 30% of all beans we bought were organically grown and we have increased the percentage to 35% for 2009. Also during 2008, we purchased at least 25% of at least one produce item while in season for each of our markets from small and midsize local farmers. We expect to increase the amount of locally grown produce purchased during 2009. At the end of 2008, 10% of the milk used in our cheese came from cows raised in pastures and we expect to increase that percentage during 2009. Marketing. While our marketing approach has often been considered edgy and innovative, we recognize the need for our marketing to evolve, much as we have evolved our food culture and our unique people culture. In January 2009 we hired our first chief marketing officer and a new advertising agency, and we are taking a fresh look at our marketing strategy and direction with an eye to making our marketing more effective. Stock Repurchase. In September 2008, our Board of Directors approved the expenditure of up to $100 million to repurchase shares of our class B common stock, of which we purchased $30.0 million in 2008. We have entered into an agreement with a broker under SEC rule 10b5 1, authorizing the broker to make open market purchases of class B common stock from time to time, subject to market conditions. The repurchase agreement and the Boards authorization of the repurchase program may be modified, suspended, or discontinued at any time. Cash and Securities. As of December 31, 2008, we had cash and securities of $188.0 million. Given the recent financial turmoil, we have focused on capital preservation and invested our cash and securities solely in U.S. Treasuries, Treasury backed funds and FDIC insured accounts. 2008 Accounting Adjustments. We completed an analysis of unredeemed electronic gift card liabilities and recognized $2.3 million in revenue as a one time cumulative adjustment for the recognition of unused gift card balances. We implemented lease management software to perform the calculation of straight line rent expense and deferred rent. During the implementation, we identified certain adjustments related to our historical straight line 26 Table of Contents lease calculations, which were not recognized in our 2005 and prior consolidated financial statements. As a result, we recognized an additional $2.6 million in occupancy costs in the current period to correct this misstatement. See Note 1 of our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional disclosure on the accounting adjustments. Restaurant Openings, Relocations and Closures The following table details restaurant unit data for our company operated and franchised locations for the years indicated. For the years endedDecember 31, 2008 2007 2006 Company operated Beginning of year 704 573 481 Openings 136 125 94 Relocations and closures (3 ) (2 ) (2 ) Franchise acquisitions 8 End of year 837 704 573 Franchises, end of the year 8 Total restaurants, end of year 837 704 581 Results of Operations Our results of operations as a percentage of revenue and period over period variances are discussed in the following section. As our business grows, as we open more restaurants and hire more employees, our restaurant operating costs increase. Restaurant Sales For the years endedDecember 31, %increase2008 over2007 %increase2007 over2006 2008 2007 2006 (dollars in millions) Restaurant sales $ 1,332.0 $ 1,085.0 $ 819.8 22.8 % 32.4 % Average restaurant sales $ 1.763 $ 1.734 $ 1.611 1.7 % 7.6 % Comparable restaurant sales increase 5.8 % 10.8 % 13.7 % Number of company operated restaurants as of the end of the year 837 704 573 18.9 % 22.9 % Number of company operated restaurants opened in the year, net of closures and relocations 133 123 92 The significant factors contributing to our increases in sales were new restaurant openings and comparable restaurant sales increases. Restaurant sales from restaurants not yet in the comparable base contributed to $182.3 million of the increase in sales in 2008, of which $93.3 million was attributable to restaurants opened during the year. In 2007, restaurant sales from restaurants not yet in the comparable restaurant base contributed to $167.2 million of the increase in sales, of which $83.8 million was attributable to restaurants opened in 2007. Comparable restaurant sales increases contributed to $62.6 million and $98.1 million of the increase in restaurant sales in 2008 and 2007, respectively. In 2008 the substantial majority of our comparable restaurant 27 Table of Contents sales growth was driven by menu price increases and in 2007 was due primarily to an increase in the number of transactions and menu price increases in certain markets in conjunction with the introduction of naturally raised beef or chicken. Food, Beverage and Packaging Costs For the years endedDecember 31, %increase2008 over2007 %increase2007 over2006 2008 2007 2006 Food, beverage and packaging $ 431.9 $ 346.4 $ 258.0 24.7 % 34.3 % As a percentage of revenue 32.4 % 31.9 % 31.4 % Food, beverage and packaging costs increased as a percentage of revenue in 2008 due to increased product cost, primarily cheese, chicken and avocados, partially offset by menu price increases in selected markets. We saw significantly higher costs for many of our raw ingredients in 2008. In 2007, food costs increased as a percentage of revenue due primarily to increased product costs, primarily avocados, chicken and steak, partially offset by menu price increases in selected markets in conjunction with the introduction of naturally raised beef or chicken, and improvements in food controls. Labor Costs For the years endedDecember 31, %increase2008 over2007 %increase2007 over2006 2008 2007 2006 (dollars in millions) Labor costs $ 351.0 $ 289.4 $ 231.1 21.3 % 25.2 % As a percentage of revenue 26.4 % 26.7 % 28.1 % Labor costs decreased as a percentage of revenue in 2008 primarily due to the impact of menu price increases partially offset by increased average wage rates and labor inefficiencies associated with the new restaurant openings. In 2007, labor costs as a percentage of revenue decreased due to more effective management of staffing, improved efficiency as restaurant sales increased faster than the need to add labor and lower insurance claims benefiting us as we became self insured in the fourth quarter of 2006. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in average wage rates. Occupancy Costs For the years endedDecember 31, %increase2008 over2007 %increase2007 over2006 2008 2007 2006 (dollars in millions) Occupancy costs $ 98.1 $ 75.9 $ 58.8 29.2 % 29.1 % As a percentage of revenue 7.4 % 7.0 % 7.1 % Occupancy costs increased as a percentage of revenue in 2008 primarily due to higher average rents for new locations primarily due to our opening proportionately more restaurants in expensive urban areas in 2008 and a one time $2.6 million non cash correction of our historical straight line rent expense. The increase was partially offset by higher average restaurant sales on a partially fixed cost base. 28 Table of Contents In 2007, occupancy costs decreased as a percentage of revenue due to higher average restaurant sales on a partially fixed cost base, partially offset by higher rents for new locations. Other Operating Costs For the years endedDecember 31, %increase2008 over2007 %increase2007 over2006 2008 2007 2006 (dollars in millions) Other operating costs $ 164.0 $ 131.5 $ 102.7 24.7 % 28.0 % As a percentage of revenue 12.3 % 12.1 % 12.5 % Other operating costs as a percentage of revenue increased in 2008 primarily due to increased utilities, repair and maintenance costs, and credit card processing fees resulting from a higher percentage of our customers using credit cards. The increase was partially offset by lower marketing and promotional spend. In 2007 other operating costs declined as a percentage of revenue primarily due to the effect of higher average restaurant sales on a partially fixed cost base and operating efficiencies that were realized as we grew. We also realized a benefit in 2007 related to our promote from within strategy which reduced the dollars we spent on training external hires. General and Administrative Expenses For the years endedDecember 31, %increase2008 over2007 %increase2007 over2006 2008 2007 2006 (dollars in millions) General and administrative expense $ 89.2 $ 75.0 $ 65.3 18.8 % 14.9 % As a percentage of revenue 6.7 % 6.9 % 7.9 % The increase in general and administrative expenses in 2008 primarily resulted from hiring more employees as we grew, an increase in stock based compensation expense resulting from the stock based compensation awards granted in 2008, and the cost of the all manager conference held in the third quarter. This increase was partially offset by lower performance related bonus accruals. As a percentage of revenue, general and administrative expenses decreased in 2008 due primarily to menu price increases and lower performance related bonus accruals. The increase in general and administrative expense in 2007 primarily resulted from hiring more employees as we grew and stock based compensation awards granted in 2007. The increase was partially offset by the reversal of the credit card contingency reserve in the second quarter of 2007 and the impact of costs incurred for the exchange offer conducted by McDonalds in the third quarter of 2006, a secondary offering of our common stock in the second quarter of 2006 and severance costs incurred in the first and second quarters of 2006. As a percentage of revenue, general and administrative expenses decreased in 2007 due primarily to the effect of higher restaurant sales on a partially fixed cost base, the reversal of the credit card contingency in 2007 and the costs incurred for the secondary and exchange offers and severance negatively impacting 2006. Depreciation and Amortization For the years endedDecember 31, %increase2008 over2007 %increase2007 over2006 2008 2007 2006 (dollars in millions) Depreciation and amortization $ 52.8 $ 43.6 $ 34.3 21.0 % 27.3 % As a percentage of revenue 4.0 % 4.0 % 4.2 % 29 Table of Contents Depreciation and amortization increased in 2008 and 2007 primarily due to the increase in the number of restaurants from January 1, 2006 to December 31, 2008. In 2008, as a percentage of total revenue, depreciation and amortization remained constant due to new store openings increasing the average per store depreciable base offset by higher average restaurant sales on a partially fixed cost base. In 2007, as a percentage of revenue depreciation and amortization decreased as a result of higher average restaurant sales on a partially fixed cost base. Pre opening Costs For the years endedDecember 31, %increase2008 over2007 %increase2007 over2006 2008 2007 2006 (dollars in millions) Pre opening costs $ 11.6 $ 9.6 $ 6.8 21.3 % 41.4 % As a percentage of revenue 0.9 % 0.9 % 0.8 % Restaurant openings 136 125 94 Pre opening costs increased in 2008 and 2007 primarily due to an increase in rent expense recognized during the construction period and an increase in the number of restaurants opened. Pre opening costs include non cash straight line rent expense of $5.9 million, $4.6 million and $2.7 million for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Loss on Disposal of Assets For the years endedDecember 31, %increase2008 over2007 %increase2007 over2006 2008 2007 2006 (dollars in millions) Loss on disposal of assets $ 9.3 $ 6.2 $ 4.0 51.4 % 54.9 % As a percentage of revenue 0.7 % 0.6 % 0.5 % Loss on disposal of assets increased in 2008 as a result of an increase in both the age and number of restaurants and updating older restaurants in certain markets, an increase in write offs associated with investigating potential restaurant sites that we considered but subsequently rejected, and an impairment charge related to a pending closure of a restaurant. The increase in 2007 in loss on disposal of assets was due to an increase in both the age and number of restaurants, the upgrade of restaurant security systems and an increase in the write offs associated with investigating potential restaurant sites that we considered but subsequently rejected. Interest Income For the years endedDecember 31, %decrease2008 over2007 %decrease2007 over2006 2008 2007 2006 (dollars in millions) Interest income $ 3.5 $ 6.1 $ 6.6 (43.3 )% (7.0 )% As a percentage of revenue 0.3 % 0.6 % 0.8 % In 2008, interest income decreased primarily due to lower yields on our investments. In addition, late in the third quarter of 2008, we moved our investments into more secure, but lower yielding U.S. Treasury funds. This 30 Table of Contents decrease is partially offset by a higher average cash balance and fewer tax exempt securities which have lower interest rates but are exempt from federal income taxes. In 2007 interest income decreased primarily due to an increase in investments in tax exempt securities. Income Tax Provision For the years endedDecember 31, %increase2008 over2007 %increase2007 over2006 2008 2007 2006 (dollars in millions) Income tax provision $ 49.0 $ 43.4 $ 26.8 12.8 % 61.9 % Effective tax rate 38.5 % 38.1 % 39.3 % The 2008 effective tax rate increased primarily due to a reduction in earnings on tax exempt investments partially offset by a decrease in our estimated statutory state tax rate. The 2007 effective tax rate decreased primarily due to increased investments in tax exempt securities and a decrease in our estimated statutory state tax rate. The improvement was partially offset by a $0.5 million tax effect from non deductible costs associated with the secondary offering and split off transaction in 2006. Quarterly Financial Data/Seasonality The following table presents consolidated statement of income data for each of the eight quarters in the period ended December 31, 2008. The operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results for any subsequent quarter. 2008 Quarters Ended Mar. 31 June 30 Sept. 30 Dec. 31 (dollars in millions) Revenue $ 305.3 $ 340.8 $ 340.5 $ 345.3 Operating income $ 26.8 $ 38.3 $ 31.1 $ 27.8 Net income $ 17.3 $ 24.5 $ 19.5 $ 16.9 Number of restaurants opened in quarter 28 49 20 39 Comparable restaurant sales increase 10.2 % 7.1 % 3.1 % 3.5 % 2007 Quarters Ended Mar. 31 June 30 Sept. 30 Dec. 31 (dollars in millions) Revenue $ 236.1 $ 274.3 $ 286.4 $ 289.0 Operating income $ 18.6 $ 30.7 $ 31.4 $ 27.5 Net income $ 12.4 $ 20.0 $ 20.6 $ 17.6 Number of restaurants opened in quarter 28 32 28 37 Comparable restaurant sales increase 8.3 % 11.6 % 12.4 % 10.6 % Seasonal factors cause our profitability to fluctuate from quarter to quarter. Historically, our average daily restaurant sales and net income are lower in the first and fourth quarters due, in part, to the holiday season and because fewer people eat out during periods of inclement weather (the winter months) than during periods of mild or warm weather (the spring, summer and fall months). Other factors also have a seasonal effect on our results. For example, restaurants located near colleges and universities generally do more business during the academic year. The number of trading days in a quarter can also affect our results. Overall, on an annual basis, changes in trading dates do not have a significant impact on our results. Our quarterly results are also affected by other factors such as the number of new restaurants opened in a quarter and unanticipated events. New restaurants typically have lower margins following opening as a result of 31 Table of Contents the expenses associated with opening new restaurants and their operating inefficiencies in the months immediately following opening. In addition, unanticipated events also impact our results. Accordingly, results for a particular quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary liquidity and capital requirements are for new restaurant construction, working capital and general corporate needs. We have a cash and short term investment balance of $188.0 million that we expect to utilize, along with cash flow from operations, to provide capital to support the growth of our business (primarily through opening restaurants), to repurchase up to an additional $70.0 million of our class B common stock subject to market conditions, to continue to maintain our existing restaurants and for general corporate purposes. We believe that cash from operations, together with our cash balance, will be enough to meet ongoing capital expenditures, working capital requirements and other cash needs over at least the next 24 months. We havent required significant working capital because customers pay using cash or credit cards and because our operations do not require significant receivables, nor do they require significant inventories due, in part, to our use of various fresh ingredients. In addition, we generally have the right to pay for the purchase of food, beverage and supplies some time after the receipt of those items, generally within ten days, thereby reducing the need for incremental working capital to support our growth. In February 2009, we entered into an unsecured revolving credit facility with Bank of America, N.A. with an initial principal amount of $25 million and an additional $25 million accordion feature. Borrowings under the credit facility will bear interest at a rate set, at our option, at either (i) a rate equal to an adjusted LIBOR rate plus a margin ranging from 0.75% to 2.0% depending on a lease adjusted leverage ratio, or (ii) a daily rate equal to (a) the highest of the federal funds rate plus 0.5%, the banks published prime rate, and one month LIBOR plus 1.0%, plus (b) a margin ranging from 0.0% to 1.0% depending on a lease adjusted leverage ratio. The facility requires that we pay a commitment fee on the unused balance ranging from 0.25% to 0.5%, based on the lease adjusted leverage ratio. Availability of borrowings under the facility requires that we be in compliance with specified covenants including a maximum lease adjusted leverage ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. The facility expires in February 2014, but can be terminated or decreased at our option prior to expiration. We intend to use the credit facility, if at all, for letters of credit we issue in the normal course of business and normal short term working capital needs. While operations continue to provide cash, our primary use of cash is in new restaurant development. As we expand into more urban areas, our average costs to open new restaurants will increase due to more significant reconstruction work that often needs to be done on those sites. Our total capital expenditures for 2008 were $152.1 million, and we expect to incur capital expenditures of about $140 million in 2009, of which $120 million relates to our construction of new restaurants and the remainder primarily relates to restaurant reinvestments. In 2008, we spent on average about $916,000 in development and construction costs per restaurant, with end caps costing about $774,000, in lines costing about $965,000, free standing costing about $1.2 million and urban costing about $1.6 million (in each case, reduced for landlord reimbursements). The average development and construction costs per restaurant increased from $880,000 in 2007 due to opening a larger portion of our restaurants in urban locations being partially offset by a decline in the percentage of free standing restaurant openings and decreasing our average restaurant size. In 2009, we expect average development and construction costs to remain about the same overall as 2008. 32 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations Our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2008 were as follows: Payments Due by Period Total 1 year 2 3 years 4 5 years After5 years (in thousands) Operating leases $ 1,523,183 $ 88,119 $ 176,929 $ 178,998 $ 1,079,137 Deemed landlord financing 7,029 366 764 788 5,111 Other contractual obligations(1) 22,108 21,578 530 Total contractual cash obligations $ 1,552,320 $ 110,063 $ 178,223 $ 179,786 $ 1,084,248 (1) We enter into various purchase obligations in the ordinary course of business. Those that are binding primarily relate to amounts owed under contractor and subcontractor agreements, orders submitted for equipment for restaurants under construction, and corporate sponsorships. Were obligated under non cancelable leases for our restaurants and administrative offices. Our leases generally have initial terms of either five to ten years with two or more five year extensions, for end cap and in line restaurants, or 15 to 20 years with several five year extensions, for free standing restaurants. Our leases generally require us to pay a proportionate share of real estate taxes, insurance, common charges and other operating costs. Some restaurant leases provide for contingent rental payments based on sales thresholds, although we generally do not expect to pay significant contingent rent on these properties based on the thresholds in those leases. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, we had no off balance sheet arrangements or obligations. Inflation The primary areas of our operations affected by inflation are food, labor, fuel, insurance, utility costs and materials used in the construction of our restaurants. Although almost all of our crew members make more than the minimum wage, increases in the applicable federal or state minimum wage will have an impact on our labor costs. Additionally, many of our leases require us to pay taxes, maintenance, utilities and insurance, all of which are generally subject to inflationary increases. Critical Accounting Estimates We describe our significant accounting policies in Note 1 of our consolidated financial statements. Critical accounting estimates are those that we believe are both significant and that require us to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often because we need to estimate the effect of inherently uncertain matters. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experiences and various other factors that we believe to be appropriate under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates, and we might obtain different estimates if we used different assumptions or factors. We believe the following critical accounting estimates affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements: Leases We lease most of our restaurant locations. Our leases contain escalating rentals over the lease term as well as optional renewal periods. We account for our leases under FASB Statement No. 13, Accounting for Leases (FAS 13) which requires rent to be recognized on a straight line basis over the lease term including reasonably assured renewal periods. We have estimated that our lease term, including reasonably assured renewal periods, is the lesser of the lease term or 20 years. If the estimate of our reasonably assured lease terms were changed our depreciation and rent expense could differ materially. 33 Table of Contents Stock based Compensation We recognize compensation expense for equity awards over the vesting period based on the awards fair value. We use the Black Scholes valuation model to determine the fair value of our stock options and stock appreciation rights, which requires assumptions to be made regarding our stock price volatility, the expected life of the award and expected dividend rates. The volatility assumptions were derived primarily from historical volatilities of competitors whose shares are traded in the public markets and are adjusted to reflect anticipated behavior specific to us and our volatility while a public company. Had we arrived at different assumptions of stock price volatility or expected lives of our options and stock appreciation rights, our stock based compensation expense and result of operations could have been different. Insurance Liability We maintain various insurance policies for employee health, workers compensation, general liability and property damage. Pursuant to these policies we are either responsible for losses up to certain limits or are self insured but have third party insurance coverage to limit exposure to these claims. We record a liability that represents our estimated cost of claims incurred and unpaid as of the balance sheet date. Our estimated liability is not discounted and is based on a number of assumptions and factors, including historical trends, actuarial assumptions and economic conditions, and is closely monitored and adjusted when warranted by changing circumstances. In addition, our history of claims experience is short and our significant growth rate could affect the accuracy of estimates based on historical experience. Should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what was estimated or medical costs increase beyond what was expected, our accrued liabilities might not be sufficient and additional expenses may be recorded. Actual claims experience could also be more favorable than estimated resulting in expense reductions. Unanticipated changes may produce materially different amounts of expense than that reported under these programs. Reserves/Contingencies for Litigation and Other Matters We are involved in various claims and legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of business. These actions are subject to many uncertainties, and we cannot predict the outcomes with any degree of certainty. Consequently, we were unable to ascertain the ultimate aggregate amount of monetary liability or financial impact with respect to these matters as of December 31, 2008 and 2007. Once resolved, however, these actions may affect our operating results and cash flows. Sabbatical Liability We offer our employees a sabbatical leave after each ten years of service they complete. We record a liability for our estimate of the accumulated sabbatical expense as of the balance sheet date. Our estimated liability is based on a number of factors including actuarial assumptions and historical trends. Changes in assumptions and trends could result in a materially different liability and expense. Unredeemed Gift Card Balances The Company sells gift cards which do not have an expiration date and it does not deduct non usage fees from outstanding gift card balances. The Company recognizes revenue from gift cards when: (i) the gift card is redeemed by the customer; or (ii) the likelihood of the gift card being redeemed by the customer is remote (gift card breakage) and the Company determines that there is not a legal obligation to remit the unredeemed gift cards to the relevant jurisdiction. The determination of the gift card breakage rate is based upon company specific historical redemption patterns. Gift card breakage will be recognized in revenue as the gift cards are used. Gift card breakage is included in total revenue in the consolidated statement of income. Any future revisions to the estimated breakage rate may result in changes in the amount of breakage revenue recognized in future periods. 34 Table of Contents Adoption of New Accounting Standards Effective January 1, 2008, we adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, (FAS 157). FAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities, and expands disclosure about fair value measurements. FAS 157 applies whenever other statements require or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value. The adoption of FAS 157 did not have an impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK Changing Interest Rates Were exposed to interest rate risk through the investment of our cash, cash equivalents, and available for sale securities. Changes in interest rates affect the interest income we earn, and therefore impact our cash flows and results of operations. Our interest income decreased during 2008 due to a significant reduction in interest rates. As of December 31, 2008, we had $188.2 million deposited in short term investments and available for sale securities bearing a weighted average interest rate of 0.3% (approximately 0.4% tax equivalent). Commodity Price Risks We are also exposed to commodity price risks. Many of the ingredients we use to prepare our food, as well as our packaging materials, are commodities or ingredients that are affected by the price of other commodities, exchange rates, foreign demand, weather, seasonality, production, availability and other factors outside our control. We work closely with our suppliers and use a mix of forward pricing protocols under which we agree with our supplier on fixed prices for deliveries at some time in the future, fixed pricing protocols under which we agree on a fixed price with our supplier for the duration of that protocol, and formula pricing protocols under which the prices we pay are based on a specified formula related to the prices of the goods, such as spot prices. Substantial portions of the dollar value of goods purchased by us are effectively at spot prices. Though we generally do not have long term supply contracts or guaranteed purchase amounts, our pricing protocols with suppliers can remain in effect for periods ranging from one month to a year, depending on the outlook for prices of the particular ingredient. Weve tried to increase, where necessary, the number of suppliers for our ingredients, which we believe can help mitigate pricing volatility, and we follow industry news, trade issues, exchange rates, foreign demand, weather, crises and other world events that may affect supply prices. Increases in ingredient prices have, and could continue to, adversely affect our results if we choose not to increase menu prices at the same pace for competitive or other reasons. Counterparty Risks Some of our suppliers and other vendors have been adversely impacted by tightening of the credit markets, fluctuations in commodity prices and other consequences of the economic downturn. Some vendors have sought to change the terms on which they do business with us in order to lessen the impact of the economic downturn on their business. If we are forced to find alternative vendors for key services, whether due to demands from the vendor or the vendors bankruptcy or ceasing operations, that could be a distraction to us and adversely impact our business. Changing vendors could also result in our inability to obtain business terms as favorable to us as the terms on which we currently operate. 35 Table of Contents 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS You should read the following discussion together with Item 6. Selected Consolidated Financial Data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. The discussion contains forward looking statements involving risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause our results to differ materially from expectations. Factors that might cause such differences include those described in Item 1A. Risk Factors and elsewhere in this report. Overview Chipotle operates fresh Mexican food restaurants serving burritos, tacos, burrito bowls (a burrito without the tortilla) and salads. We began with a simple philosophy: demonstrate that food served fast doesnt have to be a traditional fast food experience. Over the years, that vision has evolved. Today, our vision is to change the way people think about and eat fast food. We do this by avoiding a formulaic approach when creating our restaurant experience, looking to fine dining restaurants for inspiration. We use high quality raw ingredients, classic cooking methods and a distinctive interior design, and have friendly people to take care of each customer features that are more frequently found in the world of fine dining. Our approach is also guided by our belief in an idea we call Food With Integrity. Our objective is to find the highest quality ingredients we can ingredients that are grown or raised with respect for the environment, animals and people who grow or raise the food. 2008 Highlights and Trends Restaurant Development. As of December 31, 2008, we operated 837 restaurants in 33 states throughout the United States, the District of Columbia, and Toronto, Canada. New restaurants have contributed substantially to our restaurant sales growth. We opened 136 restaurants in 2008. We expect to open between 120 and 130 restaurants in 2009, including one in London. Sales Growth. In addition to growing our number of restaurants, we have experienced increases in our average restaurant sales from $1.734 million as of December 31, 2007 to $1.763 million as of December 31, 2008 driven by comparable restaurant sales increases. Our comparable restaurant sales increases were 5.8% in 2008 and 10.8% in 2007. Comparable restaurant sales increases in 2008 were due mainly to menu price increases. Our comparable restaurant sales increases decelerated during 2008, which we believe was due primarily to the weakened economy. We define average restaurant sales as the average trailing 12 month sales for company operated restaurants in operation for at least 12 full calendar months. Comparable restaurant sales include company operated restaurants only and represent the change in period over period sales for restaurants beginning in their 13th full month of operation. We expect our comparable restaurant sales increases in 2009 to be in the low single digits driven primarily by menu price increases implemented in the fourth quarter of 2008, partially or fully offset by a decrease in customer visits. Due to fluctuations in consumer spending as a result of economic uncertainty, potential traffic declines as a result of our recent menu price increases and variability in prior year comparisons, we could experience rapid and large changes in our comparable restaurant sales trends during the year. Food Costs. The cost of many basic foods for humans and animals, including corn, wheat, rice and oil increased over 2007 prices. This resulted in upward pricing pressures on almost all of our raw ingredients including chicken, beef, tortillas and rice. In addition, freezes during 2007 in California and Chile put pricing pressure on avocados during 2008. We experienced a significant increase in cheese prices throughout 2008 as a result of the expiration of the pricing protocols under which we operated during 2007. We also experienced significant increases in the cost of rice, soy oil and sweet corn in conjunction with the renewal of those pricing protocols at the end of the third quarter of 2008. In response to the increasing raw ingredient prices, we instituted menu price increases in the fourth quarter of 2008 for most of the country. This increase, combined with some easing of commodity costs will likely result in flat food costs as a percentage of revenue for 2009. 25 Table of Contents Labor. Although we have not been directly impacted by recent minimum wage increases, we experienced some upward pressure on our restaurant wages in 2008 and expect further pressure into 2009. As a result, we do not expect to see improvements in our labor expense as a percentage of revenue into 2009. In addition to excelling in providing quality food and customer service, restaurant managers are expected to contribute substantially to the development of their crew. Our restaurant management structure is designed to facilitate the development of crew members into restaurant managers, and we emphasized the importance of hiring and developing great crew at our first all managers conference we held in August. We continue to focus on ensuring our employee practices are as exceptional as our food. We have sought to ensure that we have an effective and efficient field support system for restaurant managers that supports our efforts to identify people with potential, develops crew into managers and ensures high operating standards of our restaurants. In an effort to achieve this we continue to develop the Restaurateur program, which is designed to encourage the restaurant manager position as a career opportunity for our top performing restaurant managers. We have also been working to leverage our Restaurateurs leadership by giving select Restaurateurs responsibility for mentoring nearby restaurants. This provides the opportunity for Restaurateurs to develop into field leadership roles as well. Food With Integrity. In addition to continuing to serve naturally raised pork in all our restaurants, we now serve naturally raised chicken in all of our restaurants in the United States and naturally raised beef in about 60%. However, current economic conditions have led to natural chicken supply shortages. As a result, we temporarily suspended serving naturally raised chicken in certain limited restaurants for a short period of time. We define naturally raised as coming from animals that are fed a pure vegetarian diet, never given antibiotics or hormones, and raised humanely in open pastures or deeply bedded pens which is more stringent than the USDAs new standard for naturally raised marketing claims. In 2008, 30% of all beans we bought were organically grown and we have increased the percentage to 35% for 2009. Also during 2008, we purchased at least 25% of at least one produce item while in season for each of our markets from small and midsize local farmers. We expect to increase the amount of locally grown produce purchased during 2009. At the end of 2008, 10% of the milk used in our cheese came from cows raised in pastures and we expect to increase that percentage during 2009. Marketing. While our marketing approach has often been considered edgy and innovative, we recognize the need for our marketing to evolve, much as we have evolved our food culture and our unique people culture. In January 2009 we hired our first chief marketing officer and a new advertising agency, and we are taking a fresh look at our marketing strategy and direction with an eye to making our marketing more effective. Stock Repurchase. In September 2008, our Board of Directors approved the expenditure of up to $100 million to repurchase shares of our class B common stock, of which we purchased $30.0 million in 2008. We have entered into an agreement with a broker under SEC rule 10b5 1, authorizing the broker to make open market purchases of class B common stock from time to time, subject to market conditions. The repurchase agreement and the Boards authorization of the repurchase program may be modified, suspended, or discontinued at any time. Cash and Securities. As of December 31, 2008, we had cash and securities of $188.0 million. Given the recent financial turmoil, we have focused on capital preservation and invested our cash and securities solely in U.S. Treasuries, Treasury backed funds and FDIC insured accounts. 2008 Accounting Adjustments. We completed an analysis of unredeemed electronic gift card liabilities and recognized $2.3 million in revenue as a one time cumulative adjustment for the recognition of unused gift card balances. We implemented lease management software to perform the calculation of straight line rent expense and deferred rent. During the implementation, we identified certain adjustments related to our historical straight line 26 Table of Contents lease calculations, which were not recognized in our 2005 and prior consolidated financial statements. As a result, we recognized an additional $2.6 million in occupancy costs in the current period to correct this misstatement. See Note 1 of our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional disclosure on the accounting adjustments. Restaurant Openings, Relocations and Closures The following table details restaurant unit data for our company operated and franchised locations for the years indicated. For the years endedDecember 31, 2008 2007 2006 Company operated Beginning of year 704 573 481 Openings 136 125 94 Relocations and closures (3 ) (2 ) (2 ) Franchise acquisitions 8 End of year 837 704 573 Franchises, end of the year 8 Total restaurants, end of year 837 704 581 Results of Operations Our results of operations as a percentage of revenue and period over period variances are discussed in the following section. As our business grows, as we open more restaurants and hire more employees, our restaurant operating costs increase. Restaurant Sales For the years endedDecember 31, %increase2008 over2007 %increase2007 over2006 2008 2007 2006 (dollars in millions) Restaurant sales $ 1,332.0 $ 1,085.0 $ 819.8 22.8 % 32.4 % Average restaurant sales $ 1.763 $ 1.734 $ 1.611 1.7 % 7.6 % Comparable restaurant sales increase 5.8 % 10.8 % 13.7 % Number of company operated restaurants as of the end of the year 837 704 573 18.9 % 22.9 % Number of company operated restaurants opened in the year, net of closures and relocations 133 123 92 The significant factors contributing to our increases in sales were new restaurant openings and comparable restaurant sales increases. Restaurant sales from restaurants not yet in the comparable base contributed to $182.3 million of the increase in sales in 2008, of which $93.3 million was attributable to restaurants opened during the year. In 2007, restaurant sales from restaurants not yet in the comparable restaurant base contributed to $167.2 million of the increase in sales, of which $83.8 million was attributable to restaurants opened in 2007. Comparable restaurant sales increases contributed to $62.6 million and $98.1 million of the increase in restaurant sales in 2008 and 2007, respectively. In 2008 the substantial majority of our comparable restaurant 27 Table of Contents sales growth was driven by menu price increases and in 2007 was due primarily to an increase in the number of transactions and menu price increases in certain markets in conjunction with the introduction of naturally raised beef or chicken. Food, Beverage and Packaging Costs For the years endedDecember 31, %increase2008 over2007 %increase2007 over2006 2008 2007 2006 Food, beverage and packaging $ 431.9 $ 346.4 $ 258.0 24.7 % 34.3 % As a percentage of revenue 32.4 % 31.9 % 31.4 % Food, beverage and packaging costs increased as a percentage of revenue in 2008 due to increased product cost, primarily cheese, chicken and avocados, partially offset by menu price increases in selected markets. We saw significantly higher costs for many of our raw ingredients in 2008. In 2007, food costs increased as a percentage of revenue due primarily to increased product costs, primarily avocados, chicken and steak, partially offset by menu price increases in selected markets in conjunction with the introduction of naturally raised beef or chicken, and improvements in food controls. Labor Costs For the years endedDecember 31, %increase2008 over2007 %increase2007 over2006 2008 2007 2006 (dollars in millions) Labor costs $ 351.0 $ 289.4 $ 231.1 21.3 % 25.2 % As a percentage of revenue 26.4 % 26.7 % 28.1 % Labor costs decreased as a percentage of revenue in 2008 primarily due to the impact of menu price increases partially offset by increased average wage rates and labor inefficiencies associated with the new restaurant openings. In 2007, labor costs as a percentage of revenue decreased due to more effective management of staffing, improved efficiency as restaurant sales increased faster than the need to add labor and lower insurance claims benefiting us as we became self insured in the fourth quarter of 2006. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in average wage rates. Occupancy Costs For the years endedDecember 31, %increase2008 over2007 %increase2007 over2006 2008 2007 2006 (dollars in millions) Occupancy costs $ 98.1 $ 75.9 $ 58.8 29.2 % 29.1 % As a percentage of revenue 7.4 % 7.0 % 7.1 % Occupancy costs increased as a percentage of revenue in 2008 primarily due to higher average rents for new locations primarily due to our opening proportionately more restaurants in expensive urban areas in 2008 and a one time $2.6 million non cash correction of our historical straight line rent expense. The increase was partially offset by higher average restaurant sales on a partially fixed cost base. 28 Table of Contents In 2007, occupancy costs decreased as a percentage of revenue due to higher average restaurant sales on a partially fixed cost base, partially offset by higher rents for new locations. Other Operating Costs For the years endedDecember 31, %increase2008 over2007 %increase2007 over2006 2008 2007 2006 (dollars in millions) Other operating costs $ 164.0 $ 131.5 $ 102.7 24.7 % 28.0 % As a percentage of revenue 12.3 % 12.1 % 12.5 % Other operating costs as a percentage of revenue increased in 2008 primarily due to increased utilities, repair and maintenance costs, and credit card processing fees resulting from a higher percentage of our customers using credit cards. The increase was partially offset by lower marketing and promotional spend. In 2007 other operating costs declined as a percentage of revenue primarily due to the effect of higher average restaurant sales on a partially fixed cost base and operating efficiencies that were realized as we grew. We also realized a benefit in 2007 related to our promote from within strategy which reduced the dollars we spent on training external hires. General and Administrative Expenses For the years endedDecember 31, %increase2008 over2007 %increase2007 over2006 2008 2007 2006 (dollars in millions) General and administrative expense $ 89.2 $ 75.0 $ 65.3 18.8 % 14.9 % As a percentage of revenue 6.7 % 6.9 % 7.9 % The increase in general and administrative expenses in 2008 primarily resulted from hiring more employees as we grew, an increase in stock based compensation expense resulting from the stock based compensation awards granted in 2008, and the cost of the all manager conference held in the third quarter. This increase was partially offset by lower performance related bonus accruals. As a percentage of revenue, general and administrative expenses decreased in 2008 due primarily to menu price increases and lower performance related bonus accruals. The increase in general and administrative expense in 2007 primarily resulted from hiring more employees as we grew and stock based compensation awards granted in 2007. The increase was partially offset by the reversal of the credit card contingency reserve in the second quarter of 2007 and the impact of costs incurred for the exchange offer conducted by McDonalds in the third quarter of 2006, a secondary offering of our common stock in the second quarter of 2006 and severance costs incurred in the first and second quarters of 2006. As a percentage of revenue, general and administrative expenses decreased in 2007 due primarily to the effect of higher restaurant sales on a partially fixed cost base, the reversal of the credit card contingency in 2007 and the costs incurred for the secondary and exchange offers and severance negatively impacting 2006. Depreciation and Amortization For the years endedDecember 31, %increase2008 over2007 %increase2007 over2006 2008 2007 2006 (dollars in millions) Depreciation and amortization $ 52.8 $ 43.6 $ 34.3 21.0 % 27.3 % As a percentage of revenue 4.0 % 4.0 % 4.2 % 29 Table of Contents Depreciation and amortization increased in 2008 and 2007 primarily due to the increase in the number of restaurants from January 1, 2006 to December 31, 2008. In 2008, as a percentage of total revenue, depreciation and amortization remained constant due to new store openings increasing the average per store depreciable base offset by higher average restaurant sales on a partially fixed cost base. In 2007, as a percentage of revenue depreciation and amortization decreased as a result of higher average restaurant sales on a partially fixed cost base. Pre opening Costs For the years endedDecember 31, %increase2008 over2007 %increase2007 over2006 2008 2007 2006 (dollars in millions) Pre opening costs $ 11.6 $ 9.6 $ 6.8 21.3 % 41.4 % As a percentage of revenue 0.9 % 0.9 % 0.8 % Restaurant openings 136 125 94 Pre opening costs increased in 2008 and 2007 primarily due to an increase in rent expense recognized during the construction period and an increase in the number of restaurants opened. Pre opening costs include non cash straight line rent expense of $5.9 million, $4.6 million and $2.7 million for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Loss on Disposal of Assets For the years endedDecember 31, %increase2008 over2007 %increase2007 over2006 2008 2007 2006 (dollars in millions) Loss on disposal of assets $ 9.3 $ 6.2 $ 4.0 51.4 % 54.9 % As a percentage of revenue 0.7 % 0.6 % 0.5 % Loss on disposal of assets increased in 2008 as a result of an increase in both the age and number of restaurants and updating older restaurants in certain markets, an increase in write offs associated with investigating potential restaurant sites that we considered but subsequently rejected, and an impairment charge related to a pending closure of a restaurant. The increase in 2007 in loss on disposal of assets was due to an increase in both the age and number of restaurants, the upgrade of restaurant security systems and an increase in the write offs associated with investigating potential restaurant sites that we considered but subsequently rejected. Interest Income For the years endedDecember 31, %decrease2008 over2007 %decrease2007 over2006 2008 2007 2006 (dollars in millions) Interest income $ 3.5 $ 6.1 $ 6.6 (43.3 )% (7.0 )% As a percentage of revenue 0.3 % 0.6 % 0.8 % In 2008, interest income decreased primarily due to lower yields on our investments. In addition, late in the third quarter of 2008, we moved our investments into more secure, but lower yielding U.S. Treasury funds. This 30 Table of Contents decrease is partially offset by a higher average cash balance and fewer tax exempt securities which have lower interest rates but are exempt from federal income taxes. In 2007 interest income decreased primarily due to an increase in investments in tax exempt securities. Income Tax Provision For the years endedDecember 31, %increase2008 over2007 %increase2007 over2006 2008 2007 2006 (dollars in millions) Income tax provision $ 49.0 $ 43.4 $ 26.8 12.8 % 61.9 % Effective tax rate 38.5 % 38.1 % 39.3 % The 2008 effective tax rate increased primarily due to a reduction in earnings on tax exempt investments partially offset by a decrease in our estimated statutory state tax rate. The 2007 effective tax rate decreased primarily due to increased investments in tax exempt securities and a decrease in our estimated statutory state tax rate. The improvement was partially offset by a $0.5 million tax effect from non deductible costs associated with the secondary offering and split off transaction in 2006. Quarterly Financial Data/Seasonality The following table presents consolidated statement of income data for each of the eight quarters in the period ended December 31, 2008. The operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results for any subsequent quarter. 2008 Quarters Ended Mar. 31 June 30 Sept. 30 Dec. 31 (dollars in millions) Revenue $ 305.3 $ 340.8 $ 340.5 $ 345.3 Operating income $ 26.8 $ 38.3 $ 31.1 $ 27.8 Net income $ 17.3 $ 24.5 $ 19.5 $ 16.9 Number of restaurants opened in quarter 28 49 20 39 Comparable restaurant sales increase 10.2 % 7.1 % 3.1 % 3.5 % 2007 Quarters Ended Mar. 31 June 30 Sept. 30 Dec. 31 (dollars in millions) Revenue $ 236.1 $ 274.3 $ 286.4 $ 289.0 Operating income $ 18.6 $ 30.7 $ 31.4 $ 27.5 Net income $ 12.4 $ 20.0 $ 20.6 $ 17.6 Number of restaurants opened in quarter 28 32 28 37 Comparable restaurant sales increase 8.3 % 11.6 % 12.4 % 10.6 % Seasonal factors cause our profitability to fluctuate from quarter to quarter. Historically, our average daily restaurant sales and net income are lower in the first and fourth quarters due, in part, to the holiday season and because fewer people eat out during periods of inclement weather (the winter months) than during periods of mild or warm weather (the spring, summer and fall months). Other factors also have a seasonal effect on our results. For example, restaurants located near colleges and universities generally do more business during the academic year. The number of trading days in a quarter can also affect our results. Overall, on an annual basis, changes in trading dates do not have a significant impact on our results. Our quarterly results are also affected by other factors such as the number of new restaurants opened in a quarter and unanticipated events. New restaurants typically have lower margins following opening as a result of 31 Table of Contents the expenses associated with opening new restaurants and their operating inefficiencies in the months immediately following opening. In addition, unanticipated events also impact our results. Accordingly, results for a particular quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary liquidity and capital requirements are for new restaurant construction, working capital and general corporate needs. We have a cash and short term investment balance of $188.0 million that we expect to utilize, along with cash flow from operations, to provide capital to support the growth of our business (primarily through opening restaurants), to repurchase up to an additional $70.0 million of our class B common stock subject to market conditions, to continue to maintain our existing restaurants and for general corporate purposes. We believe that cash from operations, together with our cash balance, will be enough to meet ongoing capital expenditures, working capital requirements and other cash needs over at least the next 24 months. We havent required significant working capital because customers pay using cash or credit cards and because our operations do not require significant receivables, nor do they require significant inventories due, in part, to our use of various fresh ingredients. In addition, we generally have the right to pay for the purchase of food, beverage and supplies some time after the receipt of those items, generally within ten days, thereby reducing the need for incremental working capital to support our growth. In February 2009, we entered into an unsecured revolving credit facility with Bank of America, N.A. with an initial principal amount of $25 million and an additional $25 million accordion feature. Borrowings under the credit facility will bear interest at a rate set, at our option, at either (i) a rate equal to an adjusted LIBOR rate plus a margin ranging from 0.75% to 2.0% depending on a lease adjusted leverage ratio, or (ii) a daily rate equal to (a) the highest of the federal funds rate plus 0.5%, the banks published prime rate, and one month LIBOR plus 1.0%, plus (b) a margin ranging from 0.0% to 1.0% depending on a lease adjusted leverage ratio. The facility requires that we pay a commitment fee on the unused balance ranging from 0.25% to 0.5%, based on the lease adjusted leverage ratio. Availability of borrowings under the facility requires that we be in compliance with specified covenants including a maximum lease adjusted leverage ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. The facility expires in February 2014, but can be terminated or decreased at our option prior to expiration. We intend to use the credit facility, if at all, for letters of credit we issue in the normal course of business and normal short term working capital needs. While operations continue to provide cash, our primary use of cash is in new restaurant development. As we expand into more urban areas, our average costs to open new restaurants will increase due to more significant reconstruction work that often needs to be done on those sites. Our total capital expenditures for 2008 were $152.1 million, and we expect to incur capital expenditures of about $140 million in 2009, of which $120 million relates to our construction of new restaurants and the remainder primarily relates to restaurant reinvestments. In 2008, we spent on average about $916,000 in development and construction costs per restaurant, with end caps costing about $774,000, in lines costing about $965,000, free standing costing about $1.2 million and urban costing about $1.6 million (in each case, reduced for landlord reimbursements). The average development and construction costs per restaurant increased from $880,000 in 2007 due to opening a larger portion of our restaurants in urban locations being partially offset by a decline in the percentage of free standing restaurant openings and decreasing our average restaurant size. In 2009, we expect average development and construction costs to remain about the same overall as 2008. 32 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations Our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2008 were as follows: Payments Due by Period Total 1 year 2 3 years 4 5 years After5 years (in thousands) Operating leases $ 1,523,183 $ 88,119 $ 176,929 $ 178,998 $ 1,079,137 Deemed landlord financing 7,029 366 764 788 5,111 Other contractual obligations(1) 22,108 21,578 530 Total contractual cash obligations $ 1,552,320 $ 110,063 $ 178,223 $ 179,786 $ 1,084,248 (1) We enter into various purchase obligations in the ordinary course of business. Those that are binding primarily relate to amounts owed under contractor and subcontractor agreements, orders submitted for equipment for restaurants under construction, and corporate sponsorships. Were obligated under non cancelable leases for our restaurants and administrative offices. Our leases generally have initial terms of either five to ten years with two or more five year extensions, for end cap and in line restaurants, or 15 to 20 years with several five year extensions, for free standing restaurants. Our leases generally require us to pay a proportionate share of real estate taxes, insurance, common charges and other operating costs. Some restaurant leases provide for contingent rental payments based on sales thresholds, although we generally do not expect to pay significant contingent rent on these properties based on the thresholds in those leases. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, we had no off balance sheet arrangements or obligations. Inflation The primary areas of our operations affected by inflation are food, labor, fuel, insurance, utility costs and materials used in the construction of our restaurants. Although almost all of our crew members make more than the minimum wage, increases in the applicable federal or state minimum wage will have an impact on our labor costs. Additionally, many of our leases require us to pay taxes, maintenance, utilities and insurance, all of which are generally subject to inflationary increases. Critical Accounting Estimates We describe our significant accounting policies in Note 1 of our consolidated financial statements. Critical accounting estimates are those that we believe are both significant and that require us to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often because we need to estimate the effect of inherently uncertain matters. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experiences and various other factors that we believe to be appropriate under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates, and we might obtain different estimates if we used different assumptions or factors. We believe the following critical accounting estimates affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements: Leases We lease most of our restaurant locations. Our leases contain escalating rentals over the lease term as well as optional renewal periods. We account for our leases under FASB Statement No. 13, Accounting for Leases (FAS 13) which requires rent to be recognized on a straight line basis over the lease term including reasonably assured renewal periods. We have estimated that our lease term, including reasonably assured renewal periods, is the lesser of the lease term or 20 years. If the estimate of our reasonably assured lease terms were changed our depreciation and rent expense could differ materially. 33 Table of Contents Stock based Compensation We recognize compensation expense for equity awards over the vesting period based on the awards fair value. We use the Black Scholes valuation model to determine the fair value of our stock options and stock appreciation rights, which requires assumptions to be made regarding our stock price volatility, the expected life of the award and expected dividend rates. The volatility assumptions were derived primarily from historical volatilities of competitors whose shares are traded in the public markets and are adjusted to reflect anticipated behavior specific to us and our volatility while a public company. Had we arrived at different assumptions of stock price volatility or expected lives of our options and stock appreciation rights, our stock based compensation expense and result of operations could have been different. Insurance Liability We maintain various insurance policies for employee health, workers compensation, general liability and property damage. Pursuant to these policies we are either responsible for losses up to certain limits or are self insured but have third party insurance coverage to limit exposure to these claims. We record a liability that represents our estimated cost of claims incurred and unpaid as of the balance sheet date. Our estimated liability is not discounted and is based on a number of assumptions and factors, including historical trends, actuarial assumptions and economic conditions, and is closely monitored and adjusted when warranted by changing circumstances. In addition, our history of claims experience is short and our significant growth rate could affect the accuracy of estimates based on historical experience. Should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what was estimated or medical costs increase beyond what was expected, our accrued liabilities might not be sufficient and additional expenses may be recorded. Actual claims experience could also be more favorable than estimated resulting in expense reductions. Unanticipated changes may produce materially different amounts of expense than that reported under these programs. Reserves/Contingencies for Litigation and Other Matters We are involved in various claims and legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of business. These actions are subject to many uncertainties, and we cannot predict the outcomes with any degree of certainty. Consequently, we were unable to ascertain the ultimate aggregate amount of monetary liability or financial impact with respect to these matters as of December 31, 2008 and 2007. Once resolved, however, these actions may affect our operating results and cash flows. Sabbatical Liability We offer our employees a sabbatical leave after each ten years of service they complete. We record a liability for our estimate of the accumulated sabbatical expense as of the balance sheet date. Our estimated liability is based on a number of factors including actuarial assumptions and historical trends. Changes in assumptions and trends could result in a materially different liability and expense. Unredeemed Gift Card Balances The Company sells gift cards which do not have an expiration date and it does not deduct non usage fees from outstanding gift card balances. The Company recognizes revenue from gift cards when: (i) the gift card is redeemed by the customer; or (ii) the likelihood of the gift card being redeemed by the customer is remote (gift card breakage) and the Company determines that there is not a legal obligation to remit the unredeemed gift cards to the relevant jurisdiction. The determination of the gift card breakage rate is based upon company specific historical redemption patterns. Gift card breakage will be recognized in revenue as the gift cards are used. Gift card breakage is included in total revenue in the consolidated statement of income. Any future revisions to the estimated breakage rate may result in changes in the amount of breakage revenue recognized in future periods. 34 Table of Contents Adoption of New Accounting Standards Effective January 1, 2008, we adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, (FAS 157). FAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities, and expands disclosure about fair value measurements. FAS 157 applies whenever other statements require or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value. The adoption of FAS 157 did not have an impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK Changing Interest Rates Were exposed to interest rate risk through the investment of our cash, cash equivalents, and available for sale securities. Changes in interest rates affect the interest income we earn, and therefore impact our cash flows and results of operations. Our interest income decreased during 2008 due to a significant reduction in interest rates. As of December 31, 2008, we had $188.2 million deposited in short term investments and available for sale securities bearing a weighted average interest rate of 0.3% (approximately 0.4% tax equivalent). Commodity Price Risks We are also exposed to commodity price risks. Many of the ingredients we use to prepare our food, as well as our packaging materials, are commodities or ingredients that are affected by the price of other commodities, exchange rates, foreign demand, weather, seasonality, production, availability and other factors outside our control. We work closely with our suppliers and use a mix of forward pricing protocols under which we agree with our supplier on fixed prices for deliveries at some time in the future, fixed pricing protocols under which we agree on a fixed price with our supplier for the duration of that protocol, and formula pricing protocols under which the prices we pay are based on a specified formula related to the prices of the goods, such as spot prices. Substantial portions of the dollar value of goods purchased by us are effectively at spot prices. Though we generally do not have long term supply contracts or guaranteed purchase amounts, our pricing protocols with suppliers can remain in effect for periods ranging from one month to a year, depending on the outlook for prices of the particular ingredient. Weve tried to increase, where necessary, the number of suppliers for our ingredients, which we believe can help mitigate pricing volatility, and we follow industry news, trade issues, exchange rates, foreign demand, weather, crises and other world events that may affect supply prices. Increases in ingredient prices have, and could continue to, adversely affect our results if we choose not to increase menu prices at the same pace for competitive or other reasons. Counterparty Risks Some of our suppliers and other vendors have been adversely impacted by tightening of the credit markets, fluctuations in commodity prices and other consequences of the economic downturn. Some vendors have sought to change the terms on which they do business with us in order to lessen the impact of the economic downturn on their business. If we are forced to find alternative vendors for key services, whether due to demands from the vendor or the vendors bankruptcy or ceasing operations, that could be a distraction to us and adversely impact our business. Changing vendors could also result in our inability to obtain business terms as favorable to us as the terms on which we currently operate. 35 Table of Contents
