MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS You should read the following discussion together with Item 6. Selected Consolidated Financial Data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. The discussion contains forward looking statements involving risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause our results to differ materially from expectations. Factors that might cause such differences include those described in Item 1A. Risk Factors and elsewhere in this report. Overview Chipotle operates fresh Mexican food restaurants serving burritos, tacos, burrito bowls (a burrito without the tortilla) and salads. We began with a simple philosophy: demonstrate that food served fast doesnt have to be a traditional fast food experience. Over the years, that vision has evolved. Today, our vision is to change the way the world thinks about and eats fast food. We do this by avoiding a formulaic approach when creating our restaurant experience, looking to fine dining restaurants for inspiration. We use high quality raw ingredients, classic cooking methods and a distinctive interior design, and have friendly people to take care of each customer features that are more frequently found in the world of fine dining. Our approach is also guided by our belief in an idea we call Food With Integrity. Our objective is to find the highest quality ingredients we can ingredients that are grown or raised with respect for the environment, animals and people who grow or raise the food. 2009 Highlights and Trends Restaurant Development. As of December 31, 2009, we operated 956 restaurants in 35 states throughout the United States, the District of Columbia, and Ontario, Canada. New restaurants have contributed substantially to our restaurant sales growth. We opened 121 restaurants in 2009. We expect to open between 120 and 130 restaurants in 2010, including one in London. Up to 25% of these openings will be what we are calling A Model restaurants. These restaurants will be located in well established markets with high levels of brand awareness. A Model locations will be built primarily in secondary trade areas which have attractive demographics but are typically characterized by lower occupancy costs. We expect that A Model locations will be constructed for substantially lower investment costs and have lower operating expenses than our recent traditional restaurant openings. While the economic environment has put pressure on the commercial real estate market and developers, reducing the number of new real estate developments available to us, which have historically accounted for a majority of our new restaurants, we expect that A Model locations will allow us to pursue additional opportunities and continue to open 120 130 restaurants next year. Sales Growth. Our comparable restaurant sales increases were 2.2% in 2009 and were driven primarily by menu price increases, partially offset by a decrease in customer visits and our average check not increasing by the full amount of the menu price increases. We believe the decrease in customer visits and impact on our average check resulted primarily from the adverse macroeconomic environment as well as some customer reaction to our menu price increases late last year. We generally increase our prices to be at or slightly below direct competitor pricing for comparable items. Comparable restaurant sales represent the change in period over period sales for restaurants beginning in their 13th full month of operation. We expect our comparable restaurant sales in 2010 to be flat. As a result of this and normal inflationary pressures, we anticipate our restaurant operating costs as a percentage of revenue to increase in 2010. Average restaurant sales were $1.728 million as of December 31, 2009, down from $1.763 million as of December 31, 2008. We define average restaurant sales as the average trailing 12 month sales for company operated restaurants in operation for at least 12 full calendar months. 25 Table of Contents Food With Integrity. In addition to continuing to serve naturally raised pork in all our restaurants, we now serve naturally raised chicken in all of our restaurants and naturally raised beef in about 60%. We define naturally raised as coming from animals that are fed a pure vegetarian diet, never given antibiotics or hormones, and raised humanely in open pastures or deeply bedded pens which is more stringent than the USDAs recently adopted standard for naturally raised marketing claims. The current economic conditions have led to natural chicken supply shortages. As a result, we have on occasion temporarily suspended serving naturally raised chicken in certain limited restaurants for short periods of time. We expect additional shortages during the first half of 2010 due to a supplier suspending production of naturally raised chickens. In 2009, 35% of all beans we bought were organically grown and we have increased the percentage to 40% for 2010. Also during 2009, we exceeded our goal to purchase at least 35% of at least one produce item while in season for each of our markets from small and midsize local farmers. We expect to increase the amount of locally grown produce purchased during 2010. At the end of 2009, 30% of the milk used in our cheese came from cows raised in pastures and we expect to increase that percentage during 2010. Marketing. While our marketing approach has often been considered edgy and innovative, we recognize the need for our marketing to evolve, much as we have evolved our food culture and our unique people culture. In January 2009 we hired our first Chief Marketing Officer and we continue to review our marketing strategy and messaging approach to make it more effective. One component of that effort is to develop our advertising so that it more effectively communicates how Chipotle is different than other restaurant concepts, and so that it resonates more with our customers. In addition, we began testing an expanded menu in the Denver market that is designed to broaden the appeal of our restaurants to families and to customers who are unfamiliar with Chipotle or are seeking lower priced eating options but still value high quality ingredients and great taste. Based on the results thus far, weve expanded the kids meal portion of the expanded menu to a total of 7 markets and expect the kids menu to be rolled out nationwide in 2010. Stock Repurchases. In September 2008, our Board of Directors approved the expenditure of up to $100 million to repurchase shares of our class B common stock, and we repurchased shares in each month thereafter through August 2009, when the authorized repurchases were completed. In November 2009, we announced that our Board of Directors approved the expenditure of up to an additional $100 million to repurchase shares of our common stock. We have entered into an agreement with a broker under SEC rule 10b5 1, authorizing the broker to make open market purchases of common stock from time to time, subject to market conditions. The repurchase agreement and the Boards authorization of the repurchase program may be modified, suspended, or discontinued at any time. We repurchased stock with an aggregate total repurchase price of $84.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2009. Cash and Securities. As of December 31, 2009, we had cash and securities of $269.6 million. Given the recent financial turmoil, we have focused on capital preservation and our cash equivalent holdings consist of highly rated money market funds or FDIC insured accounts. Stock Conversion. In December 2009, our shareholders approved a proposal to convert all of the outstanding shares of our class B common stock to shares of class A common stock on a one for one basis, and to rename the class A common stock as common stock. The conversion was completed on December 21, 2009. 26 Table of Contents Restaurant Openings, Relocations and Closures The following table details restaurant unit data for the years indicated. All restaurants were company owned at the end of 2007. For the years endedDecember 31, 2009 2008 2007 Beginning of year 837 704 573 Openings 121 136 125 Closures and Relocations (2 ) (3 ) (2 ) Franchise acquisitions 8 Total restaurants at end of year 956 837 704 Results of Operations Our results of operations as a percentage of revenue and period over period variances are discussed in the following section. As our business grows, as we open more restaurants and hire more employees, our restaurant operating costs increase. Restaurant Sales For the years ended December 31, %increase(decrease)2009 over2008 %increase2008 over2007 2009 2008 2007 (dollars in millions) Restaurant sales $ 1,518.4 $ 1,332.0 $ 1,085.0 14.0 % 22.8 % Average restaurant sales $ 1.728 $ 1.763 $ 1.734 (2.0 )% 1.7 % Comparable restaurant sales increase 2.2 % 5.8 % 10.8 % Number of company operated restaurants as of the end of the year 956 837 704 14.2 % 18.9 % Number of company operated restaurants opened in the year, net of closures and relocations 119 133 123 The significant factors contributing to our increases in sales were new restaurant openings and comparable restaurant sales increases. Restaurant sales from restaurants not yet in the comparable base contributed to $161.7 million of the increase in sales in 2009, of which $73.6 million was attributable to restaurants opened during the year. In 2008, restaurant sales from restaurants not yet in the comparable restaurant base contributed to $182.3 million of the increase in sales, of which $93.3 million was attributable to restaurants opened in 2008. Comparable restaurant sales increases contributed to $26.3 million and $62.6 million of the increase in restaurant sales in 2009 and 2008, respectively, primarily driven by the impact of menu price increases initiated beginning in late 2008. In 2009 the impact of the menu price increases was partially offset by a decrease in customer visits and the average check not increasing by the full amount of the menu price increases. Food, Beverage and Packaging Costs For the years endedDecember 31, %increase2009 over2008 %increase2008 over2007 2009 2008 2007 (dollars in millions) Food, beverage and packaging $ 466.0 $ 431.9 $ 346.4 7.9 % 24.7 % As a percentage of revenue 30.7 % 32.4 % 31.9 % 27 Table of Contents Food, beverage and packaging costs decreased as a percentage of revenue in 2009 due primarily to the impact of menu price increases. In 2008, food costs increased as a percentage of revenue due to increased product cost, primarily cheese, chicken and avocados, partially offset by menu price increases in selected markets. We saw significantly higher costs for many of our raw ingredients in 2008. Labor Costs For the years endedDecember 31, %increase2009 over2008 %increase2008 over2007 2009 2008 2007 (dollars in millions) Labor costs $ 385.1 $ 351.0 $ 289.4 9.7 % 21.3 % As a percentage of revenue 25.4 % 26.4 % 26.7 % Labor costs decreased as a percentage of revenue in 2009 primarily due to the impact of menu price increases and labor efficiencies partially offset by increased average wage rates and lower transaction volumes. In 2008, labor costs as a percentage of revenue decreased due to the impact of menu price increases in selected markets partially offset by increased average wage rates and labor inefficiencies associated with new restaurant openings. Occupancy Costs For the years endedDecember 31, %increase2009 over2008 %increase2008 over2007 2009 2008 2007 (dollars in millions) Occupancy costs $ 114.2 $ 98.1 $ 75.9 16.5 % 29.2 % As a percentage of revenue 7.5 % 7.4 % 7.0 % Occupancy costs increased as a percentage of revenue in 2009 primarily due to higher average rents for new locations as we continue to open proportionately more restaurants in more expensive areas than we have historically. In 2008, occupancy costs increased as a percentage of revenue primarily due to higher average rents for new locations as we opened proportionately more restaurants in expensive areas in 2008 than we have historically and a one time $2.6 million non cash correction of our historical straight line rent expense. The increase was partially offset by higher average restaurant sales on a partially fixed cost base. Other Operating Costs For the years endedDecember 31, %increase2009 over2008 %increase2008 over2007 2009 2008 2007 (dollars in millions) Other operating costs $ 174.6 $ 164.0 $ 131.5 6.4 % 24.7 % As a percentage of revenue 11.5 % 12.3 % 12.1 % Other operating costs as a percentage of revenue decreased in 2009 primarily due to the impact of menu price increases and decreased marketing and promotional expenditures. We expect an increase as a percentage of revenue in marketing and promotional spend in 2010. In 2008 other operating costs increased as a percentage of revenue primarily due to increased utilities, repair and maintenance costs, and credit card processing fees resulting from a higher percentage of our customers using credit cards. The increase was partially offset by lower marketing and promotional expenditures. 28 Table of Contents General and Administrative Expenses For the years endedDecember 31, %increase2009 over2008 %increase2008 over2007 2009 2008 2007 (dollars in millions) General and administrative expense $ 99.1 $ 89.2 $ 75.0 11.2 % 18.8 % As a percentage of revenue 6.5 % 6.7 % 6.9 % The increase in general and administrative expenses in 2009 primarily resulted from an increase in performance related bonus accruals, an increase in stock based compensation expense resulting from the stock based compensation awards granted in 2009, wage inflation and hiring more employees as we grew. This increase was partially offset by careful management of expenses, primarily travel costs. As a percentage of revenue, general and administrative expenses decreased in 2009 due primarily to the impact of menu price increases and lower travel costs, partially offset by increased performance related bonus accruals and stock based compensation. The increase in general and administrative expenses in 2008 primarily resulted from hiring more employees as we grew, an increase in stock based compensation expense resulting from the stock based compensation awards granted in 2008, and the cost of an all manager conference held in the third quarter. This increase was partially offset by lower performance related bonus accruals. As a percentage of revenue, general and administrative expenses decreased in 2008 due primarily to menu price increases and lower performance related bonus accruals. We expect general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue to largely remain consistent in 2010, which takes into consideration that we will have materially higher stock compensation expense than 2009 and approximately $3 million in costs associated with an all manager conference to be held during 2010. Depreciation and Amortization For the years endedDecember 31, %increase2009 over2008 %increase2008 over2007 2009 2008 2007 (dollars in millions) Depreciation and amortization $ 61.3 $ 52.8 $ 43.6 16.2 % 21.0 % As a percentage of revenue 4.0 % 4.0 % 4.0 % Depreciation and amortization increased in 2009 and 2008 primarily due to the increase in the number of restaurants from January 1, 2007 to December 31, 2009. As a percentage of total revenue, depreciation and amortization remained constant. Pre opening Costs For the years endedDecember 31, %decrease2009 over2008 %increase2008 over2007 2009 2008 2007 (dollars in millions) Pre opening costs $ 8.4 $ 11.6 $ 9.6 (27.7 )% 21.3 % As a percentage of revenue 0.6 % 0.9 % 0.9 % Restaurant openings 121 136 125 Pre opening costs decreased in 2009 as a result of a decrease in the number of restaurants opened and under construction in 2009, partially offset by an increase in rent expense recognized during the construction period due to higher rents for more expensive locations. 29 Table of Contents Pre opening costs increased in 2008 primarily due to an increase in rent expense recognized during the construction period and an increase in the number of restaurants opened. Pre opening costs include non cash straight line rent expense of $4.4 million, $5.9 million and $4.6 million for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Loss on Disposal of Assets For the years endedDecember 31, %decrease2009 over2008 %increase2008 over2007 2009 2008 2007 (dollars in millions) Loss on disposal of assets $ 6.0 $ 9.3 $ 6.2 (36.2 )% 51.4 % As a percentage of revenue 0.4 % 0.7 % 0.6 % Loss on disposal of assets decreased in 2009 as a result of decreases in the number of remodels and in write offs associated with investigating potential restaurant sites that we considered but subsequently rejected, and also as a result of our not recording any restaurant impairment charges. The increase in 2008 in loss on disposal of assets was due to an increase in both the age and number of restaurants and updating older restaurants in certain markets, an increase in write offs associated with investigating potential restaurant sites that we considered but subsequently rejected, and an impairment charge related to a restaurant closure. Interest and Other Income For the years endedDecember 31, %decrease2009 over2008 %decrease2008 over2007 2009 2008 2007 (dollars in millions) Interest and other income $ 0.9 $ 3.5 $ 6.1 (73.3 )% (43.3 )% As a percentage of revenue 0.1 % 0.3 % 0.6 % Interest and other income decreased in 2009 and 2008 primarily due to lower yields on our investments. These decreases are partially offset by a higher average cash balance and fewer tax exempt securities which have lower interest rates but are exempt from federal income taxes. Income Tax Provision For the years endedDecember 31, %increase2009 over2008 %increase2008 over2007 2009 2008 2007 (dollars in millions) Income tax provision $ 77.4 $ 49.0 $ 43.4 57.9 % 12.8 % Effective tax rate 37.9 % 38.5 % 38.1 % The 2009 effective tax rate decreased primarily due to a one time benefit for prior period meals and entertainment deductions and 2008 federal tax return adjustments, a decrease in our estimated statutory state tax rate and an increase in deductions for food donations, partially offset by a reduction in earnings on tax exempt investments. The 2008 effective tax rate increased primarily due to a reduction in earnings on tax exempt investments partially offset by a decrease in our estimated statutory state tax rate. 30 Table of Contents Quarterly Financial Data/Seasonality The following table presents consolidated statement of income data for each of the eight quarters in the period ended December 31, 2009. The operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results for any subsequent quarter. 2009 Quarters Ended Mar. 31 June 30 Sept. 30 Dec. 31 (dollars in millions) Revenue $ 354.5 $ 388.8 $ 387.6 $ 387.5 Operating income $ 41.2 $ 57.3 $ 54.8 $ 50.4 Net income $ 25.4 $ 35.4 $ 34.5 $ 31.6 Number of restaurants opened in quarter 26 24 26 45 Comparable restaurant sales increase 2.2 % 1.7 % 2.7 % 2.0 % 2008 Quarters Ended Mar. 31 June 30 Sept. 30 Dec. 31 (dollars in millions) Revenue $ 305.3 $ 340.8 $ 340.5 $ 345.3 Operating income $ 26.8 $ 38.3 $ 31.1 $ 27.8 Net income $ 17.3 $ 24.5 $ 19.5 $ 16.9 Number of restaurants opened in quarter 28 49 20 39 Comparable restaurant sales increase 10.2 % 7.1 % 3.1 % 3.5 % Seasonal factors cause our profitability to fluctuate from quarter to quarter. Historically, our average daily restaurant sales and net income are lower in the first and fourth quarters due, in part, to the holiday season and because fewer people eat out during periods of inclement weather (the winter months) than during periods of mild or warm weather (the spring, summer and fall months). Other factors also have a seasonal effect on our results. For example, restaurants located near colleges and universities generally do more business during the academic year. The number of trading days in a quarter can also affect our results. Overall, on an annual basis, changes in trading dates do not have a significant impact on our results. Our quarterly results are also affected by other factors such as the number of new restaurants opened in a quarter and unanticipated events. New restaurants typically have lower margins following opening as a result of the expenses associated with opening new restaurants and their operating inefficiencies in the months immediately following opening. In addition, unanticipated events also impact our results. Accordingly, results for a particular quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary liquidity and capital requirements are for new restaurant construction, working capital and general corporate needs. We have a cash and short term investment balance of $269.6 million that we expect to utilize, along with cash flow from operations, to provide capital to support the growth of our business (primarily through opening restaurants), to repurchase up to an additional $85.9 million of our common stock subject to market conditions, to continue to maintain our existing restaurants and for general corporate purposes. We believe that cash from operations, together with our cash balance, will be enough to meet ongoing capital expenditures, working capital requirements and other cash needs over at least the next 24 months. We havent required significant working capital because customers generally pay using cash or credit and debit cards and because our operations do not require significant receivables, nor do they require significant inventories due, in part, to our use of various fresh ingredients. In addition, we generally have the right to pay for the purchase of food, beverage and supplies some time after the receipt of those items, generally within ten days, thereby reducing the need for incremental working capital to support our growth. 31 Table of Contents In February 2009, we entered into an unsecured revolving credit facility with Bank of America, N.A. with an initial principal amount of $25 million and an additional $25 million accordion feature. Borrowings under the credit facility will bear interest at a rate set, at our option, at either (i) an adjusted LIBOR rate plus a margin ranging from 0.75% to 2.0% depending on a lease adjusted leverage ratio, or (ii) a daily rate equal to (a) the highest of the federal funds rate plus 0.5%, the banks published prime rate, and one month LIBOR plus 1.0%, plus (b) a margin ranging from 0.0% to 1.0% depending on a lease adjusted leverage ratio. The facility includes a commitment fee on the unused balance ranging from 0.25% to 0.5%, based on the lease adjusted leverage ratio. Availability of borrowings under the facility is conditioned on our compliance with specified covenants including a maximum lease adjusted leverage ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. We were in compliance with these covenants as of December 31, 2009. The facility expires in February 2014, but can be terminated or decreased at our option prior to expiration. We intend to use the credit facility for letters of credit issued in the normal course of business and normal short term working capital needs. As of December 31, 2009 there were no loans outstanding and available borrowings were $19.7 million. While operations continue to provide cash, our primary use of cash is in new restaurant development. Our total capital expenditures for 2009 were $117.2 million, and we expect to incur capital expenditures of about $115 million in 2010, of which $100 million relates to our construction of new restaurants and the remainder primarily relates to restaurant reinvestments. In 2009, we spent on average about $850,000 in development and construction costs per restaurant, net of landlord reimbursements. The average development and construction costs per restaurant decreased from $916,000 in 2008 due to cost savings realized, in part, from certain cost reduction efforts associated with the development of the A Model strategy. In 2010, we expect average development and construction costs to be approximately $800,000 as we begin to open A Model restaurants. Contractual Obligations Our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2009 were as follows: Payments Due by Period Total 1 year 2 3 years 4 5 years After5 years (in thousands) Operating leases $ 1,738,244 $ 101,876 $ 204,675 $ 208,843 $ 1,222,850 Deemed landlord financing 6,663 373 785 788 4,717 Other contractual obligations(1) 29,468 25,511 2,064 1,262 631 Total contractual cash obligations $ 1,774,375 $ 127,760 $ 207,524 $ 210,893 $ 1,228,198 (1) We enter into various purchase obligations in the ordinary course of business. Those that are binding primarily relate to amounts owed under contractor and subcontractor agreements, orders submitted for equipment for restaurants under construction, and corporate sponsorships. Were obligated under non cancelable leases for our restaurants and administrative offices. Our leases generally have initial terms of either five to ten years with two or more five year extensions, for end cap and in line restaurants, or 15 to 20 years with several five year extensions, for free standing restaurants. Our leases generally require us to pay a proportionate share of real estate taxes, insurance, common charges and other operating costs. Some restaurant leases provide for contingent rental payments based on sales thresholds, although we generally do not expect to pay significant contingent rent on these properties based on the thresholds in those leases. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, we had no off balance sheet arrangements or obligations. 32 Table of Contents Inflation The primary areas of our operations affected by inflation are food, labor, fuel, utility costs, materials used in the construction of our restaurants, and insurance. Although almost all of our crew members make more than the minimum wage, increases in the applicable federal or state minimum wage may have an impact on our labor costs. Additionally, many of our leases require us to pay taxes, maintenance, utilities and insurance, all of which are generally subject to inflationary increases. Critical Accounting Estimates We describe our significant accounting policies in Note 1 of our consolidated financial statements. Critical accounting estimates are those that we believe are both significant and that require us to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often because we need to estimate the effect of inherently uncertain matters. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experiences and various other factors that we believe to be appropriate under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates, and we might obtain different estimates if we used different assumptions or factors. We believe the following critical accounting estimates affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements: Leases We lease most of our restaurant locations. Our leases contain escalating rentals over the lease term as well as optional renewal periods. We account for our leases by recognizing rent expense on a straight line basis over the lease term including reasonably assured renewal periods. We have estimated that our lease term, including reasonably assured renewal periods, is the lesser of the lease term or 20 years. If the estimate of our reasonably assured lease terms were changed our depreciation and rent expense could differ materially. Stock based Compensation We recognize compensation expense for equity awards over the vesting period based on the awards fair value. We use the Black Scholes valuation model to determine the fair value of our stock options and stock appreciation rights, which requires assumptions to be made regarding our stock price volatility, the expected life of the award and expected dividend rates. The volatility assumptions were derived from our actual and implied volatilities and historical volatilities of competitors whose shares are traded in the public markets and are adjusted to reflect anticipated behavior specific to us. Had we arrived at different assumptions of stock price volatility or expected lives of our options and stock appreciation rights, our stock based compensation expense and result of operations could have been different. Insurance Liability We maintain various insurance policies for employee health, workers compensation, general liability and property damage. Pursuant to these policies we are either responsible for losses up to certain limits or are self insured but have third party insurance coverage to limit exposure to these claims. We record a liability that represents our estimated cost of claims incurred and unpaid as of the balance sheet date. Our estimated liability is not discounted and is based on a number of assumptions and factors, including historical trends, actuarial assumptions and economic conditions, and is closely monitored and adjusted when warranted by changing circumstances. In addition, our history of claims experience is short and our significant growth rate could affect the accuracy of estimates based on historical experience. Should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what was estimated or medical costs increase beyond what was expected, our accrued liabilities might not be sufficient and additional expenses may be recorded. Actual claims experience could also be more favorable than estimated, which would result in expense reductions. Unanticipated changes may produce materially different amounts of expense than that reported under these programs. 33 Table of Contents Reserves/Contingencies for Litigation and Other Matters We are involved in various claims and legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of business. These actions are subject to many uncertainties, and we cannot predict the outcomes with any degree of certainty. Consequently, we were unable to ascertain the ultimate aggregate amount of monetary liability or financial impact with respect to these matters as of December 31, 2009 and 2008. Once resolved, however, these actions may affect our operating results and cash flows. Sabbatical Liability We offer our employees a sabbatical leave after each ten years of service they complete. We record a liability for our estimate of the accumulated sabbatical expense as of the balance sheet date. Our estimated liability is based on a number of factors including actuarial assumptions and historical trends. Changes in assumptions and trends could result in a materially different liability and expense. Unredeemed Gift Card Balances We sell gift cards which do not have an expiration date and from which we do not deduct non usage fees. We recognize revenue from gift cards when: (i) the gift card is redeemed by the customer; or (ii) the likelihood of the gift card being redeemed by the customer is remote (gift card breakage) and we determine that there is not a legal obligation to remit the unredeemed gift cards to the relevant jurisdiction. The determination of the gift card breakage rate is based upon company specific historical redemption patterns. Gift card breakage is recognized in revenue as the gift cards are used on a pro rata basis over a period of six months beginning at the date of the gift card sale. We have determined 5% of gift card sales will not be redeemed and will be retained by us. Any future revisions to the estimated breakage rate may result in changes in the amount of breakage revenue recognized in future periods. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK Changing Interest Rates Were exposed to interest rate risk through the investment of our cash, cash equivalents, and available for sale securities. Changes in interest rates affect the interest income we earn, and therefore impact our cash flows and results of operations. As of December 31, 2009, we had $236.3 million deposited in short term investments and available for sale securities, and $30.8 million in FDIC insured accounts with an earnings credit we classify as interest income, which combined earned a weighted average interest rate of 0.38% (approximately 0.40% tax equivalent). Commodity Price Risks We are also exposed to commodity price risks. Many of the ingredients we use to prepare our food, as well as our packaging materials, are commodities or ingredients that are affected by the price of other commodities, exchange rates, foreign demand, weather, seasonality, production, availability and other factors outside our control. We work closely with our suppliers and use a mix of forward pricing protocols under which we agree with our supplier on fixed prices for deliveries at some time in the future, fixed pricing protocols under which we agree on a fixed price with our supplier for the duration of that protocol, and formula pricing protocols under which the prices we pay are based on a specified formula related to the prices of the goods, such as spot prices. However, a portion of the dollar value of goods purchased by us is effectively at spot prices. Generally our pricing protocols with suppliers can remain in effect for periods ranging from one to 18 months, depending on the outlook for prices of the particular ingredient. In several cases, we have minimum purchase obligations. Weve tried to increase, where necessary, the number of suppliers for our ingredients, which we believe can help mitigate pricing volatility, and we follow industry news, trade issues, exchange rates, foreign demand, weather, crises and other world events that may affect our ingredient prices. Increases in ingredient prices could adversely affect our results if we choose not to increase menu prices at the same pace for competitive or other reasons. 34 Table of Contents 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS You should read the following discussion together with Item 6. Selected Consolidated Financial Data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. The discussion contains forward looking statements involving risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause our results to differ materially from expectations. Factors that might cause such differences include those described in Item 1A. Risk Factors and elsewhere in this report. Overview Chipotle operates fresh Mexican food restaurants serving burritos, tacos, burrito bowls (a burrito without the tortilla) and salads. We began with a simple philosophy: demonstrate that food served fast doesnt have to be a traditional fast food experience. Over the years, that vision has evolved. Today, our vision is to change the way the world thinks about and eats fast food. We do this by avoiding a formulaic approach when creating our restaurant experience, looking to fine dining restaurants for inspiration. We use high quality raw ingredients, classic cooking methods and a distinctive interior design, and have friendly people to take care of each customer features that are more frequently found in the world of fine dining. Our approach is also guided by our belief in an idea we call Food With Integrity. Our objective is to find the highest quality ingredients we can ingredients that are grown or raised with respect for the environment, animals and people who grow or raise the food. 2009 Highlights and Trends Restaurant Development. As of December 31, 2009, we operated 956 restaurants in 35 states throughout the United States, the District of Columbia, and Ontario, Canada. New restaurants have contributed substantially to our restaurant sales growth. We opened 121 restaurants in 2009. We expect to open between 120 and 130 restaurants in 2010, including one in London. Up to 25% of these openings will be what we are calling A Model restaurants. These restaurants will be located in well established markets with high levels of brand awareness. A Model locations will be built primarily in secondary trade areas which have attractive demographics but are typically characterized by lower occupancy costs. We expect that A Model locations will be constructed for substantially lower investment costs and have lower operating expenses than our recent traditional restaurant openings. While the economic environment has put pressure on the commercial real estate market and developers, reducing the number of new real estate developments available to us, which have historically accounted for a majority of our new restaurants, we expect that A Model locations will allow us to pursue additional opportunities and continue to open 120 130 restaurants next year. Sales Growth. Our comparable restaurant sales increases were 2.2% in 2009 and were driven primarily by menu price increases, partially offset by a decrease in customer visits and our average check not increasing by the full amount of the menu price increases. We believe the decrease in customer visits and impact on our average check resulted primarily from the adverse macroeconomic environment as well as some customer reaction to our menu price increases late last year. We generally increase our prices to be at or slightly below direct competitor pricing for comparable items. Comparable restaurant sales represent the change in period over period sales for restaurants beginning in their 13th full month of operation. We expect our comparable restaurant sales in 2010 to be flat. As a result of this and normal inflationary pressures, we anticipate our restaurant operating costs as a percentage of revenue to increase in 2010. Average restaurant sales were $1.728 million as of December 31, 2009, down from $1.763 million as of December 31, 2008. We define average restaurant sales as the average trailing 12 month sales for company operated restaurants in operation for at least 12 full calendar months. 25 Table of Contents Food With Integrity. In addition to continuing to serve naturally raised pork in all our restaurants, we now serve naturally raised chicken in all of our restaurants and naturally raised beef in about 60%. We define naturally raised as coming from animals that are fed a pure vegetarian diet, never given antibiotics or hormones, and raised humanely in open pastures or deeply bedded pens which is more stringent than the USDAs recently adopted standard for naturally raised marketing claims. The current economic conditions have led to natural chicken supply shortages. As a result, we have on occasion temporarily suspended serving naturally raised chicken in certain limited restaurants for short periods of time. We expect additional shortages during the first half of 2010 due to a supplier suspending production of naturally raised chickens. In 2009, 35% of all beans we bought were organically grown and we have increased the percentage to 40% for 2010. Also during 2009, we exceeded our goal to purchase at least 35% of at least one produce item while in season for each of our markets from small and midsize local farmers. We expect to increase the amount of locally grown produce purchased during 2010. At the end of 2009, 30% of the milk used in our cheese came from cows raised in pastures and we expect to increase that percentage during 2010. Marketing. While our marketing approach has often been considered edgy and innovative, we recognize the need for our marketing to evolve, much as we have evolved our food culture and our unique people culture. In January 2009 we hired our first Chief Marketing Officer and we continue to review our marketing strategy and messaging approach to make it more effective. One component of that effort is to develop our advertising so that it more effectively communicates how Chipotle is different than other restaurant concepts, and so that it resonates more with our customers. In addition, we began testing an expanded menu in the Denver market that is designed to broaden the appeal of our restaurants to families and to customers who are unfamiliar with Chipotle or are seeking lower priced eating options but still value high quality ingredients and great taste. Based on the results thus far, weve expanded the kids meal portion of the expanded menu to a total of 7 markets and expect the kids menu to be rolled out nationwide in 2010. Stock Repurchases. In September 2008, our Board of Directors approved the expenditure of up to $100 million to repurchase shares of our class B common stock, and we repurchased shares in each month thereafter through August 2009, when the authorized repurchases were completed. In November 2009, we announced that our Board of Directors approved the expenditure of up to an additional $100 million to repurchase shares of our common stock. We have entered into an agreement with a broker under SEC rule 10b5 1, authorizing the broker to make open market purchases of common stock from time to time, subject to market conditions. The repurchase agreement and the Boards authorization of the repurchase program may be modified, suspended, or discontinued at any time. We repurchased stock with an aggregate total repurchase price of $84.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2009. Cash and Securities. As of December 31, 2009, we had cash and securities of $269.6 million. Given the recent financial turmoil, we have focused on capital preservation and our cash equivalent holdings consist of highly rated money market funds or FDIC insured accounts. Stock Conversion. In December 2009, our shareholders approved a proposal to convert all of the outstanding shares of our class B common stock to shares of class A common stock on a one for one basis, and to rename the class A common stock as common stock. The conversion was completed on December 21, 2009. 26 Table of Contents Restaurant Openings, Relocations and Closures The following table details restaurant unit data for the years indicated. All restaurants were company owned at the end of 2007. For the years endedDecember 31, 2009 2008 2007 Beginning of year 837 704 573 Openings 121 136 125 Closures and Relocations (2 ) (3 ) (2 ) Franchise acquisitions 8 Total restaurants at end of year 956 837 704 Results of Operations Our results of operations as a percentage of revenue and period over period variances are discussed in the following section. As our business grows, as we open more restaurants and hire more employees, our restaurant operating costs increase. Restaurant Sales For the years ended December 31, %increase(decrease)2009 over2008 %increase2008 over2007 2009 2008 2007 (dollars in millions) Restaurant sales $ 1,518.4 $ 1,332.0 $ 1,085.0 14.0 % 22.8 % Average restaurant sales $ 1.728 $ 1.763 $ 1.734 (2.0 )% 1.7 % Comparable restaurant sales increase 2.2 % 5.8 % 10.8 % Number of company operated restaurants as of the end of the year 956 837 704 14.2 % 18.9 % Number of company operated restaurants opened in the year, net of closures and relocations 119 133 123 The significant factors contributing to our increases in sales were new restaurant openings and comparable restaurant sales increases. Restaurant sales from restaurants not yet in the comparable base contributed to $161.7 million of the increase in sales in 2009, of which $73.6 million was attributable to restaurants opened during the year. In 2008, restaurant sales from restaurants not yet in the comparable restaurant base contributed to $182.3 million of the increase in sales, of which $93.3 million was attributable to restaurants opened in 2008. Comparable restaurant sales increases contributed to $26.3 million and $62.6 million of the increase in restaurant sales in 2009 and 2008, respectively, primarily driven by the impact of menu price increases initiated beginning in late 2008. In 2009 the impact of the menu price increases was partially offset by a decrease in customer visits and the average check not increasing by the full amount of the menu price increases. Food, Beverage and Packaging Costs For the years endedDecember 31, %increase2009 over2008 %increase2008 over2007 2009 2008 2007 (dollars in millions) Food, beverage and packaging $ 466.0 $ 431.9 $ 346.4 7.9 % 24.7 % As a percentage of revenue 30.7 % 32.4 % 31.9 % 27 Table of Contents Food, beverage and packaging costs decreased as a percentage of revenue in 2009 due primarily to the impact of menu price increases. In 2008, food costs increased as a percentage of revenue due to increased product cost, primarily cheese, chicken and avocados, partially offset by menu price increases in selected markets. We saw significantly higher costs for many of our raw ingredients in 2008. Labor Costs For the years endedDecember 31, %increase2009 over2008 %increase2008 over2007 2009 2008 2007 (dollars in millions) Labor costs $ 385.1 $ 351.0 $ 289.4 9.7 % 21.3 % As a percentage of revenue 25.4 % 26.4 % 26.7 % Labor costs decreased as a percentage of revenue in 2009 primarily due to the impact of menu price increases and labor efficiencies partially offset by increased average wage rates and lower transaction volumes. In 2008, labor costs as a percentage of revenue decreased due to the impact of menu price increases in selected markets partially offset by increased average wage rates and labor inefficiencies associated with new restaurant openings. Occupancy Costs For the years endedDecember 31, %increase2009 over2008 %increase2008 over2007 2009 2008 2007 (dollars in millions) Occupancy costs $ 114.2 $ 98.1 $ 75.9 16.5 % 29.2 % As a percentage of revenue 7.5 % 7.4 % 7.0 % Occupancy costs increased as a percentage of revenue in 2009 primarily due to higher average rents for new locations as we continue to open proportionately more restaurants in more expensive areas than we have historically. In 2008, occupancy costs increased as a percentage of revenue primarily due to higher average rents for new locations as we opened proportionately more restaurants in expensive areas in 2008 than we have historically and a one time $2.6 million non cash correction of our historical straight line rent expense. The increase was partially offset by higher average restaurant sales on a partially fixed cost base. Other Operating Costs For the years endedDecember 31, %increase2009 over2008 %increase2008 over2007 2009 2008 2007 (dollars in millions) Other operating costs $ 174.6 $ 164.0 $ 131.5 6.4 % 24.7 % As a percentage of revenue 11.5 % 12.3 % 12.1 % Other operating costs as a percentage of revenue decreased in 2009 primarily due to the impact of menu price increases and decreased marketing and promotional expenditures. We expect an increase as a percentage of revenue in marketing and promotional spend in 2010. In 2008 other operating costs increased as a percentage of revenue primarily due to increased utilities, repair and maintenance costs, and credit card processing fees resulting from a higher percentage of our customers using credit cards. The increase was partially offset by lower marketing and promotional expenditures. 28 Table of Contents General and Administrative Expenses For the years endedDecember 31, %increase2009 over2008 %increase2008 over2007 2009 2008 2007 (dollars in millions) General and administrative expense $ 99.1 $ 89.2 $ 75.0 11.2 % 18.8 % As a percentage of revenue 6.5 % 6.7 % 6.9 % The increase in general and administrative expenses in 2009 primarily resulted from an increase in performance related bonus accruals, an increase in stock based compensation expense resulting from the stock based compensation awards granted in 2009, wage inflation and hiring more employees as we grew. This increase was partially offset by careful management of expenses, primarily travel costs. As a percentage of revenue, general and administrative expenses decreased in 2009 due primarily to the impact of menu price increases and lower travel costs, partially offset by increased performance related bonus accruals and stock based compensation. The increase in general and administrative expenses in 2008 primarily resulted from hiring more employees as we grew, an increase in stock based compensation expense resulting from the stock based compensation awards granted in 2008, and the cost of an all manager conference held in the third quarter. This increase was partially offset by lower performance related bonus accruals. As a percentage of revenue, general and administrative expenses decreased in 2008 due primarily to menu price increases and lower performance related bonus accruals. We expect general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue to largely remain consistent in 2010, which takes into consideration that we will have materially higher stock compensation expense than 2009 and approximately $3 million in costs associated with an all manager conference to be held during 2010. Depreciation and Amortization For the years endedDecember 31, %increase2009 over2008 %increase2008 over2007 2009 2008 2007 (dollars in millions) Depreciation and amortization $ 61.3 $ 52.8 $ 43.6 16.2 % 21.0 % As a percentage of revenue 4.0 % 4.0 % 4.0 % Depreciation and amortization increased in 2009 and 2008 primarily due to the increase in the number of restaurants from January 1, 2007 to December 31, 2009. As a percentage of total revenue, depreciation and amortization remained constant. Pre opening Costs For the years endedDecember 31, %decrease2009 over2008 %increase2008 over2007 2009 2008 2007 (dollars in millions) Pre opening costs $ 8.4 $ 11.6 $ 9.6 (27.7 )% 21.3 % As a percentage of revenue 0.6 % 0.9 % 0.9 % Restaurant openings 121 136 125 Pre opening costs decreased in 2009 as a result of a decrease in the number of restaurants opened and under construction in 2009, partially offset by an increase in rent expense recognized during the construction period due to higher rents for more expensive locations. 29 Table of Contents Pre opening costs increased in 2008 primarily due to an increase in rent expense recognized during the construction period and an increase in the number of restaurants opened. Pre opening costs include non cash straight line rent expense of $4.4 million, $5.9 million and $4.6 million for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Loss on Disposal of Assets For the years endedDecember 31, %decrease2009 over2008 %increase2008 over2007 2009 2008 2007 (dollars in millions) Loss on disposal of assets $ 6.0 $ 9.3 $ 6.2 (36.2 )% 51.4 % As a percentage of revenue 0.4 % 0.7 % 0.6 % Loss on disposal of assets decreased in 2009 as a result of decreases in the number of remodels and in write offs associated with investigating potential restaurant sites that we considered but subsequently rejected, and also as a result of our not recording any restaurant impairment charges. The increase in 2008 in loss on disposal of assets was due to an increase in both the age and number of restaurants and updating older restaurants in certain markets, an increase in write offs associated with investigating potential restaurant sites that we considered but subsequently rejected, and an impairment charge related to a restaurant closure. Interest and Other Income For the years endedDecember 31, %decrease2009 over2008 %decrease2008 over2007 2009 2008 2007 (dollars in millions) Interest and other income $ 0.9 $ 3.5 $ 6.1 (73.3 )% (43.3 )% As a percentage of revenue 0.1 % 0.3 % 0.6 % Interest and other income decreased in 2009 and 2008 primarily due to lower yields on our investments. These decreases are partially offset by a higher average cash balance and fewer tax exempt securities which have lower interest rates but are exempt from federal income taxes. Income Tax Provision For the years endedDecember 31, %increase2009 over2008 %increase2008 over2007 2009 2008 2007 (dollars in millions) Income tax provision $ 77.4 $ 49.0 $ 43.4 57.9 % 12.8 % Effective tax rate 37.9 % 38.5 % 38.1 % The 2009 effective tax rate decreased primarily due to a one time benefit for prior period meals and entertainment deductions and 2008 federal tax return adjustments, a decrease in our estimated statutory state tax rate and an increase in deductions for food donations, partially offset by a reduction in earnings on tax exempt investments. The 2008 effective tax rate increased primarily due to a reduction in earnings on tax exempt investments partially offset by a decrease in our estimated statutory state tax rate. 30 Table of Contents Quarterly Financial Data/Seasonality The following table presents consolidated statement of income data for each of the eight quarters in the period ended December 31, 2009. The operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results for any subsequent quarter. 2009 Quarters Ended Mar. 31 June 30 Sept. 30 Dec. 31 (dollars in millions) Revenue $ 354.5 $ 388.8 $ 387.6 $ 387.5 Operating income $ 41.2 $ 57.3 $ 54.8 $ 50.4 Net income $ 25.4 $ 35.4 $ 34.5 $ 31.6 Number of restaurants opened in quarter 26 24 26 45 Comparable restaurant sales increase 2.2 % 1.7 % 2.7 % 2.0 % 2008 Quarters Ended Mar. 31 June 30 Sept. 30 Dec. 31 (dollars in millions) Revenue $ 305.3 $ 340.8 $ 340.5 $ 345.3 Operating income $ 26.8 $ 38.3 $ 31.1 $ 27.8 Net income $ 17.3 $ 24.5 $ 19.5 $ 16.9 Number of restaurants opened in quarter 28 49 20 39 Comparable restaurant sales increase 10.2 % 7.1 % 3.1 % 3.5 % Seasonal factors cause our profitability to fluctuate from quarter to quarter. Historically, our average daily restaurant sales and net income are lower in the first and fourth quarters due, in part, to the holiday season and because fewer people eat out during periods of inclement weather (the winter months) than during periods of mild or warm weather (the spring, summer and fall months). Other factors also have a seasonal effect on our results. For example, restaurants located near colleges and universities generally do more business during the academic year. The number of trading days in a quarter can also affect our results. Overall, on an annual basis, changes in trading dates do not have a significant impact on our results. Our quarterly results are also affected by other factors such as the number of new restaurants opened in a quarter and unanticipated events. New restaurants typically have lower margins following opening as a result of the expenses associated with opening new restaurants and their operating inefficiencies in the months immediately following opening. In addition, unanticipated events also impact our results. Accordingly, results for a particular quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary liquidity and capital requirements are for new restaurant construction, working capital and general corporate needs. We have a cash and short term investment balance of $269.6 million that we expect to utilize, along with cash flow from operations, to provide capital to support the growth of our business (primarily through opening restaurants), to repurchase up to an additional $85.9 million of our common stock subject to market conditions, to continue to maintain our existing restaurants and for general corporate purposes. We believe that cash from operations, together with our cash balance, will be enough to meet ongoing capital expenditures, working capital requirements and other cash needs over at least the next 24 months. We havent required significant working capital because customers generally pay using cash or credit and debit cards and because our operations do not require significant receivables, nor do they require significant inventories due, in part, to our use of various fresh ingredients. In addition, we generally have the right to pay for the purchase of food, beverage and supplies some time after the receipt of those items, generally within ten days, thereby reducing the need for incremental working capital to support our growth. 31 Table of Contents In February 2009, we entered into an unsecured revolving credit facility with Bank of America, N.A. with an initial principal amount of $25 million and an additional $25 million accordion feature. Borrowings under the credit facility will bear interest at a rate set, at our option, at either (i) an adjusted LIBOR rate plus a margin ranging from 0.75% to 2.0% depending on a lease adjusted leverage ratio, or (ii) a daily rate equal to (a) the highest of the federal funds rate plus 0.5%, the banks published prime rate, and one month LIBOR plus 1.0%, plus (b) a margin ranging from 0.0% to 1.0% depending on a lease adjusted leverage ratio. The facility includes a commitment fee on the unused balance ranging from 0.25% to 0.5%, based on the lease adjusted leverage ratio. Availability of borrowings under the facility is conditioned on our compliance with specified covenants including a maximum lease adjusted leverage ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. We were in compliance with these covenants as of December 31, 2009. The facility expires in February 2014, but can be terminated or decreased at our option prior to expiration. We intend to use the credit facility for letters of credit issued in the normal course of business and normal short term working capital needs. As of December 31, 2009 there were no loans outstanding and available borrowings were $19.7 million. While operations continue to provide cash, our primary use of cash is in new restaurant development. Our total capital expenditures for 2009 were $117.2 million, and we expect to incur capital expenditures of about $115 million in 2010, of which $100 million relates to our construction of new restaurants and the remainder primarily relates to restaurant reinvestments. In 2009, we spent on average about $850,000 in development and construction costs per restaurant, net of landlord reimbursements. The average development and construction costs per restaurant decreased from $916,000 in 2008 due to cost savings realized, in part, from certain cost reduction efforts associated with the development of the A Model strategy. In 2010, we expect average development and construction costs to be approximately $800,000 as we begin to open A Model restaurants. Contractual Obligations Our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2009 were as follows: Payments Due by Period Total 1 year 2 3 years 4 5 years After5 years (in thousands) Operating leases $ 1,738,244 $ 101,876 $ 204,675 $ 208,843 $ 1,222,850 Deemed landlord financing 6,663 373 785 788 4,717 Other contractual obligations(1) 29,468 25,511 2,064 1,262 631 Total contractual cash obligations $ 1,774,375 $ 127,760 $ 207,524 $ 210,893 $ 1,228,198 (1) We enter into various purchase obligations in the ordinary course of business. Those that are binding primarily relate to amounts owed under contractor and subcontractor agreements, orders submitted for equipment for restaurants under construction, and corporate sponsorships. Were obligated under non cancelable leases for our restaurants and administrative offices. Our leases generally have initial terms of either five to ten years with two or more five year extensions, for end cap and in line restaurants, or 15 to 20 years with several five year extensions, for free standing restaurants. Our leases generally require us to pay a proportionate share of real estate taxes, insurance, common charges and other operating costs. Some restaurant leases provide for contingent rental payments based on sales thresholds, although we generally do not expect to pay significant contingent rent on these properties based on the thresholds in those leases. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, we had no off balance sheet arrangements or obligations. 32 Table of Contents Inflation The primary areas of our operations affected by inflation are food, labor, fuel, utility costs, materials used in the construction of our restaurants, and insurance. Although almost all of our crew members make more than the minimum wage, increases in the applicable federal or state minimum wage may have an impact on our labor costs. Additionally, many of our leases require us to pay taxes, maintenance, utilities and insurance, all of which are generally subject to inflationary increases. Critical Accounting Estimates We describe our significant accounting policies in Note 1 of our consolidated financial statements. Critical accounting estimates are those that we believe are both significant and that require us to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often because we need to estimate the effect of inherently uncertain matters. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experiences and various other factors that we believe to be appropriate under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates, and we might obtain different estimates if we used different assumptions or factors. We believe the following critical accounting estimates affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements: Leases We lease most of our restaurant locations. Our leases contain escalating rentals over the lease term as well as optional renewal periods. We account for our leases by recognizing rent expense on a straight line basis over the lease term including reasonably assured renewal periods. We have estimated that our lease term, including reasonably assured renewal periods, is the lesser of the lease term or 20 years. If the estimate of our reasonably assured lease terms were changed our depreciation and rent expense could differ materially. Stock based Compensation We recognize compensation expense for equity awards over the vesting period based on the awards fair value. We use the Black Scholes valuation model to determine the fair value of our stock options and stock appreciation rights, which requires assumptions to be made regarding our stock price volatility, the expected life of the award and expected dividend rates. The volatility assumptions were derived from our actual and implied volatilities and historical volatilities of competitors whose shares are traded in the public markets and are adjusted to reflect anticipated behavior specific to us. Had we arrived at different assumptions of stock price volatility or expected lives of our options and stock appreciation rights, our stock based compensation expense and result of operations could have been different. Insurance Liability We maintain various insurance policies for employee health, workers compensation, general liability and property damage. Pursuant to these policies we are either responsible for losses up to certain limits or are self insured but have third party insurance coverage to limit exposure to these claims. We record a liability that represents our estimated cost of claims incurred and unpaid as of the balance sheet date. Our estimated liability is not discounted and is based on a number of assumptions and factors, including historical trends, actuarial assumptions and economic conditions, and is closely monitored and adjusted when warranted by changing circumstances. In addition, our history of claims experience is short and our significant growth rate could affect the accuracy of estimates based on historical experience. Should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what was estimated or medical costs increase beyond what was expected, our accrued liabilities might not be sufficient and additional expenses may be recorded. Actual claims experience could also be more favorable than estimated, which would result in expense reductions. Unanticipated changes may produce materially different amounts of expense than that reported under these programs. 33 Table of Contents Reserves/Contingencies for Litigation and Other Matters We are involved in various claims and legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of business. These actions are subject to many uncertainties, and we cannot predict the outcomes with any degree of certainty. Consequently, we were unable to ascertain the ultimate aggregate amount of monetary liability or financial impact with respect to these matters as of December 31, 2009 and 2008. Once resolved, however, these actions may affect our operating results and cash flows. Sabbatical Liability We offer our employees a sabbatical leave after each ten years of service they complete. We record a liability for our estimate of the accumulated sabbatical expense as of the balance sheet date. Our estimated liability is based on a number of factors including actuarial assumptions and historical trends. Changes in assumptions and trends could result in a materially different liability and expense. Unredeemed Gift Card Balances We sell gift cards which do not have an expiration date and from which we do not deduct non usage fees. We recognize revenue from gift cards when: (i) the gift card is redeemed by the customer; or (ii) the likelihood of the gift card being redeemed by the customer is remote (gift card breakage) and we determine that there is not a legal obligation to remit the unredeemed gift cards to the relevant jurisdiction. The determination of the gift card breakage rate is based upon company specific historical redemption patterns. Gift card breakage is recognized in revenue as the gift cards are used on a pro rata basis over a period of six months beginning at the date of the gift card sale. We have determined 5% of gift card sales will not be redeemed and will be retained by us. Any future revisions to the estimated breakage rate may result in changes in the amount of breakage revenue recognized in future periods. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK Changing Interest Rates Were exposed to interest rate risk through the investment of our cash, cash equivalents, and available for sale securities. Changes in interest rates affect the interest income we earn, and therefore impact our cash flows and results of operations. As of December 31, 2009, we had $236.3 million deposited in short term investments and available for sale securities, and $30.8 million in FDIC insured accounts with an earnings credit we classify as interest income, which combined earned a weighted average interest rate of 0.38% (approximately 0.40% tax equivalent). Commodity Price Risks We are also exposed to commodity price risks. Many of the ingredients we use to prepare our food, as well as our packaging materials, are commodities or ingredients that are affected by the price of other commodities, exchange rates, foreign demand, weather, seasonality, production, availability and other factors outside our control. We work closely with our suppliers and use a mix of forward pricing protocols under which we agree with our supplier on fixed prices for deliveries at some time in the future, fixed pricing protocols under which we agree on a fixed price with our supplier for the duration of that protocol, and formula pricing protocols under which the prices we pay are based on a specified formula related to the prices of the goods, such as spot prices. However, a portion of the dollar value of goods purchased by us is effectively at spot prices. Generally our pricing protocols with suppliers can remain in effect for periods ranging from one to 18 months, depending on the outlook for prices of the particular ingredient. In several cases, we have minimum purchase obligations. Weve tried to increase, where necessary, the number of suppliers for our ingredients, which we believe can help mitigate pricing volatility, and we follow industry news, trade issues, exchange rates, foreign demand, weather, crises and other world events that may affect our ingredient prices. Increases in ingredient prices could adversely affect our results if we choose not to increase menu prices at the same pace for competitive or other reasons. 34 Table of Contents
