MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS You should read the following discussion together with Item 6. Selected Consolidated Financial Data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. The discussion contains forward looking statements involving risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause our results to differ materially from expectations. Factors that might cause such differences include those described in Item 1A. Risk Factors and elsewhere in this report. Overview Chipotle operates fresh Mexican food restaurants serving burritos, tacos, burrito bowls (a burrito without the tortilla) and salads. We began with a simple philosophy: demonstrate that food served fast doesnt have to be a traditional fast food experience. We do this by avoiding a formulaic approach when creating our restaurant experience, looking to fine dining restaurants for inspiration. We use high quality raw ingredients, classic cooking methods and distinctive interior design, and have friendly people to take care of each customer features that are more frequently found in the world of fine dining. Through our vision of Food With Integrity, Chipotle is seeking better food from using ingredients that are not only fresh, but that where possible are sustainably grown and naturally raised with respect for the animals, the land, and the farmers who produce the food. A similarly focused people culture, with an emphasis on identifying and empowering top performing employees, enables us to develop future leaders from within. 2011 Highlights and Trends Restaurant Development. As of December 31, 2011, we had 1,230 restaurants, of which 1,226 were located throughout the United States, two located in Toronto, Canada, and two located in London, England. New restaurants have contributed substantially to our restaurant sales growth. We opened 150 restaurants in 2011, including one ShopHouse Southeast Asian Kitchen, our new concept serving bowls and banh mi sandwiches. We expect to open between 155 and 165 restaurants in 2012. Among the expected restaurant openings in 2012 is a restaurant in Paris, France, which will be our first restaurant in France, and one ShopHouse. We plan about 30% of the 2012 openings to be what we call A Model restaurants. A Model locations are being built primarily in secondary trade areas which have attractive demographics but are typically characterized by lower investment and occupancy costs than our recent traditional restaurant openings. Our introduction of A Model restaurants and our new, simpler design, which incorporates some A Model design elements, enabled us to lower the average development costs for new restaurants from about $850,000 in 2009 to about $800,000 in 2011. We anticipate average development costs for new restaurants to be opened in 2012 to be similar to 2011. Sales Growth. Average restaurant sales were $2.013 million as of December 31, 2011, increasing from $1.840 million as of December 31, 2010. We define average restaurant sales as the average trailing 12 month sales for restaurants in operation for at least 12 full calendar months. Our comparable restaurant sales increases were 11.2% in 2011 and were driven primarily by an increase in customer visits, as well as the impact of menu price increases implemented during the year benefiting comparable restaurant sales by 2.9%. Comparable restaurant sales represent the change in period over period sales for restaurants beginning in their 13th full calendar month of operation. Due to the uncertain economic environment and difficult comparisons with 2011, we expect 2012 comparable restaurant sales increases to be in the mid single digits. Food With Integrity. By the end of 2011, we were serving naturally raised meats in all of our restaurants in the U.S. We define naturally raised as coming from animals that are never given antibiotics or added hormones and that are raised responsibly that is, in accordance with our animal welfare standards. In addition, a portion of some of the produce items we serve is organically grown, or sourced locally when in season (by which we mean within 350 miles of our restaurant), and a portion of the beans we serve is organically grown and a portion is grown using conservation tillage methods that improve soil conditions, reduce erosion and help preserve the environment in which they are grown. All of the sour cream and cheese we buy is made from milk that comes from cows that are not given rBGH. Milk used to make much of our cheese and a portion of our sour cream is 28 Table of Contents sourced from dairies that provide an even higher standard of animal welfare by providing pasture access for their cows. We will continue to search for ingredients that not only taste delicious, but also benefit local farmers or the environment, or otherwise benefit or improve the sustainability of our supply chain. Continuing to serve naturally raised meats in all of our restaurants is one of our primary goals, but we have and will continue to face challenges in doing so. Some of our restaurants served conventionally raised chicken or steak for much of 2011, a few markets reverted to conventionally raised beef in early 2012, and more of our restaurants may periodically serve conventionally raised meats in the future due to supply constraints. Our food costs increased in 2011 as a result of inflationary pressures on almost all of our ingredients, particularly avocados, beef, chicken, and dairy. We expect that food cost inflation will continue in 2012 and that our food costs as a percentage of revenue will increase. Stock Repurchases. In accordance with stock repurchases authorized by our Board of Directors we purchased stock with an aggregate total repurchase price of $63.5 million during 2011. As of December 31, 2011, $6.6 million was available to be repurchased under the current repurchase authorization. On February 1, 2012, we announced that our Board of Directors had authorized the expenditure of up to an additional $100 million to repurchase shares of our common stock. We have entered into an agreement with a broker under SEC rule 10b5 1(c), authorizing the broker to make open market purchases of common stock from time to time, subject to market conditions. The existing repurchase agreement and the Boards authorization of the repurchases may be modified, suspended, or discontinued at any time. Restaurant Openings, Relocations and Closures The following table details restaurant unit data for the years indicated. For the years endedDecember 31 2011 2010 2009 Beginning of year 1,084 956 837 Openings 150 129 121 Closures and Relocations (4 ) (1 ) (2 ) Total restaurants at end of year 1,230 1,084 956 Results of Operations Our results of operations as a percentage of revenue and period over period variances are discussed in the following section. As our business grows, as we open more restaurants and hire more employees, our restaurant operating costs and depreciation and amortization increase. Revenue For the years ended December 31 %increase2011 over2010 %increase2010 over2009 2011 2010 2009 (dollars in millions) Revenue $ 2,269.5 $ 1,835.9 $ 1,518.4 23.6 % 20.9 % Average restaurant sales $ 2.013 $ 1.840 $ 1.728 9.4 % 6.5 % Comparable restaurant sales increase 11.2 % 9.4 % 2.2 % Number of restaurants as of the end of the year 1,230 1,084 956 13.5 % 13.4 % Number of restaurants opened in the year, net of closures and relocations 146 128 119 29 Table of Contents The significant factors contributing to our increases in sales were new restaurant openings and comparable restaurant sales increases. Restaurant sales from restaurants not yet in the comparable base contributed to $237.9 million of the increase in sales in 2011, of which $92.8 million was attributable to restaurants opened during the year. In 2010, restaurant sales from restaurants not yet in the comparable restaurant base contributed to $178.7 million of the increase in sales, of which $75.2 million was attributable to restaurants opened in 2010. Comparable restaurant sales increases contributed $195.6 million and $138.7 million of the increase in restaurant sales in 2011 and 2010, respectively. Comparable restaurant sales growth in 2011 was due primarily to increases in customer visits, as well as the impact of menu price increases implemented during the year. The increase in 2010 was primarily driven by increases in customer visits. Food, Beverage and Packaging Costs For the years endedDecember 31 %increase2011 over2010 %increase2010 over2009 2011 2010 2009 (dollars in millions) Food, beverage and packaging $ 738.7 $ 561.1 $ 466.0 31.7 % 20.4 % As a percentage of revenue 32.5 % 30.6 % 30.7 % Food, beverage and packaging costs increased as a percentage of revenue in 2011 due to inflation on most food items, including avocados, beef, chicken, and dairy, partially offset by the impact of menu price increases. We expect that food cost inflation will continue in 2012 and that our food costs as a percentage of revenue will increase. Food, beverage and packaging costs decreased as a percentage of revenue in 2010 due primarily to favorable food costs, primarily rice, corn and chicken as a result of our switch to commodity chicken in certain markets due to supply constraints, partially offset by the increased cost of barbacoa and steak as we increased the percentage of naturally raised beef we served in our restaurants. Labor Costs For the years endedDecember 31 %increase2011 over2010 %increase2010 over2009 2011 2010 2009 (dollars in millions) Labor costs $ 543.1 $ 453.6 $ 385.1 19.7 % 17.8 % As a percentage of revenue 23.9 % 24.7 % 25.4 % Labor costs as a percentage of revenue decreased in 2011 due primarily to the benefit of higher average restaurant sales, including the impact of menu price increases, partially offset by increased average wage rates due to normal wage inflation, as well as labor inefficiencies. Labor costs decreased as a percentage of revenue in 2010 primarily due to the benefit of higher average restaurant sales, partially offset by increased average wage rates due to normal wage inflation and increased insurance costs. Occupancy Costs For the years endedDecember 31 %increase2011 over2010 %increase2010 over2009 2011 2010 2009 (dollars in millions) Occupancy costs $ 147.3 $ 128.9 $ 114.2 14.2 % 12.9 % As a percentage of revenue 6.5 % 7.0 % 7.5 % 30 Table of Contents Occupancy costs decreased as a percentage of revenue in 2011 primarily due to the benefit of higher average restaurant sales on a partially fixed cost base. Occupancy costs decreased as a percentage of revenue in 2010 primarily due to the benefit of higher average sales on a partially fixed cost base. The benefit of the lower occupancy costs from the A Model restaurants was offset by opening proportionately more restaurants in more expensive areas. Other Operating Costs For the years endedDecember 31 %increase2011 over2010 %increase2010 over2009 2011 2010 2009 (dollars in millions) Other operating costs $ 251.2 $ 202.9 $ 174.6 23.8 % 16.2 % As a percentage of revenue 11.1 % 11.1 % 11.5 % Other operating costs remained consistent as a percentage of revenue in 2011. The benefit of higher average restaurant sales on a partially fixed cost base and lower marketing and promotional spend as a percentage of revenue was offset by increased credit card fees resulting from a higher percentage of customers using credit cards, as well as increased maintenance of restaurants as they age and general inflationary pressures. Other operating costs as a percentage of revenue decreased in 2010 primarily due to the benefit of higher average restaurant sales on a partially fixed cost base, partially offset by increased credit card fees resulting from a higher percentage of customers using credit cards, as well as increased purchases of kitchen supplies. General and Administrative Expenses For the years endedDecember 31 %increase2011 over2010 %increase2010 over2009 2011 2010 2009 (dollars in millions) General and administrative expense $ 149.4 $ 118.6 $ 99.1 26.0 % 19.6 % As a percentage of revenue 6.6 % 6.5 % 6.5 % The increase in general and administrative expenses in 2011 primarily resulted from an increase in non cash stock based compensation expense due to awards granted in 2011 with a significantly higher stock price on the date of grant as well as hiring more employees as we grew. These increases were partially offset by costs from the biennial all manager conference held during the third quarter of 2010. The increase in general and administrative expenses in 2010 primarily resulted from an increase in stock based compensation expense resulting from the stock based compensation awards granted in 2010, costs from the biennial all manager conference, and hiring more employees as we grew. We expect general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue to increase in 2012, which takes into consideration that we anticipate materially higher stock based compensation expense than 2011 due to our higher stock price, as well as expenses related to the biennial all manager conference to be held in the third quarter of 2012. Depreciation and Amortization For the years endedDecember 31 %increase2011 over2010 %increase2010 over2009 2011 2010 2009 (dollars in millions) Depreciation and amortization $ 74.9 $ 68.9 $ 61.3 8.7 % 12.4 % As a percentage of revenue 3.3 % 3.8 % 4.0 % As a percentage of total revenue, depreciation and amortization decreased in 2011 and 2010 as a result of the benefit of higher average restaurant sales on a partially fixed cost base. 31 Table of Contents Interest and Other Expense For the years endedDecember 31 %increase2011 over2010 %increase2010 over2009 2011 2010 2009 (dollars in millions) Interest and other expense $ 2.9 $ 0.0 $ 0.0 * * * not meaningful Interest and other expense increased in 2011 due to a loss recognized in the second quarter on our investment in ANGR Holdings, LLC, which operated the restaurants awarded on the television program Americas Next Great Restaurant prior to their closure. The recognized losses represent the entire amount of our investment. Income Tax Provision For the years endedDecember 31 %increase2011 over2010 %increase2010 over2009 2011 2010 2009 (dollars in millions) Income tax provision $ 134.8 $ 110.1 $ 77.4 22.4 % 42.3 % Effective tax rate 38.5 % 38.1 % 37.9 % The 2011 effective tax rate increased primarily due to an increase in the state rate, smaller benefit from food donations and one time adjustments partially offset by the one time employment tax credits. We estimate our 2012 annual effective tax rate will be 39.3%. However, if certain federal tax credits weve benefitted from in 2011 are renewed by Congress, we estimate our annual effective tax rate would be lower by up to 0.4%. The 2010 effective tax rate increased primarily due to a one time benefit recognized in 2009 for prior period meals and entertainment deductions. Quarterly Financial Data/Seasonality The following table presents consolidated statement of income data for each of the eight quarters in the period ended December 31, 2011. The operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results for any subsequent quarter. 2011 Quarters Ended Mar. 31 June 30 Sept. 30 Dec. 31 (dollars in millions) Revenue $ 509.4 $ 571.6 $ 591.9 $ 596.7 Operating income $ 74.8 $ 83.9 $ 98.0 $ 93.9 Net income $ 46.4 $ 50.7 $ 60.4 $ 57.5 Number of restaurants opened in quarter 12 39 32 67 Comparable restaurant sales increase 12.4 % 10.0 % 11.3 % 11.1 % 2010 Quarters Ended Mar. 31 June 30 Sept. 30 Dec. 31 (dollars in millions) Revenue $ 409.7 $ 466.8 $ 476.9 $ 482.5 Operating income $ 61.3 $ 75.0 $ 77.6 $ 73.9 Net income $ 37.8 $ 46.5 $ 48.2 $ 46.4 Number of restaurants opened in quarter 20 25 22 62 Comparable restaurant sales increase 4.3 % 8.7 % 11.4 % 12.6 % Seasonal factors cause our profitability to fluctuate from quarter to quarter. Historically, our average daily restaurant sales and net income are lower in the first and fourth quarters due, in part, to the holiday season and because fewer people eat out during periods of inclement weather (the winter months) than during periods of 32 Table of Contents mild or warm weather (the spring, summer and fall months). Other factors also have a seasonal effect on our results. For example, restaurants located near colleges and universities generally do more business during the academic year. The number of trading days in a quarter can also affect our results. Overall, on an annual basis, changes in trading dates do not have a significant impact on our results. Our quarterly results are also affected by other factors such as the number of new restaurants opened in a quarter and unanticipated events. New restaurants typically have lower margins following opening as a result of the expenses associated with opening new restaurants and their operating inefficiencies in the months immediately following opening. In addition, unanticipated events also impact our results. Accordingly, results for a particular quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary liquidity and capital requirements are for new restaurant construction, working capital and general corporate needs. We have a cash and short term investment balance of $456.2 million that we expect to utilize, along with cash flow from operations, to provide capital to support the growth of our business (primarily through opening restaurants), to repurchase up to an additional $106.6 million of our common stock subject to market conditions, to continue to maintain our existing restaurants and for general corporate purposes. We also have a long term investments balance of $128.2 million, which consists of U.S. treasury notes and certificate of deposit products with maturities of 13 months to approximately 2 years. We believe that cash from operations, together with our cash balance, will be enough to meet ongoing capital expenditures, working capital requirements and other cash needs for the foreseeable future. We havent required significant working capital because customers generally pay using cash or credit and debit cards and because our operations do not require significant receivables, nor do they require significant inventories due, in part, to our use of various fresh ingredients. In addition, we generally have the right to pay for the purchase of food, beverage and supplies some time after the receipt of those items, generally within ten days, thereby reducing the need for incremental working capital to support our growth. While operations continue to provide cash, our primary use of cash is in new restaurant development. Our total capital expenditures for 2011 were $151.1 million, and we expect to incur capital expenditures of about $160 million to $170 million in 2012, of which $138 million relates to our construction of new restaurants before any reductions for landlord reimbursements, and the remainder primarily relates to restaurant reinvestments. In 2011, we spent on average about $800,000 in development and construction costs per restaurant, net of landlord reimbursements. The average development and construction costs per restaurant decreased from about $850,000 in 2009 due to cost savings realized, in part, from certain cost reduction efforts associated with the development of the A Model strategy and our new, simpler restaurant design. For new restaurants to be opened in 2012 we anticipate average development costs to be similar to 2011. Contractual Obligations Our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2011 were as follows: Payments Due by Period Total 1 year 2 3 years 4 5 years After5 years (in thousands) Operating leases $ 2,116,395 $ 133,813 $ 271,911 $ 275,512 $ 1,435,159 Deemed landlord financing 5,898 394 788 821 3,895 Other contractual obligations(1) 73,455 69,370 4,085 Total contractual cash obligations $ 2,195,748 $ 203,577 $ 276,784 $ 276,333 $ 1,439,054 (1) We enter into various purchase obligations in the ordinary course of business. Those that are binding primarily relate to amounts owed under contractor and subcontractor agreements, orders submitted for equipment for restaurants under construction, and corporate sponsorships. 33 Table of Contents Were obligated under non cancelable leases for our restaurants and administrative offices. Our leases generally have initial terms of either five to ten years with two or more five year extensions, for end cap and in line restaurants, or 15 to 20 years with several five year extensions, for free standing restaurants. Our leases generally require us to pay a proportionate share of real estate taxes, insurance, common charges and other operating costs. Some restaurant leases provide for contingent rental payments based on sales thresholds, although we generally do not expect to pay significant contingent rent on these properties based on the thresholds in those leases. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, we had no off balance sheet arrangements or obligations. Inflation The primary areas of our operations affected by inflation are food, labor, fuel, utility costs, materials used in the construction of our restaurants, and insurance. Although almost all of our crew members make more than the minimum wage, increases in the applicable federal or state minimum wage may have an impact on our labor costs. Additionally, many of our leases require us to pay taxes, maintenance, utilities and insurance, all of which are generally subject to inflationary increases. Critical Accounting Estimates We describe our significant accounting policies in Note 1 of our consolidated financial statements. Critical accounting estimates are those that we believe are both significant and that require us to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often because we need to estimate the effect of inherently uncertain matters. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experiences and various other factors that we believe to be appropriate under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates, and we might obtain different estimates if we used different assumptions or factors. We believe the following critical accounting estimates affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements: Leases We lease most of our restaurant locations. Our leases contain escalating rentals over the lease term as well as optional renewal periods. We account for our leases by recognizing rent expense on a straight line basis over the lease term including reasonably assured renewal periods. We have estimated that our lease term, including reasonably assured renewal periods, is the lesser of the lease term or 20 years. If the estimate of our reasonably assured lease terms were changed our depreciation and rent expense could differ materially. Stock based Compensation We recognize compensation expense for equity awards over the vesting period based on the awards fair value. We use the Black Scholes valuation model to determine the fair value of our stock only stock appreciation rights, or SOSARs, which requires assumptions to be made regarding our stock price volatility, the expected life of the award and expected dividend rates. The volatility and expected life assumptions were based on our historical data. Similarly, the compensation expense of performance share awards and SOSARs with performance based vesting conditions is based in part on the estimated probability of our achieving levels of performance associated with particular levels of payout for performance shares and with vesting for performance SOSARs. We determine the probability of achievement of future levels of performance by comparing the relevant performance level with our internal estimates of future performance. Those estimates are based on a number of assumptions, and different assumptions may have resulted in different conclusions regarding the probability of our achieving future levels of performance relevant to the payout levels for the awards. Had we arrived at different assumptions of stock price volatility or expected lives of our SOSARs, or different assumptions regarding the probability of our achieving future levels of performance with respect to performance share awards and performance SOSARs, our stock based compensation expense and results of operations could have been different. 34 Table of Contents Insurance Liability We maintain various insurance policies for workers compensation, general liability and auto damage with varying deductibles as high as $500,000, and for property which has a $1 million deductible. We are self insured for employee health but have third party insurance coverage to limit exposure to these claims. We record a liability that represents our estimated cost of claims incurred and unpaid as of the balance sheet date. Our estimated liability is not discounted and is based on a number of assumptions and factors, including historical trends, actuarial assumptions and economic conditions, and is closely monitored and adjusted when warranted by changing circumstances. In addition, our history of claims experience is short and our significant growth rate could affect the accuracy of estimates based on historical experience. Should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what was estimated or medical costs increase beyond what was expected, our accrued liabilities might not be sufficient and additional expenses may be recorded. Actual claims experience could also be more favorable than estimated, which would result in expense reductions. Unanticipated changes may produce materially different amounts of expense than that reported under these programs. The total estimated insurance liabilities as of December 31, 2011 were $21.7 million. Reserves/Contingencies for Litigation and Other Matters We are involved in various claims and legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of business. These actions are subject to many uncertainties, and we cannot predict the outcomes with any degree of certainty. Consequently, we were unable to ascertain the ultimate aggregate amount of monetary liability or financial impact with respect to these matters as of December 31, 2011 and 2010. Once resolved, however, these actions may affect our operating results and cash flows. Unredeemed Gift Card Balances We sell gift cards which do not have an expiration date and from which we do not deduct non usage fees. We recognize revenue from gift cards when: (i) the gift card is redeemed by the customer; or (ii) the likelihood of the gift card being redeemed by the customer is remote (gift card breakage) and we determine that there is not a legal obligation to remit the unredeemed gift cards to the relevant jurisdiction. The determination of the gift card breakage rate is based upon company specific historical redemption patterns. Gift card breakage is recognized in revenue as the gift cards are used on a pro rata basis over a period of six months beginning at the date of the gift card sale. We have determined 5% of gift card sales will not be redeemed and will be retained by us. Any future revisions to the estimated breakage rate may result in changes in the amount of breakage revenue recognized in future periods. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK Changing Interest Rates Were exposed to interest rate risk through fluctuations of interest rates on our investments. Changes in interest rates affect the interest income we earn, and therefore impact our cash flows and results of operations. As of December 31, 2011, we had $382.8 million in investments, including a trust account classified in other assets, and $204.0 million in FDIC insured accounts with an earnings credit we classify as interest income, which combined earned a weighted average interest rate of 0.36%. Commodity Price Risks We are also exposed to commodity price risks. Many of the ingredients we use to prepare our food, as well as our packaging materials, are commodities or ingredients that are affected by the price of other commodities, exchange rates, foreign demand, weather, seasonality, production, availability and other factors outside our control. We work closely with our suppliers and use a mix of forward pricing protocols under which we agree with our supplier on fixed prices for deliveries at some time in the future, fixed pricing protocols under which we agree on a fixed price with our supplier for the duration of that protocol, and formula pricing protocols under which the prices we pay are based on a specified formula related to the prices of the goods, such as spot prices. 35 Table of Contents However, a portion of the dollar value of goods purchased by us is effectively at spot prices. Generally our pricing protocols with suppliers can remain in effect for periods ranging from one to 18 months, depending on the outlook for prices of the particular ingredient. In several cases, we have minimum purchase obligations. Weve tried to increase, where necessary, the number of suppliers for our ingredients, which we believe can help mitigate pricing volatility, and we follow industry news, trade issues, exchange rates, foreign demand, weather, crises and other world events that may affect our ingredient prices. Increases in ingredient prices could adversely affect our results if we choose not to increase menu prices at the same pace for competitive or other reasons. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk A portion of our operations consist of activities outside of the U.S. and we have currency risk on the transactions in other currencies and translation adjustments resulting from the conversion of our international financial results into the U.S. dollar. However, a substantial majority of our operations and investment activities are transacted in the U.S. and therefore our foreign currency risk is limited at this date. 36 Table of Contents 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS You should read the following discussion together with Item 6. Selected Consolidated Financial Data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. The discussion contains forward looking statements involving risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause our results to differ materially from expectations. Factors that might cause such differences include those described in Item 1A. Risk Factors and elsewhere in this report. Overview Chipotle operates fresh Mexican food restaurants serving burritos, tacos, burrito bowls (a burrito without the tortilla) and salads. We began with a simple philosophy: demonstrate that food served fast doesnt have to be a traditional fast food experience. We do this by avoiding a formulaic approach when creating our restaurant experience, looking to fine dining restaurants for inspiration. We use high quality raw ingredients, classic cooking methods and distinctive interior design, and have friendly people to take care of each customer features that are more frequently found in the world of fine dining. Through our vision of Food With Integrity, Chipotle is seeking better food from using ingredients that are not only fresh, but that where possible are sustainably grown and naturally raised with respect for the animals, the land, and the farmers who produce the food. A similarly focused people culture, with an emphasis on identifying and empowering top performing employees, enables us to develop future leaders from within. 2011 Highlights and Trends Restaurant Development. As of December 31, 2011, we had 1,230 restaurants, of which 1,226 were located throughout the United States, two located in Toronto, Canada, and two located in London, England. New restaurants have contributed substantially to our restaurant sales growth. We opened 150 restaurants in 2011, including one ShopHouse Southeast Asian Kitchen, our new concept serving bowls and banh mi sandwiches. We expect to open between 155 and 165 restaurants in 2012. Among the expected restaurant openings in 2012 is a restaurant in Paris, France, which will be our first restaurant in France, and one ShopHouse. We plan about 30% of the 2012 openings to be what we call A Model restaurants. A Model locations are being built primarily in secondary trade areas which have attractive demographics but are typically characterized by lower investment and occupancy costs than our recent traditional restaurant openings. Our introduction of A Model restaurants and our new, simpler design, which incorporates some A Model design elements, enabled us to lower the average development costs for new restaurants from about $850,000 in 2009 to about $800,000 in 2011. We anticipate average development costs for new restaurants to be opened in 2012 to be similar to 2011. Sales Growth. Average restaurant sales were $2.013 million as of December 31, 2011, increasing from $1.840 million as of December 31, 2010. We define average restaurant sales as the average trailing 12 month sales for restaurants in operation for at least 12 full calendar months. Our comparable restaurant sales increases were 11.2% in 2011 and were driven primarily by an increase in customer visits, as well as the impact of menu price increases implemented during the year benefiting comparable restaurant sales by 2.9%. Comparable restaurant sales represent the change in period over period sales for restaurants beginning in their 13th full calendar month of operation. Due to the uncertain economic environment and difficult comparisons with 2011, we expect 2012 comparable restaurant sales increases to be in the mid single digits. Food With Integrity. By the end of 2011, we were serving naturally raised meats in all of our restaurants in the U.S. We define naturally raised as coming from animals that are never given antibiotics or added hormones and that are raised responsibly that is, in accordance with our animal welfare standards. In addition, a portion of some of the produce items we serve is organically grown, or sourced locally when in season (by which we mean within 350 miles of our restaurant), and a portion of the beans we serve is organically grown and a portion is grown using conservation tillage methods that improve soil conditions, reduce erosion and help preserve the environment in which they are grown. All of the sour cream and cheese we buy is made from milk that comes from cows that are not given rBGH. Milk used to make much of our cheese and a portion of our sour cream is 28 Table of Contents sourced from dairies that provide an even higher standard of animal welfare by providing pasture access for their cows. We will continue to search for ingredients that not only taste delicious, but also benefit local farmers or the environment, or otherwise benefit or improve the sustainability of our supply chain. Continuing to serve naturally raised meats in all of our restaurants is one of our primary goals, but we have and will continue to face challenges in doing so. Some of our restaurants served conventionally raised chicken or steak for much of 2011, a few markets reverted to conventionally raised beef in early 2012, and more of our restaurants may periodically serve conventionally raised meats in the future due to supply constraints. Our food costs increased in 2011 as a result of inflationary pressures on almost all of our ingredients, particularly avocados, beef, chicken, and dairy. We expect that food cost inflation will continue in 2012 and that our food costs as a percentage of revenue will increase. Stock Repurchases. In accordance with stock repurchases authorized by our Board of Directors we purchased stock with an aggregate total repurchase price of $63.5 million during 2011. As of December 31, 2011, $6.6 million was available to be repurchased under the current repurchase authorization. On February 1, 2012, we announced that our Board of Directors had authorized the expenditure of up to an additional $100 million to repurchase shares of our common stock. We have entered into an agreement with a broker under SEC rule 10b5 1(c), authorizing the broker to make open market purchases of common stock from time to time, subject to market conditions. The existing repurchase agreement and the Boards authorization of the repurchases may be modified, suspended, or discontinued at any time. Restaurant Openings, Relocations and Closures The following table details restaurant unit data for the years indicated. For the years endedDecember 31 2011 2010 2009 Beginning of year 1,084 956 837 Openings 150 129 121 Closures and Relocations (4 ) (1 ) (2 ) Total restaurants at end of year 1,230 1,084 956 Results of Operations Our results of operations as a percentage of revenue and period over period variances are discussed in the following section. As our business grows, as we open more restaurants and hire more employees, our restaurant operating costs and depreciation and amortization increase. Revenue For the years ended December 31 %increase2011 over2010 %increase2010 over2009 2011 2010 2009 (dollars in millions) Revenue $ 2,269.5 $ 1,835.9 $ 1,518.4 23.6 % 20.9 % Average restaurant sales $ 2.013 $ 1.840 $ 1.728 9.4 % 6.5 % Comparable restaurant sales increase 11.2 % 9.4 % 2.2 % Number of restaurants as of the end of the year 1,230 1,084 956 13.5 % 13.4 % Number of restaurants opened in the year, net of closures and relocations 146 128 119 29 Table of Contents The significant factors contributing to our increases in sales were new restaurant openings and comparable restaurant sales increases. Restaurant sales from restaurants not yet in the comparable base contributed to $237.9 million of the increase in sales in 2011, of which $92.8 million was attributable to restaurants opened during the year. In 2010, restaurant sales from restaurants not yet in the comparable restaurant base contributed to $178.7 million of the increase in sales, of which $75.2 million was attributable to restaurants opened in 2010. Comparable restaurant sales increases contributed $195.6 million and $138.7 million of the increase in restaurant sales in 2011 and 2010, respectively. Comparable restaurant sales growth in 2011 was due primarily to increases in customer visits, as well as the impact of menu price increases implemented during the year. The increase in 2010 was primarily driven by increases in customer visits. Food, Beverage and Packaging Costs For the years endedDecember 31 %increase2011 over2010 %increase2010 over2009 2011 2010 2009 (dollars in millions) Food, beverage and packaging $ 738.7 $ 561.1 $ 466.0 31.7 % 20.4 % As a percentage of revenue 32.5 % 30.6 % 30.7 % Food, beverage and packaging costs increased as a percentage of revenue in 2011 due to inflation on most food items, including avocados, beef, chicken, and dairy, partially offset by the impact of menu price increases. We expect that food cost inflation will continue in 2012 and that our food costs as a percentage of revenue will increase. Food, beverage and packaging costs decreased as a percentage of revenue in 2010 due primarily to favorable food costs, primarily rice, corn and chicken as a result of our switch to commodity chicken in certain markets due to supply constraints, partially offset by the increased cost of barbacoa and steak as we increased the percentage of naturally raised beef we served in our restaurants. Labor Costs For the years endedDecember 31 %increase2011 over2010 %increase2010 over2009 2011 2010 2009 (dollars in millions) Labor costs $ 543.1 $ 453.6 $ 385.1 19.7 % 17.8 % As a percentage of revenue 23.9 % 24.7 % 25.4 % Labor costs as a percentage of revenue decreased in 2011 due primarily to the benefit of higher average restaurant sales, including the impact of menu price increases, partially offset by increased average wage rates due to normal wage inflation, as well as labor inefficiencies. Labor costs decreased as a percentage of revenue in 2010 primarily due to the benefit of higher average restaurant sales, partially offset by increased average wage rates due to normal wage inflation and increased insurance costs. Occupancy Costs For the years endedDecember 31 %increase2011 over2010 %increase2010 over2009 2011 2010 2009 (dollars in millions) Occupancy costs $ 147.3 $ 128.9 $ 114.2 14.2 % 12.9 % As a percentage of revenue 6.5 % 7.0 % 7.5 % 30 Table of Contents Occupancy costs decreased as a percentage of revenue in 2011 primarily due to the benefit of higher average restaurant sales on a partially fixed cost base. Occupancy costs decreased as a percentage of revenue in 2010 primarily due to the benefit of higher average sales on a partially fixed cost base. The benefit of the lower occupancy costs from the A Model restaurants was offset by opening proportionately more restaurants in more expensive areas. Other Operating Costs For the years endedDecember 31 %increase2011 over2010 %increase2010 over2009 2011 2010 2009 (dollars in millions) Other operating costs $ 251.2 $ 202.9 $ 174.6 23.8 % 16.2 % As a percentage of revenue 11.1 % 11.1 % 11.5 % Other operating costs remained consistent as a percentage of revenue in 2011. The benefit of higher average restaurant sales on a partially fixed cost base and lower marketing and promotional spend as a percentage of revenue was offset by increased credit card fees resulting from a higher percentage of customers using credit cards, as well as increased maintenance of restaurants as they age and general inflationary pressures. Other operating costs as a percentage of revenue decreased in 2010 primarily due to the benefit of higher average restaurant sales on a partially fixed cost base, partially offset by increased credit card fees resulting from a higher percentage of customers using credit cards, as well as increased purchases of kitchen supplies. General and Administrative Expenses For the years endedDecember 31 %increase2011 over2010 %increase2010 over2009 2011 2010 2009 (dollars in millions) General and administrative expense $ 149.4 $ 118.6 $ 99.1 26.0 % 19.6 % As a percentage of revenue 6.6 % 6.5 % 6.5 % The increase in general and administrative expenses in 2011 primarily resulted from an increase in non cash stock based compensation expense due to awards granted in 2011 with a significantly higher stock price on the date of grant as well as hiring more employees as we grew. These increases were partially offset by costs from the biennial all manager conference held during the third quarter of 2010. The increase in general and administrative expenses in 2010 primarily resulted from an increase in stock based compensation expense resulting from the stock based compensation awards granted in 2010, costs from the biennial all manager conference, and hiring more employees as we grew. We expect general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue to increase in 2012, which takes into consideration that we anticipate materially higher stock based compensation expense than 2011 due to our higher stock price, as well as expenses related to the biennial all manager conference to be held in the third quarter of 2012. Depreciation and Amortization For the years endedDecember 31 %increase2011 over2010 %increase2010 over2009 2011 2010 2009 (dollars in millions) Depreciation and amortization $ 74.9 $ 68.9 $ 61.3 8.7 % 12.4 % As a percentage of revenue 3.3 % 3.8 % 4.0 % As a percentage of total revenue, depreciation and amortization decreased in 2011 and 2010 as a result of the benefit of higher average restaurant sales on a partially fixed cost base. 31 Table of Contents Interest and Other Expense For the years endedDecember 31 %increase2011 over2010 %increase2010 over2009 2011 2010 2009 (dollars in millions) Interest and other expense $ 2.9 $ 0.0 $ 0.0 * * * not meaningful Interest and other expense increased in 2011 due to a loss recognized in the second quarter on our investment in ANGR Holdings, LLC, which operated the restaurants awarded on the television program Americas Next Great Restaurant prior to their closure. The recognized losses represent the entire amount of our investment. Income Tax Provision For the years endedDecember 31 %increase2011 over2010 %increase2010 over2009 2011 2010 2009 (dollars in millions) Income tax provision $ 134.8 $ 110.1 $ 77.4 22.4 % 42.3 % Effective tax rate 38.5 % 38.1 % 37.9 % The 2011 effective tax rate increased primarily due to an increase in the state rate, smaller benefit from food donations and one time adjustments partially offset by the one time employment tax credits. We estimate our 2012 annual effective tax rate will be 39.3%. However, if certain federal tax credits weve benefitted from in 2011 are renewed by Congress, we estimate our annual effective tax rate would be lower by up to 0.4%. The 2010 effective tax rate increased primarily due to a one time benefit recognized in 2009 for prior period meals and entertainment deductions. Quarterly Financial Data/Seasonality The following table presents consolidated statement of income data for each of the eight quarters in the period ended December 31, 2011. The operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results for any subsequent quarter. 2011 Quarters Ended Mar. 31 June 30 Sept. 30 Dec. 31 (dollars in millions) Revenue $ 509.4 $ 571.6 $ 591.9 $ 596.7 Operating income $ 74.8 $ 83.9 $ 98.0 $ 93.9 Net income $ 46.4 $ 50.7 $ 60.4 $ 57.5 Number of restaurants opened in quarter 12 39 32 67 Comparable restaurant sales increase 12.4 % 10.0 % 11.3 % 11.1 % 2010 Quarters Ended Mar. 31 June 30 Sept. 30 Dec. 31 (dollars in millions) Revenue $ 409.7 $ 466.8 $ 476.9 $ 482.5 Operating income $ 61.3 $ 75.0 $ 77.6 $ 73.9 Net income $ 37.8 $ 46.5 $ 48.2 $ 46.4 Number of restaurants opened in quarter 20 25 22 62 Comparable restaurant sales increase 4.3 % 8.7 % 11.4 % 12.6 % Seasonal factors cause our profitability to fluctuate from quarter to quarter. Historically, our average daily restaurant sales and net income are lower in the first and fourth quarters due, in part, to the holiday season and because fewer people eat out during periods of inclement weather (the winter months) than during periods of 32 Table of Contents mild or warm weather (the spring, summer and fall months). Other factors also have a seasonal effect on our results. For example, restaurants located near colleges and universities generally do more business during the academic year. The number of trading days in a quarter can also affect our results. Overall, on an annual basis, changes in trading dates do not have a significant impact on our results. Our quarterly results are also affected by other factors such as the number of new restaurants opened in a quarter and unanticipated events. New restaurants typically have lower margins following opening as a result of the expenses associated with opening new restaurants and their operating inefficiencies in the months immediately following opening. In addition, unanticipated events also impact our results. Accordingly, results for a particular quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary liquidity and capital requirements are for new restaurant construction, working capital and general corporate needs. We have a cash and short term investment balance of $456.2 million that we expect to utilize, along with cash flow from operations, to provide capital to support the growth of our business (primarily through opening restaurants), to repurchase up to an additional $106.6 million of our common stock subject to market conditions, to continue to maintain our existing restaurants and for general corporate purposes. We also have a long term investments balance of $128.2 million, which consists of U.S. treasury notes and certificate of deposit products with maturities of 13 months to approximately 2 years. We believe that cash from operations, together with our cash balance, will be enough to meet ongoing capital expenditures, working capital requirements and other cash needs for the foreseeable future. We havent required significant working capital because customers generally pay using cash or credit and debit cards and because our operations do not require significant receivables, nor do they require significant inventories due, in part, to our use of various fresh ingredients. In addition, we generally have the right to pay for the purchase of food, beverage and supplies some time after the receipt of those items, generally within ten days, thereby reducing the need for incremental working capital to support our growth. While operations continue to provide cash, our primary use of cash is in new restaurant development. Our total capital expenditures for 2011 were $151.1 million, and we expect to incur capital expenditures of about $160 million to $170 million in 2012, of which $138 million relates to our construction of new restaurants before any reductions for landlord reimbursements, and the remainder primarily relates to restaurant reinvestments. In 2011, we spent on average about $800,000 in development and construction costs per restaurant, net of landlord reimbursements. The average development and construction costs per restaurant decreased from about $850,000 in 2009 due to cost savings realized, in part, from certain cost reduction efforts associated with the development of the A Model strategy and our new, simpler restaurant design. For new restaurants to be opened in 2012 we anticipate average development costs to be similar to 2011. Contractual Obligations Our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2011 were as follows: Payments Due by Period Total 1 year 2 3 years 4 5 years After5 years (in thousands) Operating leases $ 2,116,395 $ 133,813 $ 271,911 $ 275,512 $ 1,435,159 Deemed landlord financing 5,898 394 788 821 3,895 Other contractual obligations(1) 73,455 69,370 4,085 Total contractual cash obligations $ 2,195,748 $ 203,577 $ 276,784 $ 276,333 $ 1,439,054 (1) We enter into various purchase obligations in the ordinary course of business. Those that are binding primarily relate to amounts owed under contractor and subcontractor agreements, orders submitted for equipment for restaurants under construction, and corporate sponsorships. 33 Table of Contents Were obligated under non cancelable leases for our restaurants and administrative offices. Our leases generally have initial terms of either five to ten years with two or more five year extensions, for end cap and in line restaurants, or 15 to 20 years with several five year extensions, for free standing restaurants. Our leases generally require us to pay a proportionate share of real estate taxes, insurance, common charges and other operating costs. Some restaurant leases provide for contingent rental payments based on sales thresholds, although we generally do not expect to pay significant contingent rent on these properties based on the thresholds in those leases. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, we had no off balance sheet arrangements or obligations. Inflation The primary areas of our operations affected by inflation are food, labor, fuel, utility costs, materials used in the construction of our restaurants, and insurance. Although almost all of our crew members make more than the minimum wage, increases in the applicable federal or state minimum wage may have an impact on our labor costs. Additionally, many of our leases require us to pay taxes, maintenance, utilities and insurance, all of which are generally subject to inflationary increases. Critical Accounting Estimates We describe our significant accounting policies in Note 1 of our consolidated financial statements. Critical accounting estimates are those that we believe are both significant and that require us to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often because we need to estimate the effect of inherently uncertain matters. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experiences and various other factors that we believe to be appropriate under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates, and we might obtain different estimates if we used different assumptions or factors. We believe the following critical accounting estimates affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements: Leases We lease most of our restaurant locations. Our leases contain escalating rentals over the lease term as well as optional renewal periods. We account for our leases by recognizing rent expense on a straight line basis over the lease term including reasonably assured renewal periods. We have estimated that our lease term, including reasonably assured renewal periods, is the lesser of the lease term or 20 years. If the estimate of our reasonably assured lease terms were changed our depreciation and rent expense could differ materially. Stock based Compensation We recognize compensation expense for equity awards over the vesting period based on the awards fair value. We use the Black Scholes valuation model to determine the fair value of our stock only stock appreciation rights, or SOSARs, which requires assumptions to be made regarding our stock price volatility, the expected life of the award and expected dividend rates. The volatility and expected life assumptions were based on our historical data. Similarly, the compensation expense of performance share awards and SOSARs with performance based vesting conditions is based in part on the estimated probability of our achieving levels of performance associated with particular levels of payout for performance shares and with vesting for performance SOSARs. We determine the probability of achievement of future levels of performance by comparing the relevant performance level with our internal estimates of future performance. Those estimates are based on a number of assumptions, and different assumptions may have resulted in different conclusions regarding the probability of our achieving future levels of performance relevant to the payout levels for the awards. Had we arrived at different assumptions of stock price volatility or expected lives of our SOSARs, or different assumptions regarding the probability of our achieving future levels of performance with respect to performance share awards and performance SOSARs, our stock based compensation expense and results of operations could have been different. 34 Table of Contents Insurance Liability We maintain various insurance policies for workers compensation, general liability and auto damage with varying deductibles as high as $500,000, and for property which has a $1 million deductible. We are self insured for employee health but have third party insurance coverage to limit exposure to these claims. We record a liability that represents our estimated cost of claims incurred and unpaid as of the balance sheet date. Our estimated liability is not discounted and is based on a number of assumptions and factors, including historical trends, actuarial assumptions and economic conditions, and is closely monitored and adjusted when warranted by changing circumstances. In addition, our history of claims experience is short and our significant growth rate could affect the accuracy of estimates based on historical experience. Should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what was estimated or medical costs increase beyond what was expected, our accrued liabilities might not be sufficient and additional expenses may be recorded. Actual claims experience could also be more favorable than estimated, which would result in expense reductions. Unanticipated changes may produce materially different amounts of expense than that reported under these programs. The total estimated insurance liabilities as of December 31, 2011 were $21.7 million. Reserves/Contingencies for Litigation and Other Matters We are involved in various claims and legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of business. These actions are subject to many uncertainties, and we cannot predict the outcomes with any degree of certainty. Consequently, we were unable to ascertain the ultimate aggregate amount of monetary liability or financial impact with respect to these matters as of December 31, 2011 and 2010. Once resolved, however, these actions may affect our operating results and cash flows. Unredeemed Gift Card Balances We sell gift cards which do not have an expiration date and from which we do not deduct non usage fees. We recognize revenue from gift cards when: (i) the gift card is redeemed by the customer; or (ii) the likelihood of the gift card being redeemed by the customer is remote (gift card breakage) and we determine that there is not a legal obligation to remit the unredeemed gift cards to the relevant jurisdiction. The determination of the gift card breakage rate is based upon company specific historical redemption patterns. Gift card breakage is recognized in revenue as the gift cards are used on a pro rata basis over a period of six months beginning at the date of the gift card sale. We have determined 5% of gift card sales will not be redeemed and will be retained by us. Any future revisions to the estimated breakage rate may result in changes in the amount of breakage revenue recognized in future periods. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK Changing Interest Rates Were exposed to interest rate risk through fluctuations of interest rates on our investments. Changes in interest rates affect the interest income we earn, and therefore impact our cash flows and results of operations. As of December 31, 2011, we had $382.8 million in investments, including a trust account classified in other assets, and $204.0 million in FDIC insured accounts with an earnings credit we classify as interest income, which combined earned a weighted average interest rate of 0.36%. Commodity Price Risks We are also exposed to commodity price risks. Many of the ingredients we use to prepare our food, as well as our packaging materials, are commodities or ingredients that are affected by the price of other commodities, exchange rates, foreign demand, weather, seasonality, production, availability and other factors outside our control. We work closely with our suppliers and use a mix of forward pricing protocols under which we agree with our supplier on fixed prices for deliveries at some time in the future, fixed pricing protocols under which we agree on a fixed price with our supplier for the duration of that protocol, and formula pricing protocols under which the prices we pay are based on a specified formula related to the prices of the goods, such as spot prices. 35 Table of Contents However, a portion of the dollar value of goods purchased by us is effectively at spot prices. Generally our pricing protocols with suppliers can remain in effect for periods ranging from one to 18 months, depending on the outlook for prices of the particular ingredient. In several cases, we have minimum purchase obligations. Weve tried to increase, where necessary, the number of suppliers for our ingredients, which we believe can help mitigate pricing volatility, and we follow industry news, trade issues, exchange rates, foreign demand, weather, crises and other world events that may affect our ingredient prices. Increases in ingredient prices could adversely affect our results if we choose not to increase menu prices at the same pace for competitive or other reasons. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk A portion of our operations consist of activities outside of the U.S. and we have currency risk on the transactions in other currencies and translation adjustments resulting from the conversion of our international financial results into the U.S. dollar. However, a substantial majority of our operations and investment activities are transacted in the U.S. and therefore our foreign currency risk is limited at this date. 36 Table of Contents
