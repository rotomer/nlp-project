ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION FINANCIAL OVERVIEW In 2001 Cummins had a net loss of $102 million, or $2.66 per share, on sales of $5.7 billion. Results, however, included a net after tax charge of $84 million for costs associated with restructuring actions and asset impairment write downs. Excluding this charge, Cummins net loss would have been $18 million, or $.47 per share. Earnings before interest and income taxes was a $42 million loss. Excluding the charge, earnings before interest and taxes would have been $83 million. In comparison, 2000 results were net earnings of $8 million, or $.20 per share, on sales of $6.6 billion. Results in 2000 also included a net after tax charge of $103 million for restructuring actions and asset impairment write downs. Excluding these charges, Cummins net earnings would have been $111 million and earnings before interest and income taxes would have been $249 million. As reported, 2000 earnings before interest and taxes were $89 mill ion. In 1999, Cummins results were net earnings of $160 million, or $4.13 per share, on sales of $6.6 billion. Results in 1999 included a $45 million net after tax charge for costs associated with the dissolution of the W&auml;rtsil&auml; joint venture. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Net Sales In 2001 Cummins net sales were $5.7 billion compared to $6.6 billion in 2000 and $6.6 billion in 1999. The net sales decrease of $.9 billion is attributable to a reduction in Engine Business sales which declined 23 percent compared to 2000 and 26 percent compared to 1999. Revenues from the Engine Business were 55 percent of net sales in 2001 compared to 61 percent in 2000 and 64 percent in 1999. The decrease in Engine Business sales resulted primarily from lower shipments to North American OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) which were effected by the sharp downturn in the North American automotive industry and construction markets. The Companys reporting structure is organized primarily by the markets served and secondarily by products and geographical territories. In the fourth quarter of 2001, Cummins realigned its reporting structure and created a new business segment, International Distributor Business, as a result of the size and growing importance of the retail distribution business. Previously, the retail distribution business had been combined within the Filtration and Other Business segment. Accordingly, certain historical business segment data has been restated and reclassified to reflect this change. A more complete disclosure of information regarding the Companys business segments can be found in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Companys net sales for each of its four operating segments during the last three years were: $ Millions 2001 2000 1999 Engine $3,121 $4,050 $4,225 Power Generation 1,422 1,395 1,356 Filtration and Other 889 902 863 International Distributor 562 555 491 Elimination of intersegment revenue (313) (305) (296) $5,681 $6,597 $6,639 Page 14 Engine Business Cummins Engine Business shipped 284,200 engines in 2001, down 108,500 units or 28 percent, compared to 2000 and down 113,800 units, or 29 percent, compared to 1999. A summary of unit shipments by engine classification during the last three years follows: Unit shipments 2001 2000 1999 Midrange 231,900 302,400 283,300 Heavy duty 48,200 86,300 111,500 High horsepower 4,100 4,000 3,200 284,200 392,700 398,000 Cummins Engine Business, the Companys largest business segment, produces engines and parts for sale to customers in automotive and industrial markets. Engine Business customers are serviced through the Companys direct sales and service departments of its worldwide distribution network. The engines are used in trucks of all sizes, buses and recreational vehicles, as well as a variety of industrial applications including construction, mining, agriculture, marine, rail and military. Engine Business revenues were $3.1 billion in 2001, down $.9 billion or 23 percent below 2000 and down $1.1 billion or 26 percent lower than 1999. A summary of Engine Business sales by market application during the last three years follows: $ Millions 2001 2000 1999 Heavy duty Truck $ 940 $1,444 $1,790 Medium duty Truck and Bus 577 662 637 Light duty Automotive 576 830 776 Industrial 748 873 839 High horsepower Industrial 280 241 183 $3,121 $4,050 $4,225 Heavy duty Truck Sales to the heavy duty truck market declined $504 million, or 35 percent below 2000 and 47 percent below 1999 sales levels reflecting the continued downturn in the North American trucking industry characterized by high inventory levels of new and used trucks. Unit shipments in 2001 to the North American heavy duty truck market were 44 percent lower than the previous year and 57 percent lower than 1999. Medium duty Truck and Bus Sales to the medium duty truck and bus market declined $85 million, or 13 percent below 2000 sales and were down $60 million, or 9 percent, from 1999 sales levels. A majority of the sales decrease is attributable to medium duty truck engines, reflecting lower market conditions in the North American truck industry. Engine sales to the bus market were essentially level compared to 2000 but were 43 percent higher than 1999, primarily from increased sales to international markets which were up 26 percent over 2000 levels. Light duty Automotive Sales of $576 million in the light duty automotive market were down $254 million or 31 percent less than 2000 sales and 26 percent below 1999 sales. Shipments to DaimlerChrysler AG for the Dodge Ram pickup declined 36 percent and 25 percent below shipments in 2000 and 1999, respectively. While the light duty automotive market has also experienced a downturn, volumes were primarily impacted by production constraints preceding the 2002 model changeover at DaimlerChrysler AG. Engine revenues from the recreational vehicle market were down 7 percent while unit shipments were down 15 percent compared to 2000 and down 25 percent compared to 1999. Industrial Sales of engines to the construction, marine and agricultural markets were down 14 percent compared to 2000 and 11 percent compared to 1999. Most of the decline was in the construction market where sales were down 18 percent compared to 2000 and 1999 as OEMs adjusted production schedules for lower volumes. Marine sales were down 8 percent compared to 2000 but up 4 percent over 1999 sales levels. Engine sales to the agricultural equipment market were down 2 percent, compared to an increase of 10 percent in 1999. Page 15 High horsepower Industrial Sales of high horsepower engines to the mining, rail and government markets were $280 million, an increase of 16 percent compared to 2000 and up 53 percent over 1999 levels. Unit shipments were up 3 percent compared to 2000 but increased 28 percent compared to 1999 reflecting a change in sales mix to higher priced units as the Company continues to gain market share in the mining sector of high horsepower engines. Engine sales to government contractors were down 20 percent compared to 2000 and were essentially flat with 1999. Sales to the rail car market, comprised largely of European and Asia demand, increased 38 percent over 2000 and have more than doubled since 1999. Power Generation Business Revenues of $1.4 billion in 2001 for the Power Generation Business were 2 percent higher than in 2000 and 5 percent higher than in 1999. Sales of the Companys generator sets in 2001 were up 9 percent compared to 2000 and up 10 percent compared to 1999. Sales of generator drive engines to generator assemblers were down 9 percent from the prior year but increased 7 percent from 1999. Alternator sales decreased 2 percent as compared to 2000 and were down 13 percent compared to 1999. Sales of small generator sets for recreational vehicles and other consumer applications were down 7 percent compared to last year and down 6 percent from 1999. Power generation revenues in North America were down slightly compared to the prior year. Sales to international areas were up 6 percent compared to 2000, primarily in Latin America and Brazil offset by lower demand in Australia and Southeast Asia. Filtration and Other Business Sales of $889 million in 2001 for this business were down slightly from 2000 sales of $902 million but were up 3 percent over 1999 sales of $863 million. Sales of filtration products in 2001 were down 4 percent compared to 2000 primarily reflecting lower demand for OEM truck and construction products as well as reduced sales to small engine and equipment manufacturers. Sales of Holset turbochargers, which are included in this segment, increased 16 percent over the prior year, primarily due to higher sales in Europe and China. International Distributor Business Cummins presently owns 17 distributorships covering geographical territories in over 25 countries with all distributorship locations reported in this segment outside of the United States. Sales of Cummins owned international distributorships, which are engaged in the sale of engines, generator sets, service parts and service and repair activity on Cummins products, increased slightly during 2000 and were up 14 percent over 1999. Geographic Markets The Companys net sales by geographic region for each of the last three years were: $ Millions 2001 2000 1999 United States $3,045 $3,775 $4,064 Asia/Australia 901 905 818 Europe/CIS 832 860 800 Mexico/Latin America 471 451 375 Canada 303 418 473 Africa/Middle East 129 188 109 $5,681 $6,597 $6,639 Sales to international markets represented 46 percent of Cummins revenues in 2001, compared to 43 percent in 2000 and 39 percent in 1999. Asia/Australia sales, comprising 16 percent of total sales in 2001 and 34 percent of total international sales, were basically level compared to 2000 and up 10 percent compared to 1999. Sales to China increased 11 percent, largely driven by higher bus engine sales, sales to Korea declined 16 percent, and sales to Japan and Southeast Asia were down 8 percent. Power generation sales to the Asia/Australia markets were down 7 percent from 2000. Europe and CIS sales (Commonwealth of Independent States), representing 15 percent of Cummins 2001 sales, were down 3 percent compared to 2000 and were 4 percent higher than 1999. Power generation sales to the Europe/CIS market were unchanged from the prior year. Sales to Mexico/Latin America were up 4 percent over 2000 and up 26 percent over 1999 mainly from increased demand for power generation equipment in Brazil while heavy duty and medium duty engine sales declined in this market. Business in Canada, representing 5 percent of Cummins 2001 sales were down 28 percent compared to 2000 resulting from the downturn in the North American heavy duty truck market. Sales to Africa/Middle East, representing 2 percent of sales in 2001, declined $59 million, or 31 percent compared to 2000. A majority of the decrease in the Africa/Middle East market was attributable to lower sales in Turkey. Page 16 Gross Margin Cummins gross margin was $1.0 billion in 2001, $1.3 billion in 2000 and $1.4 billion in 1999 with related gross margin percentage of 18.0 percent, 19.1 percent and 21.4 percent, respectively. The most significant factors affecting the Companys gross margin percentage in 2001 and 2000 were lower absorption of fixed manufacturing costs in the Engine Business as a result of declining sales volumes and changes in product mix. The effect of lower sales volumes had an unfavorable impact on gross margin of approximately $230 million, or 4 percent of net sales, in 2001. Partially offsetting the volume shortfall were benefits from the Companys cost reduction efforts and lower product coverage costs during 2001. Product coverage costs were 3.4 percent of net sales in 2001 compared to 4.2 percent in 2000 and 3.7 percent in 1999. Operating Expenses Selling, Administrative, Research and Engineering Expenses Total selling, administrative, research and engineering expenses declined $72 million or 7 percent compared to 2000 and were down $78 million or 8 percent compared to 1999. Selling and administrative expenses were $728 million in 2001, down $48 million or 6 percent lower than 2000 expenses and down $53 million, or 7 percent below 1999 expenses. A majority of the decrease in selling and administrative expenses resulted from the Companys cost reduction efforts, including the benefits of restructuring actions over the last two years and lower spending across all business segments. Research and engineering expenses were $220 million, down $24 million, or 10 percent, compared to 2000. Compared to 1999, expenses decreased $25 million, or 10 percent. Most of the reduction in research and engineering expenses was a result of ongoing cost reduction efforts and the discontinuance of a new engine development program, partially offset by increased costs for heavy duty engineering projects and expenses related to 2002 emissions standards compliance. Results of Joint Ventures and Alliances The Companys earnings from joint ventures and alliances were $10 million in 2001, compared to earnings of $9 million in 2000 and losses of $28 million in 1999. The improvement in earnings over 1999 resulted from the dissolution of the W&auml;rtsil&auml; joint venture in the fourth quarter of 1999. Total revenue from Cummins joint ventures and alliances was $1.4 billion in 2001 compared to $1.5 billion in 2000 and $1.3 billion in 1999. In April 2001, Cummins formed a joint venture with Westport Innovations, located in British Columbia, to develop and market low emissions, high performance natural gas engines for on highway, industrial and power generation markets. In May 2001, Cummins Power Generations Newage International subsidiary formed a joint venture with AvK/SEG. The partnership offers the worlds broadest range of industrial alternators from 0.5 kvA to 30,000 kvA. A more complete financial summary of joint ventures and alliances is included in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Interest Expense Interest expense of $76 million in 2001 was $10 million lower than 2000 and $1 million higher than in 1999. Lower borrowing levels as a result of the preferred securities issuance and reduced interest rates in 2001 accounted for the decrease from 2000. Increased borrowings and lower capitalization of interest accounted for the increase as compared to 1999. Interest payments for 2001, 2000 and 1999 are disclosed in a separate caption in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Other (Income) Expense Other (income) expense netted to zero in 2001 compared to $1 million income in 2000 and $8 million expense in 1999. Other (income) and expense includes the results of several different transactions including amortization of intangibles, foreign currency exchange, interest income, royalty income, gains or losses on the sale of businesses and other miscellaneous items. The major components of other (income) expense are disclosed in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Page 17 Restructuring, Asset Impairment and Other Charges Beginning in the second half of 2000, Cummins experienced a decline in demand for its products in several North American end markets. These markets included heavy duty trucks, medium duty trucks, construction equipment and a number of consumer demand driven segments such as the Dodge Ram pickup truck, recreational vehicles, and exhaust systems for off road recreational and lawn equipment. In response to the downturn and continuing market deterioration, Cummins announced a fourth quarter restructuring program designed to consolidate operations and reduce costs. The program resulted in a $160 million pre tax charge ($103 million after tax). The restructuring program focused largely (but not exclusively) on the Companys Engine Business segment and included charges for workforce reductions, asset write downs of certain equipment related to heavy duty engine production and information technology software and other costs associated with closing, consolidating or exit ing a number of smaller businesses. The Company expects the restructuring actions to result in annual savings of approximately $55 million upon completion. In the second quarter of 2001, as a result of the further downturn in the North American trucking industry and other markets and the decision to terminate the development of a new engine program, the company announced further restructuring actions and recorded charges of $125 million ($84 million after tax). The charges were attributable to workforce reduction actions, asset impairment charges related to tooling and investment in the new engine development program and charges to divest a small business operation. The Company expects to complete these restructuring actions in 2002 and expects benefits of $35 million upon completion. A more complete discussion and disclosure of the Companys restructuring actions during the last three years is included in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Provision for Income Taxes The Companys income tax provision in 2001 was a benefit of $42 million, combining a negative effective tax rate of 17 percent from operations and an effective tax rate of 33 percent from restructuring charges. The effective tax rate from operations in 2001 reflected reduced taxes on export sales, research tax credits and dividends on preferred securities, which are deductible as interest expense for federal tax purposes. In 2000, the Companys tax benefit was $19 million, reflecting an effective tax rate from operations of 23 percent and an effective tax rate of 35 percent from restructuring charges. In 1999, the Companys tax provision was $55 million, reflecting an effective tax rate of 25 percent for both operations and restructuring charges. Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements contains a more complete disclosure of the Companys income taxes. The amount of income taxes paid in 2001, 2000 and 1999 is disclosed in the Con solidated Statement of Cash Flows. Minority Interest Minority interest in Cummins net earnings of consolidated entities was $15 million in 2001, an increase of $1 million from 2000 and an increase of $9 million from 1999. The increase from 2000 was primarily due to higher earnings attributable to minority partners of Cummins India Limited and improved performance from the Companys fuel systems joint venture with Scania. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Since fiscal 2000, the Company has made a strategic effort to reduce its borrowings, improve its cost structure and improve efficiencies from continuing operations through monetization of assets and restructuring actions. As a result, Cummins management has undertaken various initiatives to improve cash flow, reduce debt obligations and improve financial flexibility during that period. During the fourth quarter of 2000, the Company entered into a receivable securitization program which provides a cost effective method to fund trade accounts receivables. This program diversifies the companys funding base by providing a flexible source of funding that is not reported on the Companys balance sheet. Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements contains a more complete description of the securitization program and discloses certain cash flows related to the program. Page 18 In the second quarter of 2001, Cummins Capital Trust, a wholly owned subsidiary, issued 6 million shares of cumulative convertible preferred securities subject to mandatory redemption. The net proceeds from the issuance, $291 million, were used to repay outstanding indebtedness under the Companys revolving credit agreement. Dividends on the preferred securities are payable at an annual rate of 7% of the $50 liquidation preference on March 15, June 15, September 15 and December 15 of each year or approximately $5.3 million in each quarter. A complete description of the preferred securities is disclosed in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. During the second and third quarters of 2001, the Company entered into three sale leaseback agreements whereby it sold certain manufacturing equipment and aircraft and received $143 million in proceeds from the transactions. The leases were accounted for as operating leases. Proceeds from the transactions were used to reduce indebtedness and fund working capital requirements. Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements contains a description of the sale leaseback transactions. During 2000 and 2001, the Company recorded significant charges to restructure its operations, largely focused in the Engine Business. These actions and the resulting charges were taken in response to the downturn in the North American trucking industry and related conditions and included workforce reductions, asset impairment losses, termination of a new engine development program and other charges. Total cash outflows associated with these actions approximated $104 million, the majority of which has already been expended. The associated annual savings of these restructuring actions are estimated at $90 million upon completion. Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements describes in more detail the restructuring actions the Company has taken during the last three years. Cummins operations have historically generated sufficient cash to fund its businesses, capital expenditures and dividend payments. Cash provided by continuing operations is a major source of working capital funding. At certain times, the Companys cash provided by operations is subject to seasonal fluctuations, and as a result, periodic borrowings are used to fund working capital requirements. The Company has available various short and long term bank credit arrangements which are more fully disclosed in Note 6 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. These credit arrangements and the receivable securitization program provide the financial flexibility Cummins requires to satisfy future short and long term funding requirements. Key elements of the Companys cash flows for the last three years follows: $ Millions 2001 2000 1999 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 144 $ 388 $ 307 Net cash used in investing activities (86) (312) (166) Net cash used in financing activities (27) (86) (105) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash (1) (2) Net change in cash $ 30 $ (12) $ 36 Net cash provided by operating activities was $144 million for 2001 compared with $388 million for 2000 and $307 million for 1999. The decrease was largely due to the decline in net earnings, repayment of funding under the receivable securitization program and a reduction in accounts payable and accrued expenses offset by a reduction in inventory. Cash flows provided by the reduction in receivables was $202 million and net of the $164 million securitization repayment, was $38 million in 2001 compared to $273 million in the prior year. Net cash used in investing activities was $86 million in 2001, down $226 million from 2000 and down $80 million from 1999. Most of the decline in cash used in investing activities was a result of $143 million cash inflows from the sale and leaseback transactions and a reduction in business acquisitions in 2001 compared to 2000. In 2000, the Company acquired a distributorship in South Africa and purchased assets from the dissolved W&auml;rtsil&auml; joint venture. Capital expenditures in 2001 decreased $22 million compared to 2000 and $9 million below 1999 as the Company reduced spending levels to improve cash flows. Net cash used in financing activities was $27 million in 2001 compared to $86 million in 2000 and $105 million in 1999. Cash uses were for dividend payments and payments on borrowings reduced by proceeds from the preferred securities issuance. Net payments on borrowings were $257 million in 2001 as the Company used proceeds from the preferred securities issuance to reduce indebtedness. The Company did not repurchase any of its common stock during 2001. As a result, the amount of cash used in financing activities was reduced compared to common stock repurchases of $16 million in 2000 and $34 million in 1999. Cash and cash equivalents increased $30 million during the year and were $92 million at the end of 2001. Based on projected cash flows from operations and existing credit facilities, management believes the Company has available sufficient liquidity to meet anticipated capital, debt and dividend requirements in the foreseeable future. Page 19 CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS A summary of payments due by period of the Companys contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of December 31, 2001 are shown in the tables below. A more complete description of these obligations and commitments is included in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements as referenced below. Contractual Cash Obligations $ Millions 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 After 2006 Total Loans payable $ 21 $ $ $ $ 21 Long term debt 7 140 243 529 919 Capital lease obligations 2 2 1 5 Operating leases 64 105 75 180 424 Preferred Securities of Subsidiary Trust 291 291 $ 94 $ 247 $ 319 $1,000 $1,660 Other Commercial Commitments $ Millions Standby letters of credit $ 20 $ $ $ $ 20 Guarantees 75 75 $ 95 $ $ $ $ 95 The above contractual obligations contain financial covenants that require the Company to maintain certain financial ratios and minimum net worth levels as defined in the agreements, and minimum credit ratings related to the Companys unsecured debt. Several of the agreements covering bank loans, credit agreements and leases contain rating triggers, which typically provide creditors with certain rights in the event that Cummins credit ratings change to predetermined levels. These rights include but are not limited to increases in loan pricing and requirements to provide letters of credit. Following is a discussion of Cummins financial arrangements that contain rating triggers. Accounts receivable securitization program This short term financing arrangement requires Cummins to maintain a minimum investment grade credit rating for its long term unsecured debt. Should events cause Cummins credit ratings to be lowered below investment grade, lenders would no longer be obligated to provide future funds against the Companys receivable balance. The program would be discontinued as the receivables are collected and lenders repaid. As of December 31, 2001, $55 million was funded under this program. A more complete disclosure of this program is disclosed in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Financing arrangements for independent distributors Cummins is a guarantor for certain independent distributors revolving loans, term loans and leases in excess of a specified borrowing base. The financing arrangement for U.S. distributors requires Cummins to maintain a minimum investment grade credit rating for its long term unsecured debt. Should events cause Cummins credit ratings to be lowered below investment grade, the lending institutions would no longer be obligated to provide funding to U.S. distributors under the current terms of the agreement. As of December 31, 2001, the amount of Cummins guarantee related to financing arrangements for U.S distributors was $30 million. The amount of guarantees related to financing arrangements for international distributors, which is not affected by rating triggers, is $19 million. The Company maintains a $500 million revolving credit agreement with a group of banks. The interest rate applicable to borrowings under the agreement is based on the Companys credit rating. Should events cause Cummins credit rating to be lowered, the Company would experience an increase in interest rates under this agreement. As of December 31, 2001, there were no outstanding borrowings under this agreement. Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements contains a more complete description of Cummins revolving credit agreement. Equipment sale leaseback In 2001, Cummins entered into a sale leaseback agreement whereby it sold certain manufacturing equipment and leased it back under an operating lease. The agreement requires Cummins to maintain a minimum investment grade credit rating. Should events cause Cummins credit rating to be lowered below investment grade, the Company is required to obtain irrevocable, unconditional standby letters of credit up to $50 million which shall continue until the Company has maintained a minimum investment grade credit rating for 12 consecutive months. The equipment sale leaseback transaction is disclosed in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Page 20 Legal/Environmental Matters The Company and its subsidiaries are defendants in a number of pending legal actions that arise in the normal course of business, including environmental claims and actions related to use and performance of the Companys products. Such matters are more fully described in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In the event the Company is determined to be liable for damages in connection with such actions or proceedings, the unreserved portion of any such liability is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Companys results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. Market Risk The Company is exposed to financial risk resulting from changes in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. This risk is closely monitored and managed through the use of financial instruments including interest rate swaps, options, forwards and other derivative contracts. As clearly stated in the Companys policies and procedures, financial instruments are used expressly for hedging purposes, and under no circumstances are they used for speculative purposes. Transactions are only entered into with banking institutions that have strong credit ratings, and thus the credit risk associated with these transactions is not considered significant. The results and status of hedging transactions are reported to senior management on a monthly and quarterly basis. Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements contains further information regarding financial instruments and risk management. The following describes the Companys risk exposures and provides results of sensitivity analyses performed on December 31, 2001. The sensitivity tests assumed instantaneous, parallel shifts in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rate yield curves and commodity prices. Foreign Exchange Rates Cummins is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk as a result of its international business presence. The Company transacts extensively in foreign currencies and has significant assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. As a result, corporate earnings experience some volatility related to movements in foreign currency exchange rates. In order to benefit from global diversification and naturally offsetting currency positions, foreign exchange balance sheet exposures are aggregated and hedged at the corporate level primarily through the use of foreign exchange forward contracts. The objective of the hedging program is to reduce the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on earnings resulting from the translation of net foreign exchange balance sheet positions. A uniform 10 percent adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar would decrease net earnings by approximately $5 million for the year ending December 31, 2001. The sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates ignores the impact of foreign exchange movements on Cummins competitive position, potential changes in sales levels and the offsetting impact on income of the revaluation of the underlying balance sheet exposures. Interest Rates The Company is also exposed to interest rate risk as result of its indebtedness. The Companys objectives in managing its exposure to changes in interests rates are to limit the effect of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower the overall cost of borrowing funds. To achieve its objectives, the Company primarily uses interest rate swap agreements to manage exposure to interest rate changes related to its borrowing arrangements. A uniform 10 percent increase in interest rates, which would remain fixed at the new, higher level for a one year period, would result in a decrease in net earnings of $2 million. This sensitivity analysis does not consider the change in the Companys competitive environment indirectly related to changes in interest rates and managements response to these changes. Commodity Prices The Company is also exposed to fluctuations in commodity prices through the purchase of raw materials as well as contractual agreements with component suppliers. Given the historical volatility of commodity prices, this exposure can significantly impact product costs. To reduce the effect of changing raw material prices for select commodities, Cummins has entered into commodity swap agreements to hedge a portion of its anticipated raw material purchases on selected commodities. A uniform 10 percent increase in the price of commodities covered by commodity swap agreements, with prices then remaining fixed for a 12 month period, would result in a decrease of net earnings of $1 million. Page 21 Disclosure Regarding Forward looking Statements This annual report and the Companys press releases, teleconferences and other external communications contain forward looking statements that are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the industries in which Cummins operates and managements beliefs and assumptions. Words, such as "expects," "anticipates," "intends," "plans," "believes," "seeks," "estimates," variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions ("Future Factors") which are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in such forward looking statements.
