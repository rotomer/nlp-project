Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Restatement of Previously Issued Financial Statements The Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations set forth in this Item 7 has been revised to reflect the restatement of the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements for the years 2001 and 2000 and certain events occurring subsequent to the original due date for filing this 2002 Annual Report on Form 10 K. In addition, we have updated our disclosure with respect to recently issued accounting standards. On April 14, 2003, we announced that we had determined that our previously issued financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 2001 would require restatement and reaudit. The restatement was necessary to correct prior period accounting errors related primarily to unreconciled accounts payable accounts at two of our manufacturing locations, the majority of which 18 were associated with the integration of a new enterprise resource planning system into our accounting processes. We were required to have these restated financial statements audited by our current auditors, since Arthur Andersen LLP, our predecessor auditor for the years subject to restatement, had ceased operations. The restatement and reaudit of our financial statements included a comprehensive review of the accounting records underlying our financial statements for the related periods. The accompanying financial statements reflect adjustments made to our previously reported information as a result of this comprehensive review and the work performed during the restatement and reaudit process in order to correct accounting errors primarily associated with the period of accounting recognition. We have segregated these adjustments into the following categories: 1.Adjustments stemming from the unreconciled accounts at our manufacturing locations referred to above. These errors resulted from deficiencies in our control processes to identify and resolve the reconciliation issues in a timely manner. 2.Adjustments related to the correction of accounting errors previously recorded in the period management identified the error. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and SAB 99 permit these types of adjustments to be recorded in the period errors are identified to the extent they are not deemed material for purposes of restating prior period financial statements. The most significant items in this category are related to the reconciliation of certain intercompany accounts and other clearing or suspense accounts associated with receivables, accounts payable and accrued payroll. As a result of the restatement, management has now reflected these items in the periods to which they relate. 3.Other adjustments to correct errors were identified during the restatement process and have been categorized and summarized as follows: a.Revisions to various accounts (primarily reserve and accrual accounts) that relate to significant estimates, uncertainties and judgments where the original amount was either calculated incorrectly or documentation directly supporting the original amount could not be located. The most significant items in this category include adjustments to obligations associated with marketing programs, inventory overhead cost capitalization and product liability reserves. b.Adjustments to certain accounts to achieve proper and consistent application of GAAP throughout our organization. For example, this category includes adjustments for liabilities or reserves not recorded by certain of our locations that are required by US GAAP. The most significant item in this category relates to the omission of an accrual for long term variable incentive compensation in 2001. This category also includes adjustments related to the calculation of expense for certain non US subsidiary defined benefit pension plans in accordance with US GAAP. c.Corrections to previously reported restructuring charges. These adjustments primarily relate to the timing of when certain charges were accrued or when excess reserves were reversed into earnings as a result of changes in estimates for restructuring actions. Approximately half of the adjustments to our charges related to timing of recognition of certain employee related costs in one restructuring action. US GAAP requires that these costs be accrued only after a specific announcement to employees. At one plant location, we accrued certain costs after management made the decision to terminate employees but prior to an announcement meeting the specificity required by US GAAP. With regard to the excess reserve adjustments, we previously reversed excess restructuring reserves at the time the associated restructuring plan was substantially complete. The adjustment was 19 made to reverse the reserve in the period in which it was determined to be in excess, as required under US GAAP. d.Other revisions to the financial statements, each of which impacted income by less than $.8 million, net of tax, less than $1 million pre tax. The following tables show the effect of the restatement adjustments on our previously issued financial statements: Increase (decrease) in net earnings ($ millions): 2002(a) Restated 2001 Restated 2000 Pre 2000 Total Net earnings (loss) as previously reported $ 72 $ (102 ) $ 8 Net adjustments (pre tax): 1.

As previously disclosed, the delay in filing resulted in a breach of a requirement for timely satisfaction of SEC filing obligations under several of our credit agreements, the most significant of which are discussed below. A majority of our long term debt is governed by three Indenture agreements summarized as follows: A November 20, 2002 Indenture between the Company and BNY Midwest Trust Company as trustee for $250 million in 9.5% senior notes; A June 18, 2001 Indenture between the Company and BNY Midwest Trust Company as trustee for $300 million in 7% convertible preferred securities; and, A March 1, 1986 Indenture between the Company and JPMorgan Chase Bank (formerly The Chase Manhattan Bank) for four series of securities with an aggregate value of $765 million. Under each of the Indentures, we are required to deliver to the respective Trustees a copy of our Annual Report on Form 10 K within specified periods of time after such filings are due (March 31, 2003). The breach caused by the delay in filing our Annual Report on Form 10 K gave certain rights to the Trustees and debt holders under the Indentures to accelerate maturity of our indebtedness if they give us notice and we do not cure the breach within 60 days. However, neither the Trustees nor the respective debt holders have given us such notice. As a result, we continue to classify our debt as long term in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. In connection with the 2002 Indenture, we agreed to file an exchange offer registration statement with the SEC and complete that offer no later than May 19, 2003. As a result of the delay in filing our Annual Report on Form 10 K with the SEC, we were unable to complete the exchange offer and became contractually obligated to pay an additional 0.25% per annum interest on the notes issued under that Indenture. For each 90 day delay in the completion of the exchange offer, the interest rate 21 on the notes will increase by an additional 0.25% per annum up to a 1% maximum increase until such time as the exchange offer is completed. In connection with the 2001 Indenture governing the issue of our 7% convertible preferred securities, we exercised our right to suspend the use of the resale prospectus, which is part of a shelf registration statement that we had filed and had declared effective to permit the resale of these securities, pending the filing of our Annual Report on Form 10 K with the SEC. Effective March 31, 2003, this suspension resulted in an increase of 0.5% per annum in the dividend rate borne by these securities, which we will continue to pay until we permit the resale prospectus to be used after the filing of our Annual Report on Form 10 K. In November 2002, we entered into a new credit facility agreement that provides for aggregate borrowings of up to $385 million and is available on a revolving basis for a period of three years. The agreement requires that we annually deliver audited financial statements to the lenders within a specified period of time. As a result of the restatement and reaudit process, we received a waiver from our lenders through November 30, 2003 of any breach due to a delay in the delivery of our audited financial statements. There were no amounts outstanding under this facility at December 31, 2002. By filing this Annual Report on Form 10 K and our Quarterly Report on Form 10 Q for the first quarter ended March 30, 2003, with the SEC and by delivering a copy of these filings to the Trustees of the Indentures and to our lender under the credit facility agreement, we will cure the noncompliance under the abovementioned Indentures and comply with the terms of the credit facility agreement. We expect to satisfy our registration obligations relating to the 2002 and 2001 Indentures in the near term, following which the incremental interest and dividend payments will be discontinued. Overview Our net earnings for 2002 were $82 million, or $2.13 per share, on sales of $5.85 billion, compared to a net loss of $103 million or ($2.70) per share on sales of $5.68 billion for the prior year. Results for 2002, however, included a pre tax credit of $8 million for costs associated with restructuring actions, an $8 million pre tax charge related to early extinguishment of debt and a $3 million after tax credit for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. Net earnings for 2002 also reflect a one time $57 million favorable tax adjustment related to the settlement of income tax audits for the years 1994 through 1999. In comparison, our 2001 loss of $103 million included a net after tax charge of $84 million related to restructuring actions. In 2000, our net earnings were $14 million, or $0.35 per share, on sales of $6.60 billion and also included a net after tax charge of $100 million for restructuring actions. As reported, earnings before interest and taxes in 2002 were $139 million, or 2.4 percent of sales, excluding the effect of restructuring actions and early extinguishment of debt. In comparison, earnings before interest and taxes, excluding the effects of restructuring actions in 2001 and 2000, were $82 million, or 1.4 percent of sales, and $249 million, or 3.8 percent of sales, respectively. 22  Net Sales The table below sets forth net sales for each of our key business segments during the last three years: 2002 2001 2000 $ Millions Engine $ 3,435 $ 3,121 $ 4,050 Power Generation 1,226 1,422 1,395 Filtration and Other 951 889 902 International Distributor 574 562 555 Elimination of intersegment sales (333 ) (313 ) (305 ) $ 5,853 $ 5,681 $ 6,597 Sales increased in all of our business segments during 2002 compared to 2001 with the exception of our Power Generation Business. Sales of our Engine Business increased $314 million, or 10 percent, primarily reflecting strong demand in the heavy duty truck sector in advance of the October 1, 2002 EPA emissions deadline and higher sales for the Dodge Ram truck. Power Generation sales were $1,226 million, down $196 million, or 14 percent compared to the prior year, as a result of lower demand from slow economic activity. Sales in the Filtration and Other Business were $951 million, up $62 million or 7 percent year over year, reflecting demand improvement and increased market penetration. In our International Distributor Business, sales increased $12 million, or 2 percent, compared to 2001, primarily due to increased business at our distributors in Australia and Asia. Net sales for 2001 were $5.68 billion, $916 million lower than 2000. The decrease was primarily due to lower engine sales, down $929 million, or 23 percent as a result of reduced shipments to North American OEMs which were affected by the sharp downturn in the North American automotive industry and construction markets. Gross Margin Our gross margin was $1.05 billion in 2002, $1.01 billion in 2001 and $1.27 billion in 2000 with related gross margin percent of net sales of 17.9 percent, 17.8 percent, and 19.2 percent, respectively. Compared to the prior year, gross margin in 2002 was relatively flat on a net sales increase of $172 million, reflecting changes in sales mix as we transitioned from mature engines to new engines where margins are typically lower at introduction. In addition, our margins were also affected by lower fixed cost absorption in our Power Generation business due to a significant sales decline as a result of weak power generation demand. Product coverage costs were flat year over year at 3.4 percent in 2002 and 2001. The most significant factors affecting the decline in gross margin and gross margin percentage from 2000 to 2001 was lower absorption of fixed manufacturing costs in our Engine Business as a result of declining sales volume. In addition, gross margin was also impacted by changes in sales mix partially offset by our cost reduction efforts and lower product coverage costs, 3.4 percent in 2001 compared to 4.1 percent in 2000. Selling and Administrative Expenses Selling and administrative expenses were $736 million in 2002, an increase of $15 million, or 2 percent, compared to spending levels a year ago. The increase in selling and administrative expenses year over year is primarily a result of volume variable expenditures, funding of focused growth initiatives and higher variable compensation expense due to improved earnings, partially offset by cost reduction actions. Selling and administrative expenses in 2001 were $721 million, down $52 million or 7 percent compared to 2000 expenses. A majority of the decrease resulted from our cost reduction efforts, including benefits of restructuring actions and lower spending across all of our business segments. 23 Research and Engineering Expenses Research and engineering expenses in 2002 were $201 million, a decrease of $19 million or 9 percent, compared to 2001 expenses. Overall, research and engineering expenses were lower due to cancellation of a major engine development program in the second quarter of 2001 and other cost reduction actions, partially offset by higher engineering costs related to the development of our 2002 emissions products. Research and engineering expenses in 2001 were $220 million, down $26 million, or 11 percent, compared to 2000. The decline is primarily a result of on going cost reduction efforts and the discontinuance of a new engine development program. Income from Joint Ventures and Alliances Our income from joint ventures and alliances was $22 million in 2002, compared to $10 million of income in 2001. The increase is primarily attributable to improved earnings across most of our joint ventures, particularly our joint ventures with China National Heavy duty Truck Corporation in Chongqing, which manufactures heavy duty and high horsepower diesel engines and Dongfeng Motors, which manufactures our B and C Series midrange engines. Earnings at our partially owned distributor locations in North America and our new marine joint venture, Cummins Mercruiser, also contributed to the increase in 2002. Earnings from joint ventures and alliances were $10 million in 2001 compared to $7 million in 2000. The increase in income is attributable to improved earnings from our joint ventures in China offset by lower earnings from our joint venture with Komatsu. Restructuring Actions We have continued a restructuring program initiated in 1998 to improve the Companys cost structure. During 2002, we recorded a net $8 million credit related to restructuring actions comprised of a net $2 million charge in the second quarter and a reversal of $10 million of excess restructuring accruals in the fourth quarter. The second quarter charge of $2 million was comprised of a $16 million charge for restructuring actions taken that quarter reduced by $14 million of reversals. The second and fourth quarter reversals included 2001 and 2000 restructuring actions that were realigned or cancelled and the fourth quarter reversal included $3 million from a charge originally recorded in 2000 and a $1 million reversal of the 2002 accrual. During 2001 and 2000, we recorded restructuring charges of $126 million and $154 million, respectively, that were directly related to the downturn in the North American heavy duty truck market and several other end markets. These actions were necessary to achieve lower production costs, improve operating efficiencies, and enhance management effectiveness under difficult economic conditions. The charges included staffing reorganizations and reductions in various business segments, asset impairment write downs for manufacturing equipment, facility closure and consolidation costs, cancellation of a new engine development program and other exit costs related to small business operations. Note 7 of the Consolidated Financial Statements includes schedules that present by major cost component and by year of expense, activities related to restructuring actions for the years 2000 through 2002, including adjustments to the original charges. As of December 31, 2002 all activities associated with our 2001 and 2000 restructuring actions are completed. A discussion of our restructuring actions during this period follows: 2002 Restructuring Actions In the second quarter 2002, we announced further restructuring actions precipitated by weak market conditions, related primarily to our Engine and Power Generation Businesses and recorded additional restructuring charges of $16 million. The charges included $11 million attributable to 24 workforce reduction actions, $3 million for asset impairments and $2 million related to facility closures and consolidations. Of this charge, $5 million was associated with our Engine Business, $4 million with Power Generation, $3 million with Filtration and Other and $4 million with the International Distributor Business. The charges included severance costs and related benefits of terminating approximately 220 salaried and 350 hourly employees and were based on amounts pursuant to established benefit programs or statutory requirements of the affected operations. These actions reflect overall reductions in staffing levels due to closing operations and moving production to available capacity. As of December 31, 2002 approximately 200 salaried and 350 hourly employees had been separated or terminated under this plan. The asset impairment charge relates to equipment available for disposal. The carrying value of the equipment and the effect of suspending depreciation on the equipment were not significant. In the fourth quarter 2002, the number and mix of employees that were terminated under this plan differed from our original estimate. As a result, we reversed approximately $1 million of severance costs and related benefits to income. During 2002, we paid approximately $10 million in liabilities related to this action. As of December 31, 2002, $2 million remained in accrued liabilities for this plan. The majority of this restructuring action was completed by the end of the first quarter 2003 and we expect to complete the remainder by the end of 2003. This action is expected to generate approximately $13 million in annual savings. For the year ended December 31, 2002, approximately $6 million in savings was recognized in cost of goods sold. 2001 Restructuring Actions In the first half of 2001, primarily as a result of the continuing downturn in the North American heavy duty truck market and several other end markets, we announced further restructuring actions and recorded restructuring charges of $128 million, most of which was recorded in the second quarter. The charges included $18 million attributable to workforce reduction actions, $68 million for asset impairment and $42 million related to cancellation of capital and tooling equipment purchase commitments. In addition we recorded other charges of $1 million attributed to the divestiture of a small business operation. These charges were reduced by a $3 million reversal of excess 2000 restructuring accruals. Of the net $126 million charge, $113 million was associated with the Engine Business, $8 million with the Power Generation Business, $4 million with the Filtration and Other Business and $1 million with the International Distributor Business. The workforce reduction actions included overall reductions in staffing levels and the impact of divesting a small business operation. The charges included severance costs and related benefits of terminating approximately 500 salaried and 350 hourly employees and were based on amounts pursuant to established benefit programs or statutory requirements of the affected operations. All employees affected by this workforce reduction plan and the subsequent fourth quarter 2001 realignment plan were terminated by the end of the fourth quarter of 2002. The asset impairment charge and the charges for cancelled purchased commitments were for equipment, tooling and related investment supporting a new engine development program that was cancelled in the second quarter of 2001. The charges included the investment in manufacturing equipment previously capitalized and cancellation charges for capital and tooling purchase commitments. The charge was reduced by the estimated salvage value related to the planned equipment disposals. During 2002, we recovered $9 million of salvage proceeds on planned equipment disposals, of which $6 million was in excess of previously estimated recoveries and was reversed against the original restructuring charge. In the fourth quarter 2002, we transferred $3 million of previously impaired manufacturing equipment to a US plant as a result of consolidating our ISX assembly and realigned our workforce reduction plan. These actions resulted in the reversal of an additional $12 million in excess charges related to this plan. 25 During 2002, we paid approximately $9 million related to liabilities under this plan. As of December 31, 2002 approximately 511 salaried and 540 hourly employees have been separated or terminated under the workforce reduction actions of this plan. The Company has completed this restructuring action as of December 31, 2002. For the year ending December 31, 2002, we recognized approximately $24 million in savings under this plan comprised of $14 million in cost of goods sold, $7 million in selling and administrative expenses and $3 million in research and engineering expenses. 2000 Restructuring Actions During the fourth quarter of 2000, we announced restructuring plans primarily in response to the downturn in the North American heavy duty truck market and several other end markets where our shipments had declined 35 percent from 1999 and recorded a $138 million restructuring charge. The charges included workforce reduction costs of $39 million, $88 million for asset impairments (including $30 million for internally developed software) and $11 million associated with exit costs to close or consolidate a number of small business operations. In addition, we recorded $13 million of other charges related to asset impairments not associated with the restructuring actions ($10 million for investments and $3 million for intangibles). In addition to the 2000 restructuring charge, we recorded a net $3 million charge related to prior years restructuring actions. Of these amounts, $125 million was associated with our Engine Business, $18 million with our Power Generation Business and $11 million with our Filtration and Other Business. The workforce reduction actions included overall reductions in staffing levels and the impact of divesting a small business operation. The charges included severance and benefit costs of terminating approximately 500 salaried and 630 hourly employees and were based on amounts pursuant to established benefit programs or statutory requirements of the affected operations. In the fourth quarter 2001, we realigned our workforce reduction plan and reallocated $2 million of excess liabilities for termination benefits to workforce reduction actions committed to during that quarter. All employees affected by this workforce reduction plan were separated or terminated by June 30, 2002 and all remaining severance costs and related benefits under this action were paid by December 31, 2002. Approximately 560 salaried and 380 hourly employees were affected by the workforce reduction actions of this plan. The asset impairment charge of $88 million was calculated in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to be Disposed Of". Approximately $30 million of the charge consisted of capitalized software in process related to manufacturing, financial and administrative information technology programs that were cancelled during program development and prior to implementation. The remaining $58 million included $38 million for engine assembly and fuel system manufacturing equipment to be disposed of upon closure or consolidation of production operations. The equipment was expected to continue in use and be depreciated for approximately two years from the date of the charge until closure or consolidation. The expected recovery value of the equipment was based on estimated salvage value and was excluded from the impairment charge. The charge also included $11 million for equipment available for disposal, $6 million for properties available for disposal, and $3 million for intangibles. The carrying value of assets held for disposal and the effect of suspending depreciation on these assets was not significant. In the second quarter 2002, we cancelled plans to close a filtration manufacturing plant ($1 million), transferred $2 million of previously impaired power generation equipment slated for disposal to a foreign operation, realigned our workforce reduction plan ($1 million) and settled legal claims from a previous disposal action for less than originally estimated ($2 million). These actions resulted in a reversal of $6 million in excess charges related to this plan. In the fourth quarter of 2002, we moved our ISX assembly to another US plant which reduced the need for a previous accrual. As a 26 result of this action, asset removal costs previously provided for at the two production facilities were no longer needed and $2 million in excess charges related to this plan were reversed. During 2002, we paid approximately $12 million related to liabilities under this plan. As of December 31, 2002, all activities associated with this restructuring plan are completed. For the year ending December 31, 2002, we recognized approximately $60 million in savings under this plan comprised of $46 million in cost of goods sold, $12 million in selling, general and administrative expenses and $2 million in research and engineering expenses. Interest Expense Interest expense was $61 million in 2002 compared to $77 million in 2001, a decrease of $16 million. Lower borrowings as a result of our preferred securities issuance in 2001 and lower interest rates accounted for a majority of the decrease. Interest expense in 2001 was $10 million lower than 2000, primarily from the issuance of the preferred securities in July 2001 and reduced debt levels. Cash payments of interest for 2002, 2001 and 2000 were $52 million, $80 million and $88 million, respectively and are disclosed separately in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Loss on Early Retirement of Debt In November 2002 we elected to repay all of the outstanding 5.61% notes due 2010 issued by our Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) trust. The election to redeem the notes early was a result of a covenant conflict with our new revolving credit facility that we entered into in November. The aggregate redemption price for the notes was approximately $51 million, plus redemption premiums of $8 million and accrued interest of approximately $1 million. The $8 million redemption premium is classified in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings as "Loss on early retirement of debt." Other Income and Expense Other income and expense was a net $9 million of income in 2002 compared to net expense of $0 million in 2001. A majority of the increase is a result of the discontinuance of goodwill amortization in accordance with a newly adopted accounting standard (see Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Other income and expense in 2000 was a net $6 million expense compared to net expense of $0 million in 2001. Other income and expense includes several transactions comprising foreign currency exchange, interest income, royalty income and other miscellaneous items. The major components of other income and expense are segregated between operating items and non operating items and are disclosed in Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Provision for Income Taxes Our income tax provision in 2002 was a benefit of $38 million, including a one time favorable tax adjustment credit of $57 million related to the settlement during 2002 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service income tax audits for the tax years 1994 through 1999. In addition, our effective income tax rate on operations in all years 2002 through 2000 was less than the 35 percent U.S. corporate income tax rate because of reduced taxes on export sales, research tax credits and (in 2002 and 2001) dividends on preferred securities, which are deductible as interest expense for federal tax purposes. The 2002 effective tax rates were 34 percent for restructuring credits and 35 percent for early retirement of debt charges. The effective tax rate on restructuring charges in 2001 was 33 percent and in 2000 was 35 percent. Note 12 of the Consolidated Financial Statements includes a more complete disclosure of our income taxes. The amount of income taxes paid in 2002 and 2001 was $30 million and $20 million, respectively, and is disclosed in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 27 Minority Interest Minority interest in income of our consolidated operations was $16 million in 2002 compared to $15 million in 2001 and $14 million in 2000. The increase over 2001 and 2000 is primarily from higher earnings due minority partners as a result of improved earnings in the operating results of Cummins India Limited and Wuxi Holset Ltd. Dividends on Preferred Securities Dividends on our preferred securities were $21 million in 2002 compared to $11 million in 2001. Our preferred securities were issued in June 2001 and results for that year include dividend payments for the last two quarters while 2002 results include a full year of dividend payments. Effective July 1, 2003 dividends on our preferred securities will be prospectively classified as interest expense in accordance with a new accounting standard issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (see Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements SFAS No. 150). Cumulative Effect of a Change in Accounting Principle During the fourth quarter of 2002, we changed the measurement date for measuring our return on pension plan investments and our minimum liability for pension obligations from September 30 to November 30. This change in measurement date aligns more closely with the date of our financial statements and we believe provides a more current measurement of plan assets and obligations than previously presented. The impact of this change is reported in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings as a change in accounting principle. The cumulative after tax effect of the change was a $3 million credit, or $0.07 per share, recorded as of January 1, 2002. The effect of this accounting change on 2002 net earnings was not significant. Net Earnings Net earnings for the year ending 2002 were $82 million, or $2.13 per share, compared to a net loss of $103 million or ($2.70) per share in 2001 and net earnings of $14 million, or $0.35 per share in 2000. Net earnings for 2002 included a pre tax credit of $8 million for excess restructuring accruals, an $8 million pre tax loss on early retirement of debt, and a $3 million net of tax credit for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting for pensions. Also reflected in 2002 net earnings is a one time $57 million favorable tax adjustment related to settlement of U.S. Internal Revenue Service income tax audits for the years 1994 through 1999. In comparison, our 2001 loss of $103 million included a net after tax charge of $84 million related to restructuring actions and our 2000 net earnings of $14 million included a net after tax charge of $100 million for restructuring actions. As reported, earnings before interest and taxes in 2002, excluding the effect of restructuring and the loss on early extinguishment of debt, were $139 million, or 2.4 percent of sales. In comparison, earnings before interest and taxes in 2001 and 2000, excluding the effects of restructuring actions, were $82 million, or 1.4 percent of sales, and $249 million, or 3.8 percent of sales, respectively. A majority of the increase in earnings before interest and taxes in 2002 compared to 2001 is attributable to higher sales volume and improved overhead absorption at our manufacturing plants, earnings improvement in our Filtration and Other Business, improved earnings at our joint ventures and alliances and the discontinuance of goodwill amortization, offset by lower earnings in our Power Generation Business. The most significant factor effecting the decrease in earnings before interest and taxes in 2001 compared to 2000 were lower gross margins in our Engine Business resulting from underabsorption of manufacturing costs due to declining sales volume and changes in sales mix partially offset by cost reduction efforts and lower product coverage costs. In addition, earnings in our Filtration and Other Business were lower reflecting reduced sales for OEM truck and construction products. 28 Business Segment Results Engine Business The revenues and operating income for the Engine Business segment for the three years ended December 31, 2002 were as follows: 2002 2001 2000 $ Millions Net Sales $ 3,435 $ 3,121 $ 4,050 Earnings (loss) before interest, income taxes and restructuring and other charges (credits) 37 (95 ) 34 Restructuring and other charges (credits) (12 ) 113 125 Earnings (loss) before interest and income taxes $ 49 $ (208 ) $ (91 ) Total net sales for our Engine Business were $3.44 billion in 2002 compared to $3.12 billion in 2001, an increase of $314 million, or 10 percent, primarily due to strong sales of our Dodge Ram truck engine and an upturn in heavy duty OEM engine shipments prior to the October 1 new emissions standards. Net sales in 2001 were down $929 million, or 23 percent, when compared to net sales in 2000, due primarily to the downturn experienced in the North American trucking industry characterized by high inventory levels of new and used trucks. A summary of net sales for the Engine Business by market follows: 2002 2001 2000 $ Millions Heavy Duty Truck $ 1,069 $ 940 $ 1,444 Medium Duty Truck and Bus 599 577 662 Light Duty Automotive 781 576 830 Industrial 743 748 873 High Horsepower industrial 243 280 241 $ 3,435 $ 3,121 $ 4,050 The Engine Business shipped 308,200 units in 2002, an increase of 24,000 units, or 8 percent, compared to 284,200 units shipped in 2001. Engine unit shipments were down 108,500 units in 2001, or 28 percent lower than unit shipments in 2000. A summary unit shipments for the Engine Business by engine category follows: Unit shipments 2002 2001 2000 Mid Range 251,100 231,900 302,400 Heavy Duty 53,600 48,200 86,300 High Horsepower 3,500 4,100 4,000 308,200 284,200 392,700 Heavy Duty Truck Sales to the heavy duty truck market were $1.07 billion in 2002, up $129 million, or 14 percent, compared to sales in 2001. The increase primarily reflects an upturn in North American OEM engine shipments in response to accelerated purchases prior to the October 1, 2002 effective date of the new EPA emissions standards. Unit shipments of our heavy duty truck engines in 2002 were 43,400 units compared to 37,900 units in 2001, an increase of 15 percent year over year. Sales to the heavy duty international truck market were relatively flat compared to 2001. Shipments of our heavy duty ISX truck engine more than doubled compared to the prior year. Sales of heavy duty truck engines in 2001 were 35 percent lower than 2000 reflecting the downturn in the North American trucking industry. 29 Medium Duty Truck and Bus Medium duty truck and bus revenues increased $22 million, or 4 percent, above sales levels a year ago reflecting a slight increase in demand as a result of the October 1, 2002 emissions standards. Unit shipments to the North American medium duty truck market were down 24 percent compared to a year ago. Medium duty shipments to international markets increased 10 percent, primarily in Asia. Bus engine sales declined 8 percent globally while total unit shipments were down 11 percent, primarily to international customers as shipments to North American OEMs declined 3 percent compared to 2001. Sales to the medium duty truck and bus market in 2001 were $85 million lower, or 13 percent below 2000 sales, primarily reflecting lower demand due to deteriorating market conditions in the North American truck industry. Light Duty Automotive Revenues from our light duty automotive market increased $205 million, or 36 percent, compared to 2001 revenues. Total unit shipments were up 27 percent compared to the prior year, with the increase evenly distributed between shipments to DaimlerChrysler and shipments to OEMs in the North American RV market. Shipments of our ISB engine to DaimlerChrysler for the Dodge Ram truck were 99,900 units in 2002, an increase of 23,700 units, or 31 percent higher than a year ago, primarily driven by the introduction of the new Dodge Ram truck model. Unit shipments to the recreational vehicle market were up 38 percent year over year from previously weak demand levels, reflecting some recovery in consumer markets and growth in the diesel powered segment of this market. Sales to the light duty automotive market in 2001 decreased $254 million, or 31 percent, compared to 2000 sales. Shipments to DaimlerChrysler were off 36 percent and were impacted by production constraints preceding the 2002 model year changeover. Engine sales to the recreational vehicle market were down 7 percent compared to 2000 reflecting lower demand. Industrial Total industrial sales to the construction, marine and agricultural markets were down $5 million, or relatively flat compared to 2001. Sales to the construction segment of this market were down slightly year over year with unit shipments to North America and international OEMs down 8 percent and 7 percent, respectively. Engine sales to the agricultural equipment market were up 16 percent compared to 2001, primarily due to international OEMs in Latin America. Sales to the North American market increased 7 percent. In the marine market, sales were down 6 percent compared to the prior year, partially as a result of our new joint venture with Brunswick Corporation, Cummins Mercruiser. Sales of engines for recreational marine applications are now recorded by the joint venture. Industrial engine sales in 2001 were down 14 percent compared to 2000, with a majority of the decline in the construction market where sales were down 18 percent as OEMs adjusted to lower market conditions. High Horsepower Industrial Sales of our V, K and Q series high horsepower industrial engines in 2002 were down $37 million or 13 percent compared to the prior year. Unit shipments to the North American mining market declined 46 percent while shipments to international OEMs in the mining markets declined 11 percent compared to 2001. Shipments of high horsepower engines to the rail sector, which is primarily international business, were down 22 percent from the prior year. Shipments of our high horsepower engines to government markets, primarily V series military applications, were up 28 percent with the majority of the increase in North America. 30 High horsepower industrial engine sales in 2001 were up 16 percent compared to 2000, primarily driven by market share gains in the mining segment and increased sales to the rail car market as a result of large orders in Europe and Asia. Earnings from Operations Earnings before interest, taxes and restructuring actions increased from a loss of $95 million in 2001 to earnings of $37 million in 2002, an improvement of $132 million. The improvement is primarily a result of higher engine volumes and the accompanying benefit of fixed cost absorption at our manufacturing plants and our continued focus on cost reduction. The $95 million loss before interest, taxes and restructuring actions in 2001 was $129 million worse on a comparable basis than 2000 results, primarily from lower volumes due to the downturn in the North American truck industry. Over the last two years, the Engine Business has lowered its break even results through restructuring actions and cost reduction efforts to better align its production costs with expected industry demand levels. Consolidation of Heavy Duty Assembly As part of our continuing effort to reduce our production costs, we announced plans in the fourth quarter of 2002 to consolidate our heavy duty engine assembly and test operations at our Jamestown, New York plant. Approximately 200 employees in the heavy duty engine business were eliminated as a result of consolidating assembly and test operations at our Columbus, Indiana engine plant into existing assembly operations at our Jamestown plant. The consolidation was completed during the first quarter of 2003. None of the costs associated with the consolidation were recorded as restructuring charges. Power Generation Business The revenue and operating income for the Power Generation Business segment for the three years ended December 31, 2002 were as follows: 2002 2001 2000 $ Millions Net Sales $ 1,226 $ 1,422 $ 1,395 Earnings (loss) before interest, income taxes and restructuring and other charges (credits) (25 ) 82 95 Restructuring and other charges 8 18 Earnings (loss) before interest and income taxes $ (25 ) $ 74 $ 77 Sales in our Power Generation Business were $1.23 billion, down $196 million or 14 percent, compared to 2001. A majority of the sales decline is a result of lower generator set sales, down 26 percent and lower generator drive sales, down 24 percent, offset by increased sales to the mobile and recreational vehicle markets, up 22 percent compared to 2001. Total engine shipments for the power generation market were 23,700 units, down 4,000 units, or 14 percent lower than a year ago, reflecting weak demand and slow economic growth in this market. Power Generation revenues in 2001 were 2 percent higher than 2000, primarily driven by higher sales to Latin America and Brazil and offset by lower sales in North America. Sales of small generator sets to the recreational vehicle industry were down 7 percent in 2001 compared to 2000. 31 A summary of engine unit shipments for the Power Generation Business by engine category follows: Unit Shipments 2002 2001 2000 Midrange 14,000 13,800 15,800 Heavy duty 4,300 6,900 5,700 High horsepower 5,400 7,000 7,800 23,700 27,700 29,300 Total unit sales of midrange engines to the power generation market were up 200 units, or 1 percent compared to 2001. Generator drive units powered by midrange engines increased 18 percent over the same period while unit sales to the midrange generator set market were off 15 percent. Total unit sales of heavy duty engines to the power generation market decreased 2,600 units, or 38 percent, compared to 2001. Heavy duty generator drive units were off 45 percent from a year ago while generator sets powered by heavy duty engines were down 21 percent year over year. High horsepower unit sales in the power generation business decreased 1,600 units, or 23 percent compared to 2001. High horsepower generator drive units declined 11 percent year over year while high horsepower generator set units decreased 34 percent from the prior period. The decline in unit shipments is attributable to weakening demand in the heavy duty and high horsepower power generation equipment markets. Most of the decline in generator drive units for stationary power occurred in North America, Latin America and Europe and was offset by slight increases in shipments to India and Southeast Asia markets. A majority of the decline in generator set units is attributable to weak demand in North America, Latin America and Europe. Sales of alternators increased 6 percent in 2002 compared to 2001 while sales of small generator sets for recreational vehicles and other consumer applications increased 22 percent in 2002 reflecting strong demand in this segment. Earnings from Operations In 2002, Power Generation incurred an operating loss before interest and taxes of $25 million, compared to earnings before interest and taxes of $74 million in 2001. The overall decline in margin and earnings before interest and taxes in the Power Generation Business is attributable to several factors. First is the decrease in volume due to weak demand. Second is a shift in sales mix, with a decline in unit shipments of higher margin heavy duty and high horsepower products. Third, the overall decline in sales volume resulted in underabsorption of fixed overhead costs at our manufacturing facilities. Fourth, excess inventory in the marketplace continues to create pricing pressures resulting in heavier discounting to retain market share. Finally, utilization of Power Generations rental fleet is lower in 2002 compared to last year due to overall weak demand, resulting in reduced profitability of our rental fleet business. 32 Filtration and Other Business The revenues and operating income for the Filtration and Other Business segment for the three years ended December 31, 2002 were as follows: 2002 2001 2000 $ Millions Net Sales $ 951 $ 889 $ 902 Earnings before interest, income taxes and restructuring and other charges 94 68 91 Restructuring and other charges 4 11 Earnings before interest and income taxes $ 94 $ 64 $ 80 Filtration and Other Business revenues were $951 million in 2002, up $62 million, or 7 percent, compared to 2001 sales. Revenues from filtration products in the U.S. were up $30 million, or 6 percent, over 2001, reflecting demand improvement and increased market penetration at North American OEMs. Sales to OEMs in Europe, Australia, Mexico and other international locations also increased compared to 2001. Revenues from the sale of Holset turbochargers were up 15 percent compared to 2001, primarily from continuing strong business in China. Approximately 27 percent of the increase in 2002 revenues for this business segment is attributable to Holset products. Earnings from Operations Earnings before interest, taxes and restructuring actions for the Filtration and Other Business in 2002 were $94 million, up $26 million, or 38 percent, compared to $68 million in earnings a year earlier. The improvement in profitability is primarily a result of volume increases and the discontinuance of approximately $9 million in goodwill amortization. In addition, incremental expenses from this segments new Emission Solutions business were offset by benefits from restructuring actions and our Six Sigma cost reduction efforts. International Distributor Business The revenues and operating income for the International Distributor Business segment for the three years ended December 31, 2002 were as follows: 2002 2001 2000 $ Millions Net Sales $ 574 $ 562 $ 555 Earnings before interest, income taxes and restructuring and other charges 33 27 29 Restructuring and other charges 4 1 Earnings before interest and income taxes $ 29 $ 26 $ 29 Revenues from the International Distributor Business were $574 million, up $12 million, or 2 percent, compared to 2001. Sales of parts and engines increased at distributor locations in Australia, East and Southeast Asia, partially offset by sales declines in Latin America, primarily Argentina, and Central Europe, primarily Germany. Sales for the year ending 2001 and 2000 include $42 million and $46 million, respectively, of certain OEM sales that are now classified and reported as sales in the Engine Business segment. This reporting change had no affect on earnings results in either business segment. 33  Earnings from Operations Earnings before interest and taxes for the International Distributor Business were $29 million in 2002 compared to $26 million in 2001 and $29 million in 2000. The increase in earnings in 2002 is primarily a result of increased engine and parts sales at our distributors in East Asia, Southeast Asia and South Pacific and offset by lower sales from distributors in Central Europe, primarily Germany. Earnings from operations in 2001 were lower primarily from the effect of foreign currency exchange losses at our Latin America distributor in Argentina. Geographic Markets Sales to international markets in 2002 were $2.65 billion, or 45 percent of total net sales, compared to $2.64 billion, or 46 percent of total net sales in 2001 and $2.82 billion, or 43 percent of total net sales in 2000. A summary of our net sales by geographic territory for the last three years follows: 2002 2001 2000 $ Millions Unites States $ 3,202 $ 3,045 $ 3,775 Asia/Australia 1,023 901 905 Europe/CIS 763 832 860 Mexico/Latin America 423 471 451 Canada 283 303 418 Africa/Middle East 159 129 188 $ 5,853 $ 5,681 $ 6,597 Shipments of heavy duty truck engines to international markets in 2002 decreased 3 percent compared to a year ago, primarily to Latin America and Central Europe, partially offset by increased shipments to Mexican OEMs. Shipments of midrange automotive engines to international markets increased 10 percent in 2002, primarily to Latin America OEMs. Engine shipments to the international bus market decreased 20 percent compared to a year ago, primarily to China, India and Mexico, where shipments declined over 2000 units compared to 2001. Shipments of light duty automotive engines to international markets declined 4 percent in 2002 compared to 2001. Engine shipments to international agricultural and construction equipment markets were down 3 percent in 2002 compared to 2001 due to weak market conditions. Engine shipments to international mining and rail markets were down 17 percent from the prior year. Sales to the Asia/Australia region increased $122 million, or 14 percent compared to 2001, primarily from increased demand for engines, generator drives and sales at our Australian distributorship. Sales to Europe/CIS, representing 13 percent of total sales and 29 percent of international sales in 2002, were down 8 percent compared to the prior year, mostly in the heavy duty truck markets in the UK. Business in Mexico, Brazil and Latin America decreased 10 percent in 2002 compared to 2001, primarily from lower power generation revenues and a decline in bus sales, and offset by increased engine sales to the agricultural market. Sales to Canada, representing 5 percent of net sales in 2002, were down 7 percent compared to 2001 due to lower heavy duty truck production and lower sales of filtration products. Sales to Africa/Middle East increased 23 percent in 2002 compared to 2001, primarily from engines and parts sales at our distributors in Dubai, Zimbabwe and South Africa. Net sales to international markets in 2001 compared to 2000 were down $186 million, or 7 percent, primarily due to weak demand in Europe/CIS, lower sales in Canada due to the downturn in the North American heavy duty truck market, and lower sales to Africa/Middle East, primarily Turkey. 34 Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flows The following table sets forth key elements of the Companys cash flows for the last three years: 2002 2001 2000 $ Millions Net cash provided by operating activities $ 193 $ 152 $ 472 Net cash used in investing activities (152 ) (140 ) (410 ) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities 131 (2 ) (81 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 2 (1 ) (2 ) Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ 174 $ 9 $ (21 ) Cash from Operations. Our operating activities provided positive cash flow of $193 million in 2002 compared to $152 million in 2001 and $472 million in 2000. The increase in cash from operations in 2002 was largely due to improved net earnings, from a net loss of $103 million in 2001 to net earnings of $82 million in 2002, or an increase of $185 million, partially offset by decreases in non cash adjustments for restructuring and asset impairment charges, down $87 million, and non cash adjustments for earnings of our joint ventures and alliances, down $17 million. Depreciation and amortization declined $10 million from the prior year, primarily due to the discontinuance of $11 million of goodwill amortization which does not affect cash flows. Cash flows from operating activities was reduced by a net $33 million from changes in accounts receivable, inventories, accounts payable and other operating assets and liabilities. Accounts receivable increased $142 million, partially due to repayment of our securitization program but the increase was offset by inventory reduction and an increase in accounts payable. Investing Activities. Net cash used in investing activities was $152 million in 2002 compared to $140 million a year ago, an increase of $12 million but down considerably from the $410 million cash used in investing activities in 2000. Cash flows from investing activities in 2001 benefited from $143 million in proceeds from sale leaseback transactions. Excluding the cash flows from these transactions, net cash used in investing activities was $283 million in 2001 compared to $152 million in 2002, or a decrease of $131 million year over year. Most of the decline was a result of lower capital spending in 2002, down $116 million compared to 2001. Reduced capital spending remains a priority in 2003 as we estimate our capital expenditures will be $110 million, up $20 million compared to 2002, but down considerably from the $200 million spending levels of 2001 and 2000. Capital expenditures during the first half of 2001 included significant disbursements for a subsequently cancelled engine program. Investments in and advances to our joint ventures and alliances represented a cash outflow of $60 million in 2002 compared to $48 million a year ago. The advances include both long term investment and short term funding for working capital needs of our joint ventures. Cash inflows from investing activities in 2002 also included $23 million in proceeds from the sale of a previously consolidated distributorship, $6 million in proceeds from the sale of a distributorship acquired during the second quarter ($5 million outflow for business acquisition) and $9 million of proceeds from assets sold to the newly formed marine business joint venture, Cummins Mercruiser. Sales of marketable securities provided $86 million of cash in 2002 but cash was reduced by the purchase $116 million in securities during the same period. During 2001, sales of marketable securities provided $53 million of cash and $74 million of cash was used for the purchase of marketable securities. Financing Activities. Net cash provided by financing activities was $131 million in 2002 compared to a net use of cash for financing activities of $2 million in 2001. A significant financing activity providing cash in 2002 was the issuance of our 9.5% Senior Notes during the fourth quarter (See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Net proceeds of $244 million from this issuance 35 were used to repay borrowings under our accounts receivable securitization program and were also used to retire our 6.25% Notes that matured in March 2003. Significant financing activities in 2001 included $291 million in proceeds from the issuance of our preferred securities in the second quarter of 2001 of which $247 million was used to repay borrowings under our short term credit agreements during that quarter. Payments on long term borrowings were $87 million in 2002 and included early retirement of our ESOP Trust Notes (See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Net borrowings under short term credit agreements were $4 million during 2002 compared to $248 million in 2001. Dividend payments on our common stock were $50 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000. Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2002 were $224 million, an increase of $174 million compared to $50 million of cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the year. A majority of the increase in cash and cash equivalents occurred in the fourth quarter when we received proceeds of $244 million from the issuance of our 9.5% Senior Notes. Management Assessment of Liquidity Since fiscal 2000, we have made a strategic effort to improve our cost structure and improve efficiencies from continuing operations through monetization of assets and restructuring actions. As a result, we have undertaken various initiatives to improve cash flow, reduce debt obligations and improve our financial flexibility. Our operations have historically generated sufficient cash to fund our businesses, capital expenditures, research and development and dividend payments. Cash provided by continuing operations is a major source of our working capital funding. At certain times, cash provided by operations is subject to seasonal fluctuations, and as a result, periodic borrowings are used to fund working capital requirements. We have available various short and long term credit arrangements which are discussed below and disclosed in Note 8 "Borrowing Arrangements" of our Consolidated Financial Statements. These credit arrangements and our accounts receivable securitization program provide the financial flexibility required to satisfy future short term funding requirements for our debt service obligations, projected working capital requirements and capital spending. With the exception of payments required under our operating lease agreements, there are no major fixed cash payment obligations occurring until March 2005 when our 6.45% Notes with principal amount of $225 million mature. Based on projected cash flows from operations and existing credit facilities, management believes the Company has sufficient liquidity available to meet anticipated capital, debt and dividend requirements in the foreseeable future. During the fourth quarter of 2000, we entered into a receivable securitization program, which provides a cost effective method to fund our trade accounts receivable. This program diversifies our funding base by providing a flexible source of funding that is not reported on our balance sheet. As of December 31, 2002, there were no amounts outstanding under this program. A more complete description of the securitization program, which discloses certain cash flows related to the program, is found in the following section "Off Balance Sheet Financing Accounts Receivable Securitization Program. In the second quarter of 2001, we issued 6 million shares of cumulative convertible preferred securities subject to mandatory redemption through Cummins Capital Trust I, a wholly owned subsidiary. The net proceeds of $291 million from this issuance were used to repay outstanding indebtedness under our revolving credit agreement. Dividends on the preferred securities are payable at an annual rate of 7% of the $50 liquidation preference on March 15, June 15, September 15 and December 15 of each year or approximately $5.3 million in each quarter. A complete description of the preferred securities is disclosed in Note 9 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. See also Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements below regarding a new accounting standard applicable to these securities. 36 During the second and third quarters of 2001, we entered into two sale leaseback transactions whereby we sold certain manufacturing equipment and aircraft and received $143 million in proceeds from the transactions. The leases were accounted for as operating leases. We used the proceeds from these transactions to reduce our indebtedness and to fund our working capital requirements. Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements contains a description of the sale leaseback transactions. During 2002, 2001 and 2000, the Company recorded significant charges to restructure its operations, largely focused in the Engine Business. These actions and the resulting charges were primarily taken in response to the downturn in the North American trucking industry and related conditions and included workforce reductions, asset impairment losses, termination of a new engine development program and other charges. Total cash outflows associated with these actions approximated $59 million, the majority of which has already been disbursed, including $23 million in 2002. The associated annual savings of these restructuring actions are estimated at $97 million upon completion. Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements describes in detail the restructuring actions we have taken during the last three years. In November 2002, we entered into a new revolving credit facility that replaced our prior revolving credit facility. The new credit facility provides for aggregate borrowings of up to $385 million and is available on a revolving basis for a period of three years. Borrowings are primarily available in U.S. dollars, although up to $60 million of the new credit facility is available for multicurrency borrowing and letters of credit, up to $150 million is available for letters of credit and up to $50 million is available for swing line loans. We and a number of our subsidiaries are permitted to borrow and obtain letters of credit under the new revolving credit facility, although the aggregate amount of borrowings by, and letters of credit issued for the benefit of, our subsidiaries under the new facility may not exceed $60 million. As of December 31, 2002, there were no borrowings outstanding under this credit facility and $94 million was utilized for letters of credit. Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements contains a more complete description of our new revolving credit facility. In November 2002, we issued $250 million of unsecured 9.5% Senior Notes that mature in 2010. Proceeds from the issue were approximately $244 million, net of debt issue costs. Proceeds from the notes were used to repay amounts outstanding under our receivable securitization program and $125 million of the proceeds were used to retire our 6.25% Notes that matured in March 2003. Interest on the Notes is payable on June 1 and December 1 each year. We can redeem the Notes in whole or in part at any time after December 1, 2006, at a premium equal to 104.75% of par, declining to par in 2008, plus accrued interest. A more complete description of our Senior Notes is disclosed in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Available Credit Capacity The following table provides the components of the Companys available credit capacity as of December 31, 2002: $ Millions Revolving credit facility $ 291 International credit facilities 30 Accounts receivable securitization 56 $ 377 Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments A summary of payments due by period of our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of December 31, 2002 are shown in the tables below. A more complete description of 37 these obligations and commitments is included in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements as referenced below.

In April 2002, Moodys Investors Services, one of two major credit rating agencies, lowered our long term and short term debt ratings primarily as a result of the continued weakness in the North American heavy duty truck market. Moodys lowered our senior unsecured long term debt rating to Ba1 from Baa3 with a Stable outlook. The short term rating, which applies to our short term borrowings, was lowered to Not Prime from Prime 3. Standard & Poors, the other major credit rating agency, reaffirmed its rating of Cummins debt at BBB and expected the Companys liquidity and credit protection measures to remain satisfactory for the current rating. In October, Moodys confirmed the long term rating of our senior debt at Ba1 but changed the outlook to Negative from Stable. Also in October, Standard & Poors lowered our corporate credit rating to BB+ from BBB with a Negative outlook, primarily as a result of declining power generation sales and weak heavy and medium duty truck demand. In November, Moodys lowered our long term senior unsecured debt rating from Ba1 to Ba2 as a result of our securing borrowings under the revolving credit facility. Any rating can be revised upward or downward or withdrawn at any time by a rating agency if it decides the circumstances warrant that change, and there can be no assurance that our debt ratings will not be lowered further or withdrawn by a rating agency. Any future lowering of our debt ratings could further increase the cost of our financing agreements and arrangements, and also have a negative impact on our ability to access the capital markets or borrow funds at current rates. However, we do not believe further downgrade of our credit rating will have a material impact on our financial results or our financial condition. The following is a discussion regarding the impact of the credit ratings on our financing arrangements. 38 Off Balance Sheet Financing Accounts Receivable Securitization Program We entered into our accounts receivable securitization program in December 2000. As of December 31, 2002, there were no proceeds outstanding under the securitization program and as of December 31, 2001, $55 million was outstanding under the program. The original agreement for this program required us to maintain a minimum investment grade credit rating in our long term senior unsecured debt. As a result of the Moodys downgrade in April 2002, we renegotiated the terms of the securitization agreement and renewed the requirement to maintain a minimum investment grade credit rating. The terms of the new agreement provide for an increase in the interest rate and fees under this program of approximately $0.5 million annually at current funding levels. As a result of amending the requirement, neither the October 2002 Standard & Poors downgrade, or the November 2002 Moodys downgrade affected our funding under this program. Further downgrade of our debt rating from Moodys will require us to renegotiate the terms of our securitization agreement in order to continue funding under this program. Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements provides a more complete discussion of our accounts receivable securitization program. Financing Arrangements for Related Parties In accordance with the provisions of various joint venture agreements, we may purchase products and components from the joint ventures, sell products and components to the joint ventures and the joint ventures may sell products and components to unrelated parties. Joint venture transfer prices to us may differ from normal selling prices. Certain joint ventures agreements transfer product to us at cost, some transfer product to us on a cost plus basis, and others transfer product to us at market value. We purchase significant quantities of mid range diesel and natural gas engines, components and service parts from Consolidated Diesel Company (CDC), an unconsolidated general partnership. The partnership was formed in 1980 with J. I. Case (Case) to jointly fund engine development and manufacturing capacity. Cummins and Case (now CNH Global N.V.) are general partners and each partner shares 50 percent ownership in CDC. Under the terms of the agreement, CDC is obligated to make its entire production of diesel engines and related products available solely to the partners. Each partner is entitled to purchase up to one half of CDCs actual production; a partner may purchase in excess of one half of actual production to the extent productive capacity is available beyond the other partners purchase requirement. The partners are each obligated, unconditionally and severally, to purchase annually at least one engine or engine kit produced by CDC, provided a minimum of one engine or kit is produced. The transfer price of CDCs engines to the partners must be sufficient to cover its manufacturing cost in such annual accounting period, including interest and financing expenses, depreciation expense and payment of principal on any of CDCs indebtedness. In addition, each partner is obligated to contribute one half of the capital investment required to maintain plant capacity and each partner has the right to invest unilaterally in plant capacity, which additional capacity can be utilized by the other partner for a fee. To date, neither partner has made a unilateral investment in plant capacity at CDC. We are not a guarantor of any of CDCs obligations or commitments; however, we are required to provide up to 50 percent of CDCs base working capital as defined by the agreement. The amount of base working capital is calculated each quarter and if supplemental funding greater than the base working capital amount is required, the amount is funded through third party financing arranged by CDC, or we may elect to fund the requirement although we are under no obligation to do so. To date, when supplemental funding is required above the base working capital amount, we have elected to provide that funding to CDC. If the amount of supplemental funding required is less than the base working capital amount, it is funded equally by the partners. Excess cash generated by CDC is remitted to Cummins until CDCs working capital amount is reduced to the base working capital amount. Any further cash remittances from CDC to the partners are shared equally by the partners. 39 Financing Arrangements and Guarantees for Distributors U.S. Distributors We guarantee the revolving loans, term loans and leases in excess of a specified borrowing base for certain independently owned and operated North American distributors as well as distributors in which we own an equity interest. The agreement requires us to maintain a minimum investment grade credit rating for our long term senior unsecured debt. As a result of the Moodys downgrade in April 2002, our guarantee under the operating agreement for our guarantee program increased to the full amount of distributor borrowings outstanding under the program. In the interim, the program lender agreed to waive the additional guarantees of distributor indebtedness that were required upon our ratings downgrade and continued to fund the distributors under this program. We then amended the operating agreement with the lender under the program to lower the ratings trigger one level. Subsequently, as a result of the Moodys downgrade in November 2002, our guarantee under the operating agreement for the guarantee program again increased to the full amount of distributor borrowings under this program. We again amended the operating agreement with the lender under the program, lowering the rating trigger for a period of approximately two years, at which time the rating trigger will resume to its prior level. Under the amended agreement, if our long term senior unsecured debt rating falls below "BB" with Standard & Poors or below "Ba2" with Moodys, the lender under the program could elect to curtail distributor borrowings and the amount of our guarantee would increase to the total distributor borrowings outstanding under the program. This rating level trigger remains in effect until August 31, 2004, at which time the ratings trigger reverts to a rating of below "BBB " for Standard & Poors or below "Baa3" for Moodys. In addition, in the event the rating on our long term senior unsecured debt falls below the thresholds described above, we will also be required to pay the lender a monthly fee equal to 0.50 percent on the daily average outstanding balance of each financing arrangement under the operating agreement. Further, in the event that any distributor defaults under a particular financing arrangement, we will be required to purchase the assets of that distributor that secure its borrowings under the financing arrangement The operating agreement will continue in effect until February 7, 2007, and may be renewed by the parties for additional one year terms. As of December 31, 2002, we had guaranteed $43 million of financing arrangements under the operating agreement relating to U.S. distributor borrowings of $292 million. Canadian Distributors We have entered into a number of guarantee agreements with a Canadian lender pursuant to which we have agreed to guarantee borrowings of certain independent distributors of our products in Canada. Under the terms of these agreements, our guarantee with respect to any one financing arrangement between a distributor and lender is limited to 50 percent of the aggregate principal amount of the financing. As of December 31, 2002, we had $15 million of guarantees outstanding under these guarantee agreements relating to distributor borrowings of $30 million. New Revolving Credit Facility In November 2002, we entered into a new revolving credit facility that replaced our prior revolving credit facility. The new revolving credit facility provides for aggregate borrowings of up to $385 million and is available on a revolving basis for a period of three years. Borrowings are primarily available in U.S. dollars, although up to $60 million of the new credit facility is available for multicurrency borrowing and letters of credit, up to $150 million is available for letters of credit and up to $50 million is available for swing line loans. We and a number of our subsidiaries are permitted to borrow and obtain letters of credit under the new revolving credit facility, although the aggregate 40 amount of borrowings by, and letters of credit issued for the benefit of, our subsidiaries under the new facility may not exceed $60 million. We guarantee all borrowings of our subsidiaries under the new revolving credit facility. In addition, our principal domestic subsidiaries guarantee all borrowings under the new revolving credit facility, although certain of those guarantees are limited by the terms of our existing public indenture (which governs a number of our existing notes and debentures) that restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to incur or guarantee indebtedness, and are limited by similar terms in the indenture governing our $250 million senior notes. Borrowings under the new revolving credit facility (other than swing line loans) bear interest at a rate equal to, at our option: the London inter bank offered rate (LIBOR) plus a spread ranging from 0.875 percent to 2.5 percent based on our credit rating and utilization of the credit facility; or the Alternate Base Rate rate or ABR (which is the greater of the administrative agents prime rate and the federal funds effective rate plus 0.5 percent) plus a spread ranging from 0 percent to 1.5 percent based on our credit rating and utilization of the credit facility. Following the November 2002 downgrade from Moodys, the effective rate of interest on our borrowings under the new revolving credit facility increased from LIBOR plus 175 basis points (1.75%) to LIBOR plus 200 basis points (2.0%). Swing line loans bear interest at the ABR rate plus a spread based on our credit rating and utilization of the new revolving credit facility, or such other rate as is agreed to by us and the swing line lender. We are required to pay quarterly facility fees on unused commitments under the new revolving credit facility, which fees are based upon our credit rating. We also are required to pay an annual administration fee to the administrative agent for the facility. Our obligations and the obligations of our subsidiaries under the new revolving credit facility are collateralized by security interests in substantially all of our assets and the assets of our domestic subsidiaries that guarantee obligations under the facility (other than shares of stock or indebtedness of our subsidiaries that are "restricted subsidiaries" under the terms of our existing public indenture and other than assets that are considered "principal properties" of ours or of our "restricted subsidiaries" under the terms of our existing public indenture). The terms of the new revolving credit facility contain covenants that restrict our ability, and the ability of our subsidiaries, to among other things, incur liens, enter into sale and leaseback transactions, enter into merger, consolidation or asset sale transactions, dispose of capital stock of subsidiaries, incur subsidiary indebtedness and enter into swap transactions. The new revolving credit facility also restricts our ability to, under the terms of our existing public indenture, redesignate "unrestricted subsidiaries" as "restricted subsidiaries" or designate future subsidiaries as "restricted subsidiaries". The new revolving credit facility also contains the following financial covenants: we may not permit our net worth to fall below an amount equal to the sum of (1) $1.15 billion and (2) 25 percent of the sum of our consolidated net earnings for each of the fiscal quarters commencing after September 29, 2002 to and including the most recent fiscal quarter prior to the date on which the net worth calculation is made and (3) 75 percent of the amount by which our net worth has increased as a result of our issuance of capital stock after September 29, 2002; we may not permit the ratio of (1) the sum of our consolidated indebtedness and our securitization financings to (2) the sum of our consolidated indebtedness, securitization financings and net worth to be equal to or greater than 0.55 to 1.0; and 41 we may not permit the ratio of (1) our consolidated EBITDA minus capital expenditures to (2) our consolidated interest expense for any period of four consecutive quarters, to be less than 1.50 to 1.0. For purposes of the financial covenants described above, "net worth," "consolidated net income," "consolidated indebtedness," "consolidated EBITDA," "consolidated interest expense" and other financial measurements are calculated in the manner provided by the terms of the new revolving credit facility agreement. As of December 31, 2002, we did not have any outstanding borrowings under this revolving credit facility and we were in compliance with all of the covenants of this agreement. Equipment Sale Leaseback Agreement In 2001, we entered into a sale leaseback agreement whereby we sold certain manufacturing equipment and leased it back under an operating lease. As a result of the Moodys downgrade in April 2002, and the Standard & Poors downgrade in October 2002, we were required under the lease agreement to obtain irrevocable, unconditional standby letters of credit in an amount of $64 million. The letters of credit were posted to the benefit of the equipment lessor and lenders and will remain in effect until we achieve and maintain a minimum investment grade credit rating for twelve consecutive months. If we had been unable to obtain these letters of credit, we would have satisfied our obligation under the lease agreement by borrowing under our prior revolving credit facility and posting the proceeds as collateral. The November 2002, Moodys downgrade had no effect on this agreement. The equipment sale leaseback transaction is disclosed in Note 18 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Critical Accounting Policies A summary of our significant accounting policies is included in Note 1 of our Consolidated Financial Statements of this annual report. We believe the application of our accounting policies on a consistent basis enables us to provide financial statement users with useful, reliable and timely information about our earnings results, financial condition and cash flows. Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles that oftentimes require management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the reported amounts presented and disclosed in our financial statements. Our management reviews these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience, changes in business conditions and other relevant factors that they believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. In any given reporting period, our actual results may differ from the estimates and assumptions used in preparing our financial statements. Critical accounting policies are those that may have a material impact on our financial statements and also require management to exercise significant judgment due to a high degree of uncertainty at the time estimates are made. Our senior management has discussed the development and selection of our accounting policies, related accounting estimates and the disclosures set forth below with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. We believe our critical accounting policies include those addressing the recoverability and useful lives of assets (including goodwill), estimation of liabilities for product coverage programs and accounting for income taxes, pensions and postretirement benefits. Recoverability of Long lived Assets Our investment in engine manufacturing equipment is depreciated using a modified units of production method. The cost of all other equipment is depreciated using the straight line method. Under the modified units of production method, the service life of our assets is measured in terms of units of product produced rather than the passage of time. Depreciation expense under this 42 method is likewise measured in terms of units of product produced subject to a minimum level or floor. The assumptions and estimates regarding asset service life, residual value and units of production are based on a number of factors, including but not limited to, wear and tear, deterioration, and obsolescence. Actual results could differ from our estimates due to changes in retirement or maintenance practices, the introduction of new technology and new products or other changes that may affect the expected service lives of the assets. We evaluate the carrying value of our long lived assets by performing impairment tests whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate possible impairment. In addition, we perform an annual impairment test for the goodwill that is recorded in our Statement of Financial Position. Product Coverage Costs We estimate and record a liability for product coverage programs, other than product recalls, at the time our products are sold. Our estimates are based on historical experience and reflect managements best estimates of expected costs at the time products are sold and subsequent adjustment to those expected costs when actual costs differ. As a result of uncertainty surrounding the nature and frequency of product recall programs, the liability for such programs is recorded when the recall action is announced. Our warranty liability is affected by component failure rates, repair costs, and the time of failure, partially offset by recovery from certain of our vendors. Future events and circumstances related to these factors could materially change our estimates and require adjustments to our liability. Note 1 of the Consolidated Financial Statements contains a summary of the activity in our product coverage liability account, including adjustments to pre existing warranties during the period. Realization of Deferred Tax Assets We determine our provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Future tax benefits of tax loss and credit carryforwards are also recognized as deferred tax assets. We evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets each quarter by assessing the likelihood of future profitability and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize our net deferred tax assets. At December 31, 2002, the Company has recorded net deferred tax assets of $768 million. These assets include $334 million for the value of tax loss and credit carryforwards that generally have a limited life and begin expiring in 2008. The ultimate realization of our net deferred tax assets will require a higher level of profitability than the Company has achieved in recent years. Having assessed the future profit plans and tax planning strategies together with the years of expiration of carryforward benefits, a valuation allowance of $41 million has been recorded to reduce the tax assets to the net value management believes is more likely than not to be realized. Should the Companys operating performance not improve, future assessments could conclude a larger valuation allowance will be needed to further reduce the deferred tax assets. Factors that may affect our ability to achieve a higher level of profitability include, but are not limited to, a decline in sales or gross margin, loss of market share, increased competition, and existing and future regulatory standards. In addition, we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to tax audits in these jurisdictions. These audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve. However, we believe we have made adequate provision for income taxes for all years that are subject to audit. A more complete description of our income taxes and the future benefits of our tax loss and credit carryforwards are disclosed in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 43  Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits We sponsor a number of pension and other retirement plans in various countries. In the U.S. and the U.K. we have several major defined benefit plans that are separately funded. We account for our pension and other postretirement benefit programs in accordance with SFAS No. 87 "Employers Accounting for Pensions" and SFAS No. 106 "Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions". These standards require that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined using an actuarial basis. As a result, our pension and other postretirement benefit programs are based on a number of statistical and judgmental assumptions that attempt to anticipate future events and are used in calculating the expense and liability related to our plans. These assumptions include a discount rate, an expected return on plan assets rate, a future compensation increase rate, and a health care cost trend rate. In addition, there are also subjective actuarial assumptions relating to retirement age, mortality rates and participant withdrawals. The actuarial assumptions we use may differ significantly from actual results due to changing economic conditions, participant life span, withdrawal rates and changes in actual costs of health care. These differences may result in a material impact to the amount of pension and other post retirement benefit expenses that are recorded. The most significant assumptions used in determining our pension income (expense) in accordance with SFAS No. 87 are the expected return on plan assets and the discount rate for pension expense calculation purposes. In 2001 and 2002, we assumed the expected long term return on our plan assets would be 10 percent for U.S. plans and 8.5 percent for U.K. plans. Over the past two years, global capital market developments have resulted in negative returns on our plan assets and a decline in the discount rate used to estimate the related pension liability. As a result, at November 30, 2002, the present value of our pension obligation (the accumulated benefit obligation or "ABO") exceeded the fair value of its assets, which required us to record a fourth quarter "minimum pension liability" adjustment of $415 million in accordance with SFAS No. 87. The effect of this non cash adjustment was to increase pension liabilities by $415 million, increase intangible assets by $13 million and increase other comprehensive loss, a contra shareholders account, by $402 million ($257 million after tax). If the fair value of the pension plan assets exceeds the ABO in future years, the charge to shareholders equity would be reversed. Alternatively, if the fair market value of the pension plan assets experiences further declines or the discount rate is reduced, additional charges to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) may be required in future periods. The financial ratios and net worth covenants contained in our credit arrangements and debt securities agreements were not affected by the 2002 minimum pension liability adjustment. As a result of lower investment returns experienced in the past two years, we have changed our pension plan asset return assumptions which will impact pension expense in future periods. Our expected long term rate of return on assets has been lowered to 8.5 percent in the U.S. and 8.2 percent in the U.K. with consultation from and the concurrence of our actuaries. The effect of lowering our long term rate of return assumption will increase our 2003 pension expense, as measured in accordance with SFAS No. 87, by approximately $30 million compared to the amount recorded in 2002. In addition, the discount rate for our U.S. plans has declined from 7.25 percent at September 30, 2001, to 7.0 percent at November 30, 2002, and from 6.25 percent at September 30, 2001, to 5.8 percent at November 30, 2002, for our UK plans. During the fourth quarter of 2002, we changed the date for measuring our return on pension plan assets and our minimum liability for pension obligations from September 30 to November 30. We believe this change in measurement dates aligns more closely with the date of our financial statements and provides a more current measurement of plan assets and obligations than previously presented. The impact of this change is reported in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings as a change in accounting principle, and had a favorable cumulative after tax effect of $3 million, or $0.07 per share, recorded as of January 1, 2002. The effect on 2002 net earnings of this accounting change was not material. 44 During 2002 and 2001, we made cash contributions to our pension plans of $81 million and $84 million, respectively, and we expect to make cash contributions of approximately $105 million during 2003. Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements provides a summary of our pension benefit plan activity, the funded status of our plans and the amounts recognized in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 141 (SFAS 141), "Business Combinations" concurrent with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142 (SFAS 142) "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets". We adopted the new accounting standards on January 1, 2002. SFAS 141 requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001. SFAS 141 also provides new criteria in the determination of intangible assets, including goodwill acquired in a business combination, and expands financial disclosures concerning business combinations. The adoption of SFAS 141 did not affect previously reported amounts of goodwill and other intangible assets included in our Statements of Financial Position. SFAS 142 requires that goodwill and certain other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized but instead are allocated to applicable reporting units for purposes of performing annual impairment tests using a two step process. To the extent that impairment exists, we are required to perform a second test to measure the amount of the impairment. During the first quarter 2002, we completed the first step of the transitional goodwill impairment test which required us to compare the fair value of our reporting units to the carrying value of the net assets of our reporting units as of January 1, 2002. For each of our reporting units, the estimated fair value was determined utilizing the expected present value of the future cash flows of the units. Based on this analysis, we concluded that the fair value of each of our reporting units exceeded their carrying, or book value, including goodwill, and therefore we did not recognize any impairment of goodwill. We elected to perform the annual impairment test of our recorded goodwill as required by SFAS 142 as of September 29, 2002, the end of our fiscal third quarter. The results of this annual impairment test indicated that the fair value of each of our reporting units as of September 29, 2002, exceeded their carrying, or book value, including goodwill, and therefore our recorded goodwill was not subject to impairment. As required by SFAS 142, our Consolidated Statements of Earnings for periods prior to its adoption have not been restated. However, the effect on our net earnings and earnings per share of excluding goodwill amortization is shown in Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In August 2001, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets" (SFAS 144), which supersedes SFAS 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to be Disposed Of". This Statement establishes a single accounting model for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets. We adopted the provisions of SFAS 144 on January 1, 2002, as required. The adoption did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position in fiscal 2002. Early Adoption of Accounting Pronouncement In April 2002, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 145, "Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections." (SFAS 145). This Statement, among other amendments, requires that certain gains and losses on the extinguishment of debt previously recorded as extraordinary items be classified as income or loss from continuing operations. In the fourth quarter 2002, we retired our ESOP Trust notes and elected to early adopt the provisions of this statement for fiscal year 2002. We paid $8 million in net 45 premiums for the early retirement of our ESOP Trust Notes and the amount is classified as a separate caption from continuing operations in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings. See Note 8 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. We will adopt the remaining provisions of SFAS 145 in fiscal 2003 and do not expect it to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In June 2001, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations." This Statement establishes standards of accounting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. It requires obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets to be capitalized as part of the carrying value of the related asset. We adopted the provisions of this standard on January 1, 2003. The adoption of SFAS 143 is not expected to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements in fiscal 2003. In June 2002, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard 146, "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities" (SFAS 146). This standard nullifies Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 88 10 "Costs Associated with Lease Modification or Termination" and EITF Issue No. 94 3 "Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring)". SFAS 146 requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized and measured at its fair value when the liability is incurred. We adopted the provisions of SFAS 146 for exit or disposal activities, such as restructuring, involuntarily terminating employees, and costs associated with consolidating facilities, on January 1, 2003. The adoption of SFAS 146 is not expected to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements in fiscal 2003. In November 2002, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 45 (FIN 45), "Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others," an interpretation of SFAS Nos. 5, 57, and 107 and rescission of FASB Interpretation No. 34. FIN 45 elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued. In addition, the interpretation requires an entity to recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, an initial liability for the fair value of an obligation assumed by issuing a guarantee. The disclosure provisions of FIN 45 are effective for financial statements issued after December 15, 2002. The recognition and measurement provisions of FIN 45 are applicable only on a prospective basis for guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our guarantees existing at December 31, 2002, and Note 1 for an analysis of our product coverage liabilities. We adopted the provisions FIN 45 on January 1, 2003. The adoption of FIN 45 is not expected to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements in fiscal 2003. In November 2002, the Emerging Issues Task Force released Issue No. 00 21, "Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables." This Issue provides guidance in determining when an arrangement involving multiple deliverables contains more than one unit of accounting and when more than one unit of accounting exists how the arrangement consideration should be allocated to the multiple units. The application of this issue could affect the timing of revenue recognition for multiple deliverable arrangements. The guidance in this Issue is prospective for revenue arrangements entered into after June 30, 2003. We are in the process of analyzing the impact this EITF will have, if any, on our revenue recognition in future accounting periods. In December 2002, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 148, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure, An Amendment of SFAS No. 123" (SFAS 148). This Statement amends SFAS 123, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation", to provide alternative methods of transition for companies that voluntarily change to the fair value 46 based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation. It also amends the disclosure provisions of that standard to require prominent disclosure about the effects on reported net income of an entitys accounting policy decisions with respect to stock based employee compensation. SFAS 148 also amends Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 28, "Interim Financial Reporting", to require disclosure about those effects in interim financial information. We adopted the provisions of SFAS 123 on January 1, 2003. In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities", an Interpretation of Accounting Research Bulleting No. 51 "Consolidated Financial Statements". FIN 46 provides guidance related to identifying variable interest entities (VIEs), more commonly referred to as special purpose entities (SPES) or off balance sheet structures, and requires each company involved with a special purpose entity to determine whether it provides financial support to the special purpose entity through a variable interest. Variable interests may arise from financial instruments, service contracts, minority ownership interests or other arrangements. If an entity holds a majority of the variable interests, or a significant variable interest that is considerably more than any other partys variable interest, that entity would be required to include the assets, liabilities and results of operations of the special purpose entity in its Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, FIN 46 requires disclosure for both VIEs that are consolidated as well as VIEs that are unconsolidated and hold a significant amount of beneficial interests, but not the majority. The disclosure provisions of FIN 46 are effective for financial statements issued after January 31, 2003, and the consolidation requirements applicable to Cummins are effective after June 15, 2003. Currently, we have three SPEs, two of which are already consolidated (See Notes 4 and 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements). We are assessing the impact of FIN 46 on the third SPE, an entity that is a party to our sale leaseback transaction entered into in 2001. However, we do not believe that it is reasonably possible that the adoption of FIN 46 will result in our consolidation of this SPE (See Note 1 regarding Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Special Purpose Entities). In April 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 149, "Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" (SFAS 149). SFAS 149 amends and clarifies accounting and reporting for derivative instruments and hedging activities under SFAS 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities." The Statement is effective for derivative instruments and hedging activities entered into or modified after June 30, 2003, except for certain forward purchase and sale securities. For forward purchase and sale securities, SFAS 149 is effective for both new and existing securities after June 30, 2003. We do not believe the adoption of this statement will have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In May 2003, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 150, "Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity" (SFAS 150). SFAS 150 establishes accounting standards regarding the classification and measurement of certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. SFAS 150 requires financial instruments meeting certain criteria to be reported as liabilities that were previously reported as equity or were reported as "mezzanine debt" between liabilities and equity. The Companys Convertible Preferred Securities of Subsidiary Trust (Note 9 of the Consolidated Financial Statements) fall within the scope of SFAS No. 150 and will be classified as a liability in our Consolidated Statement of Financial Position effective after June 30, 2003. In addition, payments or accruals of dividends on the preferred securities will also be prospectively classified as interest expense in our Consolidated Statement of Earnings. We do not believe adoption of SFAS No. 150 will have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements and will not effect our compliance with various financing arrangements or our revolving credit facility. 47 Forward Looking Statements This annual report and our press releases, teleconferences and other external communications contain forward looking statements that are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the industries in which we operate and managements beliefs and assumptions. Words, such as "expects," "anticipates," "intends," "plans," "believes," "seeks," "estimates," variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions ("Future Factors") which are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in such forward looking statements. We undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Future Factors include increasing price and product competition by foreign and domestic competitors, including new entrants; rapid technological developments and changes; the ability to continue to introduce competitive new products on a timely, cost effective basis; the mix of products; the achievement of lower costs and expenses; domestic and foreign governmental and public policy changes, including environmental regulations; protection and validity of patent and other intellectual property rights; reliance on large customers; technological, implementation and cost/financial risks in increasing use of large, multi year contracts; the cyclical nature of our business; the outcome of pending and future litigation and governmental proceedings; and continued availability of financing, financial instruments and financial resources in the amounts, at the times and on the terms required to support our future business. These are representative of the Future Factors that could affect the outcome of the forward looking statements. In addition, such statements could be affected by general industry and market conditions and growth rates, general domestic and international economic conditions, including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations, and other Future Factors.  Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. We are exposed to financial risk resulting from changes in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. This risk is closely monitored and managed through the use of financial (derivative) instruments including price swaps, forward contracts and interest rate swaps. As clearly stated in our policies and procedures, financial instruments are used expressly for hedging purposes, and under no circumstances are they used for speculative purposes. Our hedging transactions are entered into with banking institutions that have strong credit ratings, and thus the credit risk associated with these transactions is not considered significant. The results and status of our hedging transactions are reported to senior management on a monthly and quarterly basis. Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contains further information regarding financial instruments and risk management. The following describes our risk exposures and provides results of sensitivity analyses performed on December 31, 2002. The sensitivity test assumes instantaneous, parallel shifts in foreign currency exchange rates, and commodity prices. Foreign Exchange Rates We are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk as a result of our international business presence. We transact extensively in foreign currencies and have significant assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. As a result, our earnings experience some volatility related to movements in foreign currency exchange rates. In order to benefit from global diversification and naturally offsetting currency positions, we enter into forward contracts to hedge our existing exposures (recognized asset and liability) and forecasted transactions. The objective of our hedging program is to 48 reduce the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on earnings by essentially creating offsetting currency exposures. As of December 31, 2002, the potential gain or loss in the fair value of our outstanding foreign currency contracts, assuming a hypothetical 10 percent fluctuation in the currencies of such contracts, would be approximately $.2 million. The sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates assumes the notional value to remain constant for the next 12 months. The analysis ignores the impact of foreign exchange movements on our competitive position and potential changes in sales levels. It should be noted that any change in the value of the contracts, real or hypothetical, would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged items. (See Note 13 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.) Interest Rates We are also exposed to interest rate risk as result of our indebtedness. Our objective in managing our exposure to changes in interests rates is to limit the effect of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall cost of borrowing. To achieve this objective, we primarily use interest rate swap agreements to manage exposure to interest rate changes related to our borrowing arrangements. In November 2002, we terminated an interest rate swap relating to our 6.45% Notes that mature in 2005. The swap converted $225 million notional amount from fixed rate debt into floating rate debt and would have matured in 2005. The termination of this swap resulted in a $12 million gain. The gain is being amortized to earnings as a reduction of interest expense over the remaining life of the debt. The amount of gain recognized in 2002 was $0.9 million. The remaining balance of the deferred gain is classified as "Long term debt" in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. In March 2001, we terminated three fixed to floating interest rate swap agreements related to our 6.25% Notes with principal amount of $125 million due in 2003 and 6.45% Notes with principal amount of $225 million due in 2005. The termination of these swaps resulted in a $9 million gain. The gain is being amortized to earnings as a reduction of interest expense over the remaining life of the debt. The amount of gain recognized in 2002 and 2001 was $2.9 million and $2.5 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2002, we do not own any interest rate swap agreements. (See Note 13 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.) Commodity Prices We are also exposed to fluctuations in commodity prices through the purchase of raw materials as well as contractual agreements with component suppliers. To reduce the effect of raw material price changes for select commodities, we enter into commodity swap contracts to hedge a portion of our anticipated raw material purchases. As of December 31, 2002, the potential gain or loss related to the outstanding commodity swap contracts, assuming a hypothetical 10 percent fluctuation in the price of such commodities, would be approximately $.3 million. The sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in commodity prices assumes the notional value to remain constant for the next 12 months. The analysis ignores the impact of commodity price movements on our competitive position and potential changes in sales levels. It should be noted that any change in the value of the swaps, real or hypothetical, would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged items. (See Note 13 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.)
