Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations When used in this report the terms "Cummins," "the Company," "the registrant," "we," "our," or "us" mean Cummins Inc. and all entities included in our consolidated financial statements. ORGANIZATION OF INFORMATION The following Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD&A") was prepared to provide the reader with a view and perspective of our businesses through the eyes of management and should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes to those financial statements. Our MD&A is presented in the following sections: Executive Summary and Financial Highlights Results of Operations Operating Segment Results Liquidity and Capital Resources Contractual Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments Off Balance Sheet Financing Application of Critical Accounting Estimates Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements Accounting Pronouncements Issued But Not Yet Effective EXECUTIVE SUMMARY AND FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS We are a global power leader that designs, manufactures, distributes and services diesel and natural gas engines, electric power generation systems and engine related component products, including filtration and exhaust aftertreatment, fuel systems, controls and air handling systems. We sell our products to Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs), distributors and other customers worldwide. We have long standing relationships with many of the leading manufacturers in the markets we serve, including Chrysler LLC, Daimler AG, Volvo AB, PACCAR Inc., International Truck and Engine Corporation (Navistar International Corporation), CNH Global N.V., Komatsu, Scania AB, Ford Motor Company and Volkswagen. We serve our customers through a network of more than 500 company owned and independent distributor locations and approximately 5,200 dealer locations in more than 190 countries and territories. Our reportable operating segments consist of the following: Engine, Power Generation, Components and Distribution. This reporting structure is organized according to the products and markets each segment serves. This type of reporting structure allows management to focus its efforts on providing enhanced service to a wide range of customers. The Engine segment produces engines and parts for sale to customers in on highway and various industrial markets. The engines are used in trucks of all sizes, buses and RVs, as well as various industrial applications including construction, mining, agriculture, marine, oil and gas, rail and military. The Power Generation segment is an integrated provider of power systems which sells engines, generator sets and alternators and rents power equipment for both standby and prime power uses. The Components segment includes sales of filtration products, exhaust aftertreatment systems, turbochargers and fuel systems. The Distribution segment includes wholly owned and partially owned distributorships engaged in wholesaling engines, generator sets, and service parts, as well as performing service and repair activities on our products and maintaining relationships with various OEMs throughout the world. Our financial performance depends, in large part, on varying conditions in the markets we serve, particularly the on highway, construction and general industrial markets. Demand in these markets 30 tends to fluctuate in response to overall economic conditions and is particularly sensitive to changes in interest rate levels. Our sales may also be impacted by OEM inventory levels and production schedules and stoppages. Economic downturns in markets we serve generally result in reductions in sales and pricing of our products. As a worldwide business, our operations are also affected by political, economic and regulatory matters, including environmental and emissions standards, in the countries we serve. However, our geographic diversity and broad product and service offerings have helped limit the impact of any one industry and the economy of any single country upon our consolidated results. This was effectively demonstrated in 2007 as we continued to experience strong sales and earnings despite the continued softness in the North American heavy duty truck engine market which was down approximately 50 percent from 2006 levels. More than half of our 2007 sales came from countries other than the United States. The diversity of our business portfolio has contributed to the significant organic growth we have experienced over the past several years continuing into 2007. Financial highlights for the last three years were as follows: Years ended December 31, Consolidated Results 2007 2006 2005 (in millions, except earnings per share) Net sales $ 13,048 $ 11,362 $ 9,918 Gross margin 2,556 2,465 2,044 Investee equity, royalty and other income 205 140 131 Operating earnings 1,158 1,131 894 Net earnings 739 715 550 Diluted earnings per share $ 3.70 $ 3.55 $ 2.75 We continued our strong performance of the past three years into 2007 with a fourth straight year of record net sales and net earnings. Net earnings were $739 million, or $3.70 per diluted share, on sales of $13.0 billion, compared to 2006 net earnings of $715 million, or $3.55 per diluted share, on sales of $11.4 billion. The earnings improvement was driven by a 15 percent increase in net sales and a 4 percent increase in gross margin, as we benefited from improved pricing and higher demand across most of our businesses, increased market share in a number of markets and focused cost reduction efforts. All of our segments reported sales increases for the year compared to 2006, with particularly strong demand in Power Generations commercial and alternator businesses where sales increased 31 percent and 39 percent, respectively, and Components emission solutions and turbocharger businesses, where sales increased 203 percent and 41 percent, respectively. Overall, our Engine segment net sales were up $671 million, or 9 percent year over year benefitting from market share gains in the heavy duty on highway market. In addition, net sales increased at our Power Generation segment (up $644 million, or 27 percent), Components segment (up $651 million, or 29 percent) and Distribution segment (up $155 million, or 11 percent) year over year. During 2007, we continued our commitment to strengthening our balance sheet, investing in profitable growth around the globe and returning value to our shareholders. Key activities included: Financing Matters The Board of Directors authorized a pair of two for one splits of Cummins common stock in 2007. The first split was authorized on March 8, 2007 and was distributed on April 9, 2007, to shareholders of record as of March 26, 2007. The second split was authorized on December 11, 2007 and was distributed on January 2, 2008, to shareholders of record as of December 21, 2007. All share and per share amounts in this filing have been adjusted to reflect both two for one stock splits. During the fourth quarter of 2007, we completed our previously announced share repurchase program. In July 2006, the Board of Directors authorized us to acquire up to eight million shares (adjusted for the impact of a two for one stock split on April 9, 2007 and an additional 31 two for one stock split on January 2, 2008) of Cummins common stock in addition to what had been acquired under previous authorizations. During 2007, we purchased six million shares for approximately $335 million. In July, the Board also voted to increase the quarterly cash dividend per share by 39 percent to $0.125 per share (adjusted for the two for one stock split on January 2, 2008). During 2007, we made contributions of approximately $250 million to our pension plans. As of the end of 2007, our global pension funding was more than 100 percent of our qualified pension obligation. We repaid $62 million of our $120 million 6.75% debentures on February 15, 2007, at the election of the debt holders. The debentures were repaid using cash generated from operations. Our level of debt at December 31, 2007, has decreased by $137 million since December 31, 2006 and our debt to capital ratio has improved to 16.5 percent at December 31, 2007, from 22.4 percent at December 31, 2006. Business Expansion In 2007, we made global investments of $61 million in our unconsolidated joint ventures including $33 million in five new joint ventures and $28 million in additional investments to our existing joint venture businesses. After announcing a feasibility study in the spring of 2006, we signed an agreement in October 2006 with Beiqi Foton Motor Company (Beiqi Foton) to form a 50/50 joint venture, Beijing Foton Cummins Engine Company (BFCEC), to produce two families of Cummins light duty, high performance diesel engines in Beijing. The engines will be used in light duty commercial trucks, pickup trucks, multipurpose and sport utility vehicles. Certain types of marine, small construction equipment and industrial applications will also be served by this engine family. Cummins and Beiqi Foton will initially invest a combined $142 million into BFCEC, which is scheduled to begin production in 2009. In October of 2007, we received approval of the joint venture from the Chinese government and we invested $28 million during the year. In 2007, we made capital expenditures of $353 million which included expenditures of $80 million for the introduction of new products and $136 million to increase our manufacturing capacity around the world. Business Divestiture In November 2007, we sold certain assets of our Universal Silencer (USI) subsidiary, based in Stoughton, Wisconsin, to Stirling Group, LLC. The sale closed in the fourth quarter of 2007 for approximately $36 million and resulted in a pre tax gain of approximately $10 million. USI, which was part of our Components segment, specializes in designing and manufacturing noise control and air filtration products for industrial equipment. Total assets of USI were approximately $24 million at the date of the transaction and $15 million at December 31, 2006, which is less than 1.8 percent of our total assets at those dates. Total sales of USI were approximately $54 million and $47 million, for the ten months ended October 31, 2007 and for the year ended December 31, 2006, respectively, which is less than 0.5 percent of our total company consolidated net sales for both periods. 32 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Years ended December 31, Favorable/ (Unfavorable) Years ended December 31, Favorable/ (Unfavorable) 2007 2006 Amount Percent 2006 2005 Amount Percent (in millions) (in millions) Net sales $ 13,048 $ 11,362 $ 1,686 15 % $ 11,362 $ 9,918 $ 1,444 15 % Cost of sales 10,492 8,897 (1,595 ) (18 )% 8,897 7,874 (1,023 ) (13 )% Gross margin 2,556 2,465 91 4 % 2,465 2,044 421 21 % Operating expenses and income Selling and administrative expenses 1,296 1,153 (143 ) (12 )% 1,153 1,003 (150 ) (15 )% Research and engineering expenses 329 321 (8 ) (2 )% 321 278 (43 ) (15 )% Investee equity, royalty and other income 205 140 65 46 % 140 131 9 7 % Other operating income, net 22 22 NM NM Operating earnings 1,158 1,131 27 2 % 1,131 894 237 27 % Interest income 36 47 (11 ) (23 )% 47 24 23 96 % Interest expense 58 96 38 40 % 96 109 13 12 % Other income (expense), net 33 1 32 NM % 1 (11 ) 12 NM Earnings before income taxes and minority interests 1,169 1,083 86 8 % 1,083 798 285 36 % Provision for income taxes 381 324 (57 ) (18 )% 324 216 (108 ) (50 )% Minority interests in earnings of consolidated subsidiaries 49 44 (5 ) (11 )% 44 32 (12 ) (38 )% Net earnings $ 739 $ 715 $ 24 3 % $ 715 $ 550 $ 165 30 % 2007 vs. 2006 Net Sales Net sales increased due to record sales in all segments. Net sales changes by segment were as follows: 2007 vs. 2006 ($ in millions) Change % Change Engine $ 671 9 % Power Generation 644 27 % Components 651 29 % Distribution 155 11 % Engine sales were higher due to improved pricing on our emission compliant engines, strong demand in almost all on highway and off highway markets and the favorable impact of foreign currency translation. Increased engine sales were due to market share gains in the heavy duty on highway engine market and were partially offset by decreased demand in our North American heavy duty on highway market as a result of the 2007 change in emissions standards. Engine and parts sales to industrial markets were 30 percent higher with increased volumes in all market segments. Power Generation sales increased due to improved pricing and strong organic growth led primarily by increases in commercial generator and alternator sales. Components sales increased primarily due to organic sales growth in our emission solutions, turbocharger and filtration businesses. Distribution sales increased primarily due to increased demand for power generation products followed by increased parts and engine sales which were partially offset by the deconsolidation of one of our North American joint ventures beginning in 2007. The net sales of this joint venture were approximately $163 million in 2006. See our "Operating Segment Results" section for further details on sales by segment. 33 Gross Margin Gross margins improved primarily due to new pricing and increased volumes which were partially offset by increased costs for new products, increased warranty expenses and the deconsolidation of one of our North American joint ventures. Significant drivers impacting gross margins were as follows: 2007 vs. 2006 (in millions) Change Price $ 516 Volume 255 Incremental production costs (419 ) Product mix (97 ) Warranty expense (87 ) Deconsolidation of a joint venture (65 ) Other (12 ) Total $ 91 Gross margin as a percentage of sales declined by 2.1 percentage points as margin percentages declined in three of our segments, primarily driven by the Engine and Components segments. In the Engine segment, price increases for new products were offset by higher new product costs, increased warranty costs and the decreased heavy duty engine volumes. In the Components segment, two of our businesses are experiencing low margins as a result of inefficient production costs associated with meeting extremely strong demand. Warranty expense as a percent of sales increased to 3.1 percent from 2.8 percent in 2006. The increase in warranty expense was expected as the mix of 2007 emissions compliant engines and components increased. As has been our practice and as described in our Critical Accounting Estimates, new product launches require a greater use of judgment in developing estimates until historical experience becomes available. Product specific claims experience is typically available four or five quarters after product launch, with a clear claims experience trend evident eight quarters after launch. We generally record warranty expense for new products upon shipment using a factor based upon historical experience only in the first year, a blend of actual product and historical experience in the second year and product specific experience thereafter. Selling and Administrative Expenses Selling and administrative expenses increased primarily due to increases in infrastructure investments, including the number of employees to provide for our growing business, higher compensation and related expenses of approximately $116 million, which included salaries, variable compensation and fringe benefits, as a result of our improved financial performance. Other factors affecting selling and administrative expenses also included increased consulting fees and other outside services of $32 million. The remaining change in selling and administrative expenses is due to a combination of increases in various other miscellaneous expenses, none of which were individually significant. Overall selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales declined to 9.9 percent in 2007 from 10.1 percent in 2006. Research and Engineering Expenses Research and engineering expenses increased primarily due to higher spending on new product development and critical technologies for 2010 and beyond, including product development for 2010 emissions standards and developing products for new growth areas. The Power Generation and Components segments accounted for $6 million and $5 million of the increase, respectively, which was partially offset by a $3 million decrease in the Engine segment. Fluctuations in other miscellaneous research and development expenses were not significant individually or in the aggregate. 34 Investee Equity, Royalty and Other Income Investee equity, royalty and other income increased primarily due to an increase in earnings at several of our equity investees, led by a $35 million increase in earnings from our North American distributors as the result of organic growth, acquisitions and the deconsolidation of a North American joint venture in 2007. In addition, DCEC increased $22 million, CCEC increased $7 million and Cummins MerCruiser Diesel increased $5 million, while the other joint ventures had slight increases. Other Operating Income, Net The major components of other operating income are gain or loss on sale of fixed assets and businesses and royalty income. The increase in income over 2006 was primarily due to a $17 million increase in gain on sale of fixed assets. In addition, royalty income increased by approximately $2 million in 2007 and legal expenses decreased $3 million compared to 2006. Increases in miscellaneous operating expenses slightly offset the increase in income and were not material. Interest Income Interest income decreased primarily due to lower average cash balances in 2007 compared to 2006. The lower average cash balances were due to significant spending for capital expenditures, repurchases of common stock and pension contributions. Interest Expense Interest expense decreased primarily due to a decline of $137 million in debt balances, partially offset by higher interest rates. Other Income (Expense), Net The major components of other income (expense) include foreign currency exchange gains and losses on translation and transactions, bank charges and other miscellaneous income and expenses. The increase in income in 2007, compared to 2006, is primarily due to a net increase in foreign currency exchange gains of approximately $28 million in 2007 as compared to $11 million in 2006, a $12 million loss on the early extinguishment of debt incurred when we repaid our $250 million 9.5% notes in December 2006 and a $3 million increase in dividend income in 2007. Partially offsetting these increases were several fluctuations in the components of miscellaneous other income and expenses, none of which were individually significant. Provision for Income Taxes Our tax rates have been less than the 35 percent U.S. income tax rate primarily because of lower taxes on foreign earnings and research tax credits. Export tax benefits also reduced our tax rate prior to 2007. Our effective tax rate for 2007 was 32.6 percent compared to 29.9 percent for 2006. The increase is in part due to the full repeal after 2006 of U.S. export tax benefits which reduced our 2006 tax rate by 1.4 percent. Our income tax provision for 2006 also included a $28 million (2.6 percent) benefit for the favorable resolution of tax uncertainties related to prior years offset by a $12 million (1.1 percent) increase for the effect of new Indiana tax legislation. We expect our 2008 effective tax rate to be 35 percent excluding any discrete items that may arise. The research tax credit expired December 31, 2007 and has not yet been renewed by Congress. If the research credit is extended, we would anticipate the 2008 effective tax rate to drop to 34 percent. 35  Minority Interests in Earnings of Consolidated Subsidiaries Minority interests are primarily attributable to CIL, a 51 percent owned subsidiary and Wuxi Holset Engineering Co. Ltd. (Wuxi), a 55 percent owned subsidiary. These two subsidiaries accounted for over 80 percent of the total minority interest in 2007. Earnings at these two subsidiaries increased this year resulting in a combined increase in minority interest earnings of $10 million for 2007 compared to 2006. These increases were partially offset by the deconsolidation of Cummins Eastern Canada LLP (CEC), a 51 percent owned subsidiary, on January 1, 2007. The remainder of the consolidated partially owned subsidiaries had a combination of immaterial increases and decreases in earnings. 2006 vs. 2005 Net Sales Net sales increased due to record sales in all segments. Net sales changes by segment were as follows: 2006 vs. 2005 ($ in millions) Change % Change Engine $ 854 13 % Power Generation 417 21 % Components 281 14 % Distribution 194 16 % Engine sales were higher due to strong demand from heavy and medium duty truck OEMs, higher engine volumes for industrial applications and increased shipments of light duty engines. Engine and part sales to on highway markets were 12 percent higher compared to 2005 with increased volumes in most market segments. Power Generation sales increased due to increased demand across all product lines. Components sales increased due to organic growth in all of our Components businesses. Distribution sales increased due to increased demand for power generation products followed by increased parts, service and engine volumes. See our "Operating Segment Results" section for further details on sales by segment. Gross Margin Gross margin improved primarily due to increased sales, the related absorption benefits on fixed manufacturing costs, and changes in sales mix. Significant drivers impacting gross margins were as follows: 2006 vs. 2005 (in millions) Change Volume $ 415 Price 94 Incremental product cost (43 ) Warranty expense (53 ) Product mix (20 ) Other 28 Total $ 421 Gross margin as a percentage of sales increased by 1.1 percentage points as margin percentages increased in the Engine, Power Generation and Components segments. The increased margins in these segments were primarily the result of higher absorption of fixed manufacturing costs that resulted from higher demand, improved pricing, and manufacturing efficiencies. 36 Warranty expense as a percent of sales increased slightly to 2.8 percent in 2006 compared to 2.7 percent in 2005. Selling and Administrative Expenses Selling and administrative expenses increased primarily due to incremental staffing and higher compensation and related expenses of approximately $64 million, which included salaries, variable compensation and fringe benefits, as a result of our improved financial performance. Other factors affecting selling and administrative expenses included increased consulting fees and other outside services of $33 million, increased marketing and administrative expenses of $18 million and increased travel expenses of $16 million. The remaining change in selling and administrative expenses was due to a combination of increases in various other miscellaneous expenses, none of which were individually significant, partially offset by a favorable foreign currency impact. Overall, selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales remained flat at 10.1 percent for both 2006 and 2005. Research and Engineering Expenses Research and engineering expenses increased primarily due to higher compensation expense and consulting and outside services, as well as higher spending on development programs for future products. We had significant research and engineering expenses across the Engine and Components segments related to new product development for 2007 and beyond as well as research and engineering expenses for growth platforms across geographies. The Engine segment accounted for $24 million of the increase in research and engineering expenses along with an increase in the Components segment of $12 million. Fluctuations in other miscellaneous research and development expenses were not significant individually or in the aggregate. Investee Equity, Royalty and Other Income Investee equity, royalty and other income increased slightly primarily due to an increase in earnings at several of our equity investees, led by an $18 million increase in earnings from our North American distributors, a $6 million increase in earnings from Tata Cummins Ltd. and a $3 million increase in earnings from CCEC. These increases were partially offset by a $17 million decrease in earnings from DCEC, as a result of weakness in the medium duty truck market, due to the continuous tonnage upgrade of Chinas truck industry. Other Operating Income, Net The major components of other operating income are gain or loss on sale of fixed assets and businesses, royalty income and legal expenses. The 2006 results were flat compared to 2005 as a $10 million increase in gain on sale of fixed assets was offset by a $6 million decrease in royalty income, a $3 million increase in legal expenses and $1 million increase in miscellaneous expenses. Interest Income Interest income increased primarily due to higher average cash balances in 2006, compared to 2005. The higher average cash balances were due to increased earnings and stronger cash flows from operations in 2006. Interest Expense Interest expense decreased primarily due to lower debt balances in 2006, compared to 2005, partially offset by higher interest rates. The conversion of our $300 million 7% convertible subordinated debentures during the second quarter resulted in a reduction in interest expense of over $10 million for 2006. 37 Other Income (Expense), Net The major components of other income (expense) include foreign currency exchange gains and losses, bank charges and other miscellaneous income and expenses. The increase in other income in 2006 compared to 2005 was due to a fluctuation in foreign currency exchange gains and losses from a loss of approximately $6 million in 2005 to a gain of approximately $11 million in 2006. These items were partially offset by a $12 million loss on the early extinguishment of debt incurred when we repaid our $250 million 9.5% notes in December 2006. In addition, miscellaneous expenses decreased $4 million compared to 2005 while miscellaneous income increased $3 million over 2005. Provision for Income Taxes Our tax rates have been less than the 35 percent U.S. income tax rate primarily because of lower taxes on foreign earnings, export tax benefits and research tax credits. Our effective tax rate for 2006 was 29.9 percent. Our income tax provision for 2006 was impacted by a $12 million (1.1 percent) increase for the effect of new Indiana tax legislation, and a $28 million (2.6 percent) reduction for the favorable resolution of tax uncertainties related to prior years. Our effective tax rate for 2005 was 27.1 percent. Our 2005 provision was reduced by $16 million (2.0 percent) for the tax benefits of foreign dividend distributions which qualified for a special 85 percent deduction under The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 and by $8 million (1.0 percent) due to the favorable resolution of prior year tax positions which had been in dispute. U.S. export tax benefits also reduced our 2005 tax rate by 2.5 percent compared to 1.4 percent for 2006. These benefits were phased down by The American Jobs Creation Act and repealed after 2006. Minority Interests in Earnings of Consolidated Subsidiaries Minority interests are primarily attributable to CIL, a 51 percent owned subsidiary, CEC, a 51 percent owned subsidiary, and Wuxi, a 55 percent owned subsidiary. These three subsidiaries accounted for over 90 percent of the total minority interest in 2006. Earnings at these three subsidiaries increased this year resulting in a combined increase in minority interest of $7 million for 2006 compared to 2005. In addition, earnings at SEG, a 51 percent owned subsidiary prior to its sale in the fourth quarter of 2006, improved resulting in a $3 million year over year increase in minority interests. The remainder of the consolidated partially owned subsidiaries had a combination of immaterial increases and decreases in earnings. OPERATING SEGMENT RESULTS Our reportable operating segments consist of the following: Engine, Power Generation, Components, and Distribution. This reporting structure is organized according to the products and markets each segment serves. This type of reporting structure allows management to focus its efforts on providing enhanced service to a wide range of customers. The Engine segment produces engines and parts for sale to customers in on highway and various industrial markets. The engines are used in trucks of all sizes, buses and RVs, as well as various industrial applications including construction, mining, agriculture, marine, oil and gas, rail and military. The Power Generation segment is an integrated provider of power systems which sells engines, generator sets and alternators and rents power equipment for both standby and prime power uses. The Components segment includes sales of filtration products, exhaust and aftertreatment systems, turbochargers and fuel systems. The Distribution segment includes wholly owned and partially owned distributorships engaged in wholesaling engines, generator sets, and service parts, as well as performing service and repair activities on our products and maintaining relationships with various OEMs. We use segment EBIT (defined as earnings before interest expense, taxes and minority interests) as a primary basis for the chief operating decision maker to evaluate the performance of each of our operating segments. Segment amounts exclude certain expenses not specifically identifiable to segments. 38 The accounting policies of our operating segments are the same as those applied in the Consolidated Financial Statements. We prepared the financial results of our operating segments on a basis that is consistent with the manner in which we internally disaggregate financial information to assist in making internal operating decisions. We have allocated certain common costs and expenses, primarily corporate functions, among segments differently than we would for stand alone financial information prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). These include certain costs and expenses of shared services, such as information technology, human resources, legal and finance.

The North American on highway heavy duty truck market was down as a result of the 2007 emissions standards change. Total on highway related sales were 56 percent of Engine segment net sales in 2007 compared with 63 percent last year. Industrial markets were strong in 2007 compared to 2006, with increased volumes in most markets, led by construction, mining, marine, agriculture and oil and gas. Segment EBIT Engine segment EBIT decreased over 2006 primarily due to lower engine volumes in the heavy duty on highway markets, the accompanying gross margin impact of lower absorption of fixed manufacturing costs, higher product costs and warranty accrual rates for new emissions compliant products and increased selling and administrative expenses. Gross margins decreased $113 million, or 8 percent, compared to 2006 and the gross margin percentage decreased 2.9 percentage points. Gross margin was lower due to higher material and warranty costs associated with the new 2007 engines. The increase in warranty expense was expected as the mix of 2007 emissions compliant engines increased. As has been our practice, and as described in our Critical Accounting Estimates, new product launches require a greater use of judgment in developing estimates until historical experience becomes available. 41 Selling and administrative expense increased $64 million, or 12 percent, compared to 2006 and remained flat as a percentage of net sales. The 2007 increases in selling and administrative expenses were primarily due to higher payroll costs as the result of 2007 salary increases and an increase in infrastructure investments including the number of employees to provide for the Engine segments growing business. Research and engineering expenses decreased by $3 million, or 1 percent, compared to 2006 and decreased slightly as a percentage of net sales. These overall increased segment expenses were partially offset by higher earnings from joint ventures over last year, primarily due to a $22 million improvement in earnings at DCEC due to strong demand in the Chinese truck market. 2006 vs. 2005 Net Sales Engine segment net sales increased over 2005 primarily due to strong demand across most markets, particularly the North American heavy duty truck market, the stationary power market due to the strong performance of our Power Generation segment and strong industrial market sales. Total on highway related sales were 63 percent of Engine segment net sales during 2006 and 2005. Segment EBIT Engine segment EBIT improved over 2005 primarily due to the higher engine volumes across all major markets, the accompanying gross margin benefits of higher absorption of fixed manufacturing costs and improved pricing and manufacturing efficiencies. Gross margin increased $229 million, or 20 percent, compared to 2005 and the gross margin percentage increased over one percentage point. Selling and administrative expenses increased $69 million, or 15 percent, compared to 2005 and increased slightly as a percentage of net sales. Research and engineering expenses increased $24 million, or 12 percent, compared to 2005 and remained flat as a percentage of net sales. In addition, earnings from joint ventures decreased $13 million compared with 2005, primarily due to a $17 million decrease in earnings at DCEC as a result of weakness in the medium duty truck market, due to the continuous tonnage upgrade of Chinas truck industry.

The decline in the North American truck market sales was partially offset by strong growth in our international sales and North American market share gains. Medium Duty Truck and Bus The increase in medium duty truck and bus sales was due to increased demand for medium duty truck engines internationally and increased shipments of bus engines in North America and internationally compared to 2006. International medium duty truck sales improved due to continued growth in Latin America and Europe, while international bus sales have continued to grow in Chinese and Eastern European markets. The increase in overall North American bus sales is being driven by market share gains within the school bus market. Significant market share gains in the North American medium duty truck market resulted in a sales increase despite a 28 percent decline in the market itself. Light Duty Automotive and RV The increase in light duty automotive sales was primarily due to higher pricing for the 2007 emissions compliant product which was partially offset by decreased demand from Chrysler due to the softening of the U.S. economy in the fourth quarter of 2007. The 2007 total Chrysler unit shipments decreased over last year by approximately 19,800 units, or 12 percent. Global engine shipments to recreational vehicle OEMs decreased compared with 2006 as a result of increased engine purchases in 2006 ahead of the 2007 change in emissions standards. 43  Industrial Industrial sales increased in most markets over last year, primarily due to stronger demand. A summary and discussion of changes in Industrial unit sales by market follows: Industrial Unit Shipments by Market Percent Change 2007 vs. 2006 North American International Global Agriculture 2 % 17 % 5 % Construction % 32 % 17 % Government 61 % 64 % 62 % Marine (20 )% 30 % 16 % Mining (1 )% 25 % 18 % Oil & Gas 6 % 72 % 7 % Rail 131 % (9 )% 5 % Total unit shipments 1 % 31 % 15 % The total percentage of shipments to North America in 2007 was 45 percent as compared to 52 percent in 2006. The overall change in the geographic sales mix was due to the continued strength of the international construction market which was being driven by strong demand in Europe, East Asia, and Latin America. The international mining market demand was up as the strength in commodity prices was driving investment in mining capacity. Sales to the oil and gas market and the commercial marine market increased as sustained oil and natural gas prices continued to drive activity and investments in new equipment and offshore supply vessels. The rail market was up due to increased demand in North America. Stationary Power The increase in sales to stationary power markets is due to the increased intersegment sales to our Power Generation segment. These intersegment sales are eliminated in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings. See the Power Generation Segment Results for a discussion of the increase in net sales. 2006 vs. 2005 Heavy Duty Truck The increase in sales to the heavy duty truck market was primarily driven by the North American truck market as OEMs work to meet growing demand from truck fleets replacing trucks ahead of the 2007 change in emissions standards. Medium Duty Truck and Bus The increase in medium duty truck and bus revenues was due to strong demand ahead of the 2007 change in emissions standards and our growing market share position with North American OEMs in the medium duty truck and bus markets. The increase in medium duty truck and bus engine shipments in North America is due to our increased penetration in this market and an overall increase in demand ahead of the emissions standard changes. The decrease in shipments to international medium duty truck OEMs is primarily due to changes in emissions standards in Brazil to Euro III, effective January 1, 2006. The decrease in international bus engine shipments year over year is due to a large purchase made in 2005 by a customer in China. Light Duty Automotive and RV Sales of light duty automotive engines increased as a result of higher volumes. The majority of the light duty automotive and RV volumes was driven by demand from DaimlerChrysler with shipments of approximately 162,000 units, or a 1 percent increase compared to 2005. Engine shipments to 44 recreational vehicle OEMs increased compared with 2005 due to new product introductions and growing penetration at key OEMs. Industrial Industrial sales increased in most markets over last year, primarily due to stronger demand in those markets. A summary and discussion of changes in Industrial unit sales by market follows: Industrial Unit Shipments by Market Percent Change 2006 vs. 2005 North American International Global Agriculture (3 )% 21 % 1 % Construction 10 % 31 % 20 % Government 98 % 232 % 136 % Marine 39 % % 9 % Mining 11 % 11 % 11 % Oil & Gas 39 % 26 % 39 % Rail 6,600 % 78 % 97 % Total unit shipments 10 % 29 % 18 % The total percentage of shipments to North America in 2006 was 52 percent, as compared to 56 percent in 2005. The overall change in the geographic sales mix was due to the continued strength of the international construction market which was being driven by strong demand in the Middle East and Asia. Total shipments to the construction market increased largely because of the increase in international shipments. The international mining market demand was up as the strength in commodity prices was driving investment in mining capacity. The shipments to the oil and gas market have increased as sustained oil and natural gas prices continue to drive activity and investments in new equipment. In addition, we continue to penetrate this market further with the release of more engine platforms to this application. Other industrial markets had modest increases in shipments compared to 2005. Stationary Power The increase in sales to stationary power markets is due to the increased intersegment sales to our Power Generation segment. These intersegment sales are eliminated in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings. See the Power Generation Segment Results for a discussion of the increase in net sales. Power Generation Segment Results Financial data for the Power Generation segment was as follows: Years ended December 31, Favorable/ (Unfavorable) Years ended December 31, Favorable/ (Unfavorable) 2007 2006 Amount Percent 2006 2005 Amount Percent (in millions) (in millions) External sales $ 2,375 $ 1,880 $ 495 26 % $ 1,880 $ 1,582 $ 298 19 % Intersegment sales 685 536 149 28 % 536 417 119 29 % Net sales 3,060 2,416 644 27 % 2,416 1,999 417 21 % Depreciation and amortization 42 36 (6 ) (17 )% 36 45 9 20 % Research and engineering expenses 34 28 (6 ) (21 )% 28 21 (7 ) (33 )% Investee equity, royalty and other income 17 12 5 42 % 12 9 3 33 % Interest income 6 7 (1 ) (14 )% 7 3 4 NM % Segment EBIT 334 220 114 52 % 220 145 75 52 % Segment EBIT as a percentage of net sales 10.9 % 9.1 % 1.8 percentage points 9.1% 7.3% 1.8 percentage points 45 2007 vs. 2006 Net Sales Power Generation segment net sales increased over 2006, primarily due to increased sales of 31 percent in our commercial business, 39 percent in our alternator business and 10 percent in our consumer business as well as improved pricing in our commercial and alternator businesses. Our commercial business, the largest line of business in this segment, increased as the result of strong demand across most regions, especially EMEA, North America, India and Latin America. The alternator businesses also experienced strong international growth. Net sales benefited from favorable impacts from foreign currency translation. Segment EBIT Power Generation segment EBIT improved over 2006, primarily due to the improved gross margin line as significant price realization, net of increased material costs and the absorption benefit from higher volumes improved segment earnings. Gross margin improved $147 million, or 35 percent, compared to 2006 and the gross margin percentage improved by 1.1 percentage points. Selling and administrative expenses increased $39 million, or 18 percent, compared to 2006, however, improved by 0.6 percentage points as a percentage of net sales. The increase in selling and administrative expenses was primarily due to higher payroll costs and increases in infrastructure investments including the number of employees to provide for the growing Power Generation business. Research and engineering expenses increased by $6 million, or 21 percent, compared to 2006 and remained flat as a percentage of net sales. 2006 vs. 2005 Net Sales Power Generation segment net sales increased over 2005, primarily due to increased demand in the commercial generator and alternator lines of business as well as improved pricing. Our commercial and alternator businesses were up in nearly all markets. Our consumer, power electronics, energy solutions and rental markets also saw modest increases. Partially offsetting the increased sales in these lines of business was the absence of sales from SEG as the business was sold in the fourth quarter of 2006. Segment EBIT Power Generation segment EBIT improved over 2005, primarily due to strong commercial generator set and alternator sales across geographic markets, except China, as well as improved mix and price realization. While material costs, particularly copper, have increased year over year, the segment has been able to absorb these costs through improved pricing. Gross margin improved $92 million, or 28 percent, compared to 2005 and gross margin percentage improved nearly one percentage point. Selling and administrative expenses increased $29 million, or 15 percent, compared to 2005, however, selling and administrative expenses improved by 0.5 percentage points as a percentage of net sales. Research and engineering expenses increased $7 million, or 33 percent, compared to 2005 and increased slightly as a percentage of net sales. 46 Engine Net Sales by Market A summary of unit shipments used in power generation equipment by engine classification follows: Years ended December 31, Favorable/ (Unfavorable) Years ended December 31, Favorable/ (Unfavorable) 2007 2006 Amount Percent 2006 2005 Amount Percent Midrange 31,700 29,200 2,500 9 % 29,200 21,300 7,900 37 % Heavy duty 8,000 6,800 1,200 18 % 6,800 7,200 (400 ) (6 )% High horsepower 10,500 9,300 1,200 13 % 9,300 8,300 1,000 12 % Total unit shipments 50,200 45,300 4,900 11 % 45,300 36,800 8,500 23 % Components Segment Results Financial data for the Components segment was as follows: Years ended December 31, Favorable/ (Unfavorable) Years ended December 31, Favorable/ (Unfavorable) 2007 2006 Amount Percent 2006 2005 Amount Percent (in millions) (in millions) External sales $ 2,007 $ 1,473 $ 534 36 % $ 1,473 $ 1,324 $ 149 11 % Intersegment sales 925 808 117 14 % 808 676 132 20 % Net sales 2,932 2,281 651 29 % 2,281 2,000 281 14 % Depreciation and amortization 59 57 (2 ) (4 )% 57 53 (4 ) (8 )% Research and engineering expenses 73 68 (5 ) (7 )% 68 56 (12 ) (21 )% Investee equity, royalty and other income 4 7 (3 ) (43 )% 7 8 (1 ) (13 )% Interest income 3 2 1 50 % 2 1 1 100 % Segment EBIT 153 107 46 43 % 107 89 18 20 % Segment EBIT as a percentage of net sales 5.2 % 4.7 % 0.5 percentage points 4.7% 4.5% 0.2 percentage points Net sales for our Components segment by business was as follows: Years ended December 31, Favorable/ (Unfavorable) Years ended December 31, Favorable/ (Unfavorable) 2007 2006 Amount Percent 2006 2005 Amount Percent (in millions) (in millions) Turbochargers $ 860 $ 608 $ 252 41 % $ 608 $ 516 $ 92 18 % Fuel Systems 409 395 14 4 % 395 325 70 22 % Emission Solutions 448 148 300 203 % 148 103 45 44 % Filtration 1,215 1,130 85 8 % 1,130 1,056 74 7 % Total net sales $ 2,932 $ 2,281 $ 651 29 % $ 2,281 $ 2,000 $ 281 14 % 2007 vs. 2006 Net Sales Components segment net sales increased over 2006, primarily due to increased demand across all businesses and all geographic markets, but were primarily driven by strong demand in our emission solutions and turbocharger businesses. We also experienced increased sales in our filtration and fuel systems businesses. All of our businesses benefited from OEM sales of new products to allow their customers to meet new on highway emissions standards in North America and Europe as well as from increases in aftermarket volume. We also experienced favorable impacts from foreign currency translation. 47 Segment EBIT Components segment EBIT improved over 2006, primarily due to increased volumes and gross margins in most Component businesses and the sale of a business. Gross margin improved $68 million, or 20 percent, compared to 2006, however, the gross margin percentage decreased 1.1 percentage points. Gross margin percentages were unfavorably impacted by higher metal costs and new product introduction costs. In addition, both our emission solutions and turbo technologies businesses experienced low margins as the result of costs associated with meeting extremely strong demand. Selling and administrative expenses increased $30 million, or 17 percent, compared to 2006, however, selling and administrative expense improved by 0.7 percentage points as a percentage of net sales. The increase in selling and administrative expenses was primarily due to higher payroll costs and increases in infrastructure investments including the number of employees to provide for the growing Components business. Research and engineering expenses increased by $5 million, or 7 percent, compared to 2006, however, research and engineering expenses improved by 0.5 percentage points as a percentage of net sales. Segment EBIT was also favorably impacted by the $10 million gain on the sale of Universal Silencer. 2006 vs. 2005 Net Sales Components segment net sales increased over 2005 primarily due to strong demand in our turbocharger and fuel systems businesses. The segment had increased sales across all businesses and all geographic markets. In addition, the segment had strong growth in North America and Europe with increases in both aftermarket volume and OEM volume. Segment EBIT Components segment EBIT improved over 2005, primarily due to increased volumes and gross margins. Gross margin increased $59 million, or 20 percent, compared to 2005 and the gross margin percentage improved nearly one percentage point, primarily due to improved volume and improved pricing. Selling and administrative expenses increased $26 million, or 17 percent, compared to 2005, and increased slightly as a percentage of net sales. Research and engineering expenses increased $12 million, or 21 percent, compared to 2005 and increased slightly as a percentage of net sales. Research and engineering expenses increased due to additional investment in the development of a number of new products and critical technologies that were launched in 2007 and beyond. Distribution Segment Results Financial data for the Distribution segment was as follows: Years ended December 31, Favorable/ (Unfavorable) Years ended December 31, Favorable/ (Unfavorable) 2007 2006 Amount Percent 2006 2005 Amount Percent (in millions) (in millions) External sales $ 1,537 $ 1,369 $ 168 12 % $ 1,369 $ 1,176 $ 193 16 % Intersegment sales 3 16 (13 ) (81 )% 16 15 1 7 % Net sales 1,540 1,385 155 11 % 1,385 1,191 194 16 % Depreciation and amortization 11 11 % 11 15 4 27 % Investee equity, royalty and other income 92 54 38 70 % 54 34 20 59 % Interest income 1 2 (1 ) (50 )% 2 3 (1 ) (33 )% Segment EBIT 187 144 43 30 % 144 107 37 35 % Segment EBIT as a percentage of net sales 12.1 % 10.4 % 1.7 percentage points 10.4% 9.0% 1.4 percentage points 48 2007 vs. 2006 Net Sales Distribution segment net sales increased over 2006, primarily due to increased demand in Europe and the Middle East, despite the deconsolidation of one of our North American joint ventures in 2007. The net sales of this previously consolidated joint venture accounted for approximately $163 million, or 12 percent, of net sales for the Distribution segment for 2006. The strong organic growth was led by increases in power generation volumes in Europe and the Middle East, followed by engine and parts volumes and the favorable impact of foreign currency translation. Segment EBIT Distribution segment EBIT improved over 2006, primarily due to investee equity, royalty and other income led by a $35 million increase from our North American Distributors. Gross margin improved $14 million, or 5 percent, compared to 2006, however, the gross margin percentage decreased 1.4 percentage points. The decrease in gross margin percentage was primarily due to the deconsolidation of one of our North American joint ventures in 2007. Selling and administrative expenses increased $15 million, or 6 percent, compared to 2006, however, selling and administrative expenses improved by 0.7 percentage points as a percentage of net sales. The increase in selling and administrative expenses was primarily due to higher payroll costs as the result of 2007 salary increases, an increase in infrastructure investments, including the number of employees to provide for the growing Distribution business and unfavorable foreign currency translation. 2006 vs. 2005 Net Sales Distribution net sales increased over 2005, primarily due to increased demand in the Middle East, Europe and the South Pacific. The higher net sales were led by increases in power generation volume followed by parts, service and engine volume. The Middle East was the primary driver for the higher power generation volume, accounting for over half of the increase. Parts and service and engine volumes were up throughout several geographic markets, most notably Europe, East Asia and the Middle East. Segment EBIT Distribution segment EBIT improved over 2005, primarily due to higher gross margins resulting from increased demand for engines, parts and power generation equipment. Gross margin improved $37 million, or 14 percent, compared to 2005, however, the gross margin percentage decreased slightly due to an unfavorable shift in mix from parts to engines and generator sets. The increase in gross margin was partially offset by higher selling and administrative expenses. Selling and administrative expenses increased $25 million, or 12 percent compared to 2005, however, selling and administrative expenses improved by over 0.5 percentage points as a percentage of net sales. Also contributing to the increase in segment EBIT year over year was a $20 million increase in investee equity earnings primarily attributable to an $18 million increase in earnings at our North American distributors. Geographic Markets Sales to international markets were 54 percent of total net sales in 2007, compared with 50 percent of total net sales in 2006 and 51 percent of total net sales in 2005. 49 A summary of net sales (dollar amount and percentage of total) by geographic territory follows (dollars in millions): Years ended December 31, (in millions) 2007 2006 2005 United States $ 6,007 46 % $ 5,719 50 % $ 4,832 49 % Asia/Australia 2,444 19 % 1,794 16 % 1,682 17 % Europe/CIS 2,326 18 % 1,633 14 % 1,406 14 % Mexico/Latin America 1,171 9 % 886 8 % 819 8 % Canada 405 3 % 743 7 % 728 7 % Africa/Middle East 695 5 % 587 5 % 451 5 % Total international 7,041 54 % 5,643 50 % 5,086 51 % Total consolidated net sales $ 13,048 100 % $ 11,362 100 % $ 9,918 100 % 50  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Managements Assessment of Liquidity We believe our financial condition and liquidity are strong. We assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate adequate cash to fund our operating, investing and financing activities. Cash provided by operations is our principal source of liquidity. At December 31, 2007, we believe our liquidity with cash and cash equivalents of $577 million, marketable securities of $120 million, $615 million available under our revolving credit facility, $277 million, based on eligible receivables, available under our accounts receivable program and $119 million available under international credit facilities together with our operating cash flows and borrowing capacity provide us with the financial flexibility needed to fund working capital, debt service obligations, capital expenditures, projected pension obligations, common stock repurchases, dividend payments and expansion in emerging markets. As of December 31, 2007, there were no amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility or our receivable sales program. Working Capital Summary We fund our working capital with cash from operations and short term borrowings when necessary. Various assets and liabilities, including short term debt, can fluctuate significantly from month to month depending on short term liquidity needs. As a result, working capital is a prime focus of management attention. 2007 2006 (in millions) Current assets $ 4,815 $ 4,488 Current liabilities 2,711 2,399 Working capital $ 2,104 $ 2,089 Current ratio 1.78 1.87 Days sales in receivables 53 52 Inventory turnover 6.5 6.7 Current assets increased $327 million, primarily due to a $231 million increase in receivables driven by the increase in net sales and a $299 million increase in inventories. These increases were partially offset by a $263 million decline in cash and cash equivalents (see Cash Flows below). Current liabilities increased $312 million, primarily due to an increase in accounts payables of $159 million and increases in accrued warranty, compensation and other accrued liabilities of $64 million, $56 million and $78 million, respectively, all due to business expansions. These increases were partially offset by a decline in short term borrowings of $45 million. Cash Flows Cash and cash equivalents decreased by $263 million during the year ended December 31, 2007. The change in cash and cash equivalents is as follows: 2007 2006 2005 (in millions) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 810 $ 840 $ 760 Net cash used in investing activities (515 ) (277 ) (212 ) Net cash used in financing activities (576 ) (508 ) (372 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 18 6 (8 ) Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents $ (263 ) $ 61 $ 168 51 Cash From Operations Net cash provided by operating activities declined $30 million in 2007, compared to 2006, primarily due to a $79 million decrease in the deferred income tax provision, partially offset by a $41 million decrease in cash used for working capital and a decrease in pension contributions of $16 million. Net changes in working capital utilized $150 million in cash during 2007, compared to utilizing $191 million in 2006. Cash utilized for working capital tends to fluctuate from period to period based on various factors including sales and production volumes as well as timing. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon a variety of variables and assumptions including return on invested assets, market interest rates and levels of voluntary contributions to the plans. Better than expected investment returns and additional voluntary contributions have improved the funded status of all plans, helping to minimize future required funding. We continued making additional pension contributions by contributing $250 million to our pension plans during the year. Our qualified pension plans are currently over 100 percent funded. We anticipate making contributions of $95 million to $105 million to our pension plans in 2008 and paying approximately $53 million in claims and premiums for other postretirement benefits. The $250 million of 2007 pension contributions included voluntary contributions of $220 million. These contributions and payments include payments from Company funds to either increase pension plan assets or to make direct payments to plan participants. Net cash provided by operating activities improved $80 million in 2006, compared to 2005, primarily due to $165 million of higher net earnings and a $96 million decrease in cash utilized for working capital, partially offset by an increase in pension funding of $115 million and a decrease in cash provided by changes in long term liabilities of $65 million. Net changes in working capital utilized $191 million in cash during 2006 compared to utilizing $287 million in 2005, or a net decrease in cash utilized for working capital of $96 million year over year. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities increased $238 million in 2007, compared to 2006. The increase was primarily due to a $104 million increase in capital expenditures, a $57 million outflow for the purchase of long term investments, an increase of $48 million in cash used for investments in and advances to equity investees and an increased outflow of $18 million for the acquisition of businesses, the majority of which was to acquire the remaining 50 percent equity ownership in a 50/50 joint venture. Capital expenditures for 2007 increased 42 percent to support our growth, and included investments to increase capacity and to fund development of our new products. Our investments in capacity improvements and development of new products are accelerating across all of our businesses and are designed for future growth opportunities. We continue to invest at least half of our capital in low cost regions of the world to further leverage our opportunities for cost reduction and future growth opportunities. Capital expenditures for all of 2007 were $353 million to support these initiatives. We expect capital expenditures to total approximately $550 million to $600 million in 2008. In addition, we expect to invest approximately $70 million on new and existing joint ventures in 2008. Net cash used in investing activities increased $65 million in 2006 compared to 2005. The increase was primarily due to higher capital expenditures of $76 million, which includes an increase in investments in internal use software of $13 million. Net cash utilized for purchases of marketable securities in 2006 was $30 million as we increased our short term investment holdings as opposed to 2005 when we were in a net liquidation of securities position with net cash proceeds of $3 million. Significant sources of cash from investing activities year over year included increased proceeds from the disposal of equipment of $28 million as well as $24 million of proceeds from the sale of SEG. The majority of our capital spending in 2006 was primarily for new product introduction, capacity expansion, manufacturing equipment, and tooling for new products. 52 Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities increased $68 million in 2007, compared to 2006. The majority of the increase in cash outflows is due to the increase in repurchases of common stock of $214 million and a decrease in the proceeds from borrowings of $79 million, which was partially offset by a $256 million decrease in payments on borrowings and capital leases. In the first quarter of 2007, approximately $62 million of our $120 million 6.75% debentures were repaid on February 15, 2007, at the election of the debt holders. Our total debt was $674 million as of December 31, 2007, compared with $811 million at December 31, 2006. Total debt as a percent of our total capital, including total long term debt, was 16.5 percent at December 31, 2007, compared to 22.4 percent at December 31, 2006. Included in long term debt at December 31, 2007 and 2006, was $49 million and $60 million, respectively, attributable to consolidating a leasing entity under the provisions of FIN 46R (see Notes 3 and 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Also included in short term and long term debt at December 31, 2007, was $25 million from the consolidation of a joint venture consolidated under the provisions of FIN 46R (see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). The consolidation of these entities did not materially impact our 2007 or 2006 net earnings nor did it affect compliance with any of our debt covenants. We do not expect the consolidation of these entities to have a material impact on net earnings or affect our compliance with debt covenants in future periods. As of December 31, 2006, short term and long term debt also included amounts from the FIN 46R consolidation of CEC which was deconsolidated in 2007 (see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the deconsolidation). In July 2006, the Board of Directors authorized us to acquire up to eight million shares (adjusted for the impact of a two for one stock split on April 9, 2007 and an additional two for one stock split on January 2, 2008) of Cummins common stock. In 2007, we repurchased approximately $335 million of common stock, at an average cost of $55.76 per share (adjusted for the impact of both two for one stock splits), representing approximately six million shares. This concluded the share repurchase program authorized by the Board of Directors in July 2006. As of December 31, 2006, two million shares (adjusted for the impact of both two for one stock splits announced in 2007) had been purchased under the plan. In December 2007, the Board of Directors authorized the acquisition of up to $500 million worth of Cummins common stock which we plan to begin purchasing in 2008. The share repurchase program is expected to be a significant use of our cash flows in 2008 and future years, however, total repurchases may vary quarter to quarter depending on other investing and financing activities, market conditions, or restrictions. In July 2007, the Board of Directors voted to increase the quarterly cash dividend per share by 39 percent and increased cash dividends to $0.125 per common share (adjusted for the two for one stock split on January 2, 2008) in the third and fourth quarter of 2007. Dividends per share paid to common shareholders for the years ended December 31, were as follows: Quarterly Dividends (adjusted for the two for one stock splits in 2007 and 2008) 2007 2006 2005 First Quarter $ 0.09 $ 0.075 $ 0.075 Second Quarter 0.09 0.075 0.075 Third Quarter 0.125 0.09 0.075 Fourth Quarter 0.125 0.09 0.075 Total dividends paid to common shareholders for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 were $89 million, $66 million, and $56 million, respectively. Declaration and payment of dividends in the future depends upon earnings and liquidity position, among other factors. Net cash used in financing activities increased $136 million in 2006, compared to 2005. In 2006, we repaid our $250 million 9.5% notes while in 2005 we repaid our $225 million 6.45% notes. The other 53 significant use of cash in financing activities when comparing 2006 to 2005 relates to repurchases of our common stock. In 2006, we completed our previously announced $100 million stock repurchase and we began repurchasing stock under a new repurchase plan that began in the third quarter of 2006. Year over year our stock repurchases increased $83 million. Also contributing to the increase, to a lesser extent, was a decrease in the proceeds from the issuance of common stock of $21 million and an increase in dividend payments due to the 20 percent increase in quarterly dividends that the board approved in July 2006. During the third quarter of 2006, we extended a lease related to a portion of our rental business by six years. The lease was set to expire on September 30, 2006. Instead of paying a balloon payment of approximately $42 million on September 30, 2006, the amount was financed over a six year term at a fixed rate. In addition to extending this lease, we reduced the interest rate by approximately 2 percentage points. During the fourth quarter of 2006, we refinanced a lease related to another portion of our rental business. Under the terms of the agreement which was effective as of January 1, 2007, the new lease has a six year term and the interest rate is approximately 2 percentage points lower than the existing lease. The total amount refinanced was approximately $28 million. Both leases were treated as capital leases both before and after the changes. For more information regarding our rental business and related lease agreements, see Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In July 2006, we amended and extended the lease on our corporate headquarters facility to 2019. The total rental payments to be made over the revised lease term are approximately $59 million. As a result of this extension, we were required to re evaluate the classification of this lease. Based on the terms of the extension, this lease is now classified as a capital lease. As a result, our long term debt increased by approximately $40 million. On May 8, 2006, the Board of Directors approved our plan to redeem all of the 7% convertible quarterly income preferred securities that were issued in June 2001. On May 9, 2006, we gave the trustee our formal irrevocable notification of our intent to redeem the preferred securities. This notification provided the holders of the preferred securities 30 days in which to convert their securities into shares of common stock. Upon expiration of the notification period, all remaining securities not converted were redeemed for cash at a premium above liquidation value. Substantially all of the $300 million 7% convertible subordinated debentures outstanding were converted into shares of our common stock during the second quarter of 2006. As a result of the conversion, approximately 25.2 million shares (adjusted for the impact of a two for one stock split on April 9, 2007 and an additional two for one stock split on January 2, 2008) of common stock were issued during the second quarter which resulted in an increase of approximately $15 million to common stock outstanding and an increase of approximately $276 million to additional paid in capital. Since substantially all holders converted their preferred securities to common stock, the loss on extinguishment of this debt was insignificant. In September 2005, we announced our intention to repay the $250 million 9.5% notes in December 2006, the first call date for the debt. The notes were issued in November 2002 and were repaid in December 2006 using cash generated from operations. We paid a premium of approximately $12 million due to the early retirement of this debt. Financial Covenants and Credit Rating A number of our contractual obligations and financing agreements, such as our revolving credit facility and our equipment sale leaseback agreements have restrictive covenants and or pricing modifications that may be triggered in the event of downward revisions to our corporate credit rating. There have been no events in 2007 to impede our compliance with these covenants. On July 20, 2007, Fitch upgraded our senior unsecured debt ratings from "BBB " to "BBB" and revised our outlook to stable citing the continued improvement in Cummins balance sheet, increased sales diversification, an improved competitive profile and solid operating performance in North America in 2007 despite the downturn in the heavy truck cycle, among other factors. On August 16, 54 2007, Standard & Poors (S&P) upgraded our outlook from stable to positive as S&P cited Cummins prospects for continued good operating performance and its improved financial profile resulting from a steady reduction in financial leverage over the last several years. Our current ratings and outlook from each of the credit rating agencies are shown in the table below. Credit Rating Agency Senior L T Debt Rating S T Debt Rating Outlook Moodys Investors Service, Inc. Baa3 Non Prime Stable Standard & Poors BBB NR Positive Fitch BBB BBB Stable CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND OTHER COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS A summary of payments due for our contractual obligations and commercial commitments, as of December 31, 2007, is shown in the tables below: Contractual Cash Obligations 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 After 2012 Total (in millions) Loans payable $ 13 $ $ $ $ 13 Long term debt and capital lease obligations(1) 182 184 129 1,540 2,035 Operating leases 50 68 32 30 180 Capital expenditures 584 1,166 949 409 3,108 Purchase commitments for inventory 573 1 1 1 576 Other purchase commitments 136 53 17 1 207 Joint venture funding commitments(2) 9 26 35 Pension funding(3) 100 100 Other postretirement benefits 53 108 106 228 495 Total $ 1,700 $ 1,606 $ 1,234 $ 2,209 $ 6,749 (1)Includes principal payments and expected interest payments based on the terms of the obligations.

(3)Our minimum required pension funding in the U.S. is zero and approximately $20 million to $25 million in the U.K. for 2008. The contractual obligations reported above exclude our unrecognized tax benefits of $49 million, all of which is non current, as of December 31, 2007. We are not able to reasonably estimate the period in which cash outflows relating to uncertain tax contingencies could occur. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.

In July 2007, we amended the agreement to extend the facility until July 2010, and raised the purchase limitation from $200 million to $400 million. The agreement also provides us with an option to increase the purchase limitation up to $500 million upon approval. As necessary, CTR may transfer a direct interest in its receivables, without recourse, to the financial institution. To maintain a balance in the designated pools of receivables sold, we sell new receivables to CTR as existing receivables are collected. Receivables sold to CTR in which an interest is not transferred to the financial institution are included in "Receivables, net" on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The maximum interest in sold receivables that can be outstanding at any point in time is limited to the lesser of $400 million or the amount of eligible receivables held by CTR. There are no provisions in this agreement that require us to maintain a minimum investment credit rating; however, the terms of the agreement contain the same financial covenants as our revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, there were no amounts outstanding under this program. Financing Arrangements for Related Parties In accordance with the provisions of various joint venture agreements, we may purchase and or sell products and components from/to the joint ventures and the joint ventures may sell products and components to unrelated parties. The transfer price of products purchased from the joint ventures may differ from normal selling prices. Certain joint venture agreements transfer product to us at cost, some transfer product to us on a cost plus basis and other agreements provide for the transfer of products at market value. We purchase significant quantities of mid range diesel and natural gas engines, components and service parts from CDC, a general partnership that was formed in 1980 with J. I. Case (Case) to jointly fund engine development and manufacturing capacity. Cummins and Case (now CNH Global N.V.) are general partners and each partner shares 50 percent ownership in CDC. Under the terms of the agreement, CDC is obligated to make its entire production of diesel engines and related products available solely to the partners. Each partner is entitled to purchase up to one half of CDCs actual production and a partner may purchase in excess of one half of actual production to the extent productive capacity is available beyond the other partners purchase requirement. The partners are each obligated, unconditionally and severally, to purchase annually at least one engine or engine kit produced by CDC, provided a minimum of one engine or engine kit is produced. The transfer price of CDCs engines to the partners must be sufficient to cover its manufacturing cost in such annual accounting period, including interest and financing expenses, but excluding depreciation expense (other than Scheduled Depreciation Expense as defined in the agreement). In addition, each partner is obligated to contribute one half of the capital investment required to maintain plant capacity and each partner has the right to invest unilaterally in plant capacity, which additional capacity is available to the other partner for a fee. To date, neither partner has made a unilateral investment in plant capacity at CDC. We are not a guarantor of any of CDCs obligations or commitments. However, we are required as a partner to provide up to 50 percent of CDCs base working capital as defined by the agreement. The amount of base working capital is calculated each quarter and if supplemental funding greater than the base working capital amount is required, the amount is funded through third party financing arranged by CDC, or we may elect to fund the requirement, although we are under no obligation to do so. To date, when supplemental funding is required above the base working capital amount, we have elected to provide that funding to CDC. If the amount of supplemental funding required is less than the base working capital amount, it is funded equally by the partners. Excess cash generated by CDC is remitted 56 to Cummins until CDCs working capital amount is reduced to the base working capital amount. Any further cash remittances from CDC to the partners are shared equally by the partners. Under the provisions of FIN 46R, CDC and another engine manufacturing entity jointly owned and operated by us are considered VIEs and we are deemed the primary beneficiary of these VIEs by virtue of our pricing arrangements with them and substantial product purchases from them. As a result, we consolidate the assets and liabilities of CDC and the other engine manufacturer into our Consolidated Financial Statements. For a further discussion of the impact of adopting FIN 46R, see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES A summary of our significant accounting policies is included in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements of this annual report which discusses accounting policies that we have selected from acceptable alternatives. There were no accounting policies adopted during 2007 that had a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP which often requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the reported amounts presented and disclosed in the financial statements. Our management reviews these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience, changes in business conditions and other relevant factors they believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. In any given reporting period, our actual results may differ from the estimates and assumptions used in preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements. Critical accounting estimates are defined as follows: the estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the estimate was made; different estimates reasonably could have been used; or if changes in the estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period and the change would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Our senior management has discussed the development and selection of our accounting policies, related accounting estimates and the disclosures set forth below with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. We believe our critical accounting estimates include those addressing the estimation of liabilities for warranty programs, accounting for income taxes, pension benefits and annual assessment of recoverability of goodwill. Warranty Programs We estimate and record a liability for warranty programs, primarily base warranty and other than product recalls, at the time our products are sold. Our estimates are based on historical experience and reflect managements best estimates of expected costs at the time products are sold and subsequent adjustment to those expected costs when actual costs differ. As a result of the uncertainty surrounding the nature and frequency of product recall programs, the liability for such programs is recorded when we commit to a recall action, which generally occurs when it is announced. Our warranty liability is generally affected by component failure rates, repair costs and the time of failure. Future events and circumstances related to these factors could materially change our estimates and require adjustments to our liability. New product launches require a greater use of judgment in developing estimates until historical experience becomes available. Product specific experience is typically available four or five quarters after product launch, with a clear experience trend evident eight quarters after launch. We generally record warranty expense for new products upon shipment using a factor based upon historical experience only in the first year, a blend of actual product and historical experience in the second year and product specific experience thereafter. Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements contains a summary of the activity in our warranty liability account for 2007 and 2006 including adjustments to pre existing warranties. 57 Accounting for Income Taxes We determine our provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Future tax benefits of tax loss and credit carryforwards are also recognized as deferred tax assets. We evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets each quarter by assessing the likelihood of future profitability and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize our net deferred tax assets. At December 31, 2007, we recorded net deferred tax assets of $543 million. These assets include $39 million for the value of tax loss and credit carryforwards. A valuation allowance of $24 million has been recorded to reduce the tax assets to the net value management believes is more likely than not to be realized. In the event our operating performance deteriorates, future assessments could conclude that a larger valuation allowance will be needed to further reduce the deferred tax assets. In addition, we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to tax audits in these jurisdictions. These audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve. We reduce our net tax assets for the estimated additional tax and interest that may result from tax authorities disputing uncertain tax positions we have taken and we believe we have made adequate provision for income taxes for all years that are subject to audit based upon the latest information available. A more complete description of our income taxes and the future benefits of our tax loss and credit carryforwards is disclosed in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Pension Benefits We sponsor a number of pension plans primarily in the U.S. and the U.K. and to a lesser degree in various other countries. In the U.S. and the U.K. we have several major defined benefit plans that are separately funded. We account for our pension programs in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 87, "Employers Accounting for Pensions," (SFAS 87) and SFAS No. 158, "Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132 (R)" (SFAS 158). SFAS 87 requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined using an actuarial basis. As a result, our pension benefit programs are based on a number of statistical and judgmental assumptions that attempt to anticipate future events and are used in calculating the expense and liability related to our plans. These assumptions include discount rates used to value liabilities, assumed rates of return on plan assets, future compensation increases, employee turnover rates, actuarial assumptions relating to retirement age, mortality rates and participant withdrawals. The actuarial assumptions we use may differ significantly from actual results due to changing economic conditions, participant life span and withdrawal rates. These differences may result in a material impact to the amount of net periodic pension expense to be recorded in our Consolidated Financial Statements in the future. SFAS 158 requires an employer to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through comprehensive income. The Statement also requires an employer to measure the funded status of a plan as of the date of its year end statement of financial position. We adopted SFAS 158, except for the measurement date change, as required on December 31, 2006. We will adopt the measurement date change effective January 1, 2008. The expected long term return on plan assets is used in calculating the net periodic pension expense. We considered several factors in developing our expected rate of return on plan assets. The long term rate of return considers historical returns and expected returns on current and projected asset allocations and is generally applied to a 5 year average market value of return. The long term rate of return on plan assets represents an estimate of long term returns on an investment portfolio consisting of a mixture of equities, fixed income, real estate and other miscellaneous investments. The differences between the actual return on plan assets and expected long term return on plan assets are 58 recognized in the asset value used to calculate net periodic expense over five years. The table below sets forth the expected return assumptions used to develop our pension expense for the period 2005 2007 and our expected rate for 2008. Long Term Expected Return Assumptions 2008 2007 2006 2005 U.S. Plans 8.25 % 8.50 % 8.50 % 8.50 % Non U.S. Plans 7.25 % 7.24 % 7.24 % 7.56 % A lower expected rate of return will increase our net periodic pension expense and reduce profitability. The difference between the expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred from recognition in our results of operations and, under certain circumstances such as when the difference exceeds 10 percent of the market value of plan assets or the projected benefit obligation (PBO), amortized over future years of service. This is also true of changes to actuarial assumptions. As of December 31, 2007, we had net pension actuarial losses of $341 million and $226 million for the U.S. and non U.S. pension plans, respectively. Under SFAS 158, the actuarial gains and losses are recognized and recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. As these amounts exceed 10 percent of our PBO, the excess is amortized over the average remaining service lives of participating employees. The table below sets forth the net periodic pension expense for the period 2005 2007 and our expected expense for 2008. 2008 2007 2006 2005 Pension Expense (in millions) $ 72 $ 98 $ 120 $ 103 The decrease in periodic pension expense in 2007 and 2008 is due to higher expected returns on assets driven by the significant pension contributions we made in 2006 and 2007. In addition, our expense is expected to decline as the amortization of prior investment losses begins to be replaced with the amortization of prior investment gains. Another key assumption used in the development of the net periodic pension expense is the discount rate. The discount rates used to develop our net periodic pension expense are set forth in the table below. Discount Rates 2008 2007 2006 2005 U.S. Plans 6.10 % 5.60 % 5.60 % 5.75 % Non U.S. Plans 5.80 % 4.96 % 4.95 % 5.30 % Changes in the discount rate assumptions will impact the interest cost component of the net periodic pension expense calculation. 59  The discount rate enables us to state expected future cash payments for benefits as a present value on the measurement date. The guidelines for setting this rate are discussed in EITF D 36 which suggests a high quality corporate bond rate. We used bond information provided by Standard & Poors for the U.S. and iBoxx for the U.K. All bonds used to develop our hypothetical portfolio in the U.S. and U.K. were high quality, non callable bonds (AA or better) as of November 30, 2007. The average yield of this hypothetical bond portfolio was used as the benchmark for determining the discount rate to be used to value the obligations of the plans subject to SFAS 87 and SFAS No. 106, "Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions." Our model called for 60 years of benefit payments. For the U.S. plans, the sum of the cash flows from the 60 bonds matched the cash flow from the benefit payment stream upon completion of the process. The number of bonds purchased for each issue was used to determine the price of the entire portfolio. The discount rate benchmark was set to the internal rate of return needed to discount the cash flows to arrive at the portfolio price. In developing the U.K. discount rate, excess cash flows resulted in the early years of the 60 year period when the sum of the cash flow from the bonds maturing in later years exceeded the benefit payments in early years, thus no bonds maturing in early years are needed. As a result, the price of the entire portfolio of bonds was too high because all benefit payments were covered with excess cash flow remaining. We made no adjustment to the cash flow and the discount rate was determined as the internal rate of return needed to discount the cash flows to arrive at the portfolio price. Due to the flat shape of the yield curve, this methodology choice impacted the discount rate by less than two basis percentage points. The discount rate would have been slightly higher had the cash flows been allowed to reinvest. The table below sets forth the estimated impact on our 2008 net periodic pension expense relative to a change in the discount rate and a change in the expected rate of return on plan assets. Impact on Pension Expense Increase (Decrease) Millions Discount rate used to value liabilities: 0.25 percent increase $ (7.5 ) 0.25 percent decrease 7.6 Expected rate of return on assets: 1 percent increase (28.4 ) 1 percent decrease 28.2 The above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time. A higher discount rate decreases the plan obligations and decreases our net periodic pension expense. A lower discount rate increases the plan obligations and increases our net periodic pension expense. It should be noted that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear. Based upon our target asset allocations it is anticipated that our U.S. investment policy will generate an average annual return over the 20 year projection period equal to or in excess of 7.9 percent approximately 50 percent of the time while returns of 9.5 percent or greater are anticipated 25 percent of the time. Our three year average rate of return has exceeded 10.0 percent in each of the last three years. As a result, based on the historical returns and forward looking return expectations, we believe an investment return assumption of 8.25 percent per year for U.S. pension assets is reasonable. The methodology used to determine the rate of return on pension plan assets in the U.K. was based on establishing an equity risk premium over current long term bond yields adjusted based on target asset allocations. Our strategy with respect to our investments in pension plan assets is to be invested with a long term outlook. Therefore, the risk and return balance of our asset portfolio should reflect a 60 long term horizon. Our pension plan asset allocation at December 31, 2007 and 2006 and target allocation for 2008 are as follows: Percentage of Plan Assets at December 31, Investment description Target Allocation 2008 2007 2006 Equity securities 60 80 % 63.5 % 62.7 % Fixed income 23 33 % 32.3 % 33.4 % Real estate/Other 3 7 % 4.2 % 3.9 % Total 100.0 % 100.0 % Actual cash funding for our pension plans is governed by employee benefit and tax laws and the Pension Protection Act of 2006 ("the Act"). The Act extends the use of an average corporate bond rate for determining current liabilities for funding purposes. Among its many provisions, the Act establishes a 100 percent funding target for plan years beginning after December 31, 2007. Our funding strategy is to make contributions to our various qualified plans in accordance with statutory funding requirements and any additional contributions we determine are appropriate. The table below sets forth our pension contributions for the period 2006 2007 and our expected range of contributions for 2008. 2008 2007 2006 Contributions (in millions) $ 95 105 $ 250 $ 266 Contributions beyond 2008 will depend on the funded status of our plans at that time in relation to the targeted funding established under the Act. Our qualified pension plans in the U.S. and outside the U.S. were over funded at December 31, 2007, by a total of $205 million due to our funding strategy and pension trust asset performance. We have under funded plans of $146 million at December 31, 2007, which are primarily non qualified plans in the U.S. Under SFAS 158, the actuarial gains and losses and prior service costs (credits) are recognized and recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. Reductions in these amounts increased our shareholders equity by $132 million (after tax and minority interest) in 2007. The reductions resulted from strong plan asset performance and significant pension contributions in 2007 and the past several years. Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements provides a summary of our pension benefit plan activity, the funded status of our plans and the amounts recognized in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Annual Assessment for Recoverability of Goodwill Under the provisions of SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" (SFAS 142), the carrying value of goodwill is reviewed annually. The fair value of each reporting unit was estimated by discounting the future cash flows less requirements for working capital and fixed asset additions. Our valuation method requires us to make projections of revenue, operating expenses, working capital investment and fixed asset additions for the reporting units over a multi year period. Additionally, management must estimate its weighted average cost of capital for each reporting unit for use as a discount rate. The discounted cash flows are compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit and, if less than the carrying value, a separate valuation of the goodwill is required to determine if an impairment loss has occurred. As of the end of the third quarter in 2007, we performed the annual impairment assessment required by SFAS 142 and determined that our goodwill was not impaired. At December 31, 2007, our recorded goodwill was $365 million. Changes in our projections or estimates, a deterioration of our operating results and the related cash flow effect or a significant increase in the 61 discount rate could decrease the estimated fair value of our reporting units and result in a future impairment of goodwill. RECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (Revised 2004), "Share Based Payment" (SFAS 123R). This standard requires financial statement recognition of compensation cost related to share based payment transactions. Share based payment transactions within the scope of SFAS 123R include stock options, restricted stock plans, performance based awards, stock appreciation rights and employee share purchase plans. We implemented the revised standard in the first quarter of 2006. Prior to January 1, 2006, we accounted for stock based employee awards issued after December 31, 2002, using the fair value method preferred by SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation." SFAS 123R requires us to estimate forfeitures in calculating the expense relating to stock based compensation as opposed to recognizing these forfeitures and the corresponding reduction in expense as they occur. SFAS 123R also requires prospective presentation of the "Excess tax benefits on stock based awards" as a financing activity rather than an operating activity in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the impact that the adoption of this standard had on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, "Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Plans and Other Postretirement Plans an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R)" (SFAS 158), which requires employers to fully recognize the obligations associated with single employer defined benefit pension, retiree healthcare and other postretirement plans in their financial statements. In addition, SFAS 158 requires companies to measure plan assets and liabilities as of the end of a fiscal year rather than a date within 90 days of the end of the fiscal year. We adopted SFAS 158 effective December 31, 2006, except for the change in measurement date provisions, which are not effective until 2008. Total assets, total liabilities, minority interests and total shareholders equity were impacted in the following manner. Total assets increased by approximately $11 million, total liabilities increased by approximately $106 million, minority interests decreased by approximately $1 million and shareholders equity decreased by approximately $94 million. The adoption of SFAS 158 did not impact compliance with any of our financial covenants. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the impact that the adoption of this standard had on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109" (FIN 48), which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement process for recording in the financial statements, uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. In addition, FIN 48 provides guidance on the derecognition, classification, accounting in interim periods and disclosure requirements for uncertain tax positions. The adoption of FIN 48, effective January 1, 2007, did not have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the adoption of this standard. ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS ISSUED BUT NOT YET EFFECTIVE In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements" (SFAS 157), which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. We will adopt SFAS 157 effective January 1, 2008. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS 157 to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, "The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Including an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115" (SFAS 159), which is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. SFAS 159 permits an entity to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value at specified election dates. Subsequently unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected will 62 be reported in earnings. We do not expect to elect the fair value methodology under SFAS 159 for any of our financial instruments, thus the adoption of SFAS 159 will not impact our Consolidated Financial Statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), "Business Combinations" (SFAS 141R), which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. SFAS 141R makes significant changes to both the accounting and disclosures related to the acquisition of a business and could materially impact how we account for future business combination transactions. Because the standard will only impact transactions entered into after January 1, 2009, SFAS 141R will not impact our consolidated financial statements upon adoption. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, "Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements" (SFAS 160), which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. SFAS 160 amends Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, "Consolidated Financial Statements" (ARB 51) and establishes accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. For Cummins, the most significant impact of the standard, at adoption, will be to reclass our minority interests ($293 million at December 31, 2007) to be included as a part of equity, which may affect certain performance and equity ratios. We are currently evaluating the potential additional impact that SFAS 160 may have on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to financial risk resulting from volatility in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. This risk is closely monitored and managed through the use of financial derivative instruments including commodity forward contracts, currency forward contracts and interest rate swaps. As stated in our policies and procedures, financial instruments are used expressly for hedging purposes, and under no circumstances are they used for speculative purposes. Our hedging transactions are entered into with banking institutions that have strong credit ratings, and thus the credit risk associated with these transactions is not considered significant. The results and status of our hedging transactions are reported to senior management on a monthly and quarterly basis. Further information regarding financial instruments and risk management is contained in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The following describes our risk exposures and provides results of sensitivity analysis performed as of December 31, 2007. The sensitivity analysis assumes instantaneous, parallel shifts in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES As a result of our international business presence, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk. We transact in foreign currencies and have significant assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. As a result, our earnings experience some volatility related to movements in foreign currency exchange rates. In order to benefit from global diversification and after considering naturally offsetting currency positions, we enter into forward contracts to minimize our existing exposures (recognized asset and liability) and hedge forecasted transactions. The objective of our hedging program is to reduce the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on earnings by essentially creating offsetting currency exposures. As of December 31, 2007, the potential gain or loss in the fair value of our outstanding foreign currency contracts, assuming a hypothetical 10 percent fluctuation in the currencies of such contracts, would be approximately $59 million. The sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates assumes the notional value to remain constant for the next 12 months. The analysis ignores the impact of foreign exchange movements on our competitive position and potential changes in sales levels. It should be noted that any change in the value of the contracts, real or 63 hypothetical, would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged items (see Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). INTEREST RATES We are also exposed to interest rate risk as a result of our indebtedness. Our objective in managing our exposure to changes in interest rates is to limit the effect of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall cost of borrowing. To achieve this objective, we primarily use interest rate swap agreements to manage exposure to interest rate changes related to our borrowing arrangements. In November 2005, we entered into an interest rate swap to effectively convert our $250 million, due in 2028 debt from a fixed rate of 7.125% to a floating rate based on a LIBOR spread. The terms of the swap mirror those of the debt, with interest paid semi annually. This swap qualifies as a fair value hedge under SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities." COMMODITY PRICES We are also exposed to fluctuations in commodity prices through the purchase of raw materials as well as contractual agreements with component suppliers. To reduce the effect of raw material price changes for select commodities, we periodically enter into commodity forward contracts with designated banks to hedge a portion of our anticipated raw material purchases. As of December 31, 2007, the potential gain or loss related to the outstanding commodity forward contracts, assuming a hypothetical 10 percent fluctuation in the price of such commodities, was $16 million. The sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in commodity prices assumes the notional value to remain constant for the next 12 months. The analysis ignores the impact of commodity price movements on our competitive position and potential changes in sales levels. It should be noted that any change in the value of the forward contracts, real or hypothetical, would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged items (see Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).
