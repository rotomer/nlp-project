Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition. General CONSOL Energys net income was $1 million for the six month period ended December 31, 2001. This was a 96.8% decline from the net income of $33.5 million for the six month period ended December 31, 2000. The six month period represents a transitional fiscal period because CONSOL Energy will begin reporting on a year ending December 31 to align its year end with that of its majority shareholder, RWE A.G., beginning with the fiscal year beginning January 1, 2002 and ending December 31, 2002. Total coal sales for the six months ended December 31, 2001 were 36.1 million tons, including our portion of sales by equity affiliates, of which 34.2 million tons were produced by CONSOL Energy operations, by our equity affiliates or sold from inventory of company produced coal, including coal sold from inventories and produced by equity affiliates. This compares with total coal sales of 36.7 million tons for the six months ended December 31, 2000, of which 35.1 million tons were produced by CONSOL Energy operations or sold from inventory of company produced coal including coal sold from inventories and produced by equity affiliates. Demand for coal was strong in CONSOL Energys principal market areas during most of the 2001 transitional period, but we were unable to meet demand because of production shortfalls at several CONSOL Energy mines. Average sales prices for company produced coal have increased 6.9% to $25.07 in the 2001 transitional period compared to $23.45 in the 2000 six month period. Production was 34.4 million tons, including our share of production by equity affiliates of 0.8 million tons, in the 2001 transitional period compared with 32.5 million tons in the 2000 six month period which did not include any tons produced by equity affiliates. The increased production reflects the production from the mines owned by Windsor Coal Company, Southern Ohio Coal Company and Central Ohio Coal Company acquired from American Electric Power on July 2, 2001 and the Line Creek Mine acquired on December 31, 2000, offset in part by declines in production from several existing CONSOL Energy mines. The decline in production at existing mines was primarily due to the suspension of longwall production at Mine 84 early in the 2001 transitional period as a result of adverse geological conditions. As a result of adverse geological conditions, production declines were also experienced at Robinson Run, Rend Lake, Dilworth and Blacksville #2 Mines. Robinson Run production was 0.6 million tons lower in the 2001 transitional period compared with the 2000 six month period. The decline was primarily due to a number of mechanical difficulties at the mine, particularly with the belt haulage system. Rend Lake and Blacksville #2 mines were mining in a portion of their reserves where the coal seam is thinner than is normally experienced. This reduced production in the 2001 transitional period by 1.0 million tons and increased mining costs. Other CONSOL Energy mines also had higher mining costs and production declines due to mechanical and geological difficulties. Management believes these production difficulties have been resolved. Sales of coalbed methane gas, including our share of the sales of equity affiliates, increased 24.1% to 20.1 billion cubic feet in the 2001 transitional period from 16.2 billion cubic feet in the 2000 six month period. The increased sales volume is primarily due to higher production and sales volumes as a result of the purchase of the remaining 50% interest in the Pocahontas Gas Partnership on August 22, 2001. Our average sales price for coalbed methane gas, including our portion of sales from equity affiliates, was $2.67 per million British thermal units in the 2001 transitional period compared with $4.80 per million British thermal units in the 2000 six month period. The price decline was due primarily to reduced demand for gas caused by the slow down of the U.S. economy, the mild winter and a reduction in industrial demand. Factors Affecting 2002 Results Results for 2002 are being affected by the warm winter weather in the eastern United States and the sluggish U.S. economy. Customers have delayed shipments of coal and some electricity power plants are burning significantly less than normal amounts of coal. In addition, gas prices through the first two months of 2002 were lower than had been forecast. Until energy markets strengthen, CONSOL Energy is reducing planned mine output for 2002 by five to six million tons in order to match current demand. The following mines will reduce production: Mahoning Valley (Ohio); VP8 (Virginia); Blacksville 2 (West Virginia); Robinson Run (West Virginia); McElroy (West Virginia); Shoemaker (West Virginia); and Rend Lake (Illinois). The following mines will close permanently during the year: Dilworth (Pennsylvania); Humphrey (West Virginia); Meigs 2 (Ohio); and Windsor (Ohio). The Loveridge mine will remain idle. CONSOL Energy also will institute additional cost control measures and defer some capital expenditure projects. 29 Results of Operations Six Months Ended December 31, 2001 compared with Six Months Ended December 31, 2000 (unaudited) Net Income CONSOL Energys net income for the six months ended December 31, 2001 was $1 million compared with $34 million for the six months ended December 31, 2000. The decrease of $33 million was primarily due to lower prices for natural gas caused by general market declines and higher cost per ton of produced coal mined caused principally by adverse mining conditions and mechanical problems. The effects of lower prices for natural gas and higher coal production costs were offset, in part, by a reduction in income tax expense due to a pre tax loss in the 2001 transitional period along with changes in percentage depletion allowances and higher volumes of gas sold. Revenue Sales decreased $19 million, or 2.0% to $980 million for the six months ended December 31, 2001 from $999 million for the six months ended December 31, 2000. Revenues from the sale of coalbed methane gas and gathering fees decreased $8 million, or 13.7% to $48 million in the 2001 transitional period from $56 million in the 2000 six month period. This decrease was due mainly to a 44.2% decrease in average sales price for the period. Average sales price for the 2001 transitional period was $2.61 per million British thermal unit compared to $4.68 per million British thermal unit for the six months ended December 31, 2000. The decrease in sales price was offset, in part, by higher volumes as a result of the August 22, 2001 acquisition of the remaining 50% interest in Pocahontas Gas Partnership. Sales volumes were 18.6 billion cubic feet in the 2001 transitional period, an increase of 6.5 billion cubic feet, or 53.4% from the 2000 six month period. Revenues from the sale of industrial supplies decreased $30 million, or 46.5%, to $34 million in the 2001 transitional period from $64 million in the 2000 six month period. The decrease was due primarily to the sale of the physical assets, inventory and operations associated with 18 industrial and store management sites during the 2000 six month period. The sale did not have a material impact on CONSOL Energys financial position, results of operations or cash flow. These decreased revenues were partially offset by increased revenues from the sale of company produced coal. Revenues from the sale of company produced coal increased $14 million, or 1.7%, to $836 million in the 2001 transitional period from $822 million in the 2000 six month period. The increase in produced coal sales revenues was due mainly to an increase of $1.62, or 6.9%, in the average sales price per ton sold. The average sales price was $25.07 in the 2001 transitional period compared to $23.45 in the 2000 six month period. The increase in average sales price was due primarily to demand increases and low inventory levels at coal producers. The increase in average sales price was partially offset by a 2 million ton, or 4.8%, decrease in the volume of produced tons sold in the 2001 transitional period compared to the 2000 six month period. Produced coal sales volumes were 33 million tons in the 2001 transitional period compared to 35 million tons in the 2000 six month period. The decreased sales volumes were due primarily to the decline in production as a result of the suspension of longwall production at Mine 84 early in July 2001. Mine 84 restarted longwall production in early December 2001 at production levels equal to full production levels in the months before production problems were encountered. This was approximately one month earlier than originally projected. Production shortages were encountered at several other CONSOL Energy mines due to mechanical and geological difficulties. These production declines were offset by the production at several of the mines acquired from American Electric Power on July 2, 2001. Revenues from the sale of purchased coal increased $4 million, or 9.0%, to $55 million in the 2001 transitional period from $51 million in the 2000 six month period. Sales volumes increased 11.1% to 1.9 million tons in the 2001 transitional period from 1.7 million tons in the 2000 six month period. Purchased coal sales were increased to augment company production. The increased volumes were partially offset by an 1.9% decrease in the price per ton of purchased coal sold. The average sales price per ton of purchased coal was $29.87 in the 2001 transitional period compared to $30.44 in the 2000 six month period. Freight revenue, outside and related party, decreased $2 million, or 2.6%, to $70 million in the 2001 transitional period from $72 million in the 2000 six month period. Freight revenue is the amount billed to customers for transportation costs incurred. Other income, which consists of interest income, gain or loss on the disposition of assets, equity in earnings of affiliates, service income, royalty income, rental income and miscellaneous income, was $31 million in the 2001 transitional period compared to $37 million in the 2000 six month period. The decrease of $6 million, or 16.0%, was primarily due to the reduction in equity in earnings of affiliates. The reduction in equity in earnings of affiliates was primarily due to the August 22, 2001 purchase of the remaining 50% interest in Pocahontas Gas Partnership and the remaining 25% interest in the Cardinal States Gathering Company. As a result of the acquisition, CONSOL Energy owns 100% of these entities and began to account for them 30 as fully consolidated subsidiaries. Before the acquisition, CONSOL Energy accounted for these companies using the equity method. Costs Cost of Goods Sold and Other Operating Charges increased $38 million, or 5.3%, to $776 million in the 2001 transitional period from $738 million in the 2000 six month period. Cost of goods sold for company produced coal increased $28 million, or 4.8% to $623 million in the 2001 transitional period from $595 million in the 2000 six month period. The increase was primarily due to a 10.1% increase in the cost per ton sold of company produced coal, offset slightly by a 4.8% decrease in the volume of tons of company produced coal sold. The increased cost per ton produced is primarily due to a decline in productivity as measured in tons produced per manday. Tons produced per manday were 37.6 in the 2001 transitional period compared to 41.6 in the 2000 six month period. The decline in productivity is mainly due to several mines experiencing mechanical and geological difficulties in the 2001 transitional period. Cost of goods sold for gas operations increased $9 million, or 51.7%, to $27 million in the 2001 transitional period from $18 million in the 2000 six month period. The increase in gas costs was due primarily to 53.4% higher volume of gas sold as a result of the acquisition of the remaining 50% interest in Pocahontas Gas Partnership on August 22, 2001. Sales volumes were 18.6 billion cubic feet in the 2001 transitional period compared to 12.1 billion cubic feet in the 2000 six month period. The cost per million British thermal units sold remained stable at $1.50 in the 2001 transitional period compared to $1.51 in the 2000 six month period. Cost of goods sold for purchased coal increased $8 million, or 17.1%, to $55 million in the 2001 transitional period from $47 million in the 2000 six month period. The increased costs were primarily due to an increase of 11.1% in the volume of purchased tons sold. The increase also reflects a 5.4% increase in the average cost of purchased coal. The average cost of purchased coal was $29.87 per ton in the 2001 transitional period compared to $28.35 per ton in the 2000 six month period. Cost of goods sold for closed and idled mine costs increased $13 million to $29 million in the 2001 transitional period from $16 million in the 2000 six month period. The increase is due primarily to a $10 million income adjustment for mine closing and perpetual care liabilities being recognized in the 2000 six month period. The adjustment was the result of updated engineering studies and cost projections for closed and idled locations. The increase was also due to additional costs related to the closing or idling of Loveridge, Meigs #31 and Mine 84 in the 2001 transitional period compared to the 2000 six month period. Cost of goods sold for industrial supplies decreased $28 million, or 44.2%, to $36 million in the 2001 transitional period from $64 million in the 2000 six month period. The decrease in costs is related to reduced sales volumes resulting from the sale of 18 industrial and store management sites. Freight expense decreased $2 million, or 2.7%, to $70 million in the 2001 transitional period from $72 million in the 2000 six month period. Freight expense is billed to customers and the revenue from such billings equals the transportation expense. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $2 million, or 5.7%, to $31 million in the 2001 transitional period from $33 million in the 2000 six month period. The decrease was due primarily to decreased professional consulting fees. Professional consulting fees have been reduced due to the completion of the review of business processes and information technology systems supporting those processes that took place in the 2000 period. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense remained stable at $120 million for the 2001 transitional period and the 2000 six month period. Interest expense decreased by $14 million, or 46.2%, to $17 million in the 2001 transitional period compared to $31 million in the 2000 six month period. The decrease was due primarily to lower average debt levels outstanding during the 2001 transitional period compared to the 2000 six month period, along with a decrease of 3.6% per annum in average interest rates reflecting more favorable interest rates. Lower average debt levels resulted from the cash received in the acquisition of the Windsor Coal Company, Southern Ohio Coal Company and Central Ohio Coal Company from American Electric Power being used to reduce the outstanding amount of commercial paper in July 2001. Thereafter, we increased the outstanding amount of commercial paper by the issuance of approximately $155 million of commercial paper beginning in August 2001 to finance the acquisition of the remaining 50% interest in Pocahontas Gas Partnership and the remaining 25% interest in the Cardinal States Gathering Company. Also, in December 2001, approximately $18 million of commercial paper was issued to finance the acquisition of a 50% joint venture in Glennies Creek Mine. Interest expense is expected to increase during 2002 as a result of the refinancing of short term debt with long term notes with the interest rate of 7.875% per annum. Taxes other than income increased $3 million, or 3.7%, to $81 million in the 2001 transitional period compared to $78 million in the 2000 six month period. The increase was due primarily to increased excise taxes, severance taxes and payroll taxes 31 in the 2001 transitional period. These costs increased primarily due to the acquisition of the Windsor Coal Company, Southern Ohio Coal Company and Central Ohio Coal Company from American Electric Power. CONSOL Energy is no longer required to pay certain excise taxes on export coal sales. We have filed claims with the Internal Revenue Service seeking refunds for these excise taxes that were determined to be unconstitutional and were paid during the period 1991 through 1999. During the 2001 transitional period, we recognized a $5 million reduction to the expected interest receivable amount recognized in the twelve months ended June 30, 2001 due to the change in the estimate of recoverable amounts. Income Taxes Income taxes were a $21 million benefit in the 2001 transitional period compared to $4 million of expense in the 2000 six month period. The decrease of $25 million was due mainly to a pre tax loss in the 2001 transitional period with little loss of percentage depletion tax benefits. Our effective tax rate is sensitive to changes in annual profitability and percentage depletion. Twelve Months Ended June 30, 2001 compared with Twelve Months Ended June 30, 2000 Net Income CONSOL Energys net income for the year ended June 30, 2001 was $184 million compared with $107 million for the year ended June 30, 2000. The increase of $77 million was primarily due to the resolution of claims by CONSOL Energy related to export sales excise taxes that were declared unconstitutional. Also, net income increased due to increased gas sales volumes and prices, a reversal of accruals for export sales excise taxes which are no longer owed, and the completion of the restructuring program. These increases to net income were partially offset by increased income tax expense primarily due to higher pretax earnings and loss of percentage depletion benefits, reduced revenues from coal sales primarily due to reduced sales volumes, and higher production costs due mainly to adverse geological conditions at Mine 84. Revenue Sales increased $42 million, or 2.0%, to $2,137 million for the 2001 period from $2,095 million for the 2000 period. Revenues from the sale of coalbed methane gas and gathering fees increased $82 million to $130 million in the 2001 period from $48 million in the 2000 period. Average sales prices increased 69.3% to $5.18 per MMbtu for the 2001 period compared to $3.06 per MMbtu for the 2000 period. The increase was also due to higher volumes as a result of the acquisition of Buchanan Production Company and Oakwood Gathering, Inc. on February 25, 2000 and the inclusion of their results for the entire 2001 period. Revenues from the sale of produced coal decreased by $5 million, or 0.3%, to $1,781 million in the 2001 period from $1,786 million in the 2000 period. Produced Coal sales volumes were 73.8 million tons in the 2001 period, a decrease of 1.4 million tons, or 1.9%, from the 75.2 million tons sold in the 2000 period. This was primarily due to lower production at Mine 84 resulting from adverse geological conditions in the 2001 period. In the quarter ended December 31, 2000 and continuing throughout the remainder of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2001, Mine 84 encountered a sandstone intrusion in the coal seam that ran across several longwall coal panels. Because sandstone is harder than coal, mining advance rates were slowed for both longwall and continuous mining machines. Production for Mine 84 was 2.2 million tons in the 2001 period compared to 5.7 million tons for the 2000 period. Production in the quarter ended June 30, 2001 was 0.6 million tons compared to 0.3 million tons in the quarter ended March 31, 2001. Average sales prices increased 1.6% to $24.12 per ton for the 2001 period from $23.74 per ton for the 2000 period. The increase in average sales price was due primarily to demand increases and low inventory levels at both our mines and at our customers power stations. Revenues from the sale of purchased coal decreased by $8 million, or 8.0%, to $95 million in the 2001 period from $103 million in the 2000 period. Sales volumes of Purchased Coal were 3.1 million tons in the 2001 period, a decrease of 0.4 million tons, or 10.6%, compared to the 3.5 million tons sold in the 2000 period. The decrease in tons sold primarily reflects a renegotiated contract that allows company produced coal to be shipped in the 2001 period instead of coal purchased from third parties which was required to be shipped under the contract in the 2000 period. Average sales prices of coal that we purchased increased 3.0% to $30.56 per ton for the 2001 period from $29.69 for the 2000 period due primarily to demand increases and low inventory levels at both our mines and at our customers power stations. Industrial supplies sales decreased $25 million, or 17.7%, to $116 million in the 2001 period from $141 million in the 2000 period due to reduced sales volumes primarily related to sales to various chemical plants. During the 2001 period, the physical assets, inventory and operations associated with 18 industrial and store management sites of Fairmont Supply Company were sold. The sale did not have a material impact on financial position, results of operations or cash flow. Fairmont Supply Company continues to operate 12 customer service locations nationwide. 32 Freight revenue, outside and related party, which represents amounts billed to customers in a sale transaction related to shipping and handling costs, decreased 3.0% to $161 million in the 2001 period from $166 million in the 2000 period. Freight revenue is the amount billed to customers that equals the expense of the transportation. Other income, which consists of interest income, gain on the disposition of assets, service income, royalty income, rental income, equity in earnings of affiliates and miscellaneous income, increased 9.5% to $70 million in the 2001 period from $64 million in the 2000 period. The increase of $6 million was primarily due to an increase in the equity in earnings of affiliates related to gas, offset in part by a decrease in the gain on disposition of assets and royalty income. Equity in earnings of affiliates related to gas increased primarily due to an increase in volumes sold and sales prices. The gain on sale of assets principally relates to the sale of certain in place coal reserves. CONSOL Energy continually manages its coal reserves and from time to time sells non strategic reserves. Costs Cost of goods sold and other operating charges increased 4.7% to $1,569 million in the 2001 period compared to $1,499 million in the 2000 period. Cost of goods sold for produced coal was $1,207 million for the 2001 period, an increase of $73 million, or 6.4%, from $1,134 in the 2000 period. The increased cost per ton produced is primarily due to adverse geological conditions at Mine 84. Tons per manday decreased 4.6% to 42.2 tons in the 2001 period compared to 44.2 tons in the 2000 period primarily reflecting the adverse geological conditions at Mine 84. Industrial Supplies cost of goods sold decreased 20.2% to $115 million in the 2001 period from $145 million in the 2000 period. The $30 million decrease was due to reduced sales volumes. Purchased coal costs decreased 10.6% to $89 million in the 2001 period from $100 million in the 2000 period. The $11 million decrease was due to a 10.6% decrease in tons sold. The decrease in tons sold primarily reflects a renegotiated contract that allows company produced coal to be shipped in the 2001 period instead of coal purchased from third parties which was required to be shipped under the contract in the 2000 period. Gas costs increased 108.1% to $47 million in the 2001 period from $22 million in the 2000 period. The $25 million increase was primarily due to higher volumes as a result of the acquisition of Buchanan Production Company and MCNIC Oakwood Gathering Inc. in February 2000. Average cost per million Btu was $1.88 in the 2001 period, a $0.15 increase, or 8.4%, compared to the 2000 period. Average cost per million Btu has increased due primarily to an increase in royalty expense, which is related to the increase in the average sales price of a million Btu sold. Cost of goods sold for closed and idle mine costs increased 21.5% to $60 million in the 2001 period from $49 million in the 2000 period. The $11 million increase was primarily due to the increased costs related to the preparation for the reopening of Loveridge mine in the 2001 period in order to mine the remaining longwall panel. The longwall panel was mined out and Loveridge was again idled. Idle mine costs were then incurred to recover, refurbish and redeploy the longwall to another CONSOL Energy mine. Closed and idle mine costs also increased due to engineering survey adjustments related to mine closing and reclamation. In the 2000 period, we incurred costs related to the initial idling or closing of Powhatan, VP#8 and Ohio #11 mines that were not repeated during the 2001 period. Costs also increased $16 million due to the approval of a new incentive compensation program for eligible full time employees. This program is designed to increase compensation payable to eligible employees when CONSOL Energy reaches predetermined earnings targets and the employees reach predetermined performance targets. Freight expense decreased 3.0% to $161 million in the 2001 period from $166 million in the 2000 period. Freight expense is billed to customers and the revenues from such billings equals the transportation expense. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 1.4% to $63 million in the 2001 period compared to $62 million in the 2000 period. The increase of $1 million was primarily due to increased professional consulting fees associated with the review of business processes and information technology systems supporting those processes, offset in part by salary cost savings from the Voluntary Separation Incentive Program implemented in the last half of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2000. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense decreased 2.6% to $243 million in the 2001 period compared to $250 million in the 2000 period. The decrease of $7 million was primarily due to reduced depreciation and depletion expense as a result of the scheduled closing of the Powhatan mine due to economically depleted reserves. Depletion and amortization expense was also reduced due to lower production tons in the 2001 period and items becoming fully amortized in the 2000 period. These decreases were offset, in part, by increased depreciation expense related to assets placed in service after the 2000 period and 33 additional depreciation expense on assets received in the acquisition of Buchanan Production Company and MCNIC Oakwood Gathering Inc. Interest expense increased 4.2% to $58 million for the 2001 period compared to $55 million for the 2000 period. The increase of $3 million was due primarily to higher average debt levels outstanding during the 2001 period compared to the 2000 period, along with an increase of 0.2% in average interest rates. Higher debt levels resulted from the issuance of commercial paper to finance the purchase of Buchanan Production Company, MCNIC Oakwood Gathering Inc. and a MCN subsidiary that owns a 50% interest in Cardinal States Gathering Company in February 2000, and the purchase of a 50% joint venture interest in Line Creek mine on December 31, 2000. Taxes other than income decreased 9.3% to $158 million for the 2001 period compared to $174 million for the 2000 period. The decrease of $16 million was due primarily to reduced excise taxes in the 2001 period. As discussed in Note 7 of the Consolidated Financial Statements, CONSOL Energy is no longer required to pay certain excise taxes on export coal sales and, therefore, is no longer accruing for this expense. Due to these taxes on export coal sales being declared unconstitutional, prior year accruals of $11 million which were not paid and are no longer owed, were reversed. The decrease was partially offset by increased state severance taxes due to higher sales prices and increased property taxes due to increased assessments. CONSOL Energy has filed claims with the Internal Revenue Service seeking refunds for these unconstitutional excise taxes that were paid during the period 1991 through 1999. During the 2001 period, CONSOL Energy recognized $93 million of pretax earnings net of other charges and $31 million of interest income related to these claims. Restructuring charges were $12 million in the 2000 period and represent charges for employee severance costs and outside professional consultant costs. These costs related to the review of administrative and research staff functions that began in the quarter ended December 31, 1999. The purpose of the review was to assess the need for and to assist in a restructuring of those functions to enable CONSOL Energy to respond to the cost challenges of the current environment without losing the ability to take advantage of opportunities to grow the business over the longer term. Income Taxes Income taxes were $57 million in the 2001 period compared to a $0.5 million benefit in the 2000 period. The increased effective tax rate in the 2001 period is due mainly to higher pre tax income, with some related loss of percentage depletion benefits. The effective rate increase was partially offset due to additional gas tax benefits related to the acquisition of Buchanan Production Company, MCNIC Oakwood Gathering Inc. and a MCN subsidiary that owns a 50% interest in Cardinal States Gathering Company in February 2000. Also, the tax benefit in the 2000 period was due primarily to the recording of an $8 million benefit from a final agreement resolving disputed federal income tax items for the years 1992 1994, the recording of a $4 million benefit resulting from filing the federal and various state tax returns for the period January 1, 1998 through December 31, 1998 in the 2000 period and the recording of a $1 million benefit resulting from filing federal and various state tax returns for the period January 1, 1999 through June 30, 1999 in the 2000 period. Twelve Months Ended June 30, 2000 compared with Twelve Months Ended June 30, 1999 (unaudited) Net Income CONSOL Energys net income for the twelve months ended June 30, 2000 was $107 million compared with $108 million for the twelve months ended June 30, 1999. The decrease of $1 million, or 1.2%, was primarily due to reduced coal sales revenues and the addition of restructuring costs, partially offset by lower costs of goods sold. Revenue Sales decreased $149 million, or 6.6%, to $2,095 million for the 2000 period from $2,244 million for the 1999 period. Revenues from the sale of produced coal decreased $140 million, or 7.3%, to $1,786 million in the 2000 period from $1,926 million in the 1999 period. Average sales price per ton of produced coal sold decreased 7.7% to $23.74 per ton for the 2000 period from $25.73 per ton for the 1999 period. The decline in average sales price was primarily due to expirations of higher priced contracts during the 2000 period and weaker spot prices compared to the 1999 period. Sales volumes of produced coal for the 2000 period were 75.2 million tons compared to 74.9 million tons for the 1999 period. Revenues from the sale of purchased coal decreased $15 million, or 12.6%, to $103 million in the 2000 period from $118 million in the 1999 period. The decrease primarily was due to lower volumes and prices related to export coal sales. Sales of industrial supplies decreased $20 million, or 12.8%, to $141 million in the 2000 period from $161 million in the 1999 period due to reduced volumes. 34 These decreases were partially offset by the increase in revenues from the sale of coalbed methane gas and from gathering fees. Revenues from gas sales increased $28 million to $48 million in the 2000 period from $20 million in the 1999 period. The increase was primarily due to higher volumes as a result of the acquisition of Buchanan Production Company and MCNIC Oakwood Gathering Inc. in February 2000. The increase was also due to an increase in the average price per MMBTU sold. The average price per MMBTU was $3.06 for the 2000 period compared to $2.05 for the 1999 period. Freight revenue, outside and related party, decreased 13.4% to $166 million in the 2000 period from $192 million in the 1999 period. Freight revenue is the amount billed to customers that equals the expense of the transportation. Other income, which consists of interest income, gain on the disposition of assets, service income, royalty income, rental income, equity in earnings of affiliates and miscellaneous income, increased $7 million to $64 million in the 2000 period from $57 million in the 1999 period. The increase was primarily due to an increase in gain on sale of assets, partially offset by $2 million of income recognized in the 1999 period for a one time refund of harbor maintenance fees. Costs Cost of goods sold and other operating charges decreased $136 million, or 8.3%, to $1,499 million in the 2000 period compared to $1,635 million in the 1999 period. Cost of goods sold for produced coal was $1,134 million for the 2000 period, a decrease of $68 million, or 5.7%, from the 1999 period. This primarily reflects a decrease due to a reduction in cost per produced ton. The reductions in production costs are primarily due to the decrease in supplies, maintenance and labor costs. Tons per manday have increased 11.4% to 44.2 in the 2000 period compared to 39.7 in the 1999 period reflecting improved efficiencies at the operating locations, the closing of the Keystone and Helvetia complexes, and the transfer of production to more efficient mines. Purchased coal costs decreased 14.0% to $100 million in the 2000 period compared to $116 million in the 1999 period. The $16 million decrease was due mainly to reduced volumes related to export sales. Miscellaneous cost of goods sold and other operating charges decreased 62% to $39 million in the 2000 period from $101 million in the 1999 period. The decrease of $62 million was primarily related to a $16 million decrease in actuarial adjustments in the 2000 period, a $4 million decrease in claim accruals, and a $2 million decrease in salary vacation accruals due to workforce reductions incurred in the 2000 period. The decrease was also due to a $14 million property donation and a $5 million accrual for the Loveridge mine fire in the 1999 period. Industrial supplies cost of goods sold decreased 6.9% to $145 million in the 2000 period from $155 million in the 1999 period. The $10 million decrease was due to reduced sales. These decreases in cost of goods sold and other charges were offset, in part, by increased cost of goods sold for closed and idle mine costs. Closed and idle property expense increased 25.6% to $49 million in the 2000 period compared to $39 million in the 1999 period. The $10 million increase was primarily due to an $8 million increase due to the Loveridge, Powhatan and Ohio #11 mines being closed or idled for the full 2000 period compared to being idle only part of the 1999 period and a $5 million increase was due to the reversal of mine closing liabilities related to a property disposition in the 1999 period. These increases in expense were partially offset due to Robinson Run #95, Humphrey #138 and V.P. #8 mines reopening in the 2000 period after being idled for part of the 1999 period. Gas costs increased 47.0% to $22 million in the 2000 period from $15 million in the 1999 period. The $7 million increase was primarily due to higher volumes of sales following the acquisition of Buchanan Production Company and MCNIC Oakwood Gathering Inc. Coal property holding costs increased 46.9% to $13 million in the 2000 period from $9 million in the 1999 period. The $4 million increase was primarily due to leasehold surrenders. Freight expense decreased 13.4 % to $166 million in the 2000 period from $192 million in the 1999 period. Freight expense is billed to customers and the revenue from such billings equals the transportation expense. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 3.6 % to $62 million in the 2000 period compared to $60 million in the 1999 period. The increase of $2 million was primarily due to increased fees for professional consulting services and general professional services, offset partially by a decrease in labor costs due to the Voluntary Separation Incentive Program and an involuntary severance program. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense increased 3.1% to $250 million in the 2000 period compared to $242 million in the 1999 period. The increase of $8 million was primarily due to the depreciation expense related to assets placed in service, principally the Bailey Preparation Plant expansion and the purchase of a new longwall, after the 1999 period. The 35 increased depreciation expense was partially offset by reduced depreciation and depletion expense from the scheduled closing of the Powhatan mine due to economically depleted reserves and V.P. #3 and Ohio #11 mines being idled for the full 2000 period. Interest expense decreased 1.0% to $55 million for the 2000 period compared to $56 million for the 1999 period. The decrease of $1 million was due primarily to $78 million lower average debt levels outstanding during the 2000 period compared to the 1999 period, partially offset by a 0.6% increase in average interest rates on commercial paper in the 2000 period. Higher debt levels in the 1999 period resulted from the issuance of commercial paper to finance the purchase of CONSOL Energys common stock from DuPont Energy Company in November 1998. Lower debt levels in the 2000 period resulted from the use of the Initial Public Offering proceeds to reduce debt and the repayment of $100 million of long term debt as scheduled in January 1999. These reductions in debt were partially offset by an increase in the debt outstanding from the issuance of commercial paper in February 2000, which was used to finance the acquisition of Buchanan Production Company, MCNIC Oakwood Gathering Inc. and a MCN subsidiary that owns a 50% interest in Cardinal States Gathering Company. Taxes other than income decreased 11.5% to $174 million for the 2000 period compared to $197 million for the 1999 period. The decrease of $23 million was due primarily to decreased West Virginia severance taxes due to lower production and sales prices in that state, decreased black lung excise taxes due to overall lower production tons and overall lower sales prices, and reduced payroll taxes primarily due to decreased labor costs. Restructuring charges were $12 million in the 2000 period and represent charges for employee severance costs and outside professional consultant costs. These costs were related to the review of administrative and research staff functions that began in the quarter ended December 31, 1999. The purpose of the review was to assess the need for and to assist in a restructuring of those functions to enable CONSOL Energy to respond to the cost challenges of the then current environment without losing the ability to take advantage of opportunities to grow the business over the longer term. Income Taxes Income taxes were a $0.5 million benefit in the 2000 period compared to a $3 million expense in the 1999 period. The tax benefit in the 2000 period was due primarily to the recording of a $8 million benefit from a final agreement resolving disputed federal income tax items for the years 1992 1994, the recording of a $4 million benefit resulting from filing the federal and various state tax returns for the period January 1, 1998 through December 31, 1998 in the 2000 period, and the recording of a $1 million benefit resulting from filing the federal and various state tax returns for the period January 1, 1999 through June 30, 1999 in the 2000 period. Also, the reduced tax expense is due to a lower effective tax rate in the 2000 period primarily due to lower pre tax income, with minimal effect on percentage depletion benefits, and additional gas tax benefits related to the recent acquisition of Buchanan Production Company and MCNIC Oakwood Gathering Inc. and a MCN subsidiary that owns a 50% interest in Cardinal States Gathering Company Six Months Ended June 30, 1999 compared with Six Months Ended June 30, 1998 (unaudited) Net Income CONSOL Energys net income for the six months ended June 30, 1999 was $40 million compared with $106 million for the six months ended June 30, 1998. The decrease of $66 million primarily was due to a decline in coal prices and an increase in coal production costs in the 1999 period compared with the 1998 period. The mild winter weather in the eastern United States dampened demand for coal by electricity generators, leaving utilities coal inventories above planned levels. Low prices for oil, certain petroleum by products and natural gas led to increase use of these fuels by electricity generators. Sales of U.S. steam coal in Europe were adversely affected by competition from coal producers in other countries. Also, annual negotiations of prices for metallurgical coal bound for overseas markets resulted in significant price reductions, causing some U.S. producers to elect to offer these coals as a steam coal in U.S. markets in an effort to obtain a higher price. The increase in costs was due to the addition of production capacity by CONSOL Energy with no commensurate increase in sales volumes due to these market factors. Revenue Sales decreased 4.6% to $1,082 million for the 1999 period from $1,133 million for the 1998 period. The decrease of $51 million was primarily due to a decrease of $46 million in company produced coal sales, a decrease of $12 million in industrial supply sales, partially offset by increased purchased coal sales of $10 million. The decline in coal sales for the period was primarily due to a decline in market prices, a higher proportion of sales of lower priced coals, and a decline in contract prices. Coal sales volumes for the two periods were similar. The decreased revenue for industrial supplies was mainly due to decreased volumes. Increases in purchased coal revenues were primarily due to higher volumes related to contracts acquired with the 36 acquisition of Rochester and Pittsburgh Coal Company on September 22, 1998, partially offset by decreased volumes due to the decline in the export market. Related party sales declined from the 1998 period reflecting the change in the categorization of sales to DuPont from related party sales to outside sales due to the purchase of shares of the company from DuPont Energy Company on November 5, 1998, as a result of which DuPont no longer is characterized as an affiliate. Freight revenue, outside and related party, decreased 32.3% to $80 million for the 1999 period from $119 million for the 1998 period. Freight revenue is the amount billed to customers that equals the expense of the transportation. Other income, which consists of interest income, gain on the disposition of assets, service income, royalty income, rental income and miscellaneous income, increased 7.8% to $29 million for the 1999 period from $27 million for the 1998 period. The increase of $2 million primarily was due to increased royalty income and a one time refund of harbor maintenance fees, offset partially by reduced interest income. Costs Cost of goods sold and other operating charges increased $44 million or 6.0%, to $790 million for the 1999 period from $746 million for the 1998 period. Production cost increased $18 million and purchased coal cost increased $9 million primarily because of the inclusion of the Rochester & Pittsburgh Coal Company operations. Idle mine costs increased $14 million due to weak market conditions. During the 1999 period, one mine was permanently closed and six mines were idled. Other postretirement benefits other than pensions increased $10 million due to the inclusion of Rochester & Pittsburgh Coal Company operations, discount rate changes and adverse experience. In addition, costs have increased in the 1999 period due to the accrued expenses for the Loveridge mine fire. On June 22, 1999, an underground mine fire was discovered at the Loveridge mine. A provision of $5 million was made in 1999 for the expected cost to extinguish the fire and rehabilitate the mine. The increased costs were partially offset by a $13 million decrease in costs of goods sold for industrial supply sales due mainly to a reduction in volumes. Freight expense decreased 32.3% to $80 million in the 1999 period from $119 million in the 1998 period. Freight expense is billed to customers and the revenue from such billings equals the transportation expense. Selling, general and administrative expenses remained stable at $30 million in the 1999 period. Depreciation, depletion and amortization increased 3.1% to $121 million in the 1999 period from $118 million in the 1998 period. The increase of $3 million was primarily due to the increase in depreciation related to assets acquired with the Rochester & Pittsburgh Coal Company acquisition, offset partially by decreased cost depletion due to several mines being temporarily idled due to market conditions in the 1999 period. Interest expense increased 33.9% in the 1999 period to $31 million from $23 million in the 1998 period. The increase of $8 million primarily was due to higher average debt levels outstanding during the 1999 period compared to the 1998 period. Higher debt levels resulted from the issuance of commercial paper to finance the purchase of common stock from DuPont Energy Company in November 1998. Taxes other than income decreased 4.2% to $98 million in the 1999 period from $103 million in the 1998 period. The decrease of $5 million was primarily due to lower West Virginia severance taxes resulting from decreased production in the state. The reduction in severance taxes was partially offset by increased payroll taxes due to the additional personnel added with the Rochester & Pittsburgh Coal Company acquisition. Income Taxes Income taxes decreased 99.7% to $0.1 million in the 1999 period from $35 million in the 1998 period. The decrease of $35 million primarily was due to lower earnings before income taxes in the 1999 period and changes in percentage depletion deductions for various operations. The effective tax rate for the 1999 period was 0.3% compared to 25.0% in the 1998 period primarily due to effects of percentage depletion. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period. Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10 K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates upon subsequent resolution of identified matters. Management 37 believes that the estimates utilized are reasonable. The following critical accounting policies are materially impacted by judgements, assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Other Post Employment Benefits CONSOL Energy provides retiree health benefits to employees that retire with at least 10 years of service and have attained age 55. Our retiree health plan provides health benefits to approximately 11,000 of our former employees and is partially funded. After our review and consultation, various actuarial assumptions, including discount rate, expected trend in health care costs and per capita costs, are used by our independent actuary to estimate the cost and benefit obligations for our retiree health plan. The discount rate is determined each year at the measurement date (normally three months before the year end date). The discount rate is an estimate of the current interest rate at which the Other Post Employment Benefit liabilities could be effectively settled at the measurement date. In estimating this rate, CONSOL Energy looks to rates of return on high quality, fixed income investments that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized ratings agency. For the six months ended December 31, 2001 the discount rate was determined to be 7.25%, the same discount rate was used for the twelve months ended June 30, 2001. Significant changes to these interest rates introduce substantial volatility to our costs. In June 2001, our assumed health care cost trend rate for the six months immediately following the measurement date was 9.0%, an increase of 0.5% over the prior year. The increase was primarily due to the recent increases in the price of medical services provided by the plan. The ultimate long term trend rate was assumed to decrease gradually to 4.75% by 2008 and remain level thereafter. Per capita costs on a per annum basis for Other Post Retirement Benefits were assumed to be $4,700 in the six month period ended December 31, 2001. This was a 5.1% increase over the period ended June 30, 2001. If the actual increase in per capita cost of medical services or other post retirements benefits are significantly greater or less than the projected trend rates, the per capita cost assumption would need to be adjusted which could have a significant effect on the costs and liabilities recognized in the financial statements. The estimated liability recognized in the financial statements at December 31, 2001 was $1.4 billion. Coal Workers Pneumoconiosis CONSOL Energy is responsible under the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969, as amended, for medical and disability benefits to employees and their dependents resulting from occurrences of coal workers pneumoconiosis disease. CONSOL Energy is also responsible under various state statues for pneumoconiosis benefits. After our review and consultation, our independent actuaries calculate the actuarial present value of the estimated pneumoconiosis obligation based on assumptions regarding disability incidence, medical costs, mortality, death benefits, dependents and interest rates. In January 2001, the United States Department of Labor amended the regulations implementing the federal black lung laws to give greater weight to the opinion of a claimants treating physician, expand the definition of black lung disease and limit the amount of medical evidence that can be submitted by claimants and respondents. The amendments also alter administrative procedures for the adjudication of claims, which according to the Department of Labor, results in streamlined procedures that are less formal, less adversarial and easier for participants to understand. These and other changes to the federal black lung regulations could result in changes in assumptions used in our actuarial determination of the liability, including interest, disability and mortality assumptions. These changes could significantly increase our exposure to black lung benefits liabilities. The estimated liability recognized in the financial statements at December 31, 2001 was approximately $460 million. Workers Compensation Workers Compensation is a system by which individuals who sustain physical or mental injuries due to their jobs are compensated for their disabilities, medical costs, and on some occasions, for the costs of their rehabilitation, and by which the survivors of workers who are killed receive compensation for lost financial support. The workers compensation laws are administered by state agencies with each state having its own set of rules and regulations regarding compensation that is owed to an employee that is injured in the course of employment. CONSOL Energy accrues for this type of liability by recognizing cost when the event occurs that gives rise to the obligation, i.e., it is probable that the liability has been incurred and the cost can be reasonably estimated. To assist in the determination of this estimated liability CONSOL Energy utilizes the services of third party administrators in various states that we do business to determine the liability that exists for workers compensation. These third parties provide information that facilitates the estimation of the liability based on their knowledge and experience concerning similar past events. The estimated liability recognized in the financial statements at December 31, 2001, including the current portion, was approximately $322 million. 38 Reclamation and Mine Closure Obligations The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act establishes operational, reclamation and closure standards for all aspects of surface mining as well as most aspects of deep mining. CONSOL Energy accrues for the costs of current mine disturbance and final mine closure, including the cost of treating mine water discharge where necessary. Estimates of our total reclamation and mine closing liabilities, which are based upon permit requirements and CONSOL Energy engineering expertise related to these requirements, including the current portion, were approximately $396 million at December 31, 2001. This liability is reviewed annually by CONSOL Energy management and engineers. The estimated liability can significantly change if actual costs vary from assumptions or if governmental regulations change significantly. We are currently reviewing the impacts of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" on the accounting treatment of reclamation and mine closing. Therefore, the amounts will change prospectively under these new rules. Contingencies CONSOL Energy is currently involved in certain legal proceedings. We have accrued our estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of these claims. This estimate has been developed in consultation with legal counsel handling the defense in these matters and is based upon an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies. We do not believe these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position. It is possible, however, that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings. Deferred Taxes CONSOL Energy accounts for income taxes in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities. SFAS No. 109 also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. At December 31, 2001, CONSOL Energy has deferred tax assets in excess of deferred tax liabilities of approximately $576 million. The deferred tax assets are evaluated annually to determine if a valuation allowance is necessary. To date, no valuation allowance has been recognized because CONSOL Energy has determined that it is more likely than not these deferred tax assets will be realized. Realization of our deferred tax assets is principally dependent upon our achievement of projected future taxable income. Our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions, our ability to continue to successfully execute our business strategy and other factors. These changes, if any, may require possible valuation allowances to be recognized. These allowances could materially impact net income. Coal and Gas Reserve Values There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities and values of economically recoverable coal and gas reserves, including many factors beyond our control. As a result, estimates of economically recoverable coal and gas reserves are by their nature uncertain. Information about our reserves consists of estimates based on engineering, economic and geological data assembled and analyzed by our staff. Some of our gas reserves, but none of our coal reserves, have been reviewed by independent experts. Some of the factors and assumptions which impact economically recoverable reserve estimates include: . geological conditions; . historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas; . the assumed effects of regulations and taxes by governmental agencies; . assumptions governing future prices; and . future operating costs. Each of these factors may in fact vary considerably from the assumptions used in estimating reserves. For these reasons, estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of coal and gas attributable to a particular group of properties, and classifications of these reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of future net cash flows, may vary substantially. Actual production, revenues and expenditures with respect to our reserves will likely vary from estimates, and these variances may be material. 39 Certain Trends and Uncertainties In addition to the trends and uncertainties described in Item I of this Annual Report on Form 10 K under "Coal Operations Competition," "Gas Operations Competition" and "Regulations" and elsewhere in this "Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition," CONSOL Energy is subject to the trends and uncertainties set forth below. A significant decline in the prices we receive for our coal and gas could adversely affect our operating results and cash flows. Our results of operations are highly dependent upon the prices we receive for our coal and gas, which are closely linked to consumption patterns of the electric generation industry and certain industrial and residential patterns where gas is the principal fuel. For example, in calendar years 1998 and 1999, demand for coal decreased because of the warm winters in the northeastern United States. This resulted in increased inventories that caused pricing decreases in 1999. Substantially all of our natural gas production is sold on the spot market or under short term contracts at market sensitive prices. Spot prices for natural gas are subject to volatile trading patterns. Extended or substantial price declines for coal or gas would adversely affect our operating results for future periods and our ability to generate cash flows necessary to improve productivity and expand operations. If the coal or gas industry experiences overcapacity in the future, our profitability could be impaired. During the mid 1970s and early 1980s, a growing coal market and increased demand for coal attracted new investors to the coal industry, spurred the development of new mines and resulted in added production capacity throughout the industry, all of which led to increased competition and lower coal prices. Recent increases in coal prices similarly could encourage the development of expanded capacity by new or existing coal producers. Any overcapacity could reduce coal prices in the future. Increased prices for gas typically stimulate additional exploration and often result in additional supplies brought to market. Increased gas supply could reduce gas prices in the future. If customers do not extend existing contracts or enter into new long term contracts for coal, the stability and profitability of our operations could be affected. During the six months ended December 31, 2001, approximately 80% of the coal we produced was sold under contracts with terms of one year or more. The profitability of our long term coal supply contracts depends on a variety of factors, which vary from contract to contract and fluctuate during the contract term, and includes our production costs and other factors. Price changes, if any, provided in long term supply contracts are not intended to reflect our cost increases, and therefore increases in our costs may reduce our profit margins. In addition, in periods of declining market prices, provisions for adjustment or renegotiation of prices and other provisions may increase our exposure to short term coal price volatility. If a substantial portion of our long term contracts are modified or terminated, we would be adversely affected to the extent that we are unable to find other customers at the same level of profitability. As a result, we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain long term agreements at favorable prices (compared to either market conditions, as they may change from time to time, or our cost structure) or that they will contribute to our profitability. We depend on two customers for a significant portion of our revenues and the loss of one of those customers could adversely affect us. During the six months ended December 31, 2001, American Electric Power and Allegheny Energy each accounted for approximately 14% of our total revenue. Our business and operating results could be adversely affected if one of these customers does not continue to purchase the same amount of coal as it has purchased from us in the past or on terms, including pricing, it has under existing agreements. Coal mining is subject to unexpected disruptions, which could cause our quarterly or annual results to deteriorate. Our coal mining operations are predominantly underground mines. These mines are subject to conditions or events beyond our control that could disrupt operations, affect production and the cost of mining at particular mines for varying lengths of time and have a significant impact on our operating results. These conditions or events have included: . variations in thickness of the layer, or seam, of coal; . amounts of rock and other natural materials and other geological conditions; . equipment replacement or repair; . fires and other accidents; and 40 . weather conditions. For example, we encountered a sandstone intrusion in the coal seam at our Mine 84 in Pennsylvania. Because sandstone is harder than coal, mining advance rates slowed significantly at this mine. For fiscal year 2001, production at Mine 84 was 2.2 million tons, compared to 5.7 million tons for fiscal year 2000. Also, in June 1999, we were forced to temporarily seal our Loveridge Mine as a result of a fire. Disputes with our customers concerning contracts can result in litigation, which could result in our paying substantial damages. From time to time, we have disputes with our customers over the provisions of long term contracts relating to, among other things, coal quality, pricing and quantity. We may not be able to resolve any future disputes in a satisfactory manner, which could result in our paying substantial damages. The exploration for, and production of, gas is an uncertain process with many risks. The exploration for and production of gas involves numerous risks. The cost of drilling, completing and operating wells for coalbed methane or other gas is often uncertain, and a number of factors can delay or prevent drilling operations or production, including: . unexpected drilling conditions; . pressure or irregularities in formations; . equipment failures or repairs; . fires or other accidents; . adverse weather conditions; . pipeline ruptures or spills; . compliance with governmental requirements; and . shortages or delays in the availability of drilling rigs and the delivery of equipment. Our future drilling activities may not be successful, and we cannot be sure that our drilling success rates will not decline. Unsuccessful drilling activities could result in higher costs without any corresponding revenues. Also, we may not be able to obtain any options or lease rights in potential drilling locations that we identify which, among other things, could prevent us from producing gas at potential drilling locations. We have been informed by insurance companies that unless provided with collateral they no longer will issue surety bonds that we and other coal mining companies are required by law to obtain. Various federal or state laws and regulations require us to obtain surety bonds or to provide other assurance of payment for certain of our long term liabilities including mine closure or reclamation costs, workers compensation and other post employment benefits. We, along with other participants in the coal industry, have been informed by the insurance companies that they no longer will provide surety bonds for workers compensation and other post employment benefits without collateral. Although it may be possible to satisfy our obligations under these statutes and regulations, or it may be possible to satisfy the insurance companies request for collateral, by providing letters of credit or other assurances of payment, we cannot be certain that we can obtain these or that they would not be significantly more costly than surety bonds have been or otherwise impose restrictions on us. Change in Fiscal Year CONSOL Energy changed its fiscal year from a fiscal year ending June 30 to a calendar year ending December 31. CONSOL Energy had a transitional fiscal period ending December 31, 2001. CONSOL Energys first full fiscal year ending December 31 will be the year that started January 1, 2002 and ends December 31, 2002. CONSOL Energy is undertaking this change in order to align its fiscal year with that of RWE Rheinbraun A.G., its majority shareholder. 41 Liquidity and Capital Resources CONSOL Energy generally has satisfied its working capital requirements and funded its capital expenditures and debt service obligations from cash generated from operations. CONSOL Energy believes that cash generated from operations and its borrowing capacity will be sufficient to meet its working capital requirements, anticipated capital expenditures (other than major acquisitions), scheduled debt payments and anticipated dividend payments. Nevertheless, the ability of CONSOL Energy to satisfy its debt service obligations, to fund planned capital expenditures or pay dividends will depend upon its future operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions in the coal and gas industries and other financial and business factors, some of which are beyond CONSOL Energys control. In order to align long term assets purchased in 2001 with long term debt, CONSOL Energy issued $250 million principal of 7.875 percent notes due in 2012. The notes were issued at 99.174% of the principal amount and CONSOL Energy received approximately $246 million of net proceeds. Interest on the notes is payable March 1 and September 1 of each year commencing September 1, 2002. Payment of the principle and premium, if any, and interest on the notes will be guaranteed by several CONSOL Energy subsidiaries that incur or guarantee certain indebtedness. The notes are senior unsecured obligations and will rank equally with all other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of the guarantors. CONSOL Energy paid approximately $4 million for debt issue costs related to these notes. The debt issuance costs will be amortized using the interest method. CONSOL Energy frequently evaluates potential acquisitions. CONSOL Energy has funded acquisitions primarily with cash generated from operations and a variety of other sources, depending on the size of the transaction, including debt financing. There can be no assurance that such additional capital resources will be available to CONSOL Energy on terms which CONSOL Energy finds acceptable, or at all. Cash Flows Net cash provided by operating activities was $93 million in the six months ended December 31, 2001 compared to $182 million in the six months ended December 31, 2000. The change in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to increased income tax payments related to the acquisition of Windsor Coal Company, Southern Ohio Coal Company and Central Ohio Coal Company. Net cash used in investing activities was $11 million in the 2001 period compared to $131 million in the 2000 period. The change in net cash used in investing activities primarily reflects the $336 million received in the acquisition of Windsor Coal Company, Southern Ohio Coal Company and Central Ohio Coal Company reduced by the $38 million cash expenditure for the Line Creek Mine Joint Venture in the 2000 period. These reductions between periods in net cash used in investing activities were offset, in part, by the $155 million cash expenditure for the acquisition of the remaining 50% of Pocahontas Gas Partnership and the remaining 25% of Cardinal States Gathering Company, and the $18 million cash expenditure for the acquisition of a 50% interest in the Glennies Creek Mine. Cash used in investing activities was also increased due to $54 million of additional capital expenditures in the 2001 period compared to the 2000 period. Capital expenditures were $163 million in the 2001 period compared to $109 in the 2000 period. Net cash used in financing activities was $83 million in the 2001 period compared to $48 million in the 2000 period. The change in net cash used in financing activities primarily reflects additional payments made on commercial paper in the 2001 period compared to the 2000 period. The additional payments made on commercial paper primarily were due to the proceeds from the acquisition of Windsor Coal Company, Southern Ohio Coal Company and Central Ohio Coal Company being used to reduce outstanding commercial paper. This was partially offset by cash received from commercial paper to purchase the remaining 50% interest in Pocahontas Gas Partnership, the remaining 25% interest in Cardinal States Gathering Company, the 50% interest in the Glennies Creek Mine, as well as other expenditures of CONSOL Energy. The following is a summary of our significant contractual obligations at December 31, 2001 (in thousands): Payments due by Year Within 1 Year 2 3 Years 4 5 Years After 5 Years Long term Debt ..................... $68,795 $49,806 $3,736 $410,645 Capital Lease Obligations .......... 4,630 7,974 1,167 Operating Lease Obligations ........ 3,733 5,441 3,534 9,350 Total Contractual Obligations ...... $77,158 $63,221 $8,437 $419,995 42 Additionally, we have long term liabilities relating to other post employment benefits, work related injuries and illnesses, defined benefit pension plans, mine reclamation and closure, and other long term liability costs. We estimate the payments related to these items at December 31, 2001 (in thousands) to be: Payments due by Year Within 1 Year 2 3 Years 4 5 Years $119,353 $497,288 $537,625 As discussed in "Critical Accounting Policies" and in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements, our determination of these long term liabilities is calculated annually and is based on several assumptions, including then prevailing conditions, which may change from year to year. In any year, if our assumptions are inaccurate, we could be required to expend greater amounts than anticipated. Moreover, in particular, for periods after 2002 our estimates may change from the amounts included in the table, and may change significantly, if our assumptions change to reflect changing conditions. Capital expenditures were $163 million in the 2001 period compared to $109 million in the 2000 period. We currently anticipate capital expenditures for the year ending December 31, 2002 could be as much as $380 million. However, we may choose to defer certain capital projects in light of operating results. Capital expenditures for pollution abatement and reclamation are projected to be $5 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. Our capital expenditures have been and will be primarily used for replacement of mining and gas equipment, the expansion of mining and gas capacity and projects to improve the efficiency of the mining and gas operations. The projected capital expenditures for 2002 are not committed and are expected to be funded with cash generated by operations. In addition, cash requirements to fund employee related, mine closure and other long term liabilities included above, along with obligations related to long term debt, capital and operating leases, are expected to be funded with cash generated by operations. We believe the risk of generating lower than anticipated operating cash flow in 2002 is reduced by the level of sales commitments (74% of 2002 planned production) in our coal segment. If cash flow from operations is not sufficient to cover expenditures in the future, we expect to rely on the issuance of commercial paper. Our commercial paper program currently provides for borrowings of up to $400 million. Debt At December 31, 2001, CONSOL Energy had total long term debt of $300 million, including current portion of long term debt of $73 million prior to reclassification of debt as long term related to the issuance of notes due 2012. This long term debt consisted of: . An aggregate principal amount of $156 million of unsecured notes which bear interest at fixed rates ranging from 8.21% to 8.28% per annum and are due at various dates between 2002 and 2007; . An aggregate principal amount of $103 million of two series of industrial revenue bonds which were issued to finance the Baltimore port facility and bear interest at 6.50% per annum and mature in 2010 and 2011; . $28 million in advance royalty commitments with an average interest rate of 8.2%; and . An aggregate principal amount of $13 million of capital leases with an average interest rate of 7.4% per annum. At December 31, 2001, CONSOL Energy had an aggregate principal amount of $324 million of commercial paper outstanding that had maturities remaining of 1 to 30 days with interest rates ranging from 2.55% to 3.30% per annum. CONSOL Energy currently has a credit facility with several banks. This facility is used solely to support the commercial paper program. The term of this facility is 364 days renewable on a 364 day basis. In the aggregate, the total amount of funds borrowed under this facility and outstanding commercial paper cannot exceed $400 million. Borrowings under this revolving credit facility bear interest based on the London Interbank Offer Rate (LIBOR) or the Prime Rate at CONSOL Energys option. Funds may be borrowed for periods of 1 to 270 days depending on the interest rate method. There were no borrowings under this facility at December 31, 2001, June 30, 2001 and June 30, 2000. Stockholders Equity and Dividends CONSOL Energy had stockholders equity of $272 million at December 31, 2001 and $352 million at June 30, 2001. CONSOL Energy paid ordinary cash dividends of $44 million during the six months ended December 31, 2001 and $88 million during the twelve months ended June 30, 2001. The Board of Directors declared a dividend on January 24, 2002 of $0.28 per share of common stock for shareholders of record on February 11, 2002, payable on February 28, 2002. The Board of Directors currently intends to pay quarterly dividends on the common stock. The declaration and payment of dividends by CONSOL Energy is subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors, and no assurance can be given that CONSOL Energy will pay such dividend or any further dividends. The determination as to the payment of dividends will depend upon, among other things, 43 general business conditions, CONSOL Energys financial results, contractual and legal restrictions regarding the payment of dividends by CONSOL Energy, the credit ratings of CONSOL Energy, planned investments by CONSOL Energy and such other factors as the Board of Directors deems relevant. Current outstanding indebtedness of CONSOL Energy does not restrict CONSOL Energys ability to pay cash dividends. In March, 2001, CONSOL Energy approved a program to grant stock options to eligible full time employees. Under the program, eligible employees received options to purchase up to 100 CONSOL Energy shares at the fair market value on the date of the option grant ($30.18 per share). There is a one year vesting requirement on these options. In March 2000, CONSOL Energy announced that it would begin a share repurchase program of up to 1,000,000 shares of CONSOL Energys common stock. The stock repurchase will be used in connection with benefit plan administration. The timing of the purchases and the number of shares to be purchased are dependent upon market conditions. Through June 30, 2000, CONSOL Energy had repurchased 412,600 shares at an average price of $10.92 in this share repurchase program and has not repurchased any shares since. Inflation Inflation in the United States has been relatively low in recent years and did not have a material impact on CONSOL Energys results of operations for the six months ended December 31, 2001, the twelve months ended June 30, 2001 or the twelve months ended June 30, 2000. Recent Accounting Pronouncements On August 17, 2001 Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" was issued and will be effective for CONSOL Energy in the first quarter of the year ended December 31, 2003. The new rule requires the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation to be recognized in the period in which it is incurred. When the liability is initially recorded, a cost is capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset. Over time, the liability is accreted to its present value each period, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. To settle the liability, the obligation for its recorded amount is paid or a gain or loss upon settlement is incurred. Management will be analyzing this requirement to determine the effect on CONSOL Energys financial statements. In July 2001, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, "Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets," was issued and will be effective for CONSOL Energy in the first quarter of the year ending December 31, 2003. The provisions of this statement provide a single accounting model for impairment of long lived assets. No material effect from this adoption is anticipated. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. CONSOL Energys interest expense is sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates in the United States. At December 31, 2001, CONSOL Energy had outstanding $300 million aggregate principal amount of debt under fixed rate instruments and $324 million aggregate principal amount of debt under variable rate instruments prior to reclassification of debt as long term related to the issuance of notes due 2012. CONSOL Energys primary exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to its commercial paper program. At December 31, 2001, CONSOL Energy had an aggregate of $324 million in commercial paper outstanding prior to reclassification of Notes. CONSOL Energys commercial paper bore interest at an average rate of 3.4% during the six months ended December 31, 2001. A 100 basis point increase in the average rate for CONSOL Energys commercial paper would have decreased CONSOL Energys six months ended December 31, 2001 net income by approximately $0.6 million. Assuming outstanding commercial paper was reduced in July 2001 by the proceeds from the issuance of fixed rate Notes due 2012, net income on a pro forma basis, would be approximately $2.8 million lower. The fair value of CONSOL Energys financial instruments is set forth in Note 25 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Almost all of CONSOL Energys transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars, and, as a result, it does not have material exposure to currency exchange rate risks. CONSOL Energy has not engaged in any interest rate, foreign currency exchange rate or commodity price hedging transactions. 44
