Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. General CONSOL Energy had net income of $199 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 compared to a net loss of $8 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003. Net income for 2004 was improved due to increased coal and gas sales volume and increased average sales prices for both coal and gas. Pre tax earnings also improved $21 million due to the recognition of the favorable effects of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003. Net income also improved due to the gain on sale of the stock of our wholly owned subsidiary, CNX Australia Pty Limited, to certain affiliates of AMCI, Inc. In addition, net income improved due to an increased tax benefit related to the release of $15 million of contingent income tax liability resulting from the settlement of the federal, state and foreign income tax audits of prior years. Also, additional income resulted from the cumulative effect of change in accounting related to workers compensation in 2004. These increases in net income were offset, in part, by higher cost of goods sold attributable to higher sales volumes of coal and gas and to higher unit costs for coal and gas produced. Higher cost per ton of coal produced was due mainly to increased labor, supply and Combined Fund premiums per unit produced. Higher cost of gas produced was attributable to increased royalty cost and cost of firm transportation incurred by the gas operations. Increases in net income were also offset, in part, by $32 million of accelerated depreciation, depletion and amortization taken for equipment and facilities at Rend Lake and other idled mining operations. While there are no current plans for the use of the equipment or facilities, these mines have existing reserves that could be accessed from other locations or through new facilities. Total coal sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 were 69.5 million tons, including our portion of sales by equity affiliates, of which 67.4 million tons were produced by CONSOL Energy operations, by our equity affiliates or sold from inventory of company produced coal, including coal sold from inventories and produced by equity affiliates. This compares with total coal sales of 64.0 million tons for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, of which 61.5 million tons were produced by CONSOL Energy operations or sold from inventory of company produced coal including coal sold from inventories and produced by equity affiliates. The increase in tons sold was due primarily to the Loveridge Mine resuming production in March 2004 and increased production at the McElroy Mine. Loveridge experienced a fire in February 2003 while it was in the process of developing a new underground area and therefore it had no production in 2003. McElroy production increased due to the addition of a second longwall mining unit during 2004 and improved mining conditions compared to 2003. Several other mines increased production in 2004 compared to 2003. CONSOL Energy produced 67.7 million tons, including our portion of production at equity affiliates in 2004 compared to 60.4 million tons, including our portion of production at equity affiliates in 2003. Sales of coalbed methane gas, including our share of the sales from equity affiliates were 55.5 billion cubic feet in 2004 compared to 50.8 billion cubic feet in 2003. The increased sales volume is primarily due to higher production volumes as a result of our on going drilling program. Our average sales price for coalbed methane gas, including our portion of sales from equity affiliates, was $5.05 per thousand cubic feet in 2004 compared to $4.16 per thousand cubic feet in 2003. We believe that the 2004 gas market price increases were largely attributable to continued concerns over levels of North American gas production, as well as increased oil prices and the economic recovery which resulted in greater electricity use in our principal markets. CONSOL Energy restated first quarter 2004 net income by approximately $2.2 million to reflect the recognition of the favorable effects of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 as of March 8, 2004 in accordance with authoritative accounting guidance. CONSOL Energys Buchanan Mine, located near Keen Mountain, Virginia, experienced a large rock fall behind its longwall mining section on February 14, 2005. While caving behind the longwall is a normal part of the mining process, the size of this cave in created a large air pressure wave that disrupted ventilation and also caused an ignition of methane gas in the area. CONSOL Energy has temporarily sealed the mine in order to extinguish the localized fire that developed after the ignition. Based on a review of gas samples from the mine 41 Table of Contents that have been collected and analyzed by CONSOL Energy as well as by state and federal safety officials, it has been determined that the fire exists in a localized area adjacent to the longwall mining system. In addition to sealing the mine, CONSOL Energy plans to drill several boreholes from the surface into the area of the mine where the problem is believed to be located. An initial borehole drilling has penetrated the mine at the place where a mine fire was suspected to have started. Video equipment lowered into the borehole to visually inspect the area shows that the location is clear of any fire or smoke. Various materials, including nitrogen foam and water will be pumped into the area in order to accelerate the process of creating an inert environment within the mine to extinguish the fire. The mine is currently idle and will not produce coal while the mine is sealed. Gas production from this area may also be curtailed due to the idling of the Buchanan longwall. Gas production from this area averaged 23.6 thousand cubic feet per day in January 2005. Results of Operations Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2004 compared with Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2003 (Amounts reported in millions) Net Income Net income changed primarily due to the following items: 2004 2003 Dollar Variance Percentage Change Coal Sales Produced and Purchased $ 2,087 $ 1,758 $ 329 18.7 % Gas Sales Produced 275 208 67 32.2 % Gas Sales Purchased 112 112 100.0 % Other Sales and other income 303 256 47 18.4 % Total Revenue and other income 2,777 2,222 555 25.0 % Coal Cost of Goods Sold Produced and Purchased 1,533 1,310 223 17.0 % Produced Gas Cost of Goods Sold 105 84 21 25.0 % Purchased Gas Cost of Goods Sold 113 113 100.0 % Other Cost of Goods Sold 250 230 20 8.7 % Total Cost of Goods Sold 2,001 1,624 377 23.2 % Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization 280 242 38 15.7 % Taxes Other Than Income 198 160 38 23.8 % Other 215 230 (15 ) (6.5 )% Total Costs 2,694 2,256 438 19.4 % Earnings (Loss) before income tax and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 83 (34 ) 117 344.1 % Income Taxes 33 21 12 57.1 % Earnings (Loss) before Cumulative effect of change in accounting 116 (13 ) 129 992.3 % Cumulative effect of change in accounting 83 5 78 1,560.0 % Net Income (Loss) $ 199 $ (8 ) $ 207 2,587.5 % Net income for 2004 was improved due to increased coal and gas sales volumes and increased average sales prices for both coal and gas. Pre tax earnings also improved $21 million due to the recognition of the favorable effects of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 as of March 8, 2004 in accordance with accounting guidance. Also, net income was improved $14 million due to the gain on sale of the stock of CONSOL Energys wholly owned subsidiary, CNX Australia Pty Limited, to certain affiliates of AMCI, Inc. In addition, net income improved due to an increased tax benefit related to the release of $15 million of contingent income tax liabilities resulting from the settlement of the federal, state and foreign income tax audits of prior years. Also, an additional $83 million of income from the cumulative effect of change in accounting related to workers compensation was recognized in 2004 compared to $5 million of income for mine 42 Table of Contents closing, perpetual care and gas well closing costs recognized in 2003. These increases in net income were offset, in part, by higher cost of goods sold attributable to higher sales volumes of coal and gas and to higher unit costs for coal and gas produced. Higher cost per ton of coal produced was due mainly to increased labor, supply and Combined Fund premiums per unit produced. Higher cost of gas produced was attributable to increased royalty cost and cost of firm transportation incurred by the gas operations. Increases in net income were also offset, in part, by $32 million of accelerated depreciation, depletion and amortization taken for equipment and facilities at Rend Lake and other idled mining operations. While there are no current plans for the use of the equipment or facilities, these mines have existing reserves that could be accessed from other locations or through new facilities. Revenue Revenue and other income increased due to the following items: 2004 2003 Dollar Variance Percentage Change Sales Produced Coal $ 2,008 $ 1,683 $ 325 Produced Coal Related Party 1 (1 ) Total Produced Coal 2,008 1,684 324 19.2 % Purchased Coal 79 74 5 6.8 % Produced Gas 275 208 67 32.2 % Purchased Gas 112 112 100.0 % Industrial Supplies 79 63 16 25.4 % Other 27 14 13 92.9 % Total Sales 2,580 2,043 537 26.3 % Freight Revenue 110 114 (4 ) Freight Related Party 1 (1 ) Total Freight 110 115 (5 ) (4.3 )% Other Income 87 64 23 35.9 % Total Revenue and Other Income $ 2,777 $ 2,222 555 25.0 % The increase in Company produced coal sales revenue was due mainly to higher volumes sold during the period to period comparison and an increase in average sales price per ton. 2004 2003 Variance Percentage Change Produced Tons Sold (in millions) 67.3 60.9 6.4 10.5 % Average Sales Price Per Ton $ 29.84 $ 27.67 $ 2.17 7.8 % The increase in tons sold was due primarily to the Loveridge Mine resuming production in March 2004 and increased production at the McElroy Mine. Loveridge experienced a fire in February 2003 while it was in the process of developing a new underground area and therefore it had no production in 2003. McElroy production increased due to the addition of a second longwall mining unit during 2004 and improved mining conditions compared to 2003. The increase in company produced coal sales revenue was also attributable to the increase in average sales price per ton sold. The increase in average sales price reflects stronger prices negotiated in 2003 and an overall improvement in 2004 prices in the eastern coal market for coals sold to domestic and foreign utilities and for metallurgical coal. 43 Table of Contents The increase in Company purchased coal sales revenue was due to higher average sales price per ton of purchased coal, offset, in part, by a decrease in tons of purchased coal sold. 2004 2003 Variance Percentage Change Purchased Tons Sold (in millions) 2.1 2.4 (0.3 ) (12.5 )% Average Sales Price Per Ton $ 37.60 $ 31.16 $ 6.44 20.7 % The increased average sales price is primarily due to some of the purchased coal tons being sold in higher priced export and metallurgical markets. Increased revenue from higher average sales prices were offset by lower sales volumes in 2004 compared to 2003. The increase in gas sales revenue was primarily due to a higher average sales price per thousand cubic feet and increased volumes sold in 2004 compared to 2003. 2004 2003 Variance Percentage Change Produced Gas Gross Sales Volumes (in billion cubic feet) 54.6 50.0 4.6 9.2 % Average Sales Price Per thousand cubic feet $ 5.04 $ 4.16 $ 0.88 21.2 % We believe that the 2004 gas market price increases were largely driven by continued concerns over levels of North American gas production, as well as increased oil prices and the economic recovery which resulted in greater electricity use in our principal markets. CONSOL Energy enters into various physical gas supply transactions with both gas marketers and end users for terms varying in length from a single day to greater than a year. CONSOL Energy has also entered into various gas swap transactions that qualify as financial cash flow hedges. These gas swap transactions exist parallel to the underlying physical transactions. In 2004, these financial cash flow hedges represented 28% of our produced gas sales volumes at an average price of $5.10 per thousand cubic feet. We currently intend to cover approximately 17% of our estimated 2005 production volume with gas swap transactions. CONSOL Energy sold 84% of its produced gas sales volumes in 2004 under fixed priced contracts at an average price of $4.96 per thousand cubic feet compared to 90% of its gas sales volumes under fixed price contracts in 2003 at an average price of $3.99 per thousand cubic feet. Higher sales volumes in 2004 were a result of wells coming on line from the ongoing drilling program, which allowed CONSOL Energy to take advantage of increased prices. CONSOL has entered into fixed price gas sales contracts with various marketers, representing approximately 63% of total projected 2005 production, at an average price of $4.78/mcf in order to manage price fluctuations and achieve more predictable cash flows. Due to the potential curtailment on portions of the shipment capacity allocated to CONSOL Energy as a result of increased demand for pipeline use on the Columbia Gas Transmission Corporations interstate gas pipeline, referred to as the pipeline, CONSOL Energy purchased firm transportation capacity on the pipeline during 2004. The first firm transportation arrangement covered the May 2004 through October 2004 period. CONSOL Energy expects to experience potential production curtailments through spring and summer of 2005 due to capacity constraints continuing on the pipeline. In November 2004, CONSOL Energy entered into an extended firm transportation arrangement for fixed capacity on the pipeline to offset a portion of the expected impact from the estimated curtailments. This arrangement covers the November 2004 through October 2006 period. As of February 2005, the purchased fixed capacity on the pipeline represents approximately 35% of our projected production for the same period. In addition, in order to satisfy obligations to certain customers, we purchased gas from and sold gas to other gas suppliers, which increased our revenues and our costs. 2004 2003 Variance Percentage Change Purchased Gas Sales Volumes (in billion cubic feet) 17.5 17.5 100.0 % Average Sales Price Per thousand cubic feet $ 6.39 $ 6.39 100.0 % The increase in revenues from the sale of industrial supplies was due to increased sales volumes and prices. 44 Table of Contents The increase in other sales is primarily attributable to higher through put of outside coal volumes through our Baltimore terminal. Freight revenue, outside and related party, is based on weight of coal shipped, negotiated freight rates and method of transportation (i.e., rail, barge, truck, etc.) used for the customers to which CONSOL Energy contractually provides transportation services. Freight revenue is the amount billed to customers for transportation costs incurred. Other income consists of interest income, gain or loss on the disposition of assets, equity in earnings of affiliates, service income, royalty income, derivative gains and losses, rental income and miscellaneous income. 2004 2003 Dollar Variance Percentage Change Gain on Sale of Assets $ 41 $ 23 $ 18 78.3 % Royalty Income 19 16 3 18.8 % Harbor Maintenance Fee Refund 3 (3 ) (100.0 )% Equity in Loss of Affiliates (4 ) (9 ) 5 55.6 % Other Miscellaneous 31 31 Total Other Revenue $ 87 $ 64 $ 23 35.9 % The 2004 gain on sale of assets is due mainly to CONSOL Energys sale of stock in its wholly owned subsidiary, CNX Australia Pty Limited, to certain affiliates of AMCI, Inc. for $28 million. Certain affiliates of AMCI, Inc. also assumed approximately $21 million of debt, and associated interest rate swaps and foreign currency hedges. CNX Australia Pty Limited, through its wholly owned subsidiary CONSOL Energy Australia Pty Limited, owned a 50% interest in the Glennies Creek Mine in New South Wales, Australia with its joint venture partner Maitland Main Collieries Pty Limited, an affiliate of AMCI, Inc. The sale was completed on February 25, 2004 and resulted in a pre tax gain of approximately $14 million. The gain on sale of assets in 2004 is also related to the assignment of certain coal leases, conveyance of associated surface property, the transfer of related mining permits and the related liabilities for a location in southern West Virginia that resulted in a pre tax gain of approximately $7 million. The additional gain on sale of assets in 2004 is related to the sale of several previously closed operations and the sale of surplus equipment. The 2003 gain on sale of assets primarily was related to the expiration in 2003 of an option granted to a third party to purchase property for which CONSOL Energy received nonrefundable proceeds of $5 million and gains from the sale of surplus equipment. Royalty income has increased due primarily to third parties producing additional tonnage and gas volumes from CONSOL owned property in the period to period comparison. Other income for 2003 included a $3 million harbor maintenance fee refund received from the federal government for prior claims related to harbor maintenance fees imposed by the Federal statute that was subsequently declared unconstitutional. These claims were pursued since 1991, and we do not expect other refunds related to these claims. 45 Table of Contents The improvement in equity losses of affiliates is primarily attributable to CONSOL Energys equity interest in the losses of Glennies Creek mine in 2003. CONSOL Energys interest in this mine was sold in February 2004. Costs 2004 2003 Dollar Variance Percentage Change Cost of Goods Sold and Other Charges: Produced Coal $ 1,457 $ 1,238 $ 219 17.7 % Purchased Coal 76 72 4 5.6 % Produced Gas 105 84 21 25.0 % Purchased Gas 113 113 100.0 % Industrial Supplies 94 66 28 42.4 % Closed and Idle Mines 72 62 10 16.1 % Other 84 102 (18 ) (17.6 )% Total Cost of Goods Sold $ 2,001 $ 1,624 $ 377 23.2 % Increased cost of goods sold and other charges for company produced coal was due mainly to the increased produced tons sold and an increase in the average cost per ton of produced coal sold. 2004 2003 Variance Percentage Change Produced Tons Sold (in millions) 67.3 60.9 6.4 10.5 % Average Cost of Goods Sold and Other Charges Per Ton $ 21.64 $ 20.34 $ 1.30 6.4 % Produced tons sold increased due primarily to the Loveridge Mine resuming production in March 2004 and increased production at the McElroy Mine. Loveridge experienced a fire in February 2003 while it was in the process of developing a new underground area and therefore this location had no production in 2003. McElroy production increased due to the addition of a second longwall mining unit during 2004 and improved mining conditions compared to 2003. Several other mines increased production in 2004 compared with 2003. Average cost of goods sold and other charges per ton also increased in 2004 compared to 2003. This increase was attributable to higher supply costs and labor per unit produced. Increased supply costs were related to the higher costs of materials, especially metal products, used in the mining process experienced in 2004 compared to 2003. Increased labor and supply costs were also attributable to additional continuous miner shifts in 2004. Continuous mining machines are used to mine the coal reserve in such a way that large, rectangular blocks of coal, called panels, are delineated underground in preparation for mining by larger more efficient longwall machines in mines equipped with these systems. Typically, mines attempt to delineate more than one panel in advance so that as the longwall machine completes the extraction of the coal in one panel, it can move without delay to another prepared panel. Continuous mining machines are more labor intensive and use more supplies per ton of coal produced than longwall mining systems. Also, CONSOL Energy production from non longwall mines required additional continuous mining machine shifts to maintain prior year production levels at these locations. Increased average cost per ton was also due to increased Combined Fund premiums related to a premium differential announced by the Social Security Administration for the past eleven plan years for beneficiaries assigned to CONSOL Energy. The increase was approximately $28 million for the plan year beginning October 1, 2003, of which all has been expensed from October 1, 2003 through September 30, 2004. Approximately $21 million of expense was recognized in 2004. These increases in costs per ton were offset, in part, by reduced other post employment benefits due to the recognition of the effects of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 in 2004. 46 Table of Contents Purchased coal cost of goods sold and other charges increased due primarily to higher average cost per ton, offset, in part, by reduced volumes of purchased coal sold. 2004 2003 Variance Percentage Change Purchased Tons Sold (in millions) 2.1 2.4 (0.3 ) (12.5 )% Average Cost of Goods Sold and Other Charges Per Ton $ 36.34 $ 30.31 $ 6.03 19.9 % The increase in cost of goods sold and other charges for purchased coal was primarily due to higher average cost per ton of purchased coal sold in 2004 compared to 2003. The increase in the average cost of purchased coal is primarily due to increased market prices for export and metallurgical coal. The increase in cost of goods sold and other charges was offset, in part, due to a slight decrease in volume of purchased coal sold. Produced gas cost of goods sold and other charges increased due to increased average cost per thousand cubic feet sold and increased volumes. 2004 2003 Variance Percentage Change Produced Gas Gross Sales Volumes (in billion cubic feet) 54.6 50.0 4.6 9.2 % Average Cost Per Thousand cubic feet $ 1.93 $ 1.69 $ 0.24 14.2 % The increase in average cost per thousand cubic feet of gas sold was attributable to a $0.21 increase per thousand cubic feet in royalty expense. Royalty expense increased primarily due to the 21.2% increase in average sales price per thousand cubic feet in 2004 compared to 2003. Average cost per thousand cubic feet of gas sold also increased approximately $0.08 related to the purchase of firm transportation capacity on the Columbia Gas Transmission Corporations interstate pipeline because of potential curtailments on portions of the shipment capacity allocated to CONSOL Energy as a result of increased demand for pipeline. CONSOL Energy purchased firm transportation capacity on the pipeline from the May 2004 through October 2004 period to assure firm pipeline capacity of our projected production. In November 2004, CONSOL Energy entered into an extended firm transportation arrangement for use on the pipeline. This arrangement covers November 2004 through October 2006. The purchased fixed capacity on the pipeline represents approximately 35% of our projected production for the same period. These increases were offset, in part, by various reduced costs in 2004, none of which were individually material. Cost of goods sold and other charges for produced gas also increase due to increased sales volume in 2004 as a result of wells coming on line from the ongoing drilling program. In addition, in order to satisfy obligations to certain customers, we purchased from and sold to other gas suppliers, which increased our revenues and our costs. We believe this type of transaction will continue as a result of increased capacity demands on the Columbia pipeline. 2004 2003 Variance Percentage Change Purchased Gas Sales Volumes (in billion cubic feet) 17.5 17.5 100.0 % Average Cost Per Thousand Cubic Feet $ 6.45 $ 6.45 100.0 % Industrial supplies cost of goods sold increased due to higher sales volumes and higher unit costs of goods sold. Closed and idle mine costs were $72 million in 2004 compared to $62 million in 2003. The increase in cost reflects mine closing, perpetual care water treatment and reclamation liability adjustments as a result of updated engineering surveys. Survey adjustments resulted in $3 million of expense in 2004 for closed and idled locations. Closed and idle mine cost also increased approximately $10 million due to the change in calculation of workers compensation claims. Effective January 1, 2004, CONSOL Energy changed its method of accounting for workers compensation. Under the new method, the undiscounted liability is actuarially calculated based on 47 Table of Contents claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported. Additionally, the workers compensation liability is recorded on a discounted basis, which has been actuarially determined using various assumptions. Approximately $3 million of the increased closed and idle workers compensation increase is related to interest accretion. The increase in closed and idle mine cost was offset by a decrease of $6 million related to the idled Rend Lake mine. Rend Lake mine has been idle since July 2002. Closed and idle mine cost of goods sold and other charges was also impaired by approximately $3 million due to various miscellaneous transactions that occurred throughout both periods, none of which was individually material. Miscellaneous cost of goods sold and other charges decreased due to the following items: 2004 2003 Dollar Variance Percentage Change Loveridge fire $ $ 17 $ (17 ) (100.0 )% Mine 84 fire 5 (5 ) (100.0 )% Supply inventory write downs 5 (5 ) (100.0 )% Other post employee benefit curtailment gain (3 ) (3 ) (100.0 )% Cardinal River severance and pension cost 2 (2 ) (100.0 )% Buckeye landfill superfund site liability transfer (1 ) (1 ) (100.0 )% Litigation settlements and Contingencies 4 17 (13 ) (76.5 )% Incentive compensation 25 25 100.0 % Sales contract buy outs 9 1 8 800.0 % Miscellaneous transactions 50 55 (5 ) (9.1 )% Total Miscellaneous Cost of Goods Sold and Other Charges $ 84 $ 102 $ (18 ) (17.6 )% In February 2003, Loveridge Mine experienced a fire near the bottom of the slope entry that is used to carry coal from the mine to the surface. The cost of goods sold and other charges related to extinguishing the fire was approximately $17 million and other expenses related to the fire were approximately $3 million, net of expected insurance recovery. In late December 2002, the mine had begun the process of developing a new underground area that would be mined with longwall mining equipment that was expected to be installed later in 2003. The fire delayed this installation until March of 2004. In January 2003, Mine 84 experienced a fire along several hundred feet of the conveyor belt entry servicing the longwall section of the mine. The fire was extinguished approximately two weeks later. On January 20, 2003, the mine resumed production on a limited basis with continuous mining machines, while repairs continued on the belt entry. The fire caused damage to the roof support system, the conveyor belt and the steel framework on which the belt travels. Repairs took several weeks to complete and were estimated to cost approximately $7 million, net of expected insurance recovery, of which $5 million was attributable to cost of goods sold and other related charges and $2 million to other expenses. Longwall coal production, which accounts for the majority of coal normally produced at the mine resumed on February 10, 2003. Supply inventory write downs reflect adjustments made in 2003 to supply inventories that are unique to the equipment used at Dilworth and Rend Lake mines where the mining activities have ceased. Due to the restructuring that occurred in December 2003, a curtailment gain related to the other post employment benefit plan of approximately $3 million was recognized in 2004. Due to CONSOL Energys measurement date being September 30, the gain was not recognized until the quarter ended March 31, 2004. 48 Table of Contents Cardinal River Mine severance and pension accruals are attributable to the costs for which CONSOL Energy remains responsible following the sale of the mines assets. Accordingly, in 2003, CONSOL Energy recognized the cost estimate of these plans. In April 2004, CONSOL Energy entered into an Environmental Liability Transfer and Indemnity Agreement that transferred our liability related to the Buckeye Landfill Superfund Site to another party. In 1991 CONSOL Energy was named a potentially responsible party related to the Buckeye Landfill Superfund Site and accordingly recognized our estimated liability for remediation of this site. The Transfer and Indemnity transaction resulted in the reversal of the remaining liability and the recognition of approximately $1 million of income. Litigation settlements and contingencies decreased due to various contingent loss accruals related to asbestos, waste management and various other contingencies in both periods, none of which are individually material. Incentive compensation expense increased in 2004 compared to 2003 due mainly to the level of earnings achieved in 2004 compared to projected 2004 annual results. The incentive compensation package is designed to increase compensation to eligible employees when CONSOL Energy reaches predetermined earnings targets and the employees reach predetermined performance targets. There was no incentive compensation expense in 2003 due to CONSOL Energy not achieving predetermined earnings targets. In 2004, agreements were made with several customers in order to release tons committed under lower priced contracts for sale to other customers at higher pricing. Cost of goods sold and other charges also decreased $5 million due to various miscellaneous transactions which occurred throughout both periods, none of which was individually material. Freight expense is based on weight of coal shipped, negotiated freight rates and method of transportation (i.e., rail, barge, truck, etc) used for the customers to whom CONSOL Energy contractually provides transportation. Freight expense is billed to customers and the revenue from such billing equals the transportation expense. 2004 2003 Dollar Variance Percentage Change Freight expense $ 110 $ 115 $ (5 ) (4.3 )% Selling, general and administrative costs have decreased due to the following items: 2004 2003 Dollar Variance Percentage Change Wages and salaries $ 25 $ 29 $ (4 ) (13.8 )% Other post employment and pension costs 8 11 (3 ) (27.3 )% Professional consulting and other purchased services 14 15 (1 ) (6.7 )% Commissions 7 5 2 40.0 % Insurance 3 2 1 50.0 % Other 16 16 Total Selling, General And Administrative $ 73 $ 78 $ (5 ) (6.4 )% Wages and salaries for selling, general and administrative have decreased primarily due to the December 2003 reduction in workforce program. The reduction program was primarily focused on reducing the number of positions in the selling, general and administrative areas to better align with CONSOL Energys current business strategy. The program reduced approximately 100 positions. The decreases in expense as a result of these reductions were offset, in part, by the completion of the integrated information technology system provided by 49 Table of Contents SAP AG in August 2003. Prior to the completion, wages and salaries for dedicated staff were capitalized as a component of the cost of the implementation project and are being amortized over seven years. The wages capitalized for 2003 were approximately $2 million. Costs related to other post employment benefits in 2004 have decreased from 2003 due to the recognition of the effects of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 in 2004. Professional consulting and other purchased services has decreased in 2004 primarily due to lower software support services, offset, in part, by professional and consulting services provided in relation to reviewing employee benefit plans and compensation packages provided by CONSOL Energy. Costs for coal commissions increased due to entering into an additional sales agreement in 2004 that requires commissions to be paid. Insurance costs increased primarily due to the cost of director and officer insurance costs incurred in 2004. For a portion of 2003, CONSOL Energy directors and officers were previously insured under the RWE AG general liability policy. Depreciation, depletion and amortization has increased due to the following items: 2004 2003 Dollar Variance Percentage Change Coal $ 233 $ 196 $ 37 18.9 % Gas Production 23 23 Gathering 10 10 Total Gas 33 33 Other 14 13 1 7.7 % Total Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization $ 280 $ 242 $ 38 15.7 % The increase in coal depreciation, depletion and amortization was primarily attributable to the acceleration of approximately $32 million of depreciation for equipment and facilities at the Rend Lake and other idle mines. CONSOL Energys management reviewed the condition of the assets at these idle locations and determined no plan of use for these items, and therefore abandoned the facilities. These facilities have existing coal reserves that may be accessed from other locations or through new facilities. Gas depreciation, depletion and amortization was consistent in both 2004 and 2003. Production assets are depreciated using the units of production method. Units of production depreciation was based on higher gas volumes, offset by a lower rate due to increased reserve figures at January 1, 2004 compared to January 1, 2003. Gathering assets are depreciated using the straight line method and their depreciation did not change in the period to period comparison. The increase in other depreciation, depletion and amortization was primarily due to additional depreciation on the integrated information technology system installed to support business processes. The system was implemented in stages beginning in January 2001 and was substantially complete in August 2003. 50 Table of Contents Interest expense has decreased primarily due to the following items: 2004 2003 Dollar Variance Percentage Change Revolving Credit Facility and Commercial Paper $ 4 $ 2 2 100.0 % Long term Debt 32 34 (2 ) (5.9 )% Other (5 ) (2 ) (3 ) (150.0 )% Total Interest Expense $ 31 $ 34 $ (3 ) (8.8 )% Interest expense on commercial paper and the borrowings under the revolving credit facility increased primarily due to the weighted average interest rate of 5.25% per annum in 2004 compared to 2.34% in 2003. The increase was offset, in part, by a reduction of $15 million in the weighted average amount of outstanding borrowings in 2004 compared to 2003. Until July 2003, CONSOL Energys borrowings principally were in the form of commercial paper, which bears a lower interest rate than bank borrowings. As of July 2003, CONSOL Energy was no longer able to participate as a seller of commercial paper due to Standard and Poors lowering its rating of our short term debt. The decrease in long term debt interest expense also reflected the scheduled payment of $45 million principal amount of debt in June 2004. Other interest expense was reduced primarily due to the increase in the amount of interest capitalized in 2004 as a result of the higher level of capital projects funded from operating cash flows in 2004. Taxes other than income has increased primarily due to the following items: 2004 2003 Dollar Variance Percentage Change Production taxes: Coal $ 123 $ 98 $ 25 25.5 % Gas 9 6 3 50.0 % Total Production taxes 132 104 28 26.9 % Other taxes: Coal 58 48 10 20.8 % Gas 3 3 Other 5 5 Total Other taxes 66 56 10 17.9 % Total Taxes Other Than Income $ 198 $ 160 $ 38 23.8 % Increased coal production taxes are primarily due to higher severance and black lung excise taxes attributable to higher average sales prices and higher coal volumes produced in 2004 compared to 2003. Increased gas production taxes are primarily due to higher severance taxes related to increased gas production volumes and higher average sales prices. Increased other taxes in the coal segment are primarily due to higher payroll taxes related to an increase in 2004 labor costs compared to 2003. The increased labor costs are primarily related to the late March 2004 start up of the Loveridge Mine. This mine was idled in 2003. Restructuring Cost Restructuring costs of approximately $4 million in 2003 primarily represent the severance dollars paid related to the December 2003 reduction in workforce program implemented by CONSOL Energy. The program 51 Table of Contents was primarily focused on reducing the number of positions in the selling, general and administrative areas and resulted in the reduction of approximately 100 positions and approximately $10 million of wages, salaries and benefits in the administrative functions in 2004. Also included in the restructuring costs are severance monies paid throughout 2003 for positions that have been eliminated by CONSOL Energy management in an effort to reduce costs and realign its selling, general and administrative functions with todays company strategies. Export Sales Excise Tax Resolution CONSOL Energy is no longer required to pay certain excise taxes on export sales. We have received refunds in 2003 for our claims and related interest for the years 1994 1999. Upon receipt of these items, we have adjusted our estimate of interest receivable to the amounts received. This adjustment resulted in an additional $1 million in 2003. A receivable for the claims for the years 1991 1993 is still outstanding. There is no interest receivable related to these claims. Income Taxes 2004 2003 Variance Percentage Change Earnings (Loss) Before Income Taxes $ 83 $ (34 ) $ 117 344.1 % Tax Expense (Benefit) (33 ) (21 ) (12 ) (57.1 )% Effective Income Tax Rate (39.5 )% 62.4 % (101.9 )% CONSOL Energys effective tax rate is sensitive to changes to the relationship between pre tax earnings and percentage depletion. The effective rate for 2004 was also impacted by the recognition of the effects of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003. The provision for income tax is adjusted at the time the returns are filed to reflect changes in previously estimated amounts. The tax benefit was increased by $4 million in 2004 and was reduced by $5 million in 2003 related to these adjustments. The 2004 income tax benefit also includes approximately $15 million due to the release of a contingent income tax liability resulting from the settlement of the federal, state and foreign income tax audits of prior years. See note 9 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10 K for additional information. Cumulative Effect of Changes in Accounting for Workers Compensation, Mine Closing, Reclamation and Gas Well Closing Costs Effective January 1, 2004, CONSOL Energy changed its method of accounting for workers compensation. Under the new method, the undiscounted liability is actuarially calculated based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported. Additionally, the workers compensation liability is recorded on a discounted basis, which has been actuarially determined using various assumptions, including a discount rate of 6% and a future health care cost trend rate of 10%, declining to 4.75% in 2010. CONSOL Energy believes this change was preferable since it aligns the accounting for workers compensation with CONSOL Energys other long term employee benefit obligations, which are recorded on a discounted basis. Additionally, it provides a better comparison with CONSOL Energys industry peers, the majority of which, we believe, record the workers compensation liability on a discounted basis. As a result of the change, CONSOL Energy reduced its workers compensation liability by $136 million and reduced its related deferred tax asset by $53 million. The cumulative effect adjustment recognized upon adoption was a gain of $83 million, and accordingly is reflected as a cumulative effect adjustment from a change in accounting. Effective January 1, 2003, CONSOL Energy adopted SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, as required. CONSOL Energy reflected a gain of approximately $5 million, net of a tax cost of approximately $3 million. At the time of adoption, total assets, net of accumulated depreciation, increased 52 Table of Contents approximately $59 million and total liabilities increased approximately $51 million. The amounts recorded upon adoption are dependent upon a number of variables, including the estimated future retirement costs, estimated proved reserves, assumptions involving profit margins, inflation rates and the assumed credit adjusted risk free interest rate. Previous accounting standards generally used the units of production method to match estimated retirement costs with the revenues generated by the producing assets. In contrast, SFAS No. 143 requires depreciation of the capitalized asset retirement cost and accretion of the asset retirement obligation over time. The depreciation will generally be determined on a units of production basis, whereas the accretion to be recognized will escalate over the life of the producing assets, typically as production declines. Because of the long lives of the underlying producing assets, the impact on net income in the near term is not expected to be material. Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2003 compared with Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2002 (All dollar amounts in charts reported in millions) Net Income Net income changed primarily due to the following items: 2003 Period 2002 Period Dollar Variance Percentage Change Coal Sales Produced and Purchased $ 1,758 $ 1,777 $ (19 ) (1.1 )% Gas Sales 208 147 61 41.5 % Other Sales and Other Income 256 260 (4 ) (1.5 )% Total Revenue 2,222 2,184 38 1.7 % Coal Cost of Goods Sold Produced and Purchased 1,310 1,277 33 2.6 % Gas Cost of Goods Sold 84 65 19 29.2 % Other Cost of Goods Sold 230 201 29 14.4 % Total Cost of Goods Sold 1,624 1,543 81 5.2 % Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization 242 263 (21 ) (8.0 )% Interest Expense 34 46 (12 ) (26.1 )% Other 356 372 (16 ) (4.3 )% Total Costs 2,256 2,224 32 1.4 % Earnings (Loss) before Income Taxes (34 ) (40 ) 6 15.0 % Income Taxes 21 52 (31 ) (59.6 )% Earnings (Loss) Before Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle (13 ) 12 (25 ) (208.3 )% Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle 5 5 100.0 % Net Income (Loss) $ (8 ) $ 12 $ (20 ) (166.7 )% Net income (loss) for 2003 was lower than the 2002 period primarily due to increased cost of goods sold and lower income tax benefits, offset, in part, by higher revenues and lower depreciation, depletion and amortization. The increase in cost of goods sold was mainly attributable to higher retiree medical costs and salaried pension expenses, increased gas volumes and royalty costs related to gas sales, and costs related to mine fires at the Loveridge Mine and Mine 84. Tax benefits were lower in 2003 primarily due to the tax effect of the current years sale of CONSOL Energys Canadian assets. The higher sales revenues are primarily attributable to the increased gas volumes sold in 2003 compared to the 2002 period. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense declined primarily as a result of the equipment at the Dilworth mine and the related preparation plant becoming fully depreciated prior to 2003, coinciding with the closure of the mine due to economically depleted reserves. 53 Table of Contents Revenue 2003Period 2002Period DollarVariance PercentageChange Sales Produced Coal $ 1,683 $ 1,693 $ (10 ) Produced Coal Related Party 1 1 Total Produced Coal 1,684 1,694 (10 ) (0.6 )% Purchased Coal 74 83 (9 ) (10.8 )% Gas 208 147 61 41.5 % Industrial Supplies 63 64 (1 ) (1.6 )% Other 14 15 (1 ) (6.7 )% Total Sales 2,043 2,003 40 2.0 % Freight Revenue 114 134 (20 ) Freight Revenue Related Party 1 1 Total Freight Revenue 115 135 (20 ) (14.8 )% Other Income 64 46 18 39.1 % Total Revenue and Other Income $ 2,222 $ 2,184 $ 38 1.7 % The decrease in Company produced coal sales revenue was due mainly to the reduction in volumes sold during 2003 substantially offset by increased average sales price per ton. 2003 Period 2002 Period Variance Percentage Change Produced Tons Sold (in millions) 60.9 63.2 (2.3 ) (3.6 )% Average Sales Price Per Ton $ 27.67 $ 26.80 $ 0.87 3.2 % The decrease in tons sold is related to the closure of the Dilworth, Humphrey and Windsor mines, where economically mineable reserves were depleted in the last quarter of 2002. The decrease in tons sold was also attributable to the sale of the assets at the Cardinal River Mine in February 2003 and the idling of the Rend Lake mine in 2002 due to market conditions. Expected coal production in the fourth quarter of 2003 was also impacted by unfavorable mining conditions at Enlow Fork Mine, Mill Creek Mine and Mine 84, a roof fall along the west beltline at the Bailey Mine, equipment problems at VP #8 and Jones Fork Mines and flooding along the Ohio River. These decreases in tonnage were offset, in part, by increased sales of company produced coal primarily at the McElroy Mine and, to a lesser extent, at several other mines. The increased tonnage at the McElroy Mine is attributable to the mine running for the full 2003 year compared to being idled for two months of the 2002 year. The McElroy Mine increase is also attributable to the preparation plant expansion that was completed in the last quarter of 2002. The reductions in company produced coal sales revenue were substantially offset by the increase in average sales price per ton sold. The increase in average sales price primarily reflects higher prices negotiated in the second half of 2002. The decrease in Company purchased coal sales revenue was due mainly to a decrease in average sales price per ton of purchased coal. 2003 Period 2002 Period Variance Percentage Change Purchased Tons Sold (in millions) 2.4 2.5 (0.1 ) (4.0 )% Average Sales Price Per Ton $ 31.16 $ 33.49 $ (2.33 ) (7.0 )% The reduced average sales price is primarily due to sales of purchased coal in 2003 at prices under commitments made during periods of lower prices as compared to 2002 sales of coal purchased under commitments made during a period of higher prices. The reduced sales price is also due to CONSOL Energy purchasing and selling a lower quality coal in 2003 compared to the 2002 period. 54 Table of Contents The increase in gas sales revenue was primarily due to a higher average sales price per thousand cubic feet and increased volumes sold in 2003 compared to the 2002 period. 2003 Period 2002 Period Variance Percentage Change Gas Sales Volumes (in billion gross cubic feet) 50.0 46.4 3.6 7.8 % Average Sales Price Per thousand cubic feet (including effects of derivative transactions) $ 4.16 $ 3.17 $ 0.99 31.2 % The 2003 gas market price increases were largely driven by the overall supply/demand imbalance that depleted United States storage levels by the end of March 2003 and the subsequent need to refill that storage prior to the start of the next winter heating season. CONSOL Energy enters into various physical gas supply transactions with our gas marketers, selling gas under short term multi month contract nominations generally not exceeding one year. CONSOL Energy has also entered into eight float for fixed gas swap transactions and two float for collar gas swap transactions that qualify as financial cash flow hedges, which exist parallel to the underlying physical transactions. In 2003, these cash flow hedges represented 11% of our total 2003 produced sales volumes at an average price of $4.10 per thousand cubic feet. These cash flow hedges are expected to represent 24% of our estimated 2004 produced sales volumes at an average price of $5.17 per thousand cubic feet. CONSOL Energy sold 90% of its gas sales volumes in 2003 at an average price of $3.99 per thousand cubic feet compared to 77% of its gas sales volumes in the 2002 period at $3.16 per thousand cubic feet under contracts agreed to in prior periods. Higher sales volumes were a result of wells coming on line from the ongoing drilling program, which allowed CONSOL Energy to take advantage of increased demand. The decrease in revenues from the sale of industrial supplies was due to reduced sales volumes. Freight revenue, outside and related party, is based on weight of coal shipped, negotiated freight rates and method of transportation (i.e., rail, barge, truck, etc.) used for the customers to which CONSOL Energy contractually provides transportation services. Freight revenue is the amount billed to customers for transportation costs incurred. Other income consists of interest income, gain or loss on the disposition of assets, equity in earnings of affiliates, service income, royalty income, derivative gains and losses, rental income and miscellaneous income. 2003 Period 2002 Period Dollar Variance Percentage Change Gain on sale of assets $ 23 $ 13 $ 10 76.9 % Royalty income 16 12 4 33.3 % Equity in loss of affiliates (9 ) (10 ) 1 10.0 % Foreign currency derivative 5 5 100.0 % Harbor maintenance fee refund 3 3 100.0 % Contract settlement 7 (7 ) (100.0 )% Other miscellaneous 26 24 2 8.3 % Total other revenue $ 64 $ 46 $ 18 39.1 % The increase in gain on sale of assets primarily was related to the expiration in 2003 of an option granted to a third party to purchase property for which CONSOL Energy received nonrefundable proceeds of $5 million and gains from the sale of surplus equipment. Royalty income increased due primarily to third parties producing more tonnage from CONSOL owned property in the period to period comparison. The decrease in equity losses of affiliates is due mainly to the absence of $4 million in losses incurred in 2002 attributable to a coal equity affiliate, Line Creek Mine, that was sold in February 2003. The decrease is also 55 Table of Contents attributable to an equity affiliates sale of property in 2003 that resulted in a gain of which our portion was approximately $2 million. These changes were offset, in part by $5 million of additional losses in 2003 due to a coal equity affiliates, Glennies Creek Mine, coal recovery rate being lower due to a rock intrusion in the coal seam. Foreign currency derivative gains are related to the foreign currency hedge contracts entered into on July 10, 2002 to permit CONSOL Energy Australia Pty (CEA) to purchase Australian dollars at a fixed exchange rate. CEA entered into these hedges in order to minimize exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. CONSOL Energy sold its 50% interest in the Glennies Creek Mine as of February 25, 2004. As part of the transaction, the purchaser will assume CEAs debt related to Glennies Creek Mine and the associated hedging arrangements. Other income also includes a $3 million refund received from the federal government for harbor maintenance fees imposed by federal statute that was declared unconstitutional. We have pursued claims for these fees since 1991, and we do not expect other refunds related to these claims. The increases in other income were partially offset in 2003 compared to the 2002 period due to $7 million of income related to a contract settlement which occurred in the 2002 period. An additional $2 million increase in other income was due to various transactions that occurred throughout both periods, none of which were individually material. Costs 2003 Period 2002 Period Dollar Variance Percentage Change Cost of Goods Sold and Other Charges Produced Coal $ 1,238 $ 1,197 $ 41 3.4 % Purchased Coal 72 80 (8 ) (10.0 )% Gas 84 65 19 29.2 % Industrial Supplies 66 70 (4 ) (5.7 )% Closed and Idle Mines 62 79 (17 ) (21.5 )% Other 102 52 50 96.2 % Total Cost of Goods Sold $ 1,624 $ 1,543 $ 81 5.2 % Increased cost of goods sold and other charges for company produced coal was due mainly to the increased cost per unit of produced coal sold, offset, in part, by reduced sales tons. 2003 Period 2002 Period Variance Percentage Change Produced Tons Sold (in millions) 60.9 63.2 (2.3 ) (3.6 )% Average Cost of Goods Sold and Other Charges Per Ton $ 20.34 $ 18.94 $ 1.40 7.4 % Average cost of goods sold and other charges per ton for produced coal increased due mainly to increased medical expenses for retired employees and increased salaried pension expenses. Retiree medical and salaried pension expenses are actuarially determined based on several assumptions as discussed in Critical Accounting Policies and in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2004. Cost per ton for produced coal also increased due to higher supply cost per unit. These increases in costs were offset, in part, by reduced company produced sales volumes. Purchased coal cost of goods sold and other charges decreased due primarily to a reduction in the average cost per ton and reduced volumes of purchased coal sold. 2003 Period 2002 Period Variance Percentage Change Purchased Tons Sold (in millions) 2.4 2.5 (0.1 ) (4.0 )% Average Cost of Goods Sold and Other Charges Per Ton $ 30.31 $ 32.15 $ (1.84 ) (5.7 )% 56 Table of Contents The reduced average cost of purchased coal is primarily due to purchasing coal in 2003 under commitments made during the prior year when prices were lower. The lower average cost of purchased coal is also attributable to CONSOL Energy purchasing and reselling a lower quality coal in 2003 compared to the 2002 period. Gas cost of goods sold and other charges increased due to increased average cost per thousand cubic feet sold and increased volumes. 2003 Period 2002 Period Variance Percentage Change Gas Sales Volumes (in billion gross cubic feet) 50.0 46.4 3.6 7.8 % Average Cost Per thousand cubic feet $ 1.69 $ 1.40 $ 0.29 20.7 % The increase in average cost per thousand cubic feet of gas sold was attributable to a $0.21 increase per thousand cubic feet in royalty expense. Royalty expense increased primarily due to the 31.2% increase in average sales price per thousand cubic feet in 2003 compared to the 2002 period. The increase is also due to additional employees, additional contractor maintenance cost and additional power charges attributable to the increased number of wells in production in the period to period comparison. Gas cost of goods sold and other charges also increased due to the increased volumes sold in 2003 as discussed previously. We currently plan to drill approximately 300 wells in the twelve month period ending December 31, 2004. Variable costs on a per unit basis are not anticipated to increase as a result of the 2004 drilling program, although, due to the uncertainty of costs such as maintenance, contract labor, and corporate overhead, the incremental impact of the drilling program on per unit costs for 2004 cannot be reasonably predicted. Industrial supplies cost of goods sold decreased due to reduced sales volumes. Closed and idle mine cost decreased primarily due to approximately $28 million of expense related to mines that were idled for all or part of the 2002 period that were operating in 2003, or that were closed in the 2002 period. These mines include idled Loveridge, Shoemaker, McElroy, and Humphrey which was closed. Closed and idle mine cost also decreased approximately $2 million due to the reduction of workforce at Rend Lake mine in 2003 related to the mine being placed on long term idle status pending market conditions. These costs also decreased approximately $2 million due to differences in the 2003 engineering survey adjustments related to mine closing and reclamation compared to the 2002 engineering survey adjustments. The additional $2 million decrease in closed and idle mine cost was due to various miscellaneous transactions which occurred throughout both periods, none of which were individually material. The decreases in closed and idle mine cost were offset, in part, by approximately $17 million of additional mine closing and reclamation expenses related to changes in the method of accounting for these liabilities. In January 2003, CONSOL Energy adopted the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations. Under this statement, the interest accretion related to the discounted portions of mine closing, reclamation and gas well closing liabilities, previously reported as interest expense, are now reported as operating expenses. Under the previous method of accounting for mine closing, reclamation and gas well closing obligations, the estimated obligations for closed mines were fully accrued and adjusted annually as the estimates were updated by engineers. Miscellaneous cost of goods sold and other charges increased due to the following items: 2003 Period 2002 Period Dollar Variance Percentage Change Loveridge fire $ 17 $ $ 17 100.0 % Mine Eighty Four fire 5 5 100.0 % Litigation settlements and contingencies 18 11 7 63.6 % Cardinal River severance and pension cost 2 2 100.0 % Supply inventory write downs 5 5 100.0 % Miscellaneous transactions 55 41 14 34.1 % $ 102 $ 52 $ 50 96.2 % 57 Table of Contents In February 2003, Loveridge Mine experienced a fire near the bottom of the slope entry that is used to carry coal from the mine to the surface. The costs of extinguishing the fire are estimated to be approximately $17 million attributable to cost of goods sold and other charges and other related expenses are estimated to be approximately $3 million, net of expected insurance recovery applicable to both the cost of goods sold and other expenses. In late December 2002, the mine had begun the process of developing a new underground area that would be mined with longwall mining equipment that was expected to be installed later in 2003. The fire has delayed this installation until March 2004. In January 2003, Eighty Four Mine experienced a fire along several hundred feet of the conveyor belt entry servicing the longwall section of the mine. The fire was extinguished approximately two weeks later. On January 20, 2003, the mine resumed production on a limited basis with continuous mining machines, while repairs continued on the belt entry. The fire caused damage to the roof support system, the conveyor belt and the steel framework on which the belt travels. Repairs took several weeks to complete and are estimated to cost approximately $5 million attributable to cost of goods sold and other related charges and $2 million attributable to other expenses, net of expected insurance recovery applicable to both the cost of goods sold and to other expenses. Longwall coal production, which accounts for the majority of coal normally produced at the mine resumed on February 10, 2003. Litigation settlements and contingencies increased over the prior year due to various contingent loss accruals related to various individual contingencies, waste management accruals and asbestos claims in both periods, none of which are individually material. CONSOL Energy owned a 50% interest in Cardinal River until February 2003, when it and related assets were sold. Cardinal River mine severance and pension accruals are attributable to the costs for which CONSOL Energy remains responsible following the sale of the mines assets. Supply inventory write downs reflect adjustments made to supply inventories that are unique to the equipment used at locations where the mining activities have ceased, such as the Dilworth and Rend Lake mines. Cost of goods sold and other charges also increased due to various miscellaneous transactions which occurred throughout both periods, none of which are individually material. Freight expense is based on weight of coal shipped, negotiated freight rates and method of transportation (i.e., rail, barge, truck, etc.) used for the customers to whom CONSOL Energy contractually provides transportation. Freight expense is billed to customers and the revenue from such billing equals the transportation expense. 2003 Period 2002 Period Dollar Variance Percentage Change Freight expense $ 115 $ 134 $ (19 ) (14.2 )% Selling, general and administrative costs have increased due to the following items: 2003 Period 2002 Period Dollar Variance Percentage Change Wages and salaries $ 29 $ 27 $ 2 7.4 % Other post employment and pension costs 11 6 5 83.3 % Professional consulting and other purchased services 15 11 4 36.4 % Other 23 22 1 4.5 % Total Selling, General and Administrative $ 78 $ 66 $ 12 18.2 % Wages and salaries for selling, general and administrative employees have increased primarily due to merit increases, promotions and new hires throughout 2003. In December 2003, CONSOL Energy implemented a reduction in workforce program primarily focused on reducing the number of positions in the selling, general and 58 Table of Contents administrative areas to better align with its current business strategy. This program is expected to reduce approximately 100 positions and approximately $10 million of wages, salaries and benefits in the administrative functions in 2004. Other post employment and pension costs have increased due mainly to increased medical expenses for retired employees and changes in actuarial assumptions used for pension. Retiree medical and salaried pension expenses are actuarially determined based on several assumptions as discussed in Critical Accounting Policies and in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2004. Costs of professional consulting and other purchased services have increased in 2003 primarily due to services provided in relation to a special investigation into matters alleged in an anonymous letter and transactions in connection with the reduction by RWE Rheinbraun, the former controlling stockholder, of its percentage ownership in CONSOL Energy. Other selling, general and administrative costs increased primarily due to director and officer insurance costs incurred in 2003. CONSOL Energy officers and directors were previously insured under the RWE AG general liability policy. Depreciation, depletion and amortization has decreased due to the following items: 2003 Period 2002 Period Dollar Variance Percentage Change Coal $ 196 $ 218 $ (22 ) (10.1 )% Gas 33 34 (1 ) (2.9 )% Other 13 11 2 18.2 % Total depreciation, depletion and amortization $ 242 $ 263 $ (21 ) (8.0 )% The decrease in coal depreciation, depletion and amortization was primarily attributable to the equipment at the Dilworth mine and the related preparation plant becoming fully depreciated prior to 2003 to coincide with the closure of the mine due to economically depleted reserves and other mine equipment becoming fully depreciated in 2003. The decrease also relates to lower units of production financial depletion due to lower production volumes in 2003 compared to the 2002 period. Decreases in coal depreciation, depletion and amortization were offset, in part, by a $4 million increase due to the depreciation of the assets recorded in relation to the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations (SFAS No. 143). SFAS No. 143 requires depreciation of the capitalized asset retirement cost. The depreciation of these assets is generally determined on a units of production basis over the life of the producing asset. The decrease in gas depreciation, depletion and amortization was primarily due to a higher ratio of gas production coming from mine gob areas which have lives generally less than twelve months long. As a result the costs to produce these areas are expensed instead of capitalized and then amortized. This gob gas production is not included in the calculation of units of production depreciation or depletion for capitalized gas costs. The reduction in gas depreciation, depletion and amortization was offset, in part, by additional depreciation attributable to new assets placed in service during 2003 and additional depletion and depreciation related to the increased volumes from other than gob wells produced during 2003. The reductions were also offset, in part, by a $1 million increase due to the depreciation of the assets recorded in relation to the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations (SFAS No. 143). SFAS No. 143 requires depreciation of the capitalized asset retirement cost. The depreciation of these assets is generally determined on a units of production basis over the life of the producing asset. The increase in other depreciation, depletion and amortization was primarily due to additional depreciation on the integrated information technology system installed to support business processes. The system was implemented in stages beginning in January 2001 and was substantially completed in August 2003. 59 Table of Contents Interest expense has decreased primarily due to the following items: 2003 Period 2002 Period Dollar Variance Percentage Change Mine closing, reclamation and gas well closing liabilities $ $ 9 $ (9 ) (100.0 )% Commercial paper 1 6 (5 ) (83.3 )% Other 33 31 2 6.5 % Total Interest Expense $ 34 $ 46 $ (12 ) (26.1 )% Interest accretion on the discounted portions of mine closing, reclamation and gas well closing liabilities changed due to the implementation of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations. Under this statement, the interest accretion related to the discounted portions of mine closing, reclamation and gas well closing liabilities, previously reported as interest expense, are now reported as operating expense. Interest expense on commercial paper decreased primarily due to a $205 million reduction in the weighted average principal amount of commercial paper outstanding and a 1.0% per annum reduction in the weighted average interest rate on amounts outstanding in 2003. As of July 2003, CONSOL Energy was no longer able to participate as a seller of commercial paper due to Standard and Poors lowering its rating of our short term debt to B. Subsequently, CONSOL Energys debt ratings have been lowered by Standard and Poors and Moodys. See discussion in General Management Discussion and Analysis on this Form 10 K. Other interest expense increased due primarily to a $4 million increase in interest expense related to the $250 million principal amount of 7.875% Notes due in 2012, which were issued in March 2002 and therefore were not outstanding for the entire 2002 period. This increase was offset, in part, by a $2 million reduction in interest expense due to the reduction of long term debt through scheduled debt repayments. Taxes other than income decreased primarily due to the following items: 2003 Period 2002 Period Dollar Variance Percentage Change Payroll taxes $ 32 $ 35 $ (3 ) (8.6 )% Property and other taxes 23 28 (5 ) (17.9 )% Capital stock and franchise tax 1 6 (5 ) (83.3 )% Production taxes 104 103 1 1.0 % Total Taxes Other Than Income $ 160 $ 172 $ (12 ) (7.0 )% Payroll taxes have decreased primarily due to the closure or idling of several mines in the period to period comparison. Dilworth, Rend Lake and Humphrey mines were not operating in 2003 and, therefore, the average number of employees was lower in 2003 compared to the 2002 period. Decreased property and other taxes are attributable to the adjustment of prior year estimated accruals to the actual amounts paid in 2003. Capital stock and franchise tax has been reduced in 2003 due to the impacts of merging several CONSOL Energy companies over the past several years. Increased production taxes are primarily due to higher severance taxes attributable to higher gas production volumes and associated sales price in 2003 compared to the 2002 period. This increase was offset, in part, by decreased black lung excise taxes related to the lower coal production volumes. 60 Table of Contents Restructuring Costs Restructuring costs of approximately $4 million in 2003 primarily represent the severance dollars paid related to the December 2003 reduction in workforce program implemented by CONSOL Energy. The program was primarily focused on reducing the number of positions in the selling, general and administrative areas and is expected to reduce approximately 100 positions and approximately $10 million of wages, salaries and benefits in the administrative functions in 2004. Also included in the restructuring costs are severance amounts paid throughout 2003 for positions that have been eliminated by CONSOL Energy management in an effort to reduce costs and realign its selling, general and administrative functions with todays company strategies. Export Sales Excise Tax Resolution CONSOL Energy is no longer required to pay certain excise taxes on export sales. We have received refunds and related interest in 2003 for our claims for the years 1994 to 1999. Upon receipt of these refunds, we have adjusted our estimate of interest receivable to the amounts received. This adjustment resulted in additional income of $1 million in 2003. A receivable for the claims for the years 1991 to 1993 is still outstanding. There is no interest receivable related to these claims. Income Taxes 2003 Period 2002 Period Variance Percentage Change Earnings (Loss) Before Income Taxes $ (34 ) $ (40 ) $ 6 15.0 % Tax Expense (Benefit) (21 ) (52 ) 31 59.6 % Effective Income Tax Rate 62.4 % 128.9 % (66.5 )% CONSOL Energys effective tax rate is sensitive to changes in annual profitability and percentage depletion. The 2003 effective tax rate changed from the 2002 effective rate primarily due to the tax effect of the current years sale of CONSOL Energys Canadian assets. Another significant cause of the change was due to provision to return adjustments recorded in 2002. See note 9 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10 K for additional information. Cumulative Effect of Changes in Accounting for Mine Closing, Reclamation and Gas Well Closing Costs Effective January 1, 2003, CONSOL Energy adopted SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, as required. CONSOL Energy reflected a gain of approximately $5 million, net of a tax cost of approximately $3 million. At the time of adoption, total assets, net of accumulated depreciation, increased approximately $59 million and total liabilities increased approximately $51 million. The amounts recorded upon adoption are dependent upon a number of variables, including the estimated future retirement costs, estimated proven reserves, assumptions involving profit margins, inflation rates and the assumed credit adjusted risk free interest rate. Previous accounting standards generally used the units of production method to match estimated retirement costs with the revenues generated by the producing assets. In contrast, SFAS No. 143 requires depreciation of the capitalized asset retirement cost and accretion of the asset retirement obligation over time. The depreciation will generally be determined on a units of production basis, whereas the accretion to be recognized will escalate over the life of the producing assets, typically as production declines. Because of the long lives of the underlying producing assets, the impact on net income in the near term is not expected to be material. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts 61 Table of Contents of assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period. Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10 K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates upon subsequent resolution of identified matters. Management believes that the estimates utilized are reasonable. The following critical accounting policies are materially impacted by judgments, assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Other Post Employment Benefits CONSOL Energy has historically provided retiree health benefits to employees that retire with at least ten years of service and have attained age 55. Effective August 1, 2003, the eligibility requirement for salaried employees was changed to either twenty years of service and age 55, or fifteen years of service and age 62. Additionally, any salaried or non represented hourly employees that are hired or rehired effective August 1, 2004 or later will not become eligible for retiree health benefits. In lieu of traditional retiree health coverage, if certain eligibility requirements are met, these employees may be eligible to receive a retiree Medical Spending Allowance of $1,000 per year of service at retirement. At December 31, 2004, a retiree health plan provided benefits to approximately 25,000 of our former employees and their eligible dependents. Eligibility requirements for hourly employees have not changed from CONSOL Energys historical requirements. In addition to the change in eligibility requirements, other changes have been made to the medical plan which covers eligible salaried employees and retirees. These changes include a new cost sharing structure where essentially all participants contribute 20% of plan costs. Annual cost increases in excess of 6% are paid entirely by the Plan participants. After our review, various actuarial assumptions, including discount rate, expected trend in health care costs and per capita costs, are used by our independent actuary to estimate the cost and benefit obligations for our retiree health plans. The discount rate is determined each year at the measurement date (currently September 30). The discount rate is an estimate of the current interest rate at which the Other Post Employment Benefit liabilities could be effectively settled at the measurement date. In estimating this rate, CONSOL Energy looks to rates of return on high quality, fixed income investments that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized ratings agency. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, the discount rate used to calculate the period end liability and the following years expense was 6.0%. A 0.25% increase in the discount rate would have decreased 2004 net periodic postretirement benefit costs by approximately $4.2 million. A 0.25% decrease in the discount rate would have increased 2004 net periodic postretirement benefit costs by approximately $4.1 million. Changes to interest rates for the rates of returns on instruments that could be used to settle the actuarially determined plan obligations introduce substantial volatility to our costs. Per capita costs on a per annum basis for Other Post Retirement Benefits were assumed to be $5,220 at December 31, 2004. This was approximately a 10% increase over the per capita cost on a per annum basis at December 31, 2003. If the actual increase in per capita cost of medical services or other post retirement benefits are significantly greater or less than the projected trend rates, the per capita cost assumption would need to be adjusted annually, which could have a significant effect on the costs and liabilities recognized in the financial statements. The estimated liability recognized in the financial statements at December 31, 2004 was $1.7 billion compared to $1.6 billion at December 31, 2003. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, we paid approximately $126 million for Other Post Employment Benefits, most of which were paid from operating cash flow. Significant increases in health and prescription drug costs for hourly retirees could have a material adverse effect on CONSOL Energys operating cash flow. The effect on CONSOL Energys cash flow from operations for salaried employees has been limited to approximately 6% of the previous years medical cost for salaried employees due to the cost sharing provision added to the benefit plan in 2003. 62 Table of Contents On December 8, 2003, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the Act) was signed into law. The Act introduces a prescription drug benefit under Medicare (Medicare Part D) as well as a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D. CONSOL Energy, as a sponsor of a retiree health care benefit plan that provides a prescription drug benefit actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D, has recognized the effects of the Act in the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Staff Position No. FAS 106 2, Accounting and Disclosure Requirements related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003. Implementation of the Act resulted in a reduction of our postretirement benefit costs of $21 million in the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, and a reduction of $182 million to our December 31, 2004 estimated other postretirement benefit obligation. Coal Workers Pneumoconiosis CONSOL Energy is responsible under the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969, as amended, for medical and disability benefits to employees and their dependents resulting from occurrences of coal workers pneumoconiosis disease. CONSOL Energy is also responsible under various state statutes for pneumoconiosis benefits. After our review, our independent actuaries calculate the actuarial present value of the estimated pneumoconiosis obligation based on assumptions regarding disability incidence, medical costs, mortality, death benefits, dependents and discount rates. The discount rate is determined each year at the measurement date (currently September 30). The discount rate is an estimate of the current interest rate at which the Coal Workers Pneumoconiosis liabilities could be effectively settled at the measurement date. In estimating this rate, CONSOL Energy looks to rates of return on high quality, fixed income investments that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized ratings agency. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, the discount rate used to calculate the period end liability and the following years expense was 6.0%. In January 2001, the United States Department of Labor amended the regulations implementing the federal black lung laws to give greater weight to the opinion of a claimants treating physician, expand the definition of black lung disease and limit the amount of medical evidence that can be submitted by claimants and respondents. The amendments also alter administrative procedures for the adjudication of claims, which according to the Department of Labor, results in streamlined procedures that are less formal, less adversarial and easier for participants to understand. These and other changes to the federal black lung regulations could result in changes in assumptions used in our actuarial determination of the liability, including interest, disability and mortality assumptions. These changes could significantly increase our exposure to black lung benefit liabilities. The estimated liability recognized in the financial statements at December 31, 2004 was approximately $441 million compared to $456 million at December 31, 2003. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, we paid Coal Workers Pneumoconiosis benefits of approximately $12 million. Our obligations with respect to these liabilities are unfunded at December 31, 2004. Salaried Pensions CONSOL Energy has non contributory defined benefit retirement plans covering substantially all employees not covered by multi employer retirement plans. The benefits for these plans are based primarily on years of service and employees compensation near retirement. Additionally, any salaried or non represented hourly employees that are hired or rehired effective August 1, 2004 or later will not become eligible to participate in the defined benefit pension plan. Our independent actuaries calculate the actuarial present value of the estimated retirement obligation based on assumptions including rates of compensation, mortality rates, retirement age and interest rates. For the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, compensation increases are assumed to range from 3% to 6% depending on age classification. Retirement rate assumptions and mortality assumptions were unchanged for the year ended December 31, 2004. Retirement rate assumptions begin at 5% for employees at age 50 and increases gradually to 100% for employees at age 65. The discount rate is determined each year at the measurement date (currently September 30). The discount rate is an estimate of the current interest rate at which the retirement plans could be effectively settled at the measurement date. In estimating this rate, CONSOL Energy looks to rates of return on high quality, fixed income investments that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized ratings agency. For the twelve months ended 63 Table of Contents December 31, 2004 and 2003, the discount rate used to calculate the period end liability and the following years expense was 6.0%. A 0.25% increase in the discount rate would have decreased the 2004 net periodic pension cost by $1.5 million. A 0.25% decrease in the discount rate would have increased the 2004 net periodic pension cost by $1.4 million. Changes to any of these assumptions introduce substantial volatility to our costs. The estimated liability at December 31, 2004 was $117 million compared to $137 million at December 31, 2003. Due to the negative actuarial return on plan assets, the difference in the accumulated benefit obligation and the plan assets at December 31, 2004 of approximately $138 million was recognized as a minimum pension liability. At December 31, 2003, the minimum pension liability was approximately $158 million. CONSOL Energy expects to contribute approximately $66 million to the pension plan in 2005. The CONSOL Energy salaried plan allows for lump sum distributions at the employees election. According to Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 88, Employers Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits, if the lump sum distributions made for the plan year, which is October 1 to September 30, exceed the total of the service cost and interest cost for the plan year, settlement accounting is required. If this were to occur, CONSOL Energy would need to recognize in the current years results of operations, an adjustment equaling the unrecognized actuarial gain or loss resulting from each individual who received a lump sum in that year. Generally, due to the lower interest rates currently being used to calculate lump sum distributions, the impact would be to recognize actuarial losses. If this settlement accounting is triggered, the adjustment could materially impact operating results. Workers Compensation Workers compensation is a system by which individuals who sustain employment related physical injuries or some type of occupational diseases are compensated for their disabilities, medical costs, and on some occasions, for the costs of their rehabilitation. Workers compensation will also compensate the survivors of workers who suffer employment related deaths. The workers compensation laws are administered by state agencies with each state having its own set of rules and regulations regarding compensation that is owed to an employee that is injured in the course of employment. CONSOL Energy changed its method of accounting for workers compensation effective January 1, 2004. Under the new method, it records an actuarially calculated liability, which is determined using various assumptions, including discount rate and future cost trends. The discount rate is determined each year at the measurement date (currently September 30). The discount rate is an estimate of the current interest rate at which the workers compensation liabilities could be effectively settled at the measurement date. In estimating this rate, CONSOL Energy looks to rates of return on high quality, fixed income investments that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized ratings agency. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, the discount rate used to calculate the period end liability and the following years expense was 6%. A 0.25% increase or decrease in the discount rate would not have materially decreased or increased the 2004 workers compensation expense. The estimated liability recognized in the financial statements at December 31, 2004, including the current portion, was approximately $196 million at December 31, 2004. CONSOL Energys policy has been to provide for workers compensation benefits from operating cash flow. No funding has been provided to cover these benefits. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, we made payments for workers compensation benefits of approximately $53 million, all of which was paid from operating cash flow. Reclamation and Mine Closure Obligations The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act establishes operational, reclamation and closure standards for all aspects of surface mining as well as most aspects of deep mining. CONSOL Energy accrues for the costs of current mine disturbance and final mine closure, including the cost of treating mine water discharge where necessary. Estimates of our total reclamation and mine closing liabilities, which are based upon permit requirements and CONSOL Energy engineering expertise related to these requirements, including the current portion, were approximately $365 million at December 31, 2004. This liability is reviewed annually by CONSOL Energy management and engineers. The estimated liability can significantly change if actual costs vary from assumptions or if governmental regulations change significantly. 64 Table of Contents Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations (SFAS No. 143) requires that the fair value of an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The present value of the estimated asset retirement costs is capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset. Asset retirement obligations primarily relate to the closure of mines and gas wells and the reclamation of land upon exhaustion of coal and gas reserves. Changes in the variables used to calculate the liabilities can have a significant effect on the mine closing, reclamation and gas well closing liabilities. The amounts of assets and liabilities recorded are dependent upon a number of variables, including the estimated future retirement costs, estimated proven reserves, assumptions involving profit margins, inflation rates, and the assumed credit adjusted risk free interest rate. SFAS No. 143 requires depreciation of the capitalized asset retirement cost and accretion of the asset retirement obligation over time. The depreciation will generally be determined on a units of production basis, whereas the accretion to be recognized will escalate over the life of the producing assets, typically as production declines. Contingencies CONSOL Energy is currently involved in certain legal proceedings. We have accrued our estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of these claims. This estimate has been developed in consultation with legal counsel involved in the defense of these matters and is based upon an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies. We do not believe these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position. It is possible, however, that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings. Deferred Taxes CONSOL Energy accounts for income taxes in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS No. 109) which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax basis of recorded assets and liabilities. SFAS No. 109 also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. At December 31, 2004, CONSOL Energy has deferred tax assets in excess of deferred tax liabilities of approximately $500 million. The deferred tax assets are evaluated periodically to determine if a valuation allowance is necessary. A deferred tax asset of $66 million relating to state net operating loss carry forwards has been fully reserved due to the uncertainty of realizing the benefits of these carry forwards. However, CONSOL Energy is currently exploring several tax planning strategies that may allow a portion of the loss carry forwards to be recognized. No other valuation allowance has been recognized because CONSOL Energy has determined that it is more likely than not that all of these deferred tax assets will be realized. According to SFAS No. 109, a deferred tax asset should be reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. All available evidence, both positive and negative, must be considered to determine whether a valuation allowance is warranted. For the year ended December 31, 2004 positive evidence considered included the level of sales and pricing currently being negotiated under fixed price contracts, the reversal of certain book to tax differences, particularly those related to minimum tax, and the ability to employ various tax planning strategies if necessary. Negative evidence included book and tax losses generated in recent periods and the inability to achieve forecasted results in those recent periods. CONSOL Energy has concluded that the deferred tax assets, other than those associated with the state tax net operating losses, were more likely than not realizable. By its estimation, CONSOL Energy will begin paying regular tax and utilizing its deferred tax asset associated with the minimum tax within five years. Our judgment regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions, our ability to successfully execute our business strategy, as well as other factors. These changes, if any, may require additional valuation allowances to be recorded that could materially impact net income. 65 Table of Contents Coal and Gas Reserve Values There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities and values of economically recoverable coal and gas reserves, including many factors beyond our control. As a result, estimates of economically recoverable coal and gas reserves are by their nature uncertain. Information about our reserves consists of estimates based on engineering, economic and geological data assembled and analyzed by our staff. The majority of our gas reserves have been reviewed by independent experts. None of our coal reserves have been reviewed by independent experts. Some of the factors and assumptions which impact economically recoverable reserve estimates include: geological conditions; historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas; the assumed effects of regulations and taxes by governmental agencies; assumptions governing future prices; and future operating costs. Each of these factors may in fact vary considerably from the assumptions used in estimating reserves. For these reasons, estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of coal and gas attributable to a particular group of properties, and classifications of these reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of future net cash flows, may vary substantially. Actual production, revenues and expenditures with respect to our reserves will likely vary from estimates, and these variances may be material. Certain Trends and Uncertainties In addition to the trends and uncertainties described in Item I of this Annual Report on Form 10 K under Coal Operations Competition, Gas Operations Competition and Regulations and in Critical Accounting Policies and elsewhere in this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation, CONSOL Energy is subject to the trends and uncertainties set forth below. Disruption of rail, barge and other systems that deliver CONSOL Energys coal, or of pipeline systems that deliver CONSOL Energys gas, or an increase in transportation costs for either product could make CONSOL Energys coal or gas less competitive. Coal producers depend upon rail, barge, trucking, overland conveyor and other systems to provide access to markets. Disruption of transportation services because of weather related problems, strikes, lock outs or other events could temporarily impair our ability to supply coal to customers and adversely affect its profitability. Transportation costs represent a significant portion of the delivered cost of coal and, as a result, the cost of delivery is a critical factor in a customers purchasing decision. Increases in transportation costs could make our coal less competitive. The marketability of CONSOL Energys gas production partly depends on the availability, proximity and capacity of pipeline systems owned by third parties. Changes in access to pipelines or increased costs of procuring transportation on pipeline systems could adversely affect our operations. We require a skilled workforce to run our business. If we cannot hire qualified people to meet replacement or expansion needs, we may not be able to achieve planned results. Most of our workforce is comprised of people with technical skills related to the production of coal and gas. Fifty five percent of our workforce is 50 years of age or older. Based on our experience, we expect a high percentage of our employees to retire between now and the end of the decade. This will require us to conduct an expanded and sustained effort to recruit new employees to replace those who retire and to fill new jobs as we 66 Table of Contents grow our business. Some areas of Appalachia, most notably in eastern Kentucky, currently have a shortage of skilled labor. Because we have operations in this area, the shortage could make it more difficult to meet our manpower needs and therefore, our results may be adversely affected. Coal mining is subject to conditions or events beyond CONSOL Energys control, which could cause its quarterly or annual results to deteriorate. CONSOL Energys coal mining operations are predominantly underground mines. These mines are subject to conditions or events beyond CONSOL Energys control that could disrupt operations, affect production and the cost of mining at particular mines for varying lengths of time and have a significant impact on our operating results. These conditions or events have included: variations in thickness of the layer, or seam, of coal; amounts of rock and other natural materials intruding into the coal seam and other geological conditions that could affect the stability of the roof and the side walls of the mine; equipment failures or repair; fires and other accidents; and weather conditions. CONSOL Energy faces numerous uncertainties in estimating its economically recoverable coal reserves, and inaccuracies in its estimates could result in lower than expected revenues, higher than expected costs and decreased profitability. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities and values of economically recoverable coal reserves, including many factors beyond our control. As a result, estimates of economically recoverable coal reserves are by their nature uncertain. Information about our reserves consists of estimates based on engineering, economic and geological data assembled and analyzed by our staff. None of our coal reserve estimates has been reviewed by independent experts. Some of the factors and assumptions which impact economically recoverable reserve estimates include: geological conditions; historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas; the assumed effects of regulations and taxes by governmental agencies; assumptions governing future prices; and future operating costs, including cost of materials, especially metal products. Each of these factors may in fact vary considerably from the assumptions used in estimating reserves. For these reasons, estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of coal attributable to a particular group of properties, and classifications of these reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of future net cash flows, may vary substantially. Actual production, revenues and expenditures with respect to our reserves will likely vary from estimates, and these variances may be material. As a result, our estimates may not accurately reflect its actual reserves. The exploration for, and production of, gas is an uncertain process with many risks. The exploration for and production of gas involves numerous risks. The cost of drilling, completing and operating wells for coalbed methane or other gas is often uncertain, and a number of factors can delay or prevent drilling operations or production, including: unexpected drilling conditions; shortages or delays in the availability of drilling rigs and the delivery of equipment; 67 Table of Contents pressure or irregularities in formations; equipment failures or repairs; fires or other accidents; adverse weather conditions; water in the coal beds; pipeline ruptures or spills; and inadequate pipeline capacity to transport gas. CONSOL Energys future drilling activities may not be successful, and we cannot be sure that our drilling success rates will not decline. Unsuccessful drilling activities could result in higher costs without any corresponding revenues. Also, CONSOL Energy may not be able to obtain any options or lease rights in potential drilling locations that it identifies which, among other things, could prevent it from producing gas at potential drilling locations. CONSOL Energy must obtain governmental permits and approvals for mining operations, which can be a costly and time consuming process and result in restrictions on its operations. Regulatory authorities exercise considerable discretion in the timing and scope of permit issuance. Requirements imposed by these authorities may be costly and time consuming and may result in delays in the commencement or continuation of exploration or production operations. For example, CONSOL Energy often is required to prepare and present to federal, state and local authorities data pertaining to the effect or impact that proposed exploration for or production of coal may have on the environment. Further, the public may comment on and otherwise engage in the permitting process, including through intervention in the courts. Accordingly, the permits CONSOL Energy needs may not be issued, or if issued, may not be issued in a timely fashion, or may involve requirements which restrict our ability to conduct its mining operations or to do so profitably. Competition within the coal and within the gas industry may adversely affect our ability to sell our products, or a loss of our competitive position because of overcapacity in these industries could adversely affect pricing which could impair our profitability. CONSOL Energy competes with coal producers in various regions of the United States and with some foreign coal producers for domestic sales primarily to power generators. CONSOL Energy also competes with both domestic and foreign coal producers for sales in international markets. Demand for our coal by our principal customers is affected by the delivered price of competing coals, other fuel supplies and alternative generating sources, including nuclear, natural gas, oil and renewable energy sources, such as hydroelectric power. CONSOL Energy sells coal to foreign electricity generators and to the more specialized metallurgical coal market, both of which are significantly affected by international demand and competition. During the mid 1970s and early 1980s, a growing coal market and increased demand for coal attracted new investors to the coal industry, spurred the development of new mines and resulted in added production capacity throughout the industry, all of which led to increased competition and lower coal prices. Recent increases in coal prices could encourage the development of expanded capacity by new or existing coal producers. Any resulting overcapacity could reduce coal prices and therefore reduce our revenues. We compete against many gas producers who are larger and better financed than we are. If demand for gas falls or prices are lower, we may not be able to compete profitably against these larger competitors. In 2002, gas prices were much lower than current prices because mild weather conditions reduced demand and led to oversupply of natural gas. 68 Table of Contents A significant decline in the prices CONSOL Energy receives for its coal and gas could adversely affect its operating results and cash flows. CONSOL Energys results of operations are highly dependent upon the prices it receives for its coal and gas, which are closely linked to consumption patterns of the electric generation industry and certain industrial and residential patterns where gas is the principal fuel. Extended or substantial price declines for coal or gas would adversely affect our operating results for future periods and our ability to generate cash flows necessary to improve productivity and expand operations. For example, in 2002, demand for coal and natural gas decreased because of the warm winters in the northeastern United States. This resulted in increased inventories that caused prices to decrease. CONSOL Energy may not be able to produce sufficient amounts of coal to fulfill its customers requirements, which could harm its customer relationships. CONSOL Energy may not be able to produce sufficient amounts of coal to meet customer demand, including amounts that it is required to deliver under long term contracts. CONSOL Energys inability to satisfy its contractual obligations could result in its customers initiating claims against us. Our inability to satisfy demand could otherwise harm our relationships with our customers. If customers do not extend existing contracts or enter into new long term contracts for coal, the stability and profitability of CONSOL Energys operations could be affected. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, approximately 95% of the coal CONSOL Energy produced was sold under long term contracts (contracts with terms of one year or more). If a substantial portion of CONSOL Energys long term contracts are modified or terminated or if force majeure are exercised, CONSOL Energy would be adversely affected if it is unable to replace the contracts or if new contracts were not at the same level of profitability. The profitability of our long term coal supply contracts depends on a variety of factors, which vary from contract to contract and fluctuate during the contract term, and includes our production costs and other factors. Price changes, if any, provided in long term supply contracts are not intended to reflect our cost increases, and therefore increases in our costs may reduce our profit margins. In addition, in periods of declining market prices, provisions for adjustment or renegotiation of prices and other provisions may increase our exposure to short term coal price volatility. As a result, CONSOL Energy may not be able to obtain long term agreements at favorable prices (compared to either market conditions, as they may change from time to time, or our cost structure) and long term contracts may not contribute to our profitability. The loss of, or significant reduction in, purchases by our largest customers could adversely affect our revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2004, we derived approximately 25% of our total revenues from sales to our three largest customers. At December 31, 2004, we had approximately 20 coal and gas supply agreements with these customers that expire at various times from 2005 to 2022. We are currently discussing the extension of existing agreements or entering into new long term agreements with some of these customers, but these negotiations may not be successful and those customers may not continue to purchase coal and gas from us under long term coal supply agreements. If any one of these three customers were to significantly reduce their purchases of coal from us, or if we were unable to sell coal to them on terms as favorable to us as the terms under our current agreements, our financial condition and results of operations could suffer materially. Our ability to collect payments from our customers could be impaired if their creditworthiness declines. Our ability to receive payment for coal sold and delivered depends on the continued creditworthiness of our customers. Our customer base is changing with deregulation as utilities sell their power plants to their non regulated affiliates or third parties. These new power plant owners may have credit ratings that are below investment grade. In addition, the creditworthiness of certain of our customers and trading counterparties has 69 Table of Contents deteriorated over the last few years due to lower than anticipated demand for energy and volatility in the traded energy markets in 2002. If deterioration of the creditworthiness of electric power generator customers or other trading counterparties continues, our $125 million accounts receivable securitization program and our business could be adversely affected. The characteristics of coal may make it difficult for coal users to comply with various environmental standards, which are continually under review by international, federal and state agencies, related to coal combustion. As a result, they may switch to other fuels, which would affect the volume of CONSOL Energys sales. Coal contains impurities, including sulfur, mercury, chlorine and other elements or compounds, many of which are released into the air when coal is burned. Stricter environmental regulations of emissions from coal fired electric generating plants could increase the costs of using coal thereby reducing demand for coal as a fuel source, the volume of our coal sales and price. Stricter regulations could make coal a less attractive fuel alternative in the planning and building of utility power plants in the future. For example, in order to meet the federal Clean Air Act limits for sulfur dioxide emissions from electric power plants, coal users may need to install scrubbers, use sulfur dioxide emission allowances (some of which they may purchase), blend high sulfur coal with low sulfur coal or switch to other fuels. Each option has limitations. Lower sulfur coal may be more costly to purchase on an energy basis than higher sulfur coal depending on mining and transportation costs. The cost of installing scrubbers is significant and emission allowances may become more expensive as their availability declines. Switching to other fuels may require expensive modification of existing plants. Because higher sulfur coal currently accounts for a significant portion of our sales, the extent to which power generators switch to low sulfur fuel could materially affect us if it cannot offset the cost of sulfur removal by lowering the delivered costs of our higher sulfur coals on an energy equivalent basis. Proposed reductions in emissions of mercury, sulfur dioxides, nitrogen oxides, particulate matter or greenhouse gases may require the installation of additional costly control technology or the implementation of other measures, including trading of emission allowances and switching to other fuels. For example, the Environmental Protection Agency recently proposed separate regulations to establish mercury emission limits nationwide and to reduce the interstate transport of fine particulate matter and ozone through reductions in sulfur dioxides and nitrogen oxides through the eastern United States. The Environmental Protection Agency continues to require reduction of nitrogen oxide emissions in 22 eastern states and the District of Columbia and will require reduction of particulate matter emissions over the next several years for areas that do not meet air quality standards for fine particulates. In addition, Congress and several states are now considering legislation to further control air emissions of multiple pollutants from electric generating facilities and other large emitters. These new and proposed reductions will make it more costly to operate coal fired plants and could make coal a less attractive fuel alternative to the planning and building of utility power plants in the future. To the extent that any new or proposed requirements affect its customers, this could adversely affect its operations and results. Also, numerous proposals have been made at the international, national and state levels that are intended to limit or capture emissions of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide. If comprehensive legislation focusing on greenhouse gas emissions is enacted by the United States or individual sates, it could have the effect of restricting the use of coal. Other efforts to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases also may affect the use of fossil fuels, particularly coal, as an energy source. Government laws, regulations and other legal requirements relating to protection of the environment and health and safety matters increase our costs of doing business for active operations, both coal and gas, and may restrict its operations. We are subject to laws, regulations and other legal requirements enacted or adopted by federal, state and local, as well as foreign authorities relating to protection of the environment and health and safety matters, 70 Table of Contents including those legal requirements that govern discharges of substances into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, the cleanup of contaminated sites, groundwater quality and availability, plant and wildlife protection, reclamation and restoration of mining properties after mining is completed and control of surface subsidence from underground mining. Complying with these requirements, including the terms of our permits, has had, and will continue to have, a significant effect on its costs of operations and competitive position. In addition, we could incur substantial costs, including clean up costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions and third party damage claims for personal injury, property damage, wrongful death, or exposure to hazardous substances, as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental laws. For example, the federal Clean Water Act and corresponding state laws affect coal mining operations by imposing restrictions on discharges into regulated waters or precluding mining that might impact regulated waters. Permits requiring regular monitoring and compliance with effluent limitations and reporting requirements govern the discharge of pollutants into regulated waters. New requirements under the Clean Water Act and corresponding state laws could cause us to incur significant additional costs that adversely affect our operating results or may prevent us from being able to mine portions of our reserves. In addition, CONSOL Energy incurs and will continue to incur significant costs associated with the investigation and remediation of environmental contamination under the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act or the Superfund and similar state statutes and has been named as a potentially responsible party at Superfund sites in the past. CONSOL Energy may need additional financing in order for it to fund its operations, capital expenditures, potential acquisitions and to meet other obligations. Cash generated by operations may not be sufficient to fund our planned capital expenditures, to provide the collateral necessary to meet workers compensation and other post employment benefits performance obligations or to fund potential acquisitions. CONSOL Energy, along with other participants in the coal industry, has been informed by insurance companies that they no longer will provide surety bonds for workers compensation and other post employment benefits without collateral. As a result, CONSOL Energy has satisfied these obligations by providing letters of credit or other assurances of payment. However, the issuance of letters of credit under our bank credit facilities reduces amounts that it can borrow under its bank credit facilities for other purposes, including to fund operations and capital expenditures. For these and other reasons, CONSOL Energy may need additional financing. CONSOL Energy cannot be certain that it will be able to raise additional financing, as required, or that any financing, if available, will be on terms acceptable to us. Debt financing would increase our interest expense, reducing operating results, and could include covenants that are more restrictive than those in its current financings, including limitations on the payment of dividends and on the incurrence of additional debt. The issuance of additional equity could be dilutive to CONSOL Energys existing stockholders. If CONSOL Energy cannot obtain financing, it could reduce capital expenditures, particularly for expansion projects. Such a reduction in spending for these projects, however, could adversely affect future performance. CONSOL Energy reported losses in past periods and CONSOL Energy may incur losses in future periods. CONSOL Energy reported a net loss of $7.8 million in the twelve months ended December 31, 2003. CONSOL Energy reported net income of $199 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004. Although CONSOL Energy reported net income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2002, the six months ended December 31, 2001 and the twelve months ended June 30, 2001, net income was attributable to income tax benefits in the periods ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 and benefited substantially from an export sales excise tax resolution in the twelve months ended June 30, 2001. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 and the six months ended December 31, 2001, CONSOL Energy incurred losses before income tax benefits of $33.5 million, $40.4 million and $19.6 million, respectively. CONSOL Energys results reflect a number of factors in each period. For example, a decrease in tons of coal produced and tons of coal sold as a result of higher than usual customer inventory levels, decreased average sales price for gas in the industrial sector 71 Table of Contents and lower demand for gas during the 2001 2002 winter heating season resulted in high levels of gas storage. During the fourth quarter of 2003, results were adversely affected by production problems at a number of mines. These and other conditions, including conditions beyond our control, could continue to affect our business, and we may incur losses in the future. CONSOL Energy has significant reclamation and mine closure obligations. If the assumptions underlying our accruals are materially inaccurate, we could be required to expend greater amounts than anticipated. The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act establishes operational, reclamation and closure standards for all aspects of surface mining as well as most aspects of deep mining. CONSOL Energy accrues for the costs of current mine disturbance and of final mine closure, including the cost of treating mine water discharge where necessary. Estimates of our total reclamation and mine closing liabilities, which are based upon permit requirements and our experience, were $365 million at December 31, 2004. The amounts recorded are dependent upon a number of variables, including the estimated future retirement costs, estimated proven reserves, assumptions involving profit margins, inflation rates, and the assumed credit adjusted risk free interest rates. Furthermore, these obligations are unfunded. If these accruals are insufficient or our liability in a particular year is greater than currently anticipated, our future operating results could be adversely affected. If CONSOL Energy is unable to comply with restrictions imposed by its senior credit facility a default under these agreements could occur. CONSOL Energys senior credit facility imposes a number of restrictions on it. A failure to comply with these restrictions could adversely affect CONSOL Energys ability to borrow under its senior credit facility or result in an event of default under these agreements and its other debt. The senior credit facility contains financial and other covenants that create limitations on its ability to, among other things, borrow the full amount under its senior credit facility or incur additional debt, and requires CONSOL Energy to maintain various financial ratios and comply with various other financial covenants. These financial covenants include a funded debt ratio that requires that CONSOL Energy maintain a ratio of total indebtedness for borrowed money as of the last day of each quarter to total earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, excluding any extraordinary gains or losses for the four quarters ended on that date of not more than 3.0 to 1.0 and a ratio for the last four consecutive quarters of total earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and excluding any extraordinary gains or losses, to total interest payable (including amortization of debt discount) on indebtedness for borrowed money of not less than 4.5 to 1.0. A covenant also limits capital expenditures to $550 million for each of the fiscal years ending December 31, 2005 and 2006. CONSOL Energys ability to comply with these restrictions depends upon its operating results, and it may be unable to comply with these covenants and other restrictions in its senior credit facility. In the event of a default, CONSOL Energys lenders could terminate their commitments to us and declare all amounts borrowed, together with accrued interest and fees, immediately due and payable. If this were to occur, we might not be able to pay these amounts or we might be forced to seek an amendment to its debt agreements, which could make the terms of these agreements more onerous for us. Failure to comply with these restrictions, even if waived by our bank lenders, also could adversely affect our credit ratings, which could increase the costs of debt financings to us and impair our ability to obtain additional debt financing. CONSOL Energy has significant obligations for long term employee benefits for which it accrues based upon assumptions which, if inaccurate, could result in CONSOL Energy being required to expend greater amounts than anticipated. CONSOL Energy provides various long term employee benefits to inactive and retired employees. We accrue amounts for these obligations. At December 31, 2004, the current and non current portions of these obligations included: post retirement medical and life insurance ($1.7 billion); coal workers black lung benefits($441 million); 72 Table of Contents salaried retirement benefits ($117 million); and workers compensation ($196 million). However, if our assumptions are inaccurate, it could be required to expend greater amounts than anticipated. These obligations are unfunded, except for salaried retirement benefits, of which approximately 56% was funded at December 31, 2004. In addition, several states in which we operate consider changes in workers compensation and black lung laws from time to time. Such changes, if enacted, could increase our benefit expense. If lump sum payments made to retiring salaried employees pursuant to CONSOL Energys defined benefit pension plan exceed the total of the service cost and the interest cost in a plan year, CONSOL Energy would need to make an adjustment to operating results equaling the unrecognized actuarial gain or loss resulting from each individual who received a lump sum payment in that year, which may result in an adjustment that could materially reduce operating results. CONSOL Energys defined benefit pension plan for salaried employees allows such employees to receive a lump sum distribution in lieu of annual payments when they retire from CONSOL Energy. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 88, Employers Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans for the Terminations Benefits, requires that if the lump sum distributions made for a plan year, which for CONSOL Energy is October 1 to September 30, exceed the total of the service cost and interest cost for the plan year, CONSOL Energy would need to recognize for that years results of operations an adjustment equaling the unrecognized actuarial gain or loss resulting from each individual who received a lump sum in that year. If lump sum payments exceed the total of the service cost and the interest cost, the adjustment could materially reduce operating results. Fairmont Supply Company, a subsidiary of CONSOL Energy, is a co defendant in various asbestos litigation cases which could result in making payments in the future that are material. One of CONSOL Energys subsidiaries, Fairmont Supply Company, which distributes industrial supplies, currently is named as a defendant in approximately 25,100 asbestos claims in state courts in Pennsylvania, Ohio, West Virginia, Maryland, New Jersey and Mississippi. Because a very small percentage of products manufactured by third parties and supplied by Fairmont in the past may have contained asbestos and many of the pending claims are part of mass complaints filed by hundreds of plaintiffs against a hundred or more defendants, it has been difficult for Fairmont to determine how many of the cases actually involve valid claims or plaintiffs who were actually exposed to asbestos containing products supplied by Fairmont. In addition, while Fairmont may be entitled to indemnity or contribution in certain jurisdictions from manufacturers of identified products, the availability of such indemnity or contribution is unclear at this time and, in recent years, some of the manufacturers named as defendants in these actions have sought protection from these claims under bankruptcy laws. Fairmont has no insurance coverage with respect to these asbestos cases. To date, payments by Fairmont with respect to asbestos cases have not been material. However, payments in the future with respect to pending or future asbestos cases could be material to our financial position, results of operations or cash flows of CONSOL Energy. Various federal or state laws and regulations require CONSOL Energy to obtain surety bonds or to provide other assurance of payment for certain of our long term liabilities including mine closure or reclamation costs, workers compensation and other post employment benefits. Federal and state laws require us to obtain surety bonds or provide other assurances to secure payment of certain long term obligations including mine closure or reclamation costs, federal and state workers compensation costs, coal leases and other miscellaneous obligations. It has become increasingly difficult for us to secure new surety bonds or renew such bonds without posting collateral. CONSOL Energy has satisfied its obligations under these statutes and regulations by providing letters of credit or other assurances of payment. 73 Table of Contents However, letters of credit can be significantly more costly to us than surety bonds. The issuance of letters of credit under our bank credit facility also reduces amounts that it can borrow under its bank credit facility for other purposes. CONSOL Energy and certain of its officers are defendants in class action lawsuits alleging the defendants issued false and misleading statements to the public that could result in CONSOL Energy making substantial payments. On October 21, 2003, a complaint was filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania on behalf of Seth Moorhead against CONSOL Energy, J. Brett Harvey and William J. Lyons. The complaint alleges, among other things, that the defendants violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b 5 promulgated under the Exchange Act and that during the period between January 24, 2002 and July 18, 2002 the defendants issued false and misleading statements to the public that failed to disclose or misrepresented the following, among other things: (a) that CONSOL Energy utilized an aggressive approach regarding its spot market sales by reserving 20% of its production to that market, and that by increasing its exposure to the spot market, CONSOL Energy was subjecting itself to increased risk and uncertainty as the price and demand for coal could be volatile; (b) that CONSOL Energy was experiencing difficulty selling the production that it had allocated to the spot market, and, nonetheless, CONSOL Energy maintained its production levels which caused its coal inventory to increase; (c) that CONSOL Energys increasing coal inventory was causing its expenses to rise dramatically, thereby weakening its financial condition; and (d) that based on the foregoing, defendants positive statements regarding CONSOL Energys earnings and prospects were lacking in a reasonable basis at all times and therefore were materially false and misleading. The complaint asks the court to (1) award unspecified damages to plaintiff and (2) award plaintiff reasonable costs and expenses incurred in connection with this action, including counsel fees and expert fees. Another class action complaint has been filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania against CONSOL Energy and certain officers and directors. CONSOL Energy has not yet been served with that complaint. If CONSOL Energy is not successful in defending one or more of these lawsuits it may have to make substantial payments to the plaintiffs. CONSOL Energy is a holding company and conducts substantially all of its operations through subsidiaries. CONSOL Energys ability to service its debt and pay dividends to holders of its common stock will depend upon it receiving distributions or similar payments from its subsidiaries. Dividends are discretionary. Because substantially all of CONSOL Energys operations are conducted through subsidiaries, its cash flow and, therefore, its ability to service its debt and pay dividends to holders of its common stock primarily depends upon the earnings of its subsidiaries and the distribution of those earnings to, or upon loans or other payments of funds by those subsidiaries to, CONSOL Energy. In addition, the payment of dividends and the making of loans and advances to CONSOL Energy by its subsidiaries may be subject to statutory or contractual restrictions, will be contingent upon the earnings of those subsidiaries and subject to various business considerations. CONSOL Energys rights plan may have anti takeover effects that could prevent a change of control. On December 19, 2003, CONSOL Energy adopted a rights plan which, in certain circumstances, including a person or group acquiring, or the commencement of a tender or exchange offer that would result in a person or group acquiring, beneficial ownership of more than 15% of the outstanding shares of CONSOL Energy common stock, would entitle each right holder to receive, upon exercise of the right, shares of CONSOL Energy common stock having a value equal to twice the right exercise price. For example, at an exercise price of $80 per right, each right not otherwise voided would entitle its holders to purchase $160 worth of shares of CONSOL Energy common stock for $80. Assuming that shares of CONSOL Energy common stock had a per share value of $16 at such time, the holder of each right would be entitled to purchase ten shares of CONSOL Energy common stock for $80, or a price of $8 per share, one half its then market price. This and other provisions of CONSOL Energys 74 Table of Contents rights plan could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire CONSOL Energy, which could hinder stockholders ability to receive a premium for CONSOL Energy stock over the prevailing market prices. Liquidity and Capital Resources CONSOL Energy generally has satisfied its working capital requirements and funded its capital expenditures and debt service obligations from cash generated from operations and proceeds from borrowings. On June 30, 2004, CONSOL Energy completed a $600 million Senior Secured Loan Agreement to replace the existing $267 million facility. The new agreement consists of a five year $400 million revolving credit facility and a six year $200 million Tranche B credit linked deposit facility. The new facility is secured by nearly all of the assets of CONSOL Energy. CONSOL Energys 7.875% bonds that mature in 2012 and CONSOL Energys subsidiarys 8.25% medium term notes maturing in 2007 have been equally and ratably secured. The facility can be used for letters of credit and borrowings for general corporate purposes. In the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, cash collateralized letters of credit issued under a restricted cash arrangement were transferred to the Tranche B facility and the $190 million of restricted cash was released and was used to pay short term debt. At our option, interest on borrowings under the new facility is based upon the Prime (Base) Rate or London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR) plus a spread that is dependent on our credit rating. The agreement has various covenants, including covenants that limit our ability to dispose of assets, make investments and merge with another corporation. We are also required to maintain a ratio of financial covenant debt, as defined, to twelve month trailing earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization (EBITDA) of not more than 3.0 to 1.0, measured quarterly. This ratio was 1.38 to 1.0 at December 31, 2004. In addition, we are required to maintain a ratio of twelve months trailing EBITDA to cash interest expense of no less than 4.5 to 1.0, measured quarterly. This ratio was 12.71 to 1.0 at December 31, 2004. The revolving credit facility also has covenants restricting the level of annual capital expenditures to be made by CONSOL Energy. The capital expenditure limit was $450.0 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004. CONSOL Energys actual capital expenditures for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 were $411 million. At December 31, 2004, this facility had approximately $276.8 million letters of credit issued and had $1.7 million of borrowings outstanding, leaving approximately $321.5 million of unused capacity. CONSOL Energy is currently engaged in discussions to amend the existing credit facility. Among other things, the amendments may reduce costs of the facility, increase the amounts that can be borrowed, extend the term and eliminate the current limitation on capital expenditures. We cannot be certain when the amendments will be completed or the terms we will be able to obtain. In June 2004, Moodys Investor Service affirmed the rating of Ba2 (12th lowest out of 21 rating categories) to the $600 million secured bank facility, which replaced CONSOL Energys secured $267 million bank facility. The rating outlook is stable. Obligations which are rated Ba are considered to have speculative elements; their future cannot be considered as well assured. Often the protection of interest and principal payments may be very moderate, and thereby not well safeguarded during both good and bad times over the future. Uncertainty of position characterizes bonds in this class. The modifier 2 indicates that the obligation ranks in the middle of its generic rating category. In July 2004, Standard and Poors confirmed the BB rating (12th lowest out of 22 rating categories) with a recovery rate of 1 to CONSOL Energys $600 million secured bank facility, which replaced its secured $267 million bank facility. Standard and Poors defines an obligation rated BB as less vulnerable to nonpayment than other speculative issues. However, the rating indicates that an obligor faces major ongoing uncertainties or exposure to adverse business, financial, or economic conditions, which could lead to the obligors inadequate capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation. The recovery rating of 1 indicates a high expectation of full recovery of principal in the event of a default. A security rating is not a recommendation by a rating agency to buy, sell or hold securities. The security rating may be subject to change. In April 2003, CONSOL Energy and certain of its Subsidiaries entered into a receivables facility with financial institutions for the sale on a continuous basis of eligible trade accounts receivable that will provide, on a revolving basis, up to $125 million of short term funding. CONSOL Energy formed CNX Funding Corporation, 75 Table of Contents a wholly owned, special purpose, bankruptcy remote subsidiary, for the sole purpose of buying and selling eligible trade receivables generated by certain subsidiaries of CONSOL Energy. Under the receivables facility, CONSOL Energy and certain subsidiaries, irrevocably and without recourse, sell all of their eligible trade accounts receivable to CNX Funding Corporation. CNX Funding Corporation then sells, on a revolving basis, an undivided percentage interest in the pool of eligible trade accounts receivable to financial institutions and their affiliates, while maintaining a subordinated interest in a portion of the trade receivables. CONSOL Energy has agreed to continue servicing the sold receivables for the financial institutions for a fee based upon market rates for similar services. The cost of funds is consistent with commercial paper rates plus a charge for administrative services paid to the financial institution. The receivables facility expires in 2006. At December 31, 2004, eligible accounts receivable total approximately $141.1 million. The subordinated retained interest at December 31, 2004 was $16.1 million. Accounts receivable totaling $125.0 million were removed from the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2004. In accordance with the facility agreement, CONSOL Energy is able to receive proceeds based upon total eligible accounts receivable at the previous month end. Related proceeds, net of repayments, of $17.0 million are included in cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004. CONSOL Energy believes that cash generated from operations and its borrowing capacity under its credit facility will be sufficient to meet its working capital requirements, anticipated capital expenditures (other than major acquisitions), scheduled debt payments, anticipated dividend payments in 2004 and to provide required letters of credit. Nevertheless, the ability of CONSOL Energy to satisfy its working capital requirements, debt service obligations, to fund planned capital expenditures or pay dividends will depend upon its future operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions in the coal and gas industries and other financial and business factors, some of which are beyond CONSOL Energys control. In order to manage the market risk exposure of volatile natural gas prices in the future, CONSOL Energy enters into various physical gas supply transactions with both gas marketers and end users for terms varying in length from a single day to greater than a year. CONSOL Energy has also entered into various gas swap transactions that qualify as financial cash flow hedges, which exist parallel to the underlying physical transactions. The fair value of these contracts was a loss of $5.7 million (net of $3.6 million of deferred tax) at December 31, 2004. CONSOL Energy frequently evaluates potential acquisitions. CONSOL Energy has funded acquisitions primarily with cash generated from operations and a variety of other sources, depending on the size of the transaction, including debt financing. There can be no assurance that additional capital resources, including debt financing, will be available to CONSOL Energy on terms which CONSOL Energy finds acceptable, or at all. Cash Flows (in millions) for the twelve months ended December 31 2004 Period 2003 Period Change Cash flows provided by operating activities $ 358 $ 381 $ (23 ) Cash used in investing activities $ (401 ) $ (205 ) $ (196 ) Cash provided by (used in) financing activities $ 42 $ (182 ) $ 224 Cash flows from operating activities changed due to the following items: Approximately $68 million was received in 2003 for refunds filed for 1994 1999 related to our black lung excise claims and related interest. Under the accounts receivable securitization facility, approximately $17 million was received, net of amounts paid, during the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 compared to $108 million received during the twelve months ended December 31, 2003. 76 Table of Contents Coal inventories increased 0.3 million tons in the twelve month period ended December 31, 2004 compared to a decrease of 1.5 million tons in the twelve month period ended December 31, 2003. Approximately $25 million of insurance payments were collected in the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 related to the Loveridge Mine fire experienced in 2003. Accounts receivables from the expected insurance recoveries related to the two mine fires of approximately $28 million were recorded in 2003. Operating cash flows are also improved due to increased net income as previously discussed. Net cash used in or provided by investing activities changed primarily due to the following items: Capital expenditures were $411 million in 2004 compared to $291 million in 2003. 2004 capital expenditures include the purchase of longwall shields, development work at Loveridge and McElroy and the expansion of the Bailey Preparation Plant. More proceeds from sales of assets received in the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 than in the twelve months ended December 31, 2004. Proceeds from the sales of assets in 2003 primarily were from the sale, in February 2003, of CONSOL Energys Canadian coal assets and port facilities to Fording Inc. for a note and cash. The note was exchanged for 3.2 million units in the Fording Canadian Coal Trust, a newly organized publicly traded trust, which acquired the assets of Fording Inc. CONSOL Energy sold the coal trust units in March 2003. Net cash received from or used in financing activities changed primarily due to the following items; Payments of $203 million were made to repay the outstanding commercial paper balance in 2003. Payments of approximately $63 million were made in the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 to reduce amounts borrowed under the revolving credit facilities compared to borrowings of approximately $65 million in the twelve months ended December 31, 2003. Scheduled long term debt repayments of $45 million were made in 2004. Dividend payments were $50 million in 2004 compared to $46 million in 2003 due to the additional 11 million shares of common stock that were issued by CONSOL Energy in September 2003. Previously restricted cash of $190 million was released due to the completion of a new $600 million debt facility in the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 compared to $191 million used to secure letters of credit with a cash backed facility in the twelve months ended December 31, 2003. Approximately $190 million was received in 2003 from the sale of 11 million shares of common stock in a private placement in September 2003. The following is a summary of our significant contractual obligations at December 31, 2004 (in thousands): Payments due by Year Within 1 Year 13Years 3 5Years After 5 Years Total Short term Notes Payable $ 5,060 $ $ $ $ 5,060 Gas Firm Transportation Obligation 3,654 1,126 4,780 Long term Debt 3,885 51,098 4,614 371,639 431,236 Operating Lease Obligations 26,047 46,677 27,650 6,412 106,786 Total Contractual Obligations $ 38,646 $ 98,901 $ 32,264 $ 378,051 $ 547,862 77 Table of Contents Additionally, we have long term liabilities relating to other post employment benefits, work related injuries and illnesses, defined benefit pension plans, mine reclamation and closure, and other long term liability costs. We estimate payments, net of any applicable trust reimbursements, related to these items at December 31, 2004 (in thousands) to be: Payments due by Year Within 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years Total $324,099 $591,570 $577,653 $1,493,322 As discussed in Critical Accounting Policies and in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10 K, our determination of these long term liabilities is calculated annually and is based on several assumptions, including then prevailing conditions, which may change from year to year. In any year, if our assumptions are inaccurate, we could be required to expend greater amounts than anticipated. Moreover, in particular, for periods after 2004 our estimates may change from the amounts included in the table, and may change significantly, if our assumptions change to reflect changing conditions. Capital expenditures were approximately $411 million in the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 compared to $291 million in the twelve months ended December 31, 2003. We currently anticipate capital expenditures for the year ending December 31, 2005 to be approximately $430 million, of which approximately $385 million is maintenance of production. However, we may choose to defer certain capital projects in light of operating results and the availability of financing. Capital expenditures for pollution abatement and reclamation are projected to be $15.1 million for the year ending December 31, 2005. Our capital expenditures have been and will be primarily used for replacement of mining and gas equipment, the expansion of mining and gas capacity, and projects to improve the efficiency of the mining and gas operations. The projected capital expenditures for 2005 are not committed and are expected to be funded with cash generated by operations and existing borrowing capacity. In addition, cash requirements to fund employee related, mine closure and other long term liabilities included above, along with obligations related to long term debt, capital and operating leases, are expected to be funded with cash generated by operations and existing borrowing capacity. Debt At December 31, 2004, CONSOL Energy had total long term debt of $430 million outstanding, including current portion of long term debt of $4 million. This long term debt consisted of: An aggregate principal amount of $249 million ($250 million of 7.875% notes due in 2012, net of $1 million unamortized debt discount). The notes were issued at 99.174% of the principal amount. Interest on the notes is payable March 1 and September 1 of each year. Payment of the principal and premium, if any, and interest on the notes are guaranteed by most of CONSOL Energy subsidiaries. The notes are senior secured obligations and rank equally with all other secured indebtedness of the guarantors; An aggregate principal amount of $45 million of secured notes which bear interest at fixed rates of 8.25% per annum and are due in 2007; An aggregate principal amount of $103 million of two series of industrial revenue bonds which were issued to finance the Baltimore port facility and bear interest at 6.50% per annum and mature in 2010 and 2011; $32 million in advance royalty commitments with an average interest rate of 7.663% per annum; An aggregate principal amount of $1 million of variable rate notes with a weighted average interest rate of 4.66% due at various dates ranging from 2005 through 2031. On June 30, 2004, CONSOL Energy completed a $600 million Senior Secured Loan Agreement to replace the existing $267 million facility. The new agreement consists of a five year $400 million revolving credit facility and a six year $200 million Tranche B credit linked deposit facility. The new facility is secured by nearly 78 Table of Contents all of the assets of CONSOL Energy. Collateral has been provided to the banks and shared equally and ratably with the holders of CONSOL Energys 7.875% bonds that mature in 2012 and CONSOL Energys subsidiarys 8.25% medium term notes maturing in 2007. The facility can be used for letters of credit and borrowings for general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2004, cash collateralized letters of credit issued under a restricted cash arrangement have been transferred to the Tranche B facility and the $190 million of restricted cash was released and used to pay short term debt. At our option, interest is based upon the Prime (Base) Rate or London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR) plus a spread that is dependent on our credit rating. The agreement has various covenants, including covenants that limit our ability to dispose of assets, make investments and merge with another corporation. We are also required to maintain a ratio of financial covenant debt, as defined, to twelve month trailing earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization (EBITDA) of not more than 3.0 to 1.0, measured quarterly. This ratio was 1.38 to 1.0 at December 31, 2004. In addition, we are required to maintain a ratio of twelve months trailing EBITDA to cash interest expense of no less than 4.5 to 1.0, measured quarterly. This ratio was 12.71 to 1.0 at December 31, 2004. The revolving credit facility also has covenants restricting the level of annual capital expenditures to be made by CONSOL Energy. The capital expenditure limit is $550.0 million for each of the twelve months ended December 31, 2005 and 2006, respectively. At December 31, 2004, this facility had approximately $276.8 million letters of credit issued and had $1.7 million of borrowings outstanding, leaving approximately $321.5 million of unused capacity. CONSOL Energy is currently engaged in discussions to amend the existing credit facility. Among other things, the amendments may reduce costs of the facility, increase the amounts that can be borrowed, extend the term and eliminate the current limitation on capital expenditures. We cannot be certain when the amendments will be completed or the terms we will be able to obtain. Stockholders Equity and Dividends CONSOL Energy had stockholders equity of $469 million at December 31, 2004 and $291 million at December 31, 2003. The increase is primarily attributable to net income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004. Stockholders equity also increased due to a reduction of $13 million in the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 in Other Comprehensive Losses. These losses related primarily to the recognition of minimum pension liability as a result of the under performance of plan assets for non contributory defined benefit retirement plans. Comprehensive losses (gains) are generally calculated annually and reflect a number of factors including conditions in the stock markets and interest rates. These increases were offset, in part, by various cash flow hedges related to our gas business and the payment of dividends. Off Balance Sheet Transactions CONSOL Energy does not maintain any off balance sheet transactions, arrangements, obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or others that are likely to have a material current or future effect on CONSOL Energys condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources which are not disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Recent Accounting Pronouncements On December 15, 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) released its final revised standard entitled FASB Statement No. 123R, Share Based Payment (FAS 123R). This Statement requires that all public entities measure the cost of equity based service awards based on the grant date fair value. That cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award or the requisite service period, which usually is the vesting period. Compensation cost is not recognized for equity instruments for which employees do not render the requisite service. FAS 123R is effective for public companies as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after June 15, 2005. The expected impact of unvested stock options outstanding at December 31, 2004, under the modified prospective application of FAS 123R, with no restatement of interim periods prior to the effective date, is approximately $2.5 million of pre tax expense in the period ending December 31, 2005. 79 Table of Contents On November 30, 2004, the FASB ratified EITF Issue No. 03 13, Applying the Conditions in Paragraph 42 of FASB Statement No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, in Determining Whether to Report Discontinued Operations (EITF 03 13). To qualify as a discontinued operation, paragraph 42 of FAS 144 requires that the cash flows of the disposed component be eliminated from the operations of the ongoing entity and that the ongoing entity not have any significant continuing involvement in the operations of the disposed component after the disposal transaction. EITF 03 13 provides guidance on how to interpret and apply the criteria in paragraph 42A (elimination of cash flows) and paragraph 42B (no significant continuing involvement) of FAS 144. EITF 03 13 is to be effective for all periods beginning after December 15, 2004. Previously reported operating results related to disposal transactions initiated within an enterprises fiscal year that includes November 30, 2004 may be reclassified to reflect the consensus. We do not expect this guidance to have a financial impact to CONSOL Energy in the 2005 fiscal year. In November 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 151, Inventory Costs: An Amendment of ARB 43, Chapter 4 (FAS 151). This statement amends the guidance in ARB No. 43, Chapter 4, Inventory Pricing, to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted material (spoilage). Paragraph 5 of ARB 43, Chapter 4, previously stated that under some circumstances, items such as idle facility expense, excessive spoilage, double freight, and re handling costs may be so abnormal as to require treatment as current period charges. FAS 151 requires that those items be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal. In addition, this Statement requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. The provisions of this Statement are effective for inventory cost incurred during fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. We are current evaluating what impact this provision could have for CONSOL Energy in the 2005 fiscal year. On October 13, 2004, the FASB ratified EITF Issue No. 04 10, Applying Paragraph 19 of FASB Statement No. 131, Disclosure about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information, in Determining Whether to Aggregate Operating Segments That Do Not Meet the Quantitative Thresholds (EITF 04 10). FASB Statement No. 131 requires that a public business enterprise report financial and descriptive information about its reportable operating segments. Operating segments are components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. EITF 04 10 clarifies how an enterprise should evaluate the aggregation criteria in paragraph 17 of FAS 131 when determining whether operating segments that do not meet the quantitative thresholds may be aggregated in accordance with paragraph 19 of FAS 131. In addition, the FASB Task Force has requested that the FASB staff propose a FASB Staff Position (FSP) to provide guidance in determining whether two or more operating segments have similar economic characteristics. The Task Force has agreed that since the two issues are interrelated, the effective date of EITF 04 10 should coincide with the future undetermined effective date of the anticipated FSP. We are currently evaluating the positions addressed in EITF 04 10, and foresee no significant changes in the reporting practices currently used to report segment information. In October 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 was signed into law. The focal point of the legislation, and the area that is expected to have the most significant impact to CONSOL Energy, is the repeal of the extraterritorial income (ETI) exclusion. In its place, a new provision was added, the Domestic Manufacturers Exemption. For the tax years 2005 2006, the deduction will equal 3% of the lesser of qualified production activities income or taxable income. The percentage rises to 6% in 2007 2009 and to 9% in 2010 and after. At its October 2004 meeting, the FASB proposed that the deduction be treated as a special deduction that should be included as a permanent benefit in CONSOL Energys estimate of its annual effective tax rate. The Act also provides for a temporary incentive to repatriate accumulated foreign earnings and profits by providing an elective 85% dividend received deduction. We are currently evaluating what impact this provision could have for CONSOL Energy in the tax year 2005. In the second quarter of 2004, in response to the federal Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the Act), the FASB finalized guidance on how employers should account for the 80 Table of Contents Medicare Act (FSP FAS 106 2). The Act introduces a prescription drug benefit under Medicare (Medicare Part D) as well as a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D. As permitted by this recent accounting guidance, CONSOL Energy has recognized the benefits of the Act in the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 with effect from March 8, 2004. The benefits of the Act have been recognized as a reduction of approximately $21 million in other postemployment benefit costs. In March 2004, the FASB issued Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 04 2, Whether Mineral Rights Are Tangible or Intangible Assets (EITF 04 2). In this issue, the Task Force reached the consensus that mineral rights are tangible assets. This consensus differed from the requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141, Business Combinations and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets which characterize mineral rights as intangible assets. As a result, the FASB amended FAS 141 and FAS 142 to eliminate this inconsistency. Effective with the 2004 second quarter, CONSOL Energy has reclassified mineral rights as property, plant and equipment in accordance with EITF 04 2. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. In addition to the risks inherent in operations, CONSOL Energy is exposed to financial, market, political and economic risks. The following discussion provides additional detail regarding CONSOL Energys exposure to the risks of changing natural gas prices, interest rates and foreign exchange rates. CONSOL Energy is exposed to market price risk in the normal course of selling natural gas production and to a lesser extent in the sale of coal. CONSOL sells coal under both short term and long term contracts with fixed price and or indexed price contracts that reflect market value. CONSOL Energy uses fixed price contracts, collar price contracts and derivative commodity instruments that qualify as cash flow hedges under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 to minimize exposure to market price volatility in the sale of natural gas. Our risk management policy strictly prohibits the use of derivatives for speculative positions. CONSOL Energy has established risk management policies and procedures to strengthen the internal control environment of the marketing of commodities produced from its asset base. All of the derivative instruments are held for purposes other than trading. They are used primarily to mitigate uncertainty and volatility and cover underlying exposures. CONSOL Energys market risk strategy incorporates fundamental risk management tools to assess market price risk and establish a framework in which management can maintain a portfolio of transactions within pre defined risk parameters. CONSOL Energy believes that the use of derivative instruments along with the risk assessment procedures and internal controls does not expose CONSOL Energy to material risk. The use of derivative instruments could materially affect CONSOL Energys results of operations depending on market prices. However, we believe that use of these instruments will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or liquidity. For a summary of accounting policies related to derivative instruments, see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 81 Table of Contents Sensitivity analyses of the incremental effects on pre tax earnings for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 of a hypothetical 10% and 25% change in natural gas prices for open derivative instruments as of December 31, 2004 are provided in the following table: Incremental Decrease in Pre tax EarningsAssuming aHypothetical Price,Exchange Rate or Interest Rate Change of: 10% 25% (in millions) Natural Gas(a) $ 16.0 $ 25.7 (a) CONSOL Energy remains at risk for possible changes in the market value of these derivative instruments; however, such risk should be mitigated by price changes in the underlying hedged item. The effect of this offset is not reflected in the sensitivity analyses. CONSOL Energy entered into derivative instruments to convert the market prices related to portions of the 2005 through 2006 anticipated sales of natural gas to fixed prices. The sensitivity analysis reflects an inverse relationship between increases in commodity prices and a benefit to earnings. When commodity prices increase, pretax income decreases. The fair value of these contracts was a net loss of $5.7 million (net of $3.6 million deferred tax). We continually evaluate the portfolio of derivative commodity instruments and adjust the strategy to anticipated market conditions and risks accordingly. CONSOL Energy is exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by counterparties. The credit worthiness of counterparties is subject to continuing review. CONSOL Energys interest expense is sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates in the United States. At December 31, 2004, CONSOL Energy had outstanding $430 million aggregate principal amount of debt under fixed rate instruments and $5 million aggregate principal amount of debt under variable rate instruments. CONSOL Energys primary exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to its revolving credit facility, under which there was $1.7 million of borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2004. On June 30, 2004, CONSOL Energy completed a $600 million senior secured loan facility to replace the existing $267 million facility. The new facility consists of a five year $400 million revolving credit facility and a six year $200 million Tranche B credit linked deposit facility. CONSOL Energys revolving credit facility bore interest at a weighted average rate of 5.3% per annum during the twelve months ended December 31, 2004. Due to the level of borrowings against this facility in the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, a 100 basis point increase in the average rate for CONSOL Energys revolving credit facility would not have significantly decreased net income for the period. The fair value of CONSOL Energys financial instruments is set forth in Note 26 and Note 27 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Almost all of CONSOL Energys transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars, and, as a result, it does not have material exposure to currency exchange rate risks. 82 Table of Contents
