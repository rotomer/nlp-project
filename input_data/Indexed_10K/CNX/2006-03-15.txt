Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. General CONSOL Energy had net income of $581 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to $199 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Net income for the 2005 period was improved due to the $327 million gain on sale of 18.5% interest in CNX Gas Corporation. On June 21, 2005, the Board of Directors of CONSOL Energy authorized the incorporation of CNX Gas Corporation (CNX Gas). On June 30, CNX Gas was incorporated and issued 100 shares of its $0.01 par value common stock to Consolidation Coal Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of CONSOL Energy. CNX Gas was incorporated to conduct CONSOL Energys gas exploration and production activities. In August 2005, CONSOL Energy contributed or leased substantially all of the assets of its gas business, including all of CONSOL Energys rights to coalbed methane associated with 4.5 billion tons of coal reserves owned or controlled by CONSOL Energy as well as all of CONSOL Energys rights to conventional gas. In exchange for CONSOL Energys contribution of assets, CONSOL Energy received approximately 122.9 million shares of CNX Gas common stock. CNX Gas entered into various agreements with CONSOL Energy that define various operating and service relationships between the two companies. In August 2005, CNX Gas entered into an agreement to sell approximately 24.3 million shares in a private transaction and granted a 30 day option to purchase an additional 3.6 million shares. In August 2005, CNX Gas closed on the sale of all 27.9 million shares. The shares were sold to qualified institutional, foreign and accredited investors in a private transaction exempt from registration under Rule 144A, Regulation S and Regulation D. In August 2005, a Registration Statement on Form S 1 was filed with the SEC with respect to those shares. The registration statement was declared effective on January 18, 2006. The proceeds (approximately $420,167 including proceeds from the sale of the additional 3.6 million shares) were used to pay a special dividend to CONSOL Energy. The gain recognized on this transaction was $327,326. The proceeds received less the financial basis in the assets and liabilities given up were recognized as a gain on sale of a subsidiarys stock in the year ended December 31, 2005 in the consolidated financial statements. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, no deferred tax was provided on this transaction as current tax law provides a means by which the excess of the reported amount of this investment over its tax basis can be recovered tax free. Also, management has no current intention of entering into a transaction that would cause CNX Gas to leave the consolidated tax group. Improved net income was also due to higher average sales prices for coal and gas. This increase was offset, in part by costs related to the Buchanan Mine fire and by higher cost per units sold for both coal and gas. Higher coal unit costs were primarily due to higher supply costs, higher labor costs, higher contract mining fee costs and higher other post employment benefits per unit sold. Higher gas unit costs were primarily attributable to increased royalty expense, changes in imbalance amounts and firm transportation costs. Net income in the 2004 period included $83 million due to a cumulative effect of change in accounting for workers compensation. Total coal sales for the year ended December 31, 2005 were 70.5 million tons, including sales by consolidated variable interest entities, of which 68.9 million tons were produced by CONSOL Energy operations, or sold from inventory of company produced coal. This compares with total coal sales of 69.5 million tons for the year ended December 31, 2004, of which 67.4 million tons were produced by CONSOL Energy operations or sold from inventory of company produced coal. Overall, production of 69.1 million tons, including production from consolidated variable interest entities and our portion of equity affiliates, increased 1.4 million tons from the 2004 period. Bailey Mine, McElroy Mine, Loveridge Mine and Emery Mine set production records in 2005, which offset the estimated loss of approximately 2.5 million tons from the Buchanan Mine due to problems that occurred there during the year. Sales volumes of coalbed methane gas, including a percentage of the sales of equity affiliates equal to our interest in these affiliates, decreased 0.9% to 55.0 billion cubic feet for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared with 55.5 billion cubic feet in the year ended December 31, 2004. The decrease in sales volumes is primarily due to the loss of 3.6 billion cubic feet related to the Buchanan fire and 1.1 billion cubic feet from curtailments on shipment capacity on the Columbia interstate pipeline. Our average sales price for coalbed methane gas, including sales of equity affiliates increased 19.2% to $6.02 per thousand cubic feet in the 2005 period compared with $5.05 per thousand cubic feet in the 2004 period. 51 Table of Contents In September 2005, the Buchanan Mine, near Keen Mountain, Virginia, suspended production following a problem with the mines skip hoist mechanism. The hoist was repaired and production resumed on December 13, 2005. It is estimated that the mine lost approximately 1.0 million tons of production during the period that production was suspended. During that period, the company invoked the force majeure provision on all sales contracts for Buchanan Mine coal. In October 2005, David C. Hardesty, President West Virginia University, was elected to the CONSOL Energy Board of Directors. In December 2005, the Board of Directors authorized a common share repurchase program of up to $300 million during the 24 month period beginning January 1, 2006 and ended December 31, 2007. CONSOL has repurchased 155,000 shares through February 7, 2006 at an average price of $69.06 under this program. In January 2006, CONSOL Energy entered into a coal sales agreement with American Electric Power (AEP) for the sale of up to 82.5 million tons of high Btu bituminous coal to various AEP coal fired power stations over a 15 year period beginning in 2007 and running through 2021. The coal will come from the Shoemaker and McElroy mines and will be shipped to AEP power plants that have or will be equipped to have scrubbers. As a result of the new contract, we will begin a major capital improvement project for the Shoemaker Mine, replacing the mines older, rail haulage system with a new, more efficient conveyor belt haulage system. In January 2006, CONSOL Energy purchased Mon River Towing and J.A.R. Barge Lines, LP from the Guttman Group, a private concern. The acquisition will increase the size of CONSOL Energys towboat fleet from 5 to 18 and increase the number of barges from about 300 to more than 650, increasing coal transportation capacity from 11 million tons to about 24 million tons. The transaction closed on January 20, 2006. On January 18, 2006, CNX Gas Corporations registration statement on Form S 1 was declared effective by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. This registration statement covers 27,936,667 shares of CNX Gas common stock. These shares have been approved for listing on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol CXG. CONSOL Energy owns approximately 81.5% of CNX Gas outstanding shares. Over the next two years, electricity generation in the United States is forecast to grow approximately 2.0% per annum, absent any adverse weather impacts. According to industry reports, coal inventories are significantly below normal in the United States and could add 10 20 million tons of demand in 2006. Furthermore, natural gas prices remain high and make gas powered generation more expensive than that of coal. These factors should contribute to an already tight supply/demand balance for U.S. thermal (steam) coal. The United States Energy Information Administration (EIA) has forecasted that over the next four years there are more than 12 gigawatts of planned capacity additions from new generators that will use coal as an energy source requiring an estimated 30 million tons of high Btu coal per year. In addition, there are nearly 50 gigawatts of existing coal fired power scheduled to be retrofitted with scrubbers over the same time frame. CONSOL Energy expects to benefit from: the long term demand for high Btu Northern Appalachia coal due to new and retrofitted scrubbers on power plants geographically located near CONSOLs mines; the growing demand for electricity generation as consumers use more electricity dependent devices; the geological limitations of Central Appalachian coal; and the potential transportation issues associated with lower Btu coal. While the overall market for coal remains positive, we believe the growth in demand for Northern Appalachian coal will exceed the industrys organic growth by a wide margin. The transaction with AEP that we announced earlier this month is indicative of the way we see this market evolving. Major coal burning power generators are beginning to move to the high Btu products available close to their plants as their scrubber construction projects are completed. 52 Table of Contents Results of Operations Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2005 Compared with Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2004 Net Income Net income changed primarily due to the following items (table in millions): 2005 2004 Dollar Variance Percentage Change Coal Sales Produced and Purchased (Outside and Related Party) $ 2,527 $ 2,087 $ 440 21.1 % Produced Gas Sales 327 275 52 18.9 % Purchased Gas Sales 275 112 163 145.5 % Gain on Sale of 18.5% interest in CNX Gas 327 327 100.0 % Other Sales and Other Income 354 303 51 16.8 % Total Revenue and Other Income 3,810 2,777 1,033 37.2 % Coal Cost of Goods Sold Produced and Purchased 1,702 1,533 169 11.0 % Produced Gas Cost of Goods Sold 116 105 11 10.5 % Purchased Gas Cost of Goods Sold 279 113 166 146.9 % Other Cost of Goods Sold 340 250 90 36.0 % Total Cost of Goods Sold 2,437 2,001 436 21.8 % Other 719 693 26 3.8 % Total Costs 3,156 2,694 462 17.1 % Earnings Before Income Taxes, Minority Interest and Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting 654 83 571 688.0 % Income Tax Expense (Benefit) 64 (33 ) 97 293.9 % Earnings Before Minority Interest and Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle 590 116 474 408.6 % Minority Interest (9 ) (9 ) (100.0 )% Earnings Before Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle 581 116 465 400.9 % Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle 83 (83 ) (100.0 )% Net Income $ 581 $ 199 $ 382 192.0 % Earnings before cumulative effect of change in accounting for the 2005 period were improved primarily due to the gain on sale of 18.5% interest in CNX Gas. In August 2005, CNX Gas, a subsidiary of CONSOL Energy, sold 27.9 million shares in a private transaction. CNX Gas received proceeds of $420.2 million, which it used to pay a special dividend to CONSOL Energy. The proceeds received less the financial basis in the assets and liabilities given up by CONSOL Energy was recognized as a gain on sale of a subsidiarys stock in the year ended December 31, 2005. The pre tax gain recognized on this transaction was $327.3 million. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards Board No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, no deferred tax has been provided on this transaction as current tax law provides a means by which the excess of the reported amount of this investment over its tax basis can be recovered tax free. Also, management has no current intention of entering into a transaction that would cause CNX Gas to leave the consolidated tax group. Earnings before cumulative effect of change in accounting were also improved due to increased average sales prices for both coal and gas and increased volume of produced coal sold. These increases were offset, in part, by costs related to the Buchanan Mine fire and by higher cost per units sold for both coal and gas. Higher coal unit costs were primarily due to increased supply costs, higher labor costs, higher contractor mining fees and higher other post employment benefits. Higher gas unit costs were primarily due to increased royalty expense, imbalance charges and firm transportation expenses. Net income in the 2004 period included a cumulative effect of change in 53 Table of Contents accounting related to workers compensation. Effective January 1, 2004, CONSOL Energy changed our method of accounting for workers compensation. Prior to the change, CONSOL Energy recorded our workers compensation liability on an undiscounted basis. Under the new method, CONSOL Energy records our liability on a discounted basis. Revenue Revenue and other income increased due to the following items: 2005 2004 DollarVariance PercentageChange Sales Produced Coal Outside and Related Party $ 2,448 $ 2,008 $ 440 21.9 % Purchased Coal 79 79 % Produced Gas 327 275 52 18.9 % Purchased Gas 275 112 163 145.5 % Industrial Supplies 93 79 14 17.7 % Other 36 27 9 33.3 % Total Sales 3,258 2,580 678 26.3 % Freight Revenue 120 110 10 9.1 % Gain on Sale of 18.5% of CNX Gas 327 327 100.0 % Other Income 105 87 18 20.7 % Total Revenue and Other Income $ 3,810 $ 2,777 $ 1,033 37.2 % The increase in company produced coal sales revenue, including related party, during the 2005 period was due mainly to the increase in average sales price per ton and increased sales volumes. 2005 2004 Variance PercentageChange Produced Tons Sold (in millions) 68.9 67.3 1.6 2.4 % Average Sales Price Per Ton $ 35.54 $ 29.84 $ 5.70 19.1 % The increase in average sales price primarily reflects stronger prices negotiated in 2004 and early 2005 resulting from an overall improvement in prices in the eastern coal market for domestic and foreign power generators and steel producers. The increase was also attributable to pricing premiums due to improved quality on coal shipments. The increase in tons sold was due primarily to increased production at McElroy, Loveridge, Bailey, the reactivation of Emery Mine in August 2004 and the opening of the Miller Creek complex in October 2004. These production increases were offset, in part, by a decrease in tons sold due to lower production at Buchanan and various contractor locations. The McElroy production increase is related to running two longwall mining units in the 2005 period compared to running one longwall mining unit in the 2004 period. The Loveridge production increase is due to the mine operating for the full twelve months of the 2005 period compared to only a portion of the 2004 period due to the fire at this location in 2003. Bailey production increases were due to increased productivity in the period to period comparison. Buchanan production decreased in the 2005 period due to a fire that developed in the mine after a large rock fall behind the longwall mining section on February 14, 2005. The mine was temporarily sealed in order to extinguish the fire. Buchanan resumed production on June 16, 2005. On September 16, 2005, Buchanan experienced an accident with the skip hoist which brings the coal from underground to the surface. The mine was idled until repairs to the skip hoist were completed. The mine resumed production on December 13, 2005. 54 Table of Contents Company purchased coal sales revenue remained consistent in the period to period comparison due to an increase in average sales price per ton of purchased coal, offset by reduced sales volumes. 2005 2004 Variance PercentageChange Produced Tons Sold (in millions) 1.6 2.1 (0.5 ) (23.8 )% Average Sales Price Per Ton $ 48.41 $ 37.60 $ 10.81 28.8 % The increased average sales price is primarily due to sales of purchased coal tons being sold in higher priced export and metallurgical markets. Increased revenue from higher average sales prices were offset by lower sales volumes of purchased coal in the 2005 period compared to the 2004 period. The increase in gas sales revenue was due to a higher average sales price per thousand cubic feet sold in the 2005 period compared to the 2004 period. 2005 2004 Variance Percentage Change Produced Gas Sales Volumes (in billion gross cubic feet) 54.4 54.6 (0.2 ) (0.4 )% Average Sales Price per thousand cubic feet (including effects of derivative transactions) $ 6.00 $ 5.04 $ 0.96 19.0 % We believe the 2005 gas market price increases were largely driven by continued concerns over levels of North American gas production, as well as increased oil prices and favorable economic conditions in the United States that encourage demand for natural gas. The adverse affect of the 2005 hurricane season also shut in significant portions of Gulf Coast gas, increasing the tight supply, and leading to even higher prices in 2005. CONSOL Energy enters into various physical gas swap transactions with both gas marketers and other counterparties for terms varying in length. CONSOL Energy has also entered into various gas swap transactions that qualify as financial cash flow hedges. These gas swap transactions exist parallel to the underlying physical transactions. These physical and financial hedges represented approximately 70% of our produced gas sales volumes for the year ended December 31, 2005 at an average price of $4.77 per thousand cubic feet. Despite the loss of approximately 4.0 billion cubic feet of gas related to the Buchanan Mine incident and 1.4 billion cubic feet due to maintenance related capacity constraints on CONSOL Energys transportation capacity on the Columbia interstate pipeline, sales volumes are only slightly lower in the 2005 period compared to the 2004 period. We were able to offset these production losses with additional volumes coming on line from our on going drilling program, and by successfully initiating a frac well enhancement and stimulation program on wells unaffected by the mine fire. As a result of increased demand for pipeline use on the Columbia interstate pipeline, and the potential for curtailment on portions of the shipment capacity allocated to CONSOL Energy, we purchased firm transportation capacity on the pipeline during 2005. This arrangement offset a portion of the expected impact from periodic curtailments. In April 2005, we were given notice by Columbia regarding reductions in allowable gas flow due to routine maintenance and construction activities. Interruptible gas was completely shut in and our contracted firm transportation flows were reduced by 60% which resulted in reduced revenues of $6.8 million along with other smaller curtailments throughout the year that were also eventually lifted. Although we anticipate that these pipeline constraints will be an on going issue for the foreseeable future, we also intend to gain access to the East Tennessee Natural Gas (ETNG) pipeline, which is south of our Central Appalachia operations. ETNG has received the approval of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) for the construction of a 32 mile lateral pipeline, called Jewell Ridge Lateral, that will transport gas from our Central Appalachia operations to ETNGs major transportation pipeline to the south. The FERC approval is subject to certain conditions, which ETNG is working to satisfy. Jewell Ridge Lateral is expected to be in service in the summer of 2006 and will provide us with an alternative transportation route to the northeast markets we currently serve as well as access to east coast markets. 55 Table of Contents Additionally, we simultaneously purchased gas from and sold gas to other counterparties between the segmentation and interruptible pools on the Columbia interstate pipeline in order to satisfy obligations to certain customers. In accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force 99 19, we have increased our revenues and our costs. Sales of purchased gas volumes have increased primarily due to CONSOL Energy utilizing higher levels of firm transportation throughout the 2005 period that required us to purchase from and sell to other counterparties. CONSOL Energy began to enter into this type of transaction in May of 2004. 2005 2004 Variance Percentage Change Purchased Gas Sales Volumes (in billion gross cubic feet) 28.7 17.5 11.2 64.0 % Average Sales Price per thousand cubic feet $ 9.59 $ 6.39 $ 3.20 50.1 % The $14 million increase in revenues from the sale of industrial supplies was primarily due to increased sales volumes. The $9 million increase in other sales was attributable to revenues from river barge towing. Under the Jones Act Bowater exemption, because CONSOL Energy was more than 25% owned by a foreign company, we were prohibited from providing river barge towing to third parties. CONSOL Energy began third party river barge towing shortly after RWE AG divested their ownership interest in the 2004 period as we were no longer restricted by the Jones Act. Freight revenue is based on weight of coal shipped, negotiated freight rates and method of transportation (i.e., rail, barge, truck, etc.) used for the customers to which CONSOL Energy contractually provides transportation services. Freight revenue is the amount billed to customers for transportation costs incurred. On June 21, 2005, the Board of Directors of CONSOL Energy authorized the incorporation of CNX Gas Corporation (CNX Gas). On June 30, CNX Gas was incorporated and issued 100 shares of its $0.01 par value common stock to Consolidation Coal Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of CONSOL Energy. CNX Gas was incorporated to conduct CONSOL Energys gas exploration and production activities. In August 2005, CONSOL Energy contributed or leased substantially all of the assets of its gas business, including all of CONSOL Energys rights to coalbed methane associated with 4.5 billion tons of coal reserves owned or controlled by CONSOL Energy as well as all of CONSOL Energys rights to conventional gas. In exchange for CONSOL Energys contribution of assets, CONSOL Energy received approximately 122.9 million shares of CNX Gas common stock. CNX Gas entered into various agreements with CONSOL Energy that define various operating and service relationships between the two companies. In August 2005, CNX Gas entered into an agreement to sell approximately 24.3 million shares in a private transaction and granted a 30 day option to purchase an additional 3.6 million shares. In August 2005, CNX Gas closed on the sale of all 27.9 million shares. The shares were sold to qualified institutional, foreign and accredited investors in a private transaction exempt from registration under Rule 144A, Regulation S and Regulation D. In August 2005, a Registration Statement on Form S 1 was filed with the SEC with respect to those shares. The registration statement was declared effective on January 18, 2006. The proceeds (approximately $420,167 including proceeds from the sale of the additional 3.6 million shares) were used to pay a special dividend to CONSOL Energy. The gain recognized on this transaction was $327,326. 56 Table of Contents Other income consists of interest income, gain or loss on the disposition of assets, equity in earnings of affiliates, service income, royalty income, rental income and miscellaneous income. 2005 2004 DollarVariance PercentageChange Royalty Income $ 26 $ 19 $ 7 $ 36.8 % Buchanan fire business interruption proceeds 18 18 100.0 % Gain on sale of assets 15 41 (26 ) (63.4 )% Interest Income 8 5 3 60.0 % Harmar Trust Settlement 7 7 100.0 % Equity in income (loss) of affiliates 3 (4 ) 7 175.0 % Other miscellaneous 28 26 2 7.7 % Total Other Income $ 105 $ 87 $ 18 20.7 % Royalty income has increased due primarily to third parties producing more tonnage from CONSOL owned property in the period to period comparison. Buchanan Mine experienced a fire that developed in the mine after a large rock fall behind our longwall mining section on February 14, 2005. The mine was temporarily sealed in order to extinguish the fire. Coal production resumed on June 16, 2005. CONSOL Energy filed an insurance claim for reimbursement of various costs and business interruption related to the fire at Buchanan Mine. During the three months ended December 31, 2005, CONSOL Energy received an advance on the filed claim from the insurance companies. The portion of the advance related to fire abatement and various related costs relieved the previously established receivable. The portion related to business interruption was recognized as other income in the period received. The decrease in gain on sale of assets in the 2005 period reflects CONSOL Energys sale of stock in our wholly owned subsidiary CNX Australia Pty Limited to certain affiliates of AMCI, Inc. for $27.5 million, the assumption of approximately $21.3 million of debt, and associated interest rate swaps and foreign currency hedges in the 2004 period. The sale resulted in a pre tax gain of approximately $14.4 million. The additional gain on sale of assets in the 2004 period is primarily related to the sale of several previously closed operations. The 2005 period gain on sale of assets is primarily related to the sale of several previously closed operations. Interest income increased in the period to period comparison due to our improved cash position. Cash and cash equivalent balances at December 31, 2005 were $340.6 million compared to $6.4 million at December 31, 2004. The improved cash position was primarily due to the August sale of 18.5% interest in CNX Gas stock. The private sale of this stock resulted in $420.2 million of proceeds. Other income from the Harmar Environmental Trust (the Trust) Settlement was attributable to the Civil Division of the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny Countys decision to terminate a Trust among CONSOL Energy and other parties. The Trust was established in 1988 to provide funding for water treatment related to the now closed Harmar Mine. Other parties funded the trust. CONSOL Energy was responsible to complete water treatment activities, but all costs associated with these activities were funded by the Trust Agreement. Any excess funding upon completion of water treatment or a specified date in the future was to be distributed to parties that originally funded the trust. In the decision, all previously funded, but unused, amounts remaining in the Trust were distributed. CONSOL Energys portion of the distributed funds, $15.0 million, was placed into an escrow account pending provision of financial assurance supporting CONSOL Energys water treatment obligations. CONSOL Energy provided the financial assurance for this obligation and the funds were released from escrow. CONSOL Energy is responsible for the ongoing water treatment at this facility. CONSOL Energy recorded the funds and the present value of the water treatment liability resulting in $6.5 million of income in the 2005 period. 57 Table of Contents The equity income of affiliates in the 2005 period is attributable to CONSOL Energys portion of a gain on sale of land by an affiliate. The equity losses of affiliates in the 2004 period is due mainly to the equity losses related to Glennies Creek Mine operating results prior to the sale that occurred in February 2004. An additional $2 million increase in other income was due to various transactions that occurred throughout both periods, none of which were individually material. Costs 2005 2004 Dollar Variance Percentage Change Cost of Good Sold and Other Charges Produced Coal $ 1,613 $ 1,457 $ 156 10.7 % Purchased Coal 89 76 13 17.1 % Produced Gas 116 105 11 10.5 % Purchased Gas 279 113 166 146.9 % Industrial Supplies 105 94 11 11.7 % Closed and Idle Mines 69 72 (3 ) (4.2 )% Other 166 84 82 97.6 % Total Cost of Goods Sold $ 2,437 $ 2,001 $ 436 21.8 % Increased cost of goods sold and other charges for company produced coal was due mainly to an 8.2% increase in cost per ton of produced coal sold and a 2.4% increase in sales volumes. 2005 2004 Variance PercentageChange Produced Tons Sold (in millions) 68.9 67.3 1.6 2.4 % Average Cost of Goods Sold and Other Charges Per Ton $ 23.42 $ 21.64 $ 1.78 8.2 % Average cost of goods sold and other charges for produced coal increased due mainly to increased unit costs. This increase is attributable to higher supply costs, higher labor costs, higher contract mining fee costs and higher other post employment benefits per unit sold. Higher supply costs were attributable to increased maintenance costs and increased cost for steel, petroleum products and chemicals, such as magnetite, used in the mining and coal preparation process. Higher supply costs were also related to certain locations being in difficult mining conditions which increase costs on a per unit of output basis. Increased labor costs were attributable to increased employee counts and increased wages at certain mining operations. Mancounts have been increased in certain locations to maintain development rates ahead of the longwall mining units. Labor rates were increased in order to stay competitive in certain labor markets. Increased contract mining fees were attributable to increased fees negotiated with the contractors used primarily in our central Appalachian operations. Increased other post employment benefits were primarily due to the impact of cost increases for medical and drug benefits. Increased produced coal costs of goods sold was also due to higher sales volumes in the 2005 period compared to the 2004 period. These increases in costs were offset, in part, by reduced Combined Fund premiums related to a premium differential that was paid in the 2004 period. Also, CONSOL Energy currently anticipates that the 1992 Fund premiums will increase approximately $4 million for the plan year beginning January 1, 2006. Due to the recent insured losses at our mines, property and business interruption insurance coverage may be difficult to renew at the current pricing levels and terms. Purchased coal cost of goods sold and other charges increased in the period to period comparison. 2005 2004 Variance PercentageChange Purchased Tons Sold (in millions) 1.6 2.1 (0.5 ) (23.8 )% Average Cost of Goods Sold and Other Charges Per Ton $ 54.34 $ 36.34 $ 18.00 49.5 % 58 Table of Contents The higher average cost of purchased coal is primarily due to overall increases in prices for domestic coals, offset by reduced volumes of purchased coal sold. Gas cost of goods sold and other charges increased due primarily to increased unit costs. 2005 2004 Variance PercentageChange Gas Sales Volumes (in billion gross cubic feet) 54.4 54.6 (0.2 ) (0.4 )% Average Cost Per Thousand Cubic Feet $ 2.13 $ 1.93 $ 0.20 10.4 % The increase in average cost per thousand cubic feet of gas sold was primarily attributable to increased royalty expense, offset, in part by changes in imbalance amounts. Royalty expense increased approximately $0.07 per thousand cubic feet in the 2005 period compared to the 2004 period primarily due to the 19.0% increase in average sales price per thousand cubic feet in the same periods. Additionally, the average cost per thousand cubic feet of gas sold increased due to a $0.03 increase per thousand cubic feet of gas sold related to the purchase of firm transportation capacity on the Columbia interstate pipeline because of potential curtailments on portions of shipment capacity allocated to CONSOL Energy as a result of increased demand for pipeline access in the 2005 period. Cost per unit increased $0.01 per thousand cubic feet of gas sold due to higher well maintenance fees. These fees have increased due to more wells being serviced in 2005. The increase in average unit costs was also due to an increase of approximately $0.02 per thousand cubic feet in the period to period comparison due to changes in the gas imbalance amounts. Because contracted quantities of gas delivered to the pipeline rarely equal physical deliveries to customers, CONSOL Energy is responsible for monitoring this imbalance and requesting adjustments to contracted volumes as circumstances warrant. The increase in imbalance cost per unit sold was offset by corresponding increases in gas sales revenue. In addition, unit costs increased $0.02 per thousand cubic feet due to additional power expense as a result of converting several compressors from gas powered to electric powered in the 2005 period. An increase of $0.05 per thousand cubic feet was attributable to various costs which were incurred throughout both periods, none of which were individually material. In connection with the purchase of firm transportation capacity on the Columbia pipeline, we purchased from and sold to other gas suppliers, which increased our revenues and our costs. CONSOL Energy believes this type of transaction may continue as a result of increased capacity demands on the Columbia pipeline. The 2004 period included a smaller volume of firm transportation activity as we did not begin to purchase this capacity until May of 2004. Purchased gas information is as follows: 2005 2004 Variance PercentageChange Purchased Gas Sales Volumes (in billion gross cubic feet) 28.7 17.5 11.2 64.0 % Average Cost Per Thousand Cubic Feet $ 9.71 $ 6.45 $ 3.26 50.5 % Industrial supplies cost of goods sold have increased $11 million primarily due to higher sales volumes. Closed and idle mine cost of goods sold was $3 million lower in the 2005 period compared to the 2004 period primarily due to lower workers compensation expense. Workers compensation expense related to closed and idled locations has decreased $9 million primarily due to the actuarial effects of several law changes in the state of West Virginia related to workers compensation. Lower expense was also due to Emery being active for all of the 2005 period compared to being idled for most of the 2004 period. Other reductions in closed and idle mine cost of goods sold were due to various transactions that occurred throughout both periods, none of which were individually material. These improvements were offset, in part, by higher expenses related to mine closing, perpetual care water treatment and reclamation liability adjustments that were a result of updated engineering surveys. Survey adjustments resulted in $10 million of additional expense in the 2005 period for closed and idled locations compared to the results of the survey adjustments in the 2004 period. 59 Table of Contents Miscellaneous cost of goods sold and other charges increased due to the following items: 2005 2004 DollarVariance PercentageChange Incentive compensation $ 35 $ 25 $ 10 40.0 % Buchanan Mine fire 34 34 100.0 % Buchanan skip hoist accident 3 3 100.0 % Sales contract buy outs 13 9 4 44.4 % Bank fees 12 12 % Litigation settlements and contingencies 10 4 6 150.0 % Coal Property holding costs 10 5 5 100.0 % Stock based compensation expense 4 1 3 300.0 % Accounts receivable securitization fees 2 2 % Other post employee benefit curtailment gain (3 ) 3 100.0 % Buckeye landfill superfund site liability transfer (1 ) 1 100.0 % Miscellaneous transactions 43 30 13 43.3 % Total Miscellaneous Cost of Goods Sold and Other Charges $ 166 $ 84 $ 82 97.6 % Incentive compensation expense increased due to an increase in the projected amount expected to be paid out to employees for the 2005 period compared to the 2004. The incentive compensation program is designed to increase compensation to eligible employees when CONSOL Energy reaches predetermined earnings targets and the employees reach predetermined performance targets. CONSOL Energys Buchanan Mine, located near Keen Mountain, Virginia, experienced a large rock fall behind our longwall mining section on February 14, 2005. While caving behind the longwall is a normal part of the mining process, the size of this cave in created a large air pressure wave that disrupted ventilation and also caused an ignition of methane gas in the area. CONSOL Energy temporarily sealed the mine in order to extinguish the fire that developed after the ignition. Various materials, including nitrogen foam and water were pumped into the mine in order to accelerate the process of creating an inert environment within the mine to extinguish the fire. Coal production resumed on June 16, 2005. Costs of goods sold incurred, net of expected insurance recovery, for the year ended December 31, 2005 were $34 million. The Buchanan Mine was idled on September 16, 2005 following a problem with the mines skip hoist mechanism. Repairs to the skip hoist shaft and structures were completed and the mine resumed production on December 13, 2005. Expenses of approximately $3 million related to the damaged area were incurred during this time frame. Also, approximately $7 million were capitalized related to the installation and replacement of equipment and facilities damaged in the accident. We plan to file property damage and business interruption claims related to this incident. As of December 31, 2005, no insurance receivables have been recognized for these anticipated claims. In the 2005 and 2004 periods, agreements were made to buy out sales contracts with several customers in order to release tons committed under lower priced contracts for sale to other customers at higher pricing. Bank fees remained consistent in the period to period comparison. Litigation settlements and contingencies increased in the 2005 period compared to the 2004 period. The increase is attributable to a proposed settlement agreement with certain lessors in western Kentucky which would require the transfer of certain properties and permits, as well as a cash payment to the lessors, with the lessors assuming all reclamation liability for the mine property which is being transferred. Various other contingencies were incurred in both periods, none of which were individually material. Coal property holding costs increased in the 2005 period primarily due to leasehold surrenders that occurred in 2005. 60 Table of Contents In April 2004, CONSOL Energy began to issue restricted stock units as part of its equity incentive plan. Compensation cost for the restricted stock units is based upon the closing share price at the date of grant and is recognized over the vesting period of the units. The increase in stock based compensation expense in the 2005 period is due to compensation cost for the 2004 grants being recognized for the full 2005 period as well as additional compensation costs for restricted stock unit grants that occurred in the 2005 period. Accounts receivable securitization fees remained consistent in the period to period comparison. Due to the restructuring that occurred in December 2003, a curtailment gain related to the other post employment benefit plan of approximately $3 million was recognized in the 2004 period. Due to CONSOL Energys measurement date being September 30, the gain was not able to be recognized in the financial statements until the quarter ended March 31, 2004. In April 2004, CONSOL Energy entered into an Environmental Liability Transfer and Indemnity Agreement that transferred our liability related to the Buckeye Landfill Superfund Site to another party. In 1991, CONSOL Energy was named a potentially responsible party related to the Buckeye Landfill Superfund Site and accordingly recognized an estimated liability for remediation of this site. The Transfer and Indemnity transaction resulted in the reversal of the remaining liability and the recognition of approximately $1 million of income. Miscellaneous cost of goods sold and other charges increased $13 million due to various miscellaneous transactions that occurred throughout both periods, none of which were individually material. Freight expense is based on weight of coal shipped, negotiated freight rates and method of transportation (i.e., rail, barge, truck, etc.) used for the customers to whom CONSOL Energy contractually provides transportation. Freight expense is billed to customers and the revenue from such billing equals the transportation expense. 2005 2004 Dollar Variance Percentage Change Freight expense $ 120 $ 110 $ 10 9.1 % Selling, general and administrative costs have increased due to the following items: 2005 2004 Dollar Variance Percentage Change Professional consulting and other purchased services $ 20 $ 14 $ 6 42.9 % Wages and salaries 27 25 2 8.0 % Other 34 34 % Total Selling, General and Administrative $ 81 $ 73 $ 8 11.0 % Costs of professional consulting and other purchased services were higher in the 2005 period compared to the 2004 period primarily due to services provided related to various corporate initiatives. Wages and salaries have increased in the 2005 period due to additional employees hired in 2005. 61 Table of Contents Depreciation, depletion and amortization decreased due to the following items: 2005 2004 Dollar Variance Percentage Change Coal $ 214 $ 234 $ (20 ) (8.5 )% Gas: Production 23 22 1 4.5 % Gathering 12 11 1 9.1 % Total Gas 35 33 2 6.1 % Other 13 13 % Total Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization $ 262 $ 280 $ (18 ) (6.4 )% The decrease in coal depreciation, depletion and amortization was primarily attributable to the acceleration of approximately $32 million of depreciation for equipment and facilities at Rend Lake and other idle mines in the 2004 period. CONSOL Energys management reviewed the assets at these idled locations in conjunction with changes in mine plans for these locations. No plan of use for these items was determined. These pieces of equipment and facilities were considered abandoned and estimated useful lives were adjusted accordingly. Rend Lake and the other idled locations have existing coal reserves that may be accessed through new facilities or from other active locations. This decrease was offset, in part, by additional equipment being placed in service at active locations, such as McElroy Mine, Bailey Mine and Enlow Mine, after the 2004 period. Increases were also attributable to expansion projects, such as McElroy and Bailey refuse area and plant expansion, that were completed and in service in the 2005 period. The increase in gas production depreciation, depletion and amortization was primarily due to higher unit of production rates in the 2005 period compared to the 2004 period. Rates are generally calculated using the net book value of assets at the end of the year divided by proven developed reserves. Gathering depreciation, depletion and amortization is recorded on the straight line method and increased due to additional assets coming on line in 2005. Interest expense decreased in the 2005 period compared to the 2004 period. 2005 2004 Dollar Variance Percentage Change Short term borrowings $ $ 4 $ (4 ) (100.0 )% 12 year and 15 year secured notes 24 25 (1 ) (4.0 )% Other 3 2 1 50.0 % Total Interest Expense $ 27 $ 31 $ (4 ) (12.9 )% Interest expense decreased primarily due to a reduction in the weighted average outstanding balance under short term borrowings in the 2005 period compared to the 2004 period. The weighted average outstanding balance was approximately $7 million in the 2005 period compared to $74 million in the 2004 period. The decrease in interest expense related to the 12 year and 15 year secured notes is attributable to the scheduled long term debt payment of $45 million for the 12 year secured note in June 2004. Other interest expense increased due to reduced amounts of interest capitalized in the 2005 period compared to the 2004 period. The reduced capitalized interest was attributable to the lower level of capital projects funded from operating cash flow, primarily due to the completion of the McElroy expansion project. 62 Table of Contents Taxes other than income increased primarily due to the following items: 2005 2004 Dollar Variance Percentage Change Production taxes: Coal $ 145 $ 122 $ 23 18.9 % Gas 10 9 1 11.1 % Total Production Taxes 155 131 24 18.3 % Other taxes: Coal 62 58 4 6.9 % Gas 4 4 Other 8 5 3 60.0 % Other 74 67 7 10.4 % Total Taxes Other Than Income $ 229 $ 198 $ 31 15.7 % Increased coal production taxes are primarily due to higher severance taxes and higher black lung excise taxes attributable to higher coal volumes and higher average sales price. Increased gas production taxes are primarily due to higher severance taxes attributable to higher average sales price for gas. Other coal taxes and other taxes have increased due primarily to increased franchise taxes related to the sale of 18.5% interest in CNX Gas. Other coal taxes have also increased due to lower miscellaneous tax credits from the state of Virginia, which are based on tonnage produced in that state. Due to Buchanan Mine production being idled from mid September to mid December 2005, Virginia based production for the fourth quarter 2005 was lower than production for the fourth quarter 2004. Income Taxes 2005 2004 Variance Percentage Change Earnings Before Income Taxes $ 655 $ 83 $ 572 689.2 % Tax Expense (Benefit) $ 64 $ (33 ) $ 97 293.9 % Effective Income Tax Rate 9.8 % (39.5 )% 49.3 % CONSOL Energys effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2005 was impacted by the gain of $327 million resulting from the sale of 18.5% interest in CNX Gas stock, as previously discussed. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, no deferred tax has been provided on this transaction as current tax law provides a means by which the excess of the reported amount of this investment over its tax basis can be recovered tax free. Also, management has no current intention of entering into a transaction that would cause CNX Gas to leave the consolidated tax group. CONSOL Energys effective tax rate is also sensitive to changes in the relationship between pre tax earnings and percentage depletion. See Note 8 Income Taxes to the consolidated financial statements included in this form 10 K for additional information. Minority interest represents the 18.5% of CNX Gas net income which CONSOL Energy does not own. Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle Effective January 1, 2004, CONSOL Energy changed our method of accounting for workers compensation. Prior to the change, CONSOL Energy recorded our workers compensation liability on an undiscounted basis. Under the new method, CONSOL Energy recorded our liability on a discounted actuarial basis, using various 63 Table of Contents assumptions, including discount rate and future cost trends. We believe this actuarial approach is more explicit in its methodology, which should lead to better estimates of the liability and related periodic costs. The change is also preferable because it aligns the accounting with our other long term employee benefit obligations, which are recorded on a discounted basis. Additionally, it provides a better comparison with our industry peers, the majority of which record the workers compensation liability on a discounted basis. As a result of the change, CONSOL Energy reduced our workers compensation liability by $136 million and reduced the related deferred tax asset by $53 million. The cumulative effect adjustment recognized upon adoption was a gain of $83 million, net of a tax cost of approximately $53 million. Results of Operations Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2004 compared with Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2003 (Amounts reported in millions) Net Income Net income changed primarily due to the following items: 2004 2003 DollarVariance PercentageChange Coal Sales Produced and Purchased $ 2,087 $ 1,758 $ 329 18.7 % Gas Sales Produced 275 208 67 32.2 % Gas Sales Purchased 112 112 100.0 % Other Sales and other income 303 256 47 18.4 % Total Revenue and other income 2,777 2,222 555 25.0 % Coal Cost of Goods Sold Produced and Purchased 1,533 1,310 223 17.0 % Produced Gas Cost of Goods Sold 105 84 21 25.0 % Purchased Gas Cost of Goods Sold 113 113 100.0 % Other Cost of Goods Sold 250 230 20 8.7 % Total Cost of Goods Sold 2,001 1,624 377 23.2 % Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization 280 242 38 15.7 % Taxes Other Than Income 198 160 38 23.8 % Other 215 230 (15 ) (6.5 )% Total Costs 2,694 2,256 438 19.4 % Earnings (Loss) before income tax and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 83 (34 ) 117 344.1 % Income Taxes 33 21 12 57.1 % Earnings (Loss) before Cumulative effect of change in accounting 116 (13 ) 129 992.3 % Cumulative effect of change in accounting 83 5 78 1,560.0 % Net Income (Loss) $ 199 $ (8 ) $ 207 2,587.5 % Net income for 2004 was improved due to increased coal and gas sales volumes and increased average sales prices for both coal and gas. Pre tax earnings also improved $21 million due to the recognition of the favorable effects of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 as of March 8, 2004 in accordance with accounting guidance. Also, net income was improved $14 million due to the gain on sale of the stock of CONSOL Energys wholly owned subsidiary, CNX Australia Pty Limited, to certain affiliates of AMCI, Inc. In addition, net income improved due to an increased tax benefit related to the release of $15 million of contingent income tax liabilities resulting from the settlement of the federal, state and foreign income tax audits of prior years. Also, an additional $83 million of income from the cumulative effect of change in accounting 64 Table of Contents related to workers compensation was recognized in 2004 compared to $5 million of income for mine closing, perpetual care and gas well closing costs recognized in 2003. These increases in net income were offset, in part, by higher cost of goods sold attributable to higher sales volumes of coal and gas and to higher unit costs for coal and gas produced. Higher cost per ton of coal produced was due mainly to increased labor, supply and Combined Fund premiums per unit produced. Higher cost of gas produced was attributable to increased royalty cost and cost of firm transportation incurred by the gas operations. Increases in net income were also offset, in part, by $32 million of accelerated depreciation, depletion and amortization taken for equipment and facilities at Rend Lake and other idled mining operations. While there are no current plans for the use of the equipment or facilities, these mines have existing reserves that could be accessed from other locations or through new facilities. Revenue Revenue and other income increased due to the following items: 2004 2003 DollarVariance PercentageChange Sales Produced Coal $ 2,008 $ 1,683 $ 325 Produced Coal Related Party 1 (1 ) Total Produced Coal 2,008 1,684 324 19.2 % Purchased Coal 79 74 5 6.8 % Produced Gas 275 208 67 32.2 % Purchased Gas 112 112 100.0 % Industrial Supplies 79 63 16 25.4 % Other 27 14 13 92.9 % Total Sales 2,580 2,043 537 26.3 % Freight Revenue 110 114 (4 ) Freight Related Party 1 (1 ) Total Freight 110 115 (5 ) (4.3 )% Other Income 87 64 23 35.9 % Total Revenue and Other Income $ 2,777 $ 2,222 555 25.0 % The increase in Company produced coal sales revenue was due mainly to higher volumes sold during the period to period comparison and an increase in average sales price per ton. 2004 2003 Variance PercentageChange Produced Tons Sold (in millions) 67.3 60.9 6.4 10.5 % Average Sales Price Per Ton $ 29.84 $ 27.67 $ 2.17 7.8 % The increase in tons sold was due primarily to the Loveridge Mine resuming production in March 2004 and increased production at the McElroy Mine. Loveridge experienced a fire in February 2003 while it was in the process of developing a new underground area and therefore it had no production in 2003. McElroy production increased due to the addition of a second longwall mining unit during 2004 and improved mining conditions compared to 2003. The increase in company produced coal sales revenue was also attributable to the increase in average sales price per ton sold. The increase in average sales price reflects stronger prices negotiated in 2003 and an overall improvement in 2004 prices in the eastern coal market for coals sold to domestic and foreign utilities and for metallurgical coal. 65 Table of Contents The increase in Company purchased coal sales revenue was due to higher average sales price per ton of purchased coal, offset, in part, by a decrease in tons of purchased coal sold. 2004 2003 Variance Percentage Change Purchased Tons Sold (in millions) 2.1 2.4 (0.3 ) (12.5 )% Average Sales Price Per Ton $ 37.60 $ 31.16 $ 6.44 20.7 % The increased average sales price is primarily due to some of the purchased coal tons being sold in higher priced export and metallurgical markets. Increased revenue from higher average sales prices were offset by lower sales volumes in 2004 compared to 2003. The increase in gas sales revenue was primarily due to a higher average sales price per thousand cubic feet and increased volumes sold in 2004 compared to 2003. 2004 2003 Variance PercentageChange Produced Gas Gross Sales Volumes (in billion cubic feet) 54.6 50.0 4.6 9.2 % Average Sales Price Per thousand cubic feet $ 5.04 $ 4.16 $ 0.88 21.2 % We believe that the 2004 gas market price increases were largely driven by continued concerns over levels of North American gas production, as well as increased oil prices and the economic recovery which resulted in greater electricity use in our principal markets. CONSOL Energy enters into various physical gas supply transactions with both gas marketers and end users for terms varying in length. CONSOL Energy has also entered into various gas swap transactions that qualify as financial cash flow hedges. These gas swap transactions exist parallel to the underlying physical transactions. In 2004, these financial cash flow hedges represented 28% of our produced gas sales volumes at an average price of $5.10 per thousand cubic feet. We currently intend to cover approximately 17% of our estimated 2005 production volume with gas swap transactions. CONSOL Energy sold 84% of its produced gas sales volumes in 2004 under fixed priced contracts at an average price of $4.96 per thousand cubic feet compared to 90% of its gas sales volumes under fixed price contracts in 2003 at an average price of $3.99 per thousand cubic feet. Higher sales volumes in 2004 were a result of wells coming on line from the ongoing drilling program, which allowed CONSOL Energy to take advantage of increased prices. CONSOL has entered into fixed price gas sales contracts with various marketers, representing approximately 63% of total projected 2005 production, at an average price of $4.78/mcf in order to manage price fluctuations and achieve more predictable cash flows. Due to the potential curtailment on portions of the shipment capacity allocated to CONSOL Energy as a result of increased demand for pipeline use on the Columbias interstate gas pipeline, referred to as the pipeline, CONSOL Energy purchased firm transportation capacity on the pipeline during 2004. The first firm transportation arrangement covered the May 2004 through October 2004 period. In November 2004, CONSOL Energy entered into an extended firm transportation arrangement for fixed capacity on the pipeline to offset a portion of the expected impact from the estimated curtailments. This arrangement covers the November 2004 through October 2006 period. As of February 2005, the purchased fixed capacity on the pipeline represents approximately 35% of our projected production for the same period. In addition, in order to satisfy obligations to certain customers, we purchased gas from and sold gas to other gas suppliers, which increased our revenues and our costs. 2004 2003 Variance PercentageChange Purchased Gas Sales Volumes (in billion cubic feet) 17.5 17.5 100.0 % Average Sales Price Per thousand cubic feet $ 6.39 $ 6.39 100.0 % The increase in revenues from the sale of industrial supplies was due to increased sales volumes and prices. 66 Table of Contents The increase in other sales is primarily attributable to higher through put of outside coal volumes through our Baltimore terminal. Freight revenue, outside and related party, is based on weight of coal shipped, negotiated freight rates and method of transportation (i.e., rail, barge, truck, etc.) used for the customers to which CONSOL Energy contractually provides transportation services. Freight revenue is the amount billed to customers for transportation costs incurred. Other income consists of interest income, gain or loss on the disposition of assets, equity in earnings of affiliates, service income, royalty income, derivative gains and losses, rental income and miscellaneous income. 2004 2003 DollarVariance PercentageChange Gain on Sale of Assets $ 41 $ 23 $ 18 78.3 % Royalty Income 19 16 3 18.8 % Harbor Maintenance Fee Refund 3 (3 ) (100.0 )% Equity in Loss of Affiliates (4 ) (9 ) 5 55.6 % Other Miscellaneous 31 31 Total Other Revenue $ 87 $ 64 $ 23 35.9 % The 2004 gain on sale of assets is due mainly to CONSOL Energys sale of stock in its wholly owned subsidiary, CNX Australia Pty Limited, to certain affiliates of AMCI, Inc. for $28 million. Certain affiliates of AMCI, Inc. also assumed approximately $21 million of debt, and associated interest rate swaps and foreign currency hedges. CNX Australia Pty Limited, through its wholly owned subsidiary CONSOL Energy Australia Pty Limited, owned a 50% interest in the Glennies Creek Mine in New South Wales, Australia with its joint venture partner Maitland Main Collieries Pty Limited, an affiliate of AMCI, Inc. The sale was completed on February 25, 2004 and resulted in a pre tax gain of approximately $14 million. The gain on sale of assets in 2004 is also related to the assignment of certain coal leases, conveyance of associated surface property, the transfer of related mining permits and the related liabilities for a location in southern West Virginia that resulted in a pre tax gain of approximately $7 million. The additional gain on sale of assets in 2004 is related to the sale of several previously closed operations and the sale of surplus equipment. The 2003 gain on sale of assets primarily was related to the expiration in 2003 of an option granted to a third party to purchase property for which CONSOL Energy received nonrefundable proceeds of $5 million and gains from the sale of surplus equipment. Royalty income has increased due primarily to third parties producing additional tonnage and gas volumes from CONSOL owned property in the period to period comparison. Other income for 2003 included a $3 million harbor maintenance fee refund received from the federal government for prior claims related to harbor maintenance fees imposed by the Federal statute that was subsequently declared unconstitutional. These claims were pursued since 1991, and we do not expect other refunds related to these claims. 67 Table of Contents The improvement in equity losses of affiliates is primarily attributable to CONSOL Energys equity interest in the losses of Glennies Creek mine in 2003. CONSOL Energys interest in this mine was sold in February 2004. Costs 2004 2003 DollarVariance PercentageChange Cost of Goods Sold and Other Charges: Produced Coal $ 1,457 $ 1,238 $ 219 17.7 % Purchased Coal 76 72 4 5.6 % Produced Gas 105 84 21 25.0 % Purchased Gas 113 113 100.0 % Industrial Supplies 94 66 28 42.4 % Closed and Idle Mines 72 62 10 16.1 % Other 84 102 (18 ) (17.6 )% Total Cost of Goods Sold $ 2,001 $ 1,624 $ 377 23.2 % Increased cost of goods sold and other charges for company produced coal was due mainly to the increased produced tons sold and an increase in the average cost per ton of produced coal sold. 2004 2003 Variance PercentageChange Produced Tons Sold (in millions) 67.3 60.9 6.4 10.5 % Average Cost of Goods Sold and Other Charges Per Ton $ 21.64 $ 20.34 $ 1.30 6.4 % Produced tons sold increased due primarily to the Loveridge Mine resuming production in March 2004 and increased production at the McElroy Mine. Loveridge experienced a fire in February 2003 while it was in the process of developing a new underground area and therefore this location had no production in 2003. McElroy production increased due to the addition of a second longwall mining unit during 2004 and improved mining conditions compared to 2003. Several other mines increased production in 2004 compared with 2003. Average cost of goods sold and other charges per ton also increased in 2004 compared to 2003. This increase was attributable to higher supply costs and labor per unit produced. Increased supply costs were related to the higher costs of materials, especially metal products, used in the mining process experienced in 2004 compared to 2003. Increased labor and supply costs were also attributable to additional continuous miner shifts in 2004. Continuous mining machines are used to mine the coal reserve in such a way that large, rectangular blocks of coal, called panels, are delineated underground in preparation for mining by larger more efficient longwall machines in mines equipped with these systems. Typically, mines attempt to delineate more than one panel in advance so that as the longwall machine completes the extraction of the coal in one panel, it can move without delay to another prepared panel. Continuous mining machines are more labor intensive and use more supplies per ton of coal produced than longwall mining systems. Also, CONSOL Energy production from non longwall mines required additional continuous mining machine shifts to maintain prior year production levels at these locations. Increased average cost per ton was also due to increased Combined Fund premiums related to a premium differential announced by the Social Security Administration for the past eleven plan years for beneficiaries assigned to CONSOL Energy. The increase was approximately $28 million for the plan year beginning October 1, 2003, of which all has been expensed from October 1, 2003 through September 30, 2004. Approximately $21 million of expense was recognized in 2004. These increases in costs per ton were offset, in part, by reduced other post employment benefits due to the recognition of the effects of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 in 2004. 68 Table of Contents Purchased coal cost of goods sold and other charges increased due primarily to higher average cost per ton, offset, in part, by reduced volumes of purchased coal sold. 2004 2003 Variance PercentageChange Purchased Tons Sold (in millions) 2.1 2.4 (0.3 ) (12.5 )% Average Cost of Goods Sold and Other Charges Per Ton $ 36.34 $ 30.31 $ 6.03 19.9 % The increase in cost of goods sold and other charges for purchased coal was primarily due to higher average cost per ton of purchased coal sold in 2004 compared to 2003. The increase in the average cost of purchased coal is primarily due to increased market prices for export and metallurgical coal. The increase in cost of goods sold and other charges was offset, in part, due to a slight decrease in volume of purchased coal sold. Produced gas cost of goods sold and other charges increased due to increased average cost per thousand cubic feet sold and increased volumes. 2004 2003 Variance PercentageChange Produced Gas Gross Sales Volumes (in billion cubic feet) 54.6 50.0 4.6 9.2 % Average Cost Per Thousand cubic feet $ 1.93 $ 1.69 $ 0.24 14.2 % The increase in average cost per thousand cubic feet of gas sold was attributable to a $0.21 increase per thousand cubic feet in royalty expense. Royalty expense increased primarily due to the 21.2% increase in average sales price per thousand cubic feet in 2004 compared to 2003. Average cost per thousand cubic feet of gas sold also increased approximately $0.08 related to the purchase of firm transportation capacity on the Columbias interstate pipeline because of potential curtailments on portions of the shipment capacity allocated to CONSOL Energy as a result of increased demand for pipeline. CONSOL Energy purchased firm transportation capacity on the pipeline from the May 2004 through October 2004 period to assure firm pipeline capacity of our projected production. In November 2004, CONSOL Energy entered into an extended firm transportation arrangement for use on the pipeline. This arrangement covers November 2004 through October 2006. The purchased fixed capacity on the pipeline represents approximately 35% of our projected production for the same period. These increases were offset, in part, by various reduced costs in 2004, none of which were individually material. Cost of goods sold and other charges for produced gas also increase due to increased sales volume in 2004 as a result of wells coming on line from the ongoing drilling program. In addition, in order to satisfy obligations to certain customers, we purchased from and sold to other gas suppliers, which increased our revenues and our costs. We believe this type of transaction will continue as a result of increased capacity demands on the Columbia pipeline. 2004 2003 Variance PercentageChange Purchased Gas Sales Volumes (in billion cubic feet) 17.5 17.5 100.0 % Average Cost Per Thousand Cubic Feet $ 6.45 $ 6.45 100.0 % Industrial supplies cost of goods sold increased due to higher sales volumes and higher unit costs of goods sold. Closed and idle mine costs were $72 million in 2004 compared to $62 million in 2003. The increase in cost reflects mine closing, perpetual care water treatment and reclamation liability adjustments as a result of updated engineering surveys. Survey adjustments resulted in $3 million of expense in 2004 for closed and idled locations. Closed and idle mine cost also increased approximately $10 million due to the change in calculation of workers compensation claims. Effective January 1, 2004, CONSOL Energy changed its method of accounting for workers compensation. Under the new method, the undiscounted liability is actuarially calculated based on 69 Table of Contents claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported. Additionally, the workers compensation liability is recorded on a discounted basis, which has been actuarially determined using various assumptions. Approximately $3 million of the increased closed and idle workers compensation increase is related to interest accretion. The increase in closed and idle mine cost was offset by a decrease of $6 million related to the idled Rend Lake mine. Rend Lake mine has been idle since July 2002. Closed and idle mine cost of goods sold and other charges was also impaired by approximately $3 million due to various miscellaneous transactions that occurred throughout both periods, none of which was individually material. Miscellaneous cost of goods sold and other charges decreased due to the following items: 2004 2003 DollarVariance PercentageChange Loveridge fire $ $ 17 $ (17 ) (100.0 )% Mine 84 fire 5 (5 ) (100.0 )% Supply inventory write downs 5 (5 ) (100.0 )% Other post employee benefit curtailment gain (3 ) (3 ) (100.0 )% Cardinal River severance and pension cost 2 (2 ) (100.0 )% Buckeye landfill superfund site liability transfer (1 ) (1 ) (100.0 )% Litigation settlements and Contingencies 4 17 (13 ) (76.5 )% Incentive compensation 25 25 100.0 % Sales contract buy outs 9 1 8 800.0 % Miscellaneous transactions 50 55 (5 ) (9.1 )% Total Miscellaneous Cost of Goods Sold and Other Charges $ 84 $ 102 $ (18 ) (17.6 )% In February 2003, Loveridge Mine experienced a fire near the bottom of the slope entry that is used to carry coal from the mine to the surface. The cost of goods sold and other charges related to extinguishing the fire was approximately $17 million and other expenses related to the fire were approximately $3 million, net of expected insurance recovery. In late December 2002, the mine had begun the process of developing a new underground area that would be mined with longwall mining equipment that was expected to be installed later in 2003. The fire delayed this installation until March of 2004. In January 2003, Mine 84 experienced a fire along several hundred feet of the conveyor belt entry servicing the longwall section of the mine. The fire was extinguished approximately two weeks later. On January 20, 2003, the mine resumed production on a limited basis with continuous mining machines, while repairs continued on the belt entry. The fire caused damage to the roof support system, the conveyor belt and the steel framework on which the belt travels. Repairs took several weeks to complete and were estimated to cost approximately $7 million, net of expected insurance recovery, of which $5 million was attributable to cost of goods sold and other related charges and $2 million to other expenses. Longwall coal production, which accounts for the majority of coal normally produced at the mine resumed on February 10, 2003. Supply inventory write downs reflect adjustments made in 2003 to supply inventories that are unique to the equipment used at Dilworth and Rend Lake mines where the mining activities have ceased. Due to the restructuring that occurred in December 2003, a curtailment gain related to the other post employment benefit plan of approximately $3 million was recognized in 2004. Due to CONSOL Energys measurement date being September 30, the gain was not recognized until the quarter ended March 31, 2004. Cardinal River Mine severance and pension accruals are attributable to the costs for which CONSOL Energy remains responsible following the sale of the mines assets. Accordingly, in 2003, CONSOL Energy recognized the cost estimate of these plans. 70 Table of Contents In April 2004, CONSOL Energy entered into an Environmental Liability Transfer and Indemnity Agreement that transferred our liability related to the Buckeye Landfill Superfund Site to another party. In 1991 CONSOL Energy was named a potentially responsible party related to the Buckeye Landfill Superfund Site and accordingly recognized our estimated liability for remediation of this site. The Transfer and Indemnity transaction resulted in the reversal of the remaining liability and the recognition of approximately $1 million of income. Litigation settlements and contingencies decreased due to various contingent loss accruals related to asbestos, waste management and various other contingencies in both periods, none of which are individually material. Incentive compensation expense increased in 2004 compared to 2003 due mainly to the level of earnings achieved in 2004 compared to projected 2004 annual results. The incentive compensation package is designed to increase compensation to eligible employees when CONSOL Energy reaches predetermined earnings targets and the employees reach predetermined performance targets. There was no incentive compensation expense in 2003 due to CONSOL Energy not achieving predetermined earnings targets. In 2004, agreements were made with several customers in order to release tons committed under lower priced contracts for sale to other customers at higher pricing. Cost of goods sold and other charges also decreased $5 million due to various miscellaneous transactions which occurred throughout both periods, none of which was individually material. Freight expense is based on weight of coal shipped, negotiated freight rates and method of transportation (i.e., rail, barge, truck, etc) used for the customers to whom CONSOL Energy contractually provides transportation. Freight expense is billed to customers and the revenue from such billing equals the transportation expense. 2004 2003 DollarVariance PercentageChange Freight expense $ 110 $ 115 $ (5 ) (4.3 )% Selling, general and administrative costs have decreased due to the following items: 2004 2003 DollarVariance PercentageChange Wages and salaries $ 25 $ 29 $ (4 ) (13.8 )% Other post employment and pension costs 8 11 (3 ) (27.3 )% Professional consulting and other purchased services 14 15 (1 ) (6.7 )% Commissions 7 5 2 40.0 % Insurance 3 2 1 50.0 % Other 16 16 Total Selling, General and Administrative $ 73 $ 78 $ (5 ) (6.4 )% Wages and salaries for selling, general and administrative have decreased primarily due to the December 2003 reduction in workforce program. The reduction program was primarily focused on reducing the number of positions in the selling, general and administrative areas to better align with CONSOL Energys current business strategy. The program reduced approximately 100 positions. The decreases in expense as a result of these reductions were offset, in part, by the completion of the integrated information technology system provided by SAP AG in August 2003. Prior to the completion, wages and salaries for dedicated staff were capitalized as a component of the cost of the implementation project and are being amortized over seven years. The wages capitalized for 2003 were approximately $2 million. 71 Table of Contents Costs related to other post employment benefits in 2004 have decreased from 2003 due to the recognition of the effects of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 in 2004. Professional consulting and other purchased services has decreased in 2004 primarily due to lower software support services, offset, in part, by professional and consulting services provided in relation to reviewing employee benefit plans and compensation packages provided by CONSOL Energy. Costs for coal commissions increased due to entering into an additional sales agreement in 2004 that requires commissions to be paid. Insurance costs increased primarily due to the cost of director and officer insurance costs incurred in 2004. For a portion of 2003, CONSOL Energy directors and officers were previously insured under the RWE AG general liability policy. Depreciation, depletion and amortization has increased due to the following items: 2004 2003 DollarVariance PercentageChange Coal $ 233 $ 196 $ 37 18.9 % Gas Production 23 23 Gathering 10 10 Total Gas 33 33 Other 14 13 1 7.7 % Total Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization $ 280 $ 242 $ 38 15.7 % The increase in coal depreciation, depletion and amortization was primarily attributable to the acceleration of approximately $32 million of depreciation for equipment and facilities at the Rend Lake and other idle mines. CONSOL Energys management reviewed the condition of the assets at these idle locations and determined no plan of use for these items, and therefore abandoned the facilities. These facilities have existing coal reserves that may be accessed from other locations or through new facilities. Gas depreciation, depletion and amortization was consistent in both 2004 and 2003. Production assets are depreciated using the units of production method. Units of production depreciation was based on higher gas volumes, offset by a lower rate due to increased reserve figures at January 1, 2004 compared to January 1, 2003. Gathering assets are depreciated using the straight line method and their depreciation did not change in the period to period comparison. The increase in other depreciation, depletion and amortization was primarily due to additional depreciation on the integrated information technology system installed to support business processes. The system was implemented in stages beginning in January 2001 and was substantially complete in August 2003. Interest expense has decreased primarily due to the following items: 2004 2003 DollarVariance PercentageChange Revolving Credit Facility and Commercial Paper $ 4 $ 2 2 100.0 % Long term Debt 32 34 (2 ) (5.9 )% Other (5 ) (2 ) (3 ) (150.0 )% Total Interest Expense $ 31 $ 34 $ (3 ) (8.8 )% 72 Table of Contents Interest expense on commercial paper and the borrowings under the revolving credit facility increased primarily due to the weighted average interest rate of 5.25% per annum in 2004 compared to 2.34% in 2003. The increase was offset, in part, by a reduction of $15 million in the weighted average amount of outstanding borrowings in 2004 compared to 2003. Until July 2003, CONSOL Energys borrowings principally were in the form of commercial paper, which bears a lower interest rate than bank borrowings. As of July 2003, CONSOL Energy was no longer able to participate as a seller of commercial paper due to Standard and Poors lowering its rating of our short term debt. The decrease in long term debt interest expense also reflected the scheduled payment of $45 million principal amount of debt in June 2004. Other interest expense was reduced primarily due to the increase in the amount of interest capitalized in 2004 as a result of the higher level of capital projects funded from operating cash flows in 2004. Taxes other than income has increased primarily due to the following items: 2004 2003 DollarVariance PercentageChange Production taxes: Coal $ 123 $ 98 $ 25 25.5 % Gas 9 6 3 50.0 % Total Production taxes 132 104 28 26.9 % Other taxes: Coal 58 48 10 20.8 % Gas 3 3 Other 5 5 Total Other taxes 66 56 10 17.9 % Total Taxes Other Than Income $ 198 $ 160 $ 38 23.8 % Increased coal production taxes are primarily due to higher severance and black lung excise taxes attributable to higher average sales prices and higher coal volumes produced in 2004 compared to 2003. Increased gas production taxes are primarily due to higher severance taxes related to increased gas production volumes and higher average sales prices. Increased other taxes in the coal segment are primarily due to higher payroll taxes related to an increase in 2004 labor costs compared to 2003. The increased labor costs are primarily related to the late March 2004 start up of the Loveridge Mine. This mine was idled in 2003. Restructuring Cost Restructuring costs of approximately $4 million in 2003 primarily represent the severance dollars paid related to the December 2003 reduction in workforce program implemented by CONSOL Energy. The program was primarily focused on reducing the number of positions in the selling, general and administrative areas and resulted in the reduction of approximately 100 positions and approximately $10 million of wages, salaries and benefits in the administrative functions in 2004. Also included in the restructuring costs are severance monies paid throughout 2003 for positions that have been eliminated by CONSOL Energy management in an effort to reduce costs and realign its selling, general and administrative functions with todays company strategies. Export Sales Excise Tax Resolution CONSOL Energy is no longer required to pay certain excise taxes on export sales. We have received refunds in 2003 for our claims and related interest for the years 1994 1999. Upon receipt of these items, we have 73 Table of Contents adjusted our estimate of interest receivable to the amounts received. This adjustment resulted in an additional $1 million in 2003. A receivable for the claims for the years 1991 1993 is still outstanding. There is no interest receivable related to these claims. Income Taxes 2004 2003 Variance PercentageChange Earnings (Loss) Before Income Taxes $ 83 $ (34 ) $ 117 344.1 % Tax Expense (Benefit) (33 ) (21 ) (12 ) (57.1 )% Effective Income Tax Rate (39.5 )% 62.4 % (101.9 )% CONSOL Energys effective tax rate is sensitive to changes to the relationship between pre tax earnings and percentage depletion. The effective rate for 2004 was also impacted by the recognition of the effects of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003. The provision for income tax is adjusted at the time the returns are filed to reflect changes in previously estimated amounts. The tax benefit was increased by $4 million in 2004 and was reduced by $5 million in 2003 related to these adjustments. The 2004 income tax benefit also includes approximately $15 million due to the release of a contingent income tax liability resulting from the settlement of the federal, state and foreign income tax audits of prior years. See note 8 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10 K for additional information. Cumulative Effect of Changes in Accounting for Workers Compensation, Mine Closing, Reclamation and Gas Well Closing Costs Effective January 1, 2004, CONSOL Energy changed our method of accounting for workers compensation. Prior to the change, CONSOL Energy recorded workers compensation liability on an undiscounted basis. Under the new method, CONSOL Energy recorded our workers compensation liability on a discounted actuarial basis using various assumptions including discount rate and future cost trends. We believe the actuarial approach is more explicit in its methodology which should lead to better estimates of the liability and related periodic costs. The change was preferable because it aligns the accounting for workers compensation with CONSOL Energys other long term employee benefit obligations, which are recorded on a discounted basis. Additionally, it provides a better comparison with CONSOL Energys industry peers, the majority of which, we believe, record the workers compensation liability on a discounted basis. As a result of the change, CONSOL Energy reduced our workers compensation liability by $136 million and reduced the related deferred tax asset by $53 million. The cumulative effect adjustment recognized upon adoption was a gain of $83 million, and accordingly is reflected as a cumulative effect adjustment from a change in accounting. Effective January 1, 2003, CONSOL Energy adopted SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, as required. CONSOL Energy reflected a gain of approximately $5 million, net of a tax cost of approximately $3 million. At the time of adoption, total assets, net of accumulated depreciation, increased approximately $59 million and total liabilities increased approximately $51 million. The amounts recorded upon adoption were dependent upon a number of variables, including the estimated future retirement costs, estimated proved reserves, assumptions involving profit margins, inflation rates and the assumed credit adjusted risk free interest rate. Previous accounting standards generally used the units of production method to match estimated retirement costs with the revenues generated by the producing assets. In contrast, SFAS No. 143 requires depreciation of the capitalized asset retirement cost and accretion of the asset retirement obligation over time. The depreciation will generally be determined on a units of production basis, whereas the accretion to be recognized will escalate over the life of the producing assets, typically as production declines. Because of the long lives of the underlying producing assets, the impact on net income in the near term is not expected to be material. 74 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period. Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10 K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates upon subsequent resolution of identified matters. Management believes that the estimates utilized are reasonable. The following critical accounting policies are materially impacted by judgments, assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Other Post Employment Benefits CONSOL Energy has historically provided retiree health benefits to employees that retire with at least ten years of service and have attained age 55. Effective August 1, 2003, the eligibility requirement for salaried employees was changed to either twenty years of service and age 55, or fifteen years of service and age 62. Additionally, any salaried or non represented hourly employees that are hired or rehired effective August 1, 2004 or later will not become eligible for retiree health benefits. In lieu of traditional retiree health coverage, if certain eligibility requirements are met, these employees may be eligible to receive a retiree medical spending allowance of $1,000 per year of service at retirement. Eligibility requirements for hourly employees have not changed from CONSOL Energys historical requirements. At December 31, 2005, a retiree health plan provided benefits to approximately 25,000 of our former employees and their eligible dependents. In addition to the change in eligibility requirements, other changes have been made to the medical plan which covers eligible salaried employees and retirees. These changes include a cost sharing structure where essentially all participants contribute 20% of plan costs. Annual cost increases in excess of 6% are paid entirely by the Plan participants. After our review, various actuarial assumptions, including discount rate, expected trend in health care costs, average remaining service period, average remaining life expectancy and per capita costs, are used by our independent actuary to estimate the cost and benefit obligations for our retiree health plans. These assumptions have not differed materially from the prior year actual experience. The discount rate is determined each year at the measurement date (currently September 30). The discount rate is an estimate of the current interest rate at which the Other Post Employment Benefit liabilities could be effectively settled at the measurement date. In estimating this rate, CONSOL Energy looks to rates of return on high quality, fixed income investments that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized ratings agency. For the year ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, the discount rate used to calculate the period end liability and the following years expense was 5.75% and 6.00%, respectively. A 0.25% increase in the discount rate would have decreased 2005 net periodic postretirement benefit costs by approximately $6.8 million. A 0.25% decrease in the discount rate would have increased 2005 net periodic postretirement benefit costs by approximately $5.0 million. Deferred gains and losses are primarily due to historical changes in the discount rate and medical cost inflation differing from expectations in prior years. Changes to interest rates for the rates of returns on instruments that could be used to settle the actuarially determined plan obligations introduce substantial volatility to our costs. The average remaining service period for our salaried plans is approximately 10 years for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004. The average remaining life expectancy of our retired United Mine Workers of America population used to calculate the following years expense is approximately 13 years for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004. Per capita costs on a per annum basis for Other Post Retirement Benefits were assumed to be $5,674 at December 31, 2005. This was approximately a 10% increase over the per capita cost on a per annum basis at December 31, 2004. If the actual increase in per capita cost of medical services or other post retirement benefits are significantly greater or less than the projected trend rates, the per capita cost assumption would need to be 75 Table of Contents adjusted annually, which could have a significant effect on the costs and liabilities recognized in the financial statements. The estimated liability recognized in the financial statements for December 31, 2005 and 2004 was $1.7 billion. For the year ended December 31, 2005, we paid approximately $133 million for Other Post Employment Benefits, all of which were paid from operating cash flow. Our obligations with respect to these liabilities are unfunded at December 31, 2005. CONSOL Energy does not expect to contribute to the other post employment plan in 2006. We intend to pay benefit claims as they are due. The following benefit payments which reflect expected future service, are expected to be paid: 2006 $ 116,799 2007 $ 125,124 2008 $ 132,567 2009 $ 140,395 2010 $ 147,332 Year 2011 2015 $ 794,942 Significant increases in health and prescription drug costs for hourly retirees could have a material adverse effect on CONSOL Energys operating cash flow. The effect on CONSOL Energys cash flow from operations for salaried employees has been limited to approximately 6% of the previous years medical cost for salaried employees due to the cost sharing provision in the benefit plan. On December 8, 2003, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the Act) was signed into law. The Act introduces a prescription drug benefit under Medicare (Medicare Part D) as well as a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D. CONSOL Energy, as a sponsor of a retiree health care benefit plan that provides a prescription drug benefit actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D, recognized the effects of the Act in the year ended December 31, 2004 in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Staff Position No. FAS 106 2, Accounting and Disclosure Requirements related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003. Implementation of the Act resulted in a reduction of our postretirement benefit costs of $21 million in the year ended December 31, 2004, and a reduction of $182 million to our December 31, 2004 estimated other postretirement benefit obligation. In the quarter ended December 31, 2005, CONSOL Energy notified all active and retired employees that current retiree medical plans required enrollment in Medicare Act Part D. We adopted a plan amendment to reflect that CONSOL Energy did not elect the Federal Subsidy provisions of the Act. Instead, we will coordinate benefits with available Medicare coverage. Medicare will be considered the primary payer, whether or not the beneficiary enrolled and paid the required premiums. This plan amendment resulted in a $150 million reduction of the accumulated projected benefit obligation and is part of actuarial gain and losses that will be amortized. Coal Workers Pneumoconiosis CONSOL Energy is responsible under the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969, as amended, for medical and disability benefits to employees and their dependents resulting from occurrences of coal workers pneumoconiosis disease. CONSOL Energy is also responsible under various state statutes for pneumoconiosis benefits. After our review, our independent actuaries calculate the actuarial present value of the estimated pneumoconiosis obligation based on assumptions regarding disability incidence, medical costs, mortality, death benefits, dependents and discount rates. The discount rate is determined each year at the measurement date (currently September 30). The discount rate is an estimate of the current interest rate at which the Coal Workers Pneumoconiosis liabilities could be effectively settled at the measurement date. In estimating this rate, CONSOL Energy looks to rates of return on high quality, fixed income investments that receive one of 76 Table of Contents the two highest ratings given by a recognized ratings agency. For the year ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, the discount rate used to calculate the period end liability and the following years expense was 5.75% and 6.0%, respectively. In January 2001, the United States Department of Labor amended the regulations implementing the federal black lung laws to give greater weight to the opinion of a claimants treating physician, expand the definition of black lung disease and limit the amount of medical evidence that can be submitted by claimants and respondents. The amendments also alter administrative procedures for the adjudication of claims, which according to the Department of Labor, results in streamlined procedures that are less formal, less adversarial and easier for participants to understand. The estimated liability recognized in the financial statements at December 31, 2005 was approximately $423 million compared to $441 million at December 31, 2004. For the year ended December 31, 2005, we paid Coal Workers Pneumoconiosis benefits of approximately $13 million. Our obligations with respect to these liabilities are unfunded at December 31, 2005. Salaried Pensions CONSOL Energy has non contributory defined benefit retirement plans covering substantially all employees not covered by multi employer retirement plans. The benefits for these plans are based primarily on years of service and employees compensation near retirement. Effective January 1, 2006, an amendment was made to the salaried pension plan. As of this date, lump sum benefits have been frozen and prospectively the lump sum option has been eliminated. Also the amount of future benefit accruals has been reduced and early retirement subsidies have been eliminated. Our independent actuaries calculate the actuarial present value of the estimated retirement obligation based on assumptions including rates of compensation, mortality rates, retirement age and interest rates. These assumptions have not differed materially from the prior year actual experience. For the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, compensation increases are assumed to range from 3% to 6% depending on age classification. Mortality assumptions were changed to reflect more recent information. Retirement rate assumptions were unchanged for the year ended December 31, 2005. Retirement rate assumptions begin at 1% for employees at age 50 and increase to 100% for employees at age 65. The discount rate is determined each year at the measurement date (currently September 30). The discount rate is an estimate of the current interest rate at which the retirement plans could be effectively settled at the measurement date. In estimating this rate, CONSOL Energy looks to rates of return on high quality, fixed income investments that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized ratings agency. For the year ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, the discount rate used to calculate the period end liability and the following years expense was 5.75% and 6.0%, respectively. A 0.25% increase in the discount rate would have decreased the 2005 net periodic pension cost by $1.3 million. A 0.25% decrease in the discount rate would have increased the 2005 net periodic pension cost by $1.2 million. Deferred gains and losses are primarily due to historical changes in the discount rate and earnings on assets differing from expectations in prior years. The average remaining service period is approximately 9 years and 10 years for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Changes to any of these assumptions introduce substantial volatility to our costs. The estimated liability at December 31, 2005 was $86 million compared to $117 million at December 31, 2004. Due to the difference in the accumulated benefit obligation and the plan assets at December 31, 2005, approximately $127 million was recognized as a minimum pension liability. At December 31, 2004, the minimum pension liability was approximately $138 million. CONSOL Energy expects to contribute approximately $52 million to the pension plan in 2006. The market related asset value is derived by taking the cost value of assets as of September 30, 2005 and multiplying it by the average 36 month ratio of the market value of assets to the cost value of assets. CONSOL Energys pension plan weighted average asset allocations at September 30, 2005 consisted of 60% equity securities and 40% debt securities. The CONSOL Energy salaried plan allows for lump sum distributions earned up until December 31, 2005 at the employees election. As of January 1, 2006, lump sum benefits have been frozen and prospectively the lump sum option has been eliminated. According to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 88, Employers Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits, if the lump sum distributions made for the plan year, which is October 1 to September 30, exceed the total of the 77 Table of Contents service cost and interest cost for the plan year, settlement accounting is required. CONSOL regularly monitors this situation. Lump sum payments did not exceed this threshold during 2004 or 2005. If this were to occur, CONSOL Energy would need to recognize in the current years results of operations, an adjustment equaling the unrecognized actuarial gain or loss resulting from each individual who received a lump sum in that year. Generally, due to the lower interest rates currently being used to calculate lump sum distributions, the impact would be to recognize actuarial losses. If this settlement accounting is triggered, the adjustment could materially impact operating results. Workers Compensation Workers compensation is a system by which individuals who sustain employment related physical injuries or some type of occupational diseases are compensated for their disabilities, medical costs, and on some occasions, for the costs of their rehabilitation. Workers compensation will also compensate the survivors of workers who suffer employment related deaths. The workers compensation laws are administered by state agencies with each state having its own set of rules and regulations regarding compensation that is owed to an employee that is injured in the course of employment. CONSOL Energy changed our method of accounting for workers compensation effective January 1, 2004. Under the new method, it records an actuarially calculated liability, which is determined using various assumptions, including discount rate and future cost trends. The discount rate is determined each year at the measurement date (currently September 30). The discount rate is an estimate of the current interest rate at which the workers compensation liabilities could be effectively settled at the measurement date. In estimating this rate, CONSOL Energy looks to rates of return on high quality, fixed income investments that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized ratings agency. For the year ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, the discount rate used to calculate the period end liability and the following years expense was 5.75% and 6.0%, respectively. A 0.25% increase or decrease in the discount rate would not have materially decreased or increased the 2005 workers compensation expense. The estimated liability recognized in the financial statements at December 31, 2005, including the current portion, was approximately $198 million. CONSOL Energys policy has been to provide for workers compensation benefits from operating cash flow. No funding has been provided to cover these benefits. For the year ended December 31, 2005, we made payments for workers compensation benefits of approximately $56 million, all of which was paid from operating cash flow. Reclamation and Mine Closure Obligations The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act establishes operational, reclamation and closure standards for all aspects of surface mining as well as most aspects of deep mining. CONSOL Energy accrues for the costs of current mine disturbance and final mine and gas well closure, including the cost of treating mine water discharge where necessary. Estimates of our total reclamation and mine closing liabilities, which are based upon permit requirements and CONSOL Energy engineering expertise related to these requirements, including the current portion, were approximately $474 million at December 31, 2005. This liability is reviewed annually by CONSOL Energy management and engineers. The estimated liability can significantly change if actual costs vary from assumptions or if governmental regulations change significantly. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations (SFAS No. 143) requires that the fair value of an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The present value of the estimated asset retirement costs is capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset. Asset retirement obligations primarily relate to the closure of mines and gas wells and the reclamation of land upon exhaustion of coal and gas reserves. Changes in the variables used to calculate the liabilities can have a significant effect on the mine closing, reclamation and gas well closing liabilities. The amounts of assets and liabilities recorded are dependent upon a number of variables, including the estimated future retirement costs, estimated proven reserves, assumptions involving profit margins, inflation rates, and the assumed credit adjusted risk free interest rate. 78 Table of Contents SFAS No. 143 requires depreciation of the capitalized asset retirement cost and accretion of the asset retirement obligation over time. The depreciation will generally be determined on a units of production basis, whereas the accretion to be recognized will escalate over the life of the producing assets, typically as production declines. Contingencies CONSOL Energy is currently involved in certain legal proceedings. We have accrued our estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of these claims. This estimate has been developed in consultation with legal counsel involved in the defense of these matters and is based upon an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies. We do not believe these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or cash flows. It is possible, however, that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings. Deferred Taxes CONSOL Energy accounts for income taxes in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS No. 109) which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax basis of recorded assets and liabilities. SFAS No. 109 also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. At December 31, 2005, CONSOL Energy has deferred tax assets in excess of deferred tax liabilities of approximately $520 million. The deferred tax assets are evaluated periodically to determine if a valuation allowance is necessary. A deferred tax asset of approximately $50 million relating to state net operating loss carry forwards has been offset with a valuation allowance due to the uncertainty of realizing the benefits of these carry forwards. However, CONSOL Energy is currently exploring several tax planning strategies that may allow a portion of the loss carry forwards to be recognized. No other valuation allowance has been recognized because CONSOL Energy has determined that it is more likely than not that all of these deferred tax assets will be realized. According to SFAS No. 109, a deferred tax asset should be reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. All available evidence, both positive and negative, must be considered to determine whether a valuation allowance is warranted. For the year ended December 31, 2005 positive evidence considered included the level of sales and pricing currently being negotiated under fixed price contracts, the reversal of certain book to tax differences, particularly those related to minimum tax credits, and the ability to employ various tax planning strategies if necessary. Negative evidence included book and tax losses generated in past periods and the inability to achieve forecasted results in those past periods. CONSOL Energy has concluded that the deferred tax assets, other than those associated with the state tax net operating losses, were more likely than not realizable. Management will continue to assess the realizability of deferred tax assets based upon continuing updates to future income forecasts and other tax planning strategies and may record adjustments in future periods as appropriate. By our estimation, CONSOL Energy will begin paying regular tax and utilizing our deferred tax asset associated with the minimum tax in 2006. Our judgment regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions, our ability to successfully execute our business strategy, as well as other factors. These changes, if any, may require a valuation allowance to be recorded that could materially impact net income. Successful Efforts Accounting We are required to select among alternative acceptable accounting policies. There are two generally acceptable methods for accounting for oil and gas producing activities. The full cost method allows the capitalization of all costs associated with exploring for, acquiring and developing oil and natural gas reserves. The successful efforts method allows only for the capitalization of costs directly associated with exploring for, 79 Table of Contents acquiring and developing proven natural gas properties. Costs related to exploration that are not successful are expensed when it is determined that commercially productive gas reserves were not found. We have elected to use the successful efforts method to account for our gas producing activities. Coal and Gas Reserve Values There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities and values of economically recoverable coal and gas reserves, including many factors beyond our control. As a result, estimates of economically recoverable coal and gas reserves are by their nature uncertain. Information about our reserves consists of estimates based on engineering, economic and geological data assembled and analyzed by our staff. The majority of our gas reserves have been reviewed by independent experts. None of our coal reserves have been reviewed by independent experts. Some of the factors and assumptions which impact economically recoverable reserve estimates include: geological conditions; historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas; the assumed effects of regulations and taxes by governmental agencies; assumptions governing future prices; and future operating costs. Each of these factors may in fact vary considerably from the assumptions used in estimating reserves. For these reasons, estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of coal and gas attributable to a particular group of properties, and classifications of these reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of future net cash flows, may vary substantially. Actual production, revenues and expenditures with respect to our reserves will likely vary from estimates, and these variances may be material. See Risk Factors in Item 1A of this report for a discussion of the uncertainties in estimating our reserves. Liquidity and Capital Resources CONSOL Energy generally has satisfied its working capital requirements and funded our capital expenditures and debt service obligations from cash generated from operations and proceeds from borrowings. On April 1, 2005, CONSOL Energy amended our credit facility to increase the borrowing capacity, reduce cost and extend the term. The amended facility features a five year, $750 million revolving credit facility, replacing the previous $600 million credit facility, which included a Tranche B credit linked deposit facility of $200 million. The amended facility is collateralized by liens on substantially all of the assets of CONSOL Energy and our wholly owned subsidiaries. The gas business assets that were previously pledged as collateral security for the amended credit facility were released on August 8, 2005 in conjunction with the partial divestiture of CNX Gas Corporation, which was provided for within the amended facility. Collateral is shared equally and ratably with the holders of CONSOL Energys 7.875% bonds that mature in 2012 and CONSOL Energys subsidiarys 8.25% medium term notes maturing in 2007. Fees and interest rate spreads are based on a ratio of financial covenant debt to twelve month trailing earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). Covenants in the amended facility limit our ability to dispose of assets, make investments, purchase or redeem CONSOL Energy common stock and merge with another corporation. The amended facility includes a leverage ratio covenant of not more than 3.25 to 1.00, measured quarterly. This ratio was 0.07 to 1.00 at December 31, 2005. The facility also includes an interest coverage ratio covenant of no less than 4.50 to 1.00, measured quarterly. This ratio was 26.47 to 1.00 at December 31, 2005. At December 31, 2005, this facility had approximately $337 million letters of credit issued and had no outstanding borrowings, leaving approximately $413 million of unused capacity. On October 7, 2005, CNX Gas, an 81.5% controlled and consolidated subsidiary of CONSOL Energy, entered into a new credit agreement with a group of commercial lenders. The new credit agreement provides for a 80 Table of Contents revolving credit facility in an initial aggregate outstanding principal amount of up to $200 million, including borrowings and letters of credit. CNX Gas also has the ability to request an increase in aggregate outstanding principal amount of up to $300 million, including borrowings and letters of credit. This facility includes a leverage ratio covenant of not more than 3.00 to 1.00, measured quarterly. This ratio was 0.00 to 1.00 at December 31, 2005. The facility also includes an interest coverage ratio covenant of no less than 3.00 to 1.00, measured quarterly. This ratio was 14,412.29 to 1.00 at December 31, 2005. At December 31, 2005, this facility had approximately $14 million letters of credit issued and had no outstanding borrowings, leaving approximately $186 million of unused capacity. As a result of entering into the new credit agreement, CNX Gas and their subsidiaries have executed a Supplemental Indenture and as of October 21, 2005 are again guarantors of CONSOL Energys 7.875% bonds. CONSOL Energy and certain of our U.S. subsidiaries also participate in a receivables securitization facility for the sale on a continuous basis of eligible trade accounts receivable that will provide, on a revolving basis, up to $125.0 million of short term funding. CONSOL Energy formed CNX Funding Corporation, a wholly owned, special purpose, bankruptcy remote subsidiary, for the sole purpose of buying and selling eligible trade receivables generated by certain subsidiaries of CONSOL Energy. Under the receivables facility, CONSOL Energy and certain subsidiaries, irrevocably and without recourse, sell all of their eligible trade accounts receivable to CNX Funding Corporation. CNX Funding Corporation then sells, on a revolving basis, an undivided percentage interest in the pool of eligible trade accounts receivable to financial institutions and their affiliates, while maintaining a subordinated interest in a portion of the trade receivables. CONSOL Energy has agreed to continue servicing the sold receivables for the financial institutions for a fee based upon market rates for similar services. The cost of funds is consistent with commercial paper rates plus a charge for administrative services paid to the financial institution. The receivables facility expires in April 2006. We intend to renew this facility. At December 31, 2005, there were no accounts receivable removed from the consolidated balance sheet related to this facility. Repayments of $125.0 million were included as reduction to cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2005. CONSOL Energy believes that cash generated from operations and our borrowing capacity will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements, anticipated capital expenditures (other than major acquisitions), scheduled debt payments, anticipated dividend payments and to provide required letters of credit. Nevertheless, the ability of CONSOL Energy to satisfy our working capital requirements, debt service obligations, to fund planned capital expenditures or pay dividends will depend upon future operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions in the coal and gas industries and other financial and business factors, some of which are beyond CONSOL Energys control. In order to manage the market risk exposure of volatile natural gas prices in the future, CONSOL Energy enters into various physical gas supply transactions with both gas marketers and end users for terms varying in length. CONSOL Energy has also entered into various gas swap transactions that qualify as financial cash flow hedges, which exist parallel to the underlying physical transactions. The fair value of these contracts was a loss of $34.4 million (net of $22.3 million of deferred tax) at December 31, 2005. The ineffective portion of the changes in the fair value of these contracts was insignificant to earnings in the year ended December 31, 2005 and 2004. CONSOL Energy frequently evaluates potential acquisitions. CONSOL Energy has funded acquisitions primarily with cash generated from operations and a variety of other sources, depending on the size of the transaction, including debt financing. There can be no assurance that additional capital resources, including debt financing, will be available to CONSOL Energy on terms which CONSOL Energy finds acceptable, or at all. 81 Table of Contents Cash Flows (in millions) 2005 2004 Change Cash flows from operating activities $ 409 $ 358 $ 51 Cash provided by (used in) investing activities $ (74 ) $ (401 ) $ 327 Cash provided by (used in) financing activities $ $ 42 $ (42 ) Cash flows from operating activities have increased primarily due to the following items: Approximately $32 million of insurance proceeds were collected in the year ended December 31, 2005 related to the Buchanan Mine fire. Operating cash flows improved $138 million due to increases in earnings before cumulative effect of change in accounting and excluding the gain on sale of 18.5% interest in CNX Gas, as previously discussed in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Operating cash flows were improved due to various changes in operating assets, operating liabilities, other assets and other liabilities which occurred throughout both periods. Operating cash flows were lower in the 2005 period compared to the 2004 period due to amounts paid related to the accounts receivable securitization program. Under the accounts receivable securitization facility, approximately $125 million was repaid during the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to $17 million received, net of payments from the facility in the year ended December 31, 2004. Approximately $25 million of insurance proceeds were collected in the year ended December 31, 2004 related to the Loveridge Mine fire. Net cash used in investing activities changed primarily due to the following items: Proceeds of $420 million were received from the sale of 18.5% interest in CNX Gas. In July 2005, CONSOL Energy announced that we created CNX Gas Corporation (CNX Gas), a wholly owned subsidiary of CONSOL Energy, to conduct our gas exploration and production activities. CONSOL Energy contributed substantially all of the assets of our gas business, including all of CONSOL Energys rights to coalbed methane associated with 4.5 billion tons of coal reserves owned or controlled by CONSOL Energy as well as all of CONSOL Energys rights to conventional gas. CONSOL Energy entered into various agreements with CNX Gas that will define various operating and service relationships between the two companies. In August 2005, CNX Gas, a subsidiary of CONSOL Energy, sold 27.9 million shares in a private transaction. The shares were sold to qualified institutional and accredited investors in a private transaction exempt from registration under Rule 144A, Regulation S and Regulation D. CNX Gas received proceeds of $420 million, which they used to pay a special dividend to CONSOL Energy. Capital expenditures were $519 million in the 2005 period compared to $411 million in the 2004 period. Capital expenditures were higher in 2005 due to the purchase of longwall mining equipment to replace existing equipment. Proceeds from the sale of assets were $34 million in the 2005 period compared to $25 million in the 2004 period. Proceeds in the 2005 period are related to the sale and subsequent lease back of the corporate office building and proceeds related to the sale of various properties held by CONSOL Energy throughout the period. Proceeds in the 2004 period were due to the sale of CONSOL Energys stock in our wholly owned subsidiary CNX Australia Pty Limited to certain affiliates of AMCI, Inc. and the sale of various properties held by CONSOL Energy throughout the period. Net cash used in or provided by financing activities changed primarily due to the following items; In the 2005 period, approximately $2 million was paid on outstanding borrowings from the revolving credit facility compared to $63 million of payments against the Senior Revolving Credit Facility in the 2004 period. 82 Table of Contents Scheduled debt repayments of $45 million were made in 2004. $39 million of stock was issued in the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to $15 million issued in the year ended December 31, 2004. Stock issuances in both periods were a result of stock option exercises. Previously restricted cash of $190 million was released due to the completion of a $600 million debt facility in the year ended December 31, 2004. The following is a summary of our significant contractual obligations at December 31, 2005 (in thousands): Payments due by Year Within 1Year 13 Years 3 5 Years After 5 Years Total Short Term Notes Payable $ $ $ $ $ Gas Firm Transportation Obligation 2,847 4,621 4,621 3,856 15,945 Purchase Order Firm Commitments 4,040 37,500 41,540 Long term Debt 4,629 54,613 39,451 345,636 444,329 Capital Lease Obligations(a) 3,658 12,753 11,173 39,506 67,090 Operating Lease Obligations 33,003 65,450 34,946 20,161 153,560 Other Long Term Liabilities(b) 363,983 481,931 470,570 1,714,549 3,031,033 Total Contractual Obligations $ 412,160 $ 656,868 $ 560,761 $ 2,123,708 $ 3,753,497 (a) We expect to create gas transportation alternatives through certain transportation agreements with a second interstate pipeline operator, East Tennessee, a subsidiary of Duke Energy. These agreements require the construction by East Tennessee, of an approximately 32 mile lateral pipeline to our gas field in Virginia from ETNG. Called Jewel Ridge, this proposed lateral pipeline currently is under permit review by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and is expected to be in service in the second half of 2006. In connection with the construction of the Jewell Ridge lateral, we will enter into a 15 year firm transportation agreement with East Tennessee at pre determined fixed rates. We anticipate that the present value of our payments under this firm transportation agreement will be approximately $67 million. In addition to providing us with transportation flexibility, the Jewell Ridge lateral will provide access for our product to alternate and growing natural gas markets in the southeastern United States. (b) Long term liabilities include other post employment benefits, work related injuries and illnesses, defined benefit pension plans, mine reclamation and closure, and other long term liability costs. As discussed in Critical Accounting Policies and in the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this annual report on Form 10 K, our determination of these long term liabilities is calculated annually and is based on several assumptions, including then prevailing conditions, which may change from year to year. In any year, if our assumptions are inaccurate, we could be required to expend greater amounts than anticipated. Moreover, in particular, for periods after 2005 our estimates may change from the amounts included in the table, and may change significantly, if our assumptions change to reflect changing conditions. Capital expenditures were approximately $524 million in the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to $411 million in the year ended December 31, 2004. We currently anticipate capital expenditures for the year ending December 31, 2006 to be approximately $740 million, of which approximately $300 million is to maintain current production levels. However, we may choose to defer certain capital projects in light of operating results and the availability of financing. Capital expenditures for pollution abatement and reclamation are projected to be $25 million for the year ending December 31, 2006. Our capital expenditures have been and will be primarily used for replacement of mining and gas equipment, the expansion of mining and gas capacity and projects to improve the efficiency of the mining and gas operations. The projected capital expenditures for 2006 83 Table of Contents are not committed and are expected to be funded with cash generated by operations and existing borrowings capacity. In addition, cash requirements to fund employee related, mine closure and other long term liabilities included above, along with obligations related to long term debt, capital and operating leases, are expected to be funded with cash generated by operations and existing borrowing capacity. Debt At December 31, 2005, CONSOL Energy had total long term debt of $443 million outstanding, including current portion of long term debt of $5 million. The long term debt consisted of: An aggregate principal amount of $249 million of 7.875% notes due in 2012 ($250 million face amount of notes, net of $1 million unamortized debt discount). The notes were issued at 99.174% of the principal amount. Interest on the notes is payable March 1 and September 1 of each year. Payment of the principal and premium, if any, and interest on the notes are guaranteed by most of CONSOL Energys wholly owned subsidiaries. The notes are senior secured obligations and rank equally with all other secured indebtedness of the guarantors; An aggregate principal amount of $45 million of secured notes which bear interest at fixed rates of 8.25% per annum and are due in 2007; An aggregate principal amount of $103 million of two series of industrial revenue bonds which were issued to finance the Baltimore port facility and bear interest at 6.50% per annum and mature in 2010 and 2011; $32 million in advance royalty commitments with an average interest rate of 7.663% per annum; An aggregate principal amount of $14 million on a variable rate note that bears interest at the prime rate, or 7.25% at December 31, 2005. This note was incurred by a variable interest entity that is fully consolidated in which CONSOL Energy holds a 49% ownership interest. At December 31, 2005, CONSOL Energy had no aggregate principal amounts of borrowings and approximately $337 million of letters of credit outstanding under the revolving credit facility. At December 31, 2005, CNX Gas, an 81.5% controlled subsidiary, had no aggregate principal amounts of borrowings and approximately $14 million of letters of credit outstanding under their revolving credit facility. Stockholders Equity and Dividends CONSOL Energy had stockholders equity of $1,025 million at December 31, 2005 and $469 million at December 31, 2004. The increase is primarily attributable to net income for the year ended December 31, 2005. Stockholders equity was reduced due to an increase of $16 million in the year ended December 31, 2005 in Other Comprehensive Losses. These increases in Other Comprehensive Losses were primarily due to various cash flow hedges related to our gas business. Comprehensive losses were reduced as a result of a decrease in minimum pension liabilities as a result of better performance of plan assets for non contributory defined benefit retirement plans than in the prior period. Comprehensive losses (gains) related to pension assets are generally calculated annually and reflect a number of factors including conditions in the stock markets and interest rates. Stockholders equity was also decreased in 2005 for the payment of dividends. In December 2005, CONSOL Energy announced that we would begin a share repurchase program of up to $300 million of the companys common stock during a 24 month period beginning January 1, 2006 and ending December 31, 2007. As of February 7, 2006, we repurchased 155,000 shares at an average price of $69.06 under this repurchase program. 84 Table of Contents Off Balance Sheet Transactions CONSOL Energy does not maintain any off balance sheet transactions, arrangements, obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or others that are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on CONSOL Energys financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources which are not disclosed in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In September 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ratified the consensus reached by the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) on Issue No. 04 13, Accounting for Purchases and Sales of Inventory with the Same Counterparty. The issue defines when a purchase and a sale of inventory with the same party that operates in the same line of business is recorded at fair value or considered a single nonmonetary transaction subject to the fair value exception of APB Opinion No. 29. The purchase and sale transactions may be pursuant to a single contractual arrangement or separate contractual arrangements and the inventory purchased or sold may be in the form of raw materials, work in process, or finished goods. In general, two or more transactions with the same party are treated as one if they are entered into in contemplation of each other. The rules apply to new arrangements entered into in reporting periods beginning after March 15, 2006. The accounting for transactions that CONSOL Energy considers matching buy/sell transactions will be affected by this consensus and therefore, upon adoption, these transactions will no longer be recorded on a gross basis. CONSOL Energy is currently studying the provisions of this consensus to determine the impact on its consolidated financial statements; however, management does not believe any impact on net income would be material. There will be no impact on cash flows from operations as a result of adoption. In June 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Statement No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections a replacement of APB Opinion No. 20 and FASB Statement No. 3. This Statement provides guidance on the accounting for and reporting of accounting changes and error corrections. It establishes, unless impracticable, retrospective application as the required method for reporting a change in accounting principle in the absence of explicit transition requirements specific to the newly adopted accounting principle. This Statement also provides guidance for determining whether retrospective application of a change in accounting principle is impracticable and for reporting a change when retrospective application is impracticable. The correction of an error in previously issued financial statements is not an accounting change. However, the reporting of an error correction involves adjustments to previously issued financial statements similar to those generally applicable to reporting an accounting change retrospectively. Therefore, the reporting of a correction of an error by restating previously issued financial statements is also addressed by this Statement. This Statement shall be effective for accounting changes and correction of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. We do not expect this guidance to have a significant impact on CONSOL Energy. In June 2005, the FASB ratified a modification to the consensus reached by the Emerging Issues Task Force in EITF 04 06: Accounting for Stripping Costs Incurred during Production in the Mining Industry. The EITF clarified that stripping costs incurred during the production phase of a mine are variable production costs that should be included in the costs of the inventory produced during the period that the stripping costs are incurred. The Task Force noted that the consensus does not address the accounting for stripping costs incurred during the pre production phase of a mine. In addition, the consensus in this Issue is effective for the first reporting period in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. The effect of initially applying this consensus should be accounted for in a manner similar to a cumulative effect adjustment with any adjustment recognized in the opening balance of retained earnings in the year of adoption. We do not expect this guidance to have a significant impact on CONSOL Energy. In April 2005, the FASB issued FSP No. FAS 19 1 Accounting for Suspended Well Costs (FSP 19 1). This position concluded that exploratory well costs should continue to be capitalized beyond twelve months when the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a producing well, and the 85 Table of Contents enterprise is making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. This guidance requires management to exercise more judgment than was previously required and also requires additional disclosure. We do not expect this guidance to have a significant impact on CONSOL Energy. In March 2005, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation (FIN) 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143. This interpretation clarifies that the term, conditional asset retirement obligation, as used in FASB Statement No. 143, refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity. The obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional even though uncertainty exists about the timing and or method of settlement. Thus, the timing and or method of settlement may be conditional on a future event. Accordingly, an entity is required to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated. The fair value of a liability for the conditional asset retirement obligation should be recognized when incurred, generally upon acquisition, construction, or development and or through the normal operation of the asset. Uncertainty about the timing and or method of settlement of a conditional asset retirement obligation should be factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists. SFAS No. 143 acknowledges that, in some cases, sufficient information may not be available to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation. We do not expect this guidance to have a significant impact on CONSOL Energy. On December 15, 2004, the FASB released its final revised standard entitled FASB Statement No. 123R, Share Based Payment (SFAS No. 123R). This Statement requires that all public entities measure the cost of equity based service awards based on the grant date fair value. That cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award or the requisite service period, which usually is the vesting period. Compensation cost is not recognized for equity instruments for which employees do not render the requisite service. In addition, the SEC Staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 107 on SFAS No. 123R in March 2005. The SAB was issued to assist preparers by simplifying some of the implementation challenges of SFAS No. 123R while enhancing information that investors receive. This SAB provides guidance related to, among other relevant items, share based payment transactions with non employees, valuation methods, the classification of compensation expense, non GAAP financial measures, first time adoptions of SFAS No. 123R in an interim period, capitalization of compensation cost related to share based payment arrangements, the accounting for income tax effects, the modification of employee share options prior to adoption of SFAS No. 123R, and disclosures in Managements Discussion and Analysis subsequent to adoption of SFAS No. 123R. In January 2006, the FASB issued Proposed FASB Staff Position No. FAS 123 (R) d, Classification of Options and Similar Instruments Issued as Employee Compensation That Allow for Cash Settlement upon the Occurrence of a Contingent Event. This proposed FSP amends paragraphs 32 and A229 of SFAS No. 123R to state that a cash settlement that can be exercised only upon the occurrence of a contingent event outside of the employees control is not to be classified as a liability, until the contingent event is considered probable to occur. SFAS No. 123R is to be effective for public companies as of the beginning of the first annual reporting period that begins after June 15, 2005. CONSOL Energy will implement SFAS No. 123R on January 1, 2006, as required. The expected impact of unvested stock options outstanding at December 31, 2005, under the modified prospective application, is approximately $5,300 earnings before income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2006. Management is currently evaluating the policy for determining our windfall tax benefits. In November 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 151, Inventory Costs: An Amendment of ARB 43, Chapter 4 (FAS 151). This statement amends the guidance in ARB NO. 43, Chapter 4, Inventory Pricing, to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted material (spoilage). Paragraph 5 of ARB 43, Chapter 4, previously stated that under some circumstances, items such as idle facility expense, excess spoilage, double freight, and re handling costs may be so abnormal as to require treatment as current period charges. FAS 151 requires that those items be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal. In addition, 86 Table of Contents this Statement requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. In accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin 74, Disclosure Of The Impact That Recently Issued Accounting Standards Will Have On The Financial Statements Of The Registrant When Adopted In A Future Period (SAB 74), we have evaluated the provisions of FAS 151 to determine the presently known material changes, trends and uncertainties that are reasonably expected to have an impact on future financial disclosures. CONSOL does not expect the changes in accordance with the provisions of FAS 151 to have a material impact on the financial position and results of operations in future periods. The provisions of this Statement are effective for inventory cost incurred during fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. On October 13, 2004, the FASB ratified EITF Issue No. 04 10, Applying Paragraph 19 of FASB Statement No. 131, Disclosure about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information, in Determining Whether to Aggregate Operating Segments That Do Not Meet the Quantitative Thresholds (EITF 04 10). FASB Statement No. 131 requires that a public business enterprise report financial and descriptive information about its reportable operating segments. Operating segments are components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. EITF 04 10 clarifies how an enterprise should evaluate the aggregation criteria in paragraph 17 of FAS 131 when determining whether operating segments that do not meet the quantitative thresholds may be aggregated in accordance with paragraph 19 of FAS 131. In addition, the FASB Task Force has requested that the FASB staff propose a FASB Staff Position (FSP) to provide guidance in determining whether two or more operating segments have similar economic characteristics. The Tax Force has agreed that since the two issues are interrelated, the effective date of EITF 04 10 should coincide with the future undetermined effective date of the anticipated FSP. We are currently evaluating the positions addressed in EITF 04 10, and foresee no significant changes in the reporting practices currently used to report segment information. In October 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 was signed into law. CONSOL Energy has implemented the qualified production activities deduction as enacted by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. The deduction is currently equal to 3% of qualified production activities income as limited by taxable income and as limited by 50 percent of the employers W 2 wages for the tax year. The percentage used in computing the deduction will be 3% in 2006, 6% in 2007 through 2009 and 9% in 2010 and after. As a special deduction in accordance with FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, it is included as a permanent benefit in CONSOL Energys estimate of its annual effective tax rate. The Act also provided for a temporary dividends received deduction as an incentive to repatriate accumulated foreign earnings and profits. CONSOL Energy opted to leave accumulated earnings and profits as permanently reinvested outside the United States. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. In addition to the risks inherent in operations, CONSOL Energy is exposed to financial, market, political and economic risks. The following discussion provides additional detail regarding CONSOL Energys exposure to the risks of changing natural gas prices, interest rates and foreign exchange rates. CONSOL Energy is exposed to market price risk in the normal course of selling natural gas production and to a lesser extent in the sale of coal. CONSOL sells coal under both short term and long term contracts with fixed price and or indexed price contracts that reflect market value. CONSOL Energy uses fixed price contracts and derivative commodity instruments that qualify as cash flow hedges under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 to minimize exposure to market price volatility in the sale of natural gas. Our risk management policy strictly prohibits the use of derivatives for speculative positions. CONSOL Energy has established risk management policies and procedures to strengthen the internal control environment of the marketing of commodities produced from our asset base. All of the derivative instruments are held for purposes other than trading. They are used primarily to mitigate uncertainty and volatility and cover underlying exposures. CONSOL Energys market risk strategy incorporates fundamental risk management tools to assess market price risk and establish a framework in which management can maintain a portfolio of transactions within pre defined risk parameters. 87 Table of Contents CONSOL Energy believes that the use of derivative instruments along with the risk assessment procedures and internal controls does not expose CONSOL Energy to material risk. The use of derivative instruments could materially affect CONSOL Energys results of operations depending on market prices. However, we believe that use of these instruments will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or liquidity. For a summary of accounting policies related to derivative instruments, see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Sensitivity analyses of the incremental effects on pre tax earnings for the year ended December 31, 2005 of a hypothetical 10% and 25% change in natural gas prices for open derivative instruments as of December 31, 2005 are provided in the following table: Incremental Decreasein Pre tax EarningsAssuming aHypothetical Price,Exchange Rate orInterest Rate Changeof: 10% 25% (in millions) Natural Gas $ 34.4 $ 75.5 CONSOL Energy remains at risk for possible changes in the market value of these derivative instruments; however, such risk should be mitigated by price changes in the underlying hedged item. The effect of this offset is not reflected in the sensitivity analyses. CONSOL Energy entered into derivative instruments to convert the market prices related to portions of the 2005 through 2008 anticipated sales of natural gas to fixed prices. The sensitivity analysis reflects an inverse relationship between increases in commodity prices and a benefit to earnings. When commodity prices increase, pretax income decreases. The fair value of these contracts was a net loss of $34.4 million (net of $22.3 million deferred tax). We continually evaluate the portfolio of derivative commodity instruments and adjust the strategy to anticipated market conditions and risks accordingly. CONSOL Energy is exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by counterparties. The credit worthiness of counterparties is subject to continuing review. CONSOL Energys interest expense is sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates in the United States. At December 31, 2005, CONSOL Energy had outstanding $429 million aggregate principal amount of debt under fixed rate instruments and $14 million aggregate principal amount of debt under variable rate instruments. CONSOL Energys primary exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our revolving credit facility, under which there was no borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2005. Due to the level of borrowings against this facility in the year ended December 31, 2005, a 100 basis point increase in the average rate for CONSOL Energys revolving credit facility would not have significantly decreased net income for the period. The fair value of CONSOL Energys financial instruments is set forth in Note 25 and Note 26 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Almost all of CONSOL Energys transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars, and, as a result, we do not have material exposure to currency exchange rate risks. 88 Table of Contents
