Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. General Net income for the 2006 period declined in comparison to the 2005 period primarily due to the 2005 period gain on the sale of 18.5% of CNX Gas. In August 2005, CNX Gas, a subsidiary of CONSOL Energy, sold 27.9 million shares of common stock. CNX Gas received proceeds of $420 million, which it used to pay a special dividend to CONSOL Energy. The pre tax gain recognized on this transaction was $327 million. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, no deferred tax has been provided on this transaction as current tax law provides a means by which the excess of the reported amount of this investment over its tax basis can be recovered tax free. Also, management has no current intention of entering into a transaction that would cause CNX Gas to leave the consolidated tax group. Net income was also impacted by the acceleration of previously unrecognized actuarial losses related to our salary pension plan. Our defined benefit pension plan for salaried employees allows such employees to receive a lump sum distribution for the benefits earned through December 31, 2005 in lieu of annual payments when they retire from CONSOL Energy. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 88, Employers Accounting for Settlements & Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits, requires that when the lump sum distributions made for a plan year, which for CONSOL Energy is October 1 to September 30, exceed the total of the service cost and interest cost for the plan year, an adjustment equaling the unrecognized actuarial gain or loss resulting from each individual who received a lump sum in that year be recognized. The total pre tax accelerated actuarial amortization was $18 million and was included in costs of goods sold and other charges and selling, general and administrative costs. These decreases in net income were offset, in part, by $79 million of property and business interruption insurance proceeds recognized in other income related to the Buchanan Mine fire and skip hoist incident that occurred in 2005. Net income was also impacted by increased average sales prices for both coal and gas. Coal unit costs increased in the period to period comparison, impairing net income. Increased cost of goods sold and other charges were also attributable to higher supply costs, contract mining fees, labor costs, subsidence costs, and higher insurance premiums. Higher gas unit costs were primarily attributable to higher firm transportation costs and higher power costs. Total coal sales for the year ended December 31, 2006 were 68.9 million tons, of which 67.6 million tons were produced by CONSOL Energy operations, consolidated variable interest entities, or sold from inventory of company produced coal. This compares with total coal sales of 70.4 million tons for the year ended December 31, 2005, of which 68.9 million tons were produced by CONSOL Energy operations, consolidated variable interest entities, our equity affiliates or sold from inventory of company produced coal. Sales of company produced coal decreased in the 2006 period due to lower coal production causing fewer tons to be available for sale. Company produced coal production was 67.4 million tons in the 2006 period compared to 69.1 million tons in the 2005 period. The 2006 period production was lower primarily due to the idling of Shoemaker Mine early in the year and the long term idling of the VP #8 mine in Virginia in the spring of 2006. In addition, geological conditions at several mines resulted in falls on major beltlines during the high humidity season as well as sandstone and rock intrusions in the areas being mined. Produced coalbed methane gas sales volumes, including a percentage of the sales of equity affiliates equal to our interest in these affiliates, increased 16.0% to 56.1 billion cubic feet in the 2006 period compared with 48.4 billion cubic feet in the 2005 period. Sales volumes in the 2006 period increased as a result of additional wells coming online from our on going drilling program. Our average sales price for coalbed methane gas, including sales of equity affiliates, increased 19.3% to $7.04 per thousand cubic feet in the 2006 period compared with $5.90 per thousand cubic feet in the 2005 period. The increase in average sales price is a result of CNX Gas, an 81.5% owned subsidiary, exposing a larger portion of sales volumes to prevailing market prices in the current period compared to the prior period, where a larger portion of production was locked in at lower prices than the current period market prices. Mine accidents involving multiple fatalities occurred earlier this year in West Virginia at mines operated by other coal companies. These accidents attracted widespread public attention and have resulted in both federal 52 Table of Contents government and some state government changes to statutory and regulatory control of mine safety, particularly for underground mines. Because nearly all of our mines are underground, these legislative and regulatory changes could affect our performance. The actions taken thus far by federal and state governments include requiring: the caching of additional supplies of self contained self rescuer (SCSR) devices underground; the purchase and installation during the next several years of electronic communication and personal tracking devices underground; the installation, in some states of rescue chambers, structures designed to provide refuge for groups of miners for long periods of time during a mine emergency when evacuation from the mine is not possible; and additional training and testing requirements that are expected to create a need to hire additional employees. In reviewing actions taken to date, we estimate that implementation of the new requirements could cost $20 million to $37 million from 2006 until the end of 2009. The actual costs will depend primarily on: the number of additional SCSR oxygen units purchased; the design requirements as well as the extent of deployment of rescue chambers; final interpretation of other regulatory requirements; and final approval of mine by mine implementation plans. A large part of the estimated additional costs are related to the purchase of additional SCSR oxygen units. We did incur costs related to these regulatory requirements during the reporting period. We also are reviewing our coal sales agreements to determine the degree to which costs related to these regulatory requirements may be passed through to customers. While the amount will vary from contract, we believe that some portion of the cost of implementation can be passed to the customer in most of our existing sales agreements. At December 31, 2006, CONSOL Energy and its subsidiaries had 7,253 employees, 39% of whom were represented by the United Mine Workers. A new five year labor agreement was reached in December 2006 and commences January 1, 2007. The new agreement expires December 31, 2011 and provides for a 20% across the board wage increase over its duration and a $1,000 bonus to be paid immediately to the unions active miners. Wages will go up $1.50 per hour in 2007, $1.00 per hour in 2008 and $.50 per hour for 2009 through 2011. Other terms of the agreement require an average additional contribution of $2.00 per hour to be made into the employee benefit funds over the contract term. The hourly contribution for each year is as follows; $2.00 for 2007, $3.50 for 2008, $4.25 for 2009, $5.00 for 2010 and $5.50 for 2011. Full health care benefits for active land retired members and their dependents will continue with no increase in co payments. Newly employed inexperienced employees represented by the UMWA, hired after January 1, 2007 will not be eligible to receive retiree benefits. In lieu of these benefits, these employees will receive a defined contribution benefit of $1.00 per each hour worked. The agreement replaced the Bituminous Coal Wage Agreement of 2002. On September 15, 2006, Standard & Poors raised our corporate credit rating to BB from BB . The rating BB is the 12th lowest out of 22 rating categories. Standard & Poors also raised our senior secured notes to BB+ from BB. The rating BB+ is the 11th lowest out of 22 rating categories. Standard & Poors defines an obligation rated BB as less vulnerable to nonpayment than other speculative issues. However, the rating indicates that an obligor faces major ongoing uncertainties or exposure to adverse business, financial or economic conditions, which could lead to the obligors inadequate capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation. On September 27, 2006, Moodys raised our senior secured notes to Ba1 from Ba2. This is the 11th lowest out of 21 rating categories. Obligations which are rated Ba are considered to have speculative elements; their future cannot be considered as well assured. Often the protection of interest and principal payments may be very moderate, and thereby not well safeguarded during both good and bad times over the future. Uncertainty of position characterizes bonds in this class. The modifier 1 indicates that the obligation ranks in the higher end of its generic rating category. 53 Table of Contents On May 4, 2006, CONSOL Energys Board of Directors declared a two for one stock split of the common stock payable on or about May 31, 2006 to shareholders of record on May 15, 2006. The stock split was effected in the form of a stock dividend. This stock split resulted in the issuance of approximately 92.5 million additional shares of common stock. The stock split also resulted in additional shares being available for awards under the CONSOL Energy Inc. Equity Incentive Plan. Results of Operations Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2006 Compared with Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2005 Net Income Net income changed primarily due to the following items (table in millions): 2006 2005 Dollar Variance Percentage Change Coal Sales Produced and Purchased (Outside and Related Party) $ 2,694 $ 2,527 $ 167 6.6 % Produced Gas Sales 389 281 108 38.4 % Gas Royalty Interest 51 45 6 13.3 % Purchased Gas Sales 44 275 (231 ) (84.0 )% Gain on Sale of 18.5% of CNX Gas 327 (327 ) (100.0 )% Other Sales and Other Income 537 355 182 51.3 % Total Revenue and Other Income 3,715 3,810 (95 ) (2.5 )% Coal Cost of Goods Sold Produced and Purchased 1,785 1,702 83 4.9 % Produced Gas Cost of Goods Sold 107 79 28 35.4 % Gas Royalty Interest Cost of Goods Sold 42 37 5 13.5 % Purchased Gas Cost of Goods Sold 45 279 (234 ) (83.9 )% Other Cost of Goods Sold 357 340 17 5.0 % Total Cost of Goods Sold 2,336 2,437 (101 ) (4.1 )% Other 828 719 109 15.2 % Total Costs 3,164 3,156 8 0.3 % Earnings before Income Taxes and Minority Interest 551 654 (103 ) (15.7 )% Income Tax Expense 112 64 48 75.0 % Earnings Before Minority Interest 439 590 (151 ) (25.6 )% Minority Interest (30 ) (9 ) (21 ) 233.3 % Net Income $ 409 $ 581 $ (172 ) (29.6 )% Net income for the 2006 period declined in comparison to the 2005 period primarily due to the 2005 period gain on the sale of 18.5% of CNX Gas. In August 2005, CNX Gas, a subsidiary of CONSOL Energy, sold 27.9 million shares of common stock. CNX Gas received proceeds of $420 million, which it used to pay a special dividend to CONSOL Energy.

Net income was also impacted by the acceleration of previously unrecognized actuarial losses related to our salary pension plan. Our defined benefit pension plan for salaried employees allows such employees to receive a lump sum distribution for benefits earned through December 31, 2005 in lieu of annual payments when they retire from CONSOL Energy. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 88, Employers Accounting for Settlements & Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits, 54 Table of Contents requires that when the lump sum distributions made for a plan year, which for CONSOL Energy is October 1 to September 30, exceed the total of the service cost and interest cost for the plan year, an adjustment equaling the unrecognized actuarial gain or loss resulting from each individual who received a lump sum in that year be recognized. The total pre tax accelerated actuarial amortization was $18 million and was included in costs of goods sold and other charges and selling, general and administrative costs.

Revenue Revenue and other income decreased due to the following items: 2006 2005 Dollar Variance Percentage Change Sales Produced Coal Outside and Related Party $ 2,620 $ 2,448 $ 172 7.0 % Purchased Coal 74 79 (5 ) (6.3 )% Produced Gas 389 281 108 38.4 % Gas Royalty Interest 51 45 6 13.3 % Purchased Gas 44 275 (231 ) (84.0 )% Industrial Supplies 120 93 27 29.0 % Other 84 35 49 140.0 % Total Sales 3,382 3,256 126 3.9 % Freight Revenue (Outside and Related Party) 163 120 43 35.8 % Gain on Sale of 18.5% of CNX Gas 327 (327 ) (100.0 )% Other Income 170 107 63 58.9 % Total Revenue and Other Income $ 3,715 $ 3,810 $ (95 ) (2.5 )% The increase in company produced coal sales revenue, including related party, during the 2006 period was due to the increase in average sales price per ton, offset, in part, by decreased sales volumes. 2006 2005 Variance Percentage Change Produced Tons Sold (in millions) 67.6 68.9 (1.3 ) (1.9 )% Average Sales Price Per Ton $ 38.77 $ 35.54 $ 3.23 9.1 % Increased average sales price primarily reflects stronger prices negotiated in 2005 and early 2006 resulting from an overall improvement in prices in the eastern coal market for domestic and foreign power generators and steel producers. Sales of company produced coal decreased in the 2006 period due to lower company production causing fewer tons to be available for sale. Company produced coal production was 67.4 million tons in the 2006 period compared to 69.1 million tons in the 2005 period. The decrease in company purchased coal sales revenue was due to lower sales tons in the 2006 period compared to the 2005 period, offset, in part, by increased average sales price per ton of purchased coal. 2006 2005 Variance Percentage Change Purchased Tons Sold (in millions) 1.3 1.5 (0.2 ) (13.3 )% Average Sales Price Per Ton $ 55.87 $ 52.81 $ 3.06 5.8 % 55 Table of Contents Higher average sales prices were primarily due to sales of purchased coal tons being sold in higher priced export and metallurgical markets. The increase in gas sales revenue was due to a higher average sales price per thousand cubic feet sold and increased volumes in the 2006 period compared to the 2005 period. 2006 2005 Variance Percentage Change Produced Gas Sales Volumes (in billion cubic feet) 55.3 47.9 7.4 15.4 % Average Sales Price Per thousand cubic feet (including effects of derivative transactions) $ 7.04 $ 5.88 $ 1.16 19.7 % The increase in average sales price is primarily the result of selling the majority of our current year production at market rates that were higher than the prices we sold our gas under hedging contracts in the prior year. CNX Gas enters into physical fixed price gas supply transactions with various counterparties for terms varying in length. CNX Gas also enters into financial gas swap transactions that qualify as financial cash flow hedges. These financial gas swap transactions exist parallel to the underlying physical transactions. These physical and financial hedges represented approximately 27% of our produced gas sales volumes for the year ended December 31, 2006 at an average price of $7.42 per Mcf. In the prior year, these hedges represented approximately 70% of our produced gas sales volumes at an average price of $4.77 per Mcf. Sales volumes increased as a result of additional wells coming online from our on going drilling program and the 2005 period sales volumes being negatively impacted by the shutdown of Buchanan Mine due to the mine fire. 2006 2005 Variance Percentage Change Gas Royalty Interest Sales Volumes (in billion cubic feet) 7.6 6.6 1.0 15.2 % Average Sales Price Per thousand cubic feet $ 6.76 $ 6.92 $ (0.16 ) (2.3 )% Included in royalty interest gas sales are the revenues related to the portion of production associated with royalty interest owners. The decrease in average sales price is a function of the average CNX Gas sales price being higher in the prior year than the current year for royalty purposes. Sales volumes increased as a result of additional wells coming online from our on going drilling program and the 2005 period sales volumes being negatively impacted by the shutdown of Buchanan Mine due to the mine fire. 2006 2005 Variance Percentage Change Purchased Gas Sales Volumes (in billion cubic feet) 6.1 28.7 (22.6 ) (78.7 )% Average Sales Price Per thousand cubic feet $ 7.20 $ 9.59 $ (2.39 ) (24.9 )% Included in purchased gas sales revenue are volumes of gas we simultaneously purchased from and sold to the same counterparties between the segmentation and interruptible pools on the Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation (TCO) pipeline in order to satisfy obligations to certain customers. In accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent (EITF 99 19), we have historically recorded our revenues and our costs on a gross basis. However, because we adopted Emerging Issues Task Force 04 13 ,Accounting for Purchases and Sales of Inventory with the Same Counterparty (EITF 04 13) on January 1, 2006, purchased gas sales and volumes have decreased. EITF 04 13 requires the combining of matching buy/sell transactions, done in contemplation of one another, that were committed to on or after January 1, 2006. The net result for transactions that meet the above criteria are reflected in transportation expense in the current year. Additionally, there are low volumes of gas we purchase from third party producers at market prices less our gathering charge, which we then resell. The $27 million increase in revenues from the sale of industrial supplies was primarily due to increased sales volumes and higher average sales prices. 56 Table of Contents The $49 million increase in other sales was primarily attributable to revenues from river barge towing. CONSOL Energy has an initiative to increase towing revenues from outside parties now that we are no longer restricted under the Jones Act Bowater exemption. Prior to February 2004, foreign ownership of CONSOL Energy exceeded 25%, prohibiting us from providing river barge towing to third parties. In January 2006, CONSOL Energy completed the acquisition of Mon River Towing and J.A.R. Barge Line, LLC, which contributed to the increase in revenues. Freight revenue is based on weight of coal shipped, negotiated freight rates and method of transportation (i.e., rail, barge, truck, etc.) used for the customers to which CONSOL Energy contractually provides transportation services. Freight revenue is the amount billed to customers for transportation costs incurred. In July 2005, CONSOL Energy announced that it created CNX Gas Corporation, (CNX Gas) as a wholly owned subsidiary of CONSOL Energy, to conduct its gas exploration and production activities. In August 2005, CNX Gas sold 27.9 million shares of common stock. Proceeds of $420 million were received. CNX Gas used the proceeds to pay a special dividend to CONSOL Energy. The pre tax gain recognized on this transaction was $327 million. Other income consists of interest income, gain or loss on the disposition of assets, equity in earnings of affiliates, service income, royalty income, rental income and miscellaneous income. 2006 2005 Dollar Variance Percentage Change Business Interruption Insurance $ 79 $ 18 $ 61 338.9 % Royalty income 28 26 2 7.7 % Interest income 15 8 7 87.5 % Service income 13 11 2 18.2 % Gain on sale of assets 10 15 (5 ) (33.3 )% Equity in income of affiliates 1 3 (2 ) (66.7 )% Harmar Trust Settlement 7 (7 ) (100.0 )% Other miscellaneous 24 19 5 26.3 % Total other income $ 170 $ 107 $ 63 58.9 % Buchanan Mine experienced a fire that developed in the mine after a large rock fall behind our longwall mining section on February 14, 2005. The mine was temporarily sealed in order to extinguish the fire. Coal production resumed on June 16, 2005. CONSOL Energy filed an insurance claim for reimbursement of various costs and business interruption related to the fire at Buchanan Mine. During the year ended December 31, 2006, CONSOL Energy received proceeds from the insurance companies of $38 million. The $38 million was recognized as other income; coal segment recognized $29 million and gas segment recognized $9 million. We had received and recognized as other income $18 million of insurance proceeds in the 2005 period. We have received a total of $70 million from the insurance companies since the incident occurred. No additional reimbursement from the insurance carriers related to this claim will be recovered. Buchanan Mine also experienced a problem with the mines skip hoist mechanism on September 16, 2005 which caused the mine to be idled. Repairs to the skip hoist shaft and structures were completed and the mine resumed production on December 13, 2005. CONSOL Energy filed an insurance claim for reimbursement of various costs and business interruption related to the skip incident at Buchanan Mine. During the year ended December 31, 2006, CONSOL Energy recognized proceeds from the insurance companies of $41 million. The $41 million was recognized as other income; coal segment recognized $40 million and gas segment recognized $1 million. No additional reimbursement from the insurance carriers related to this claim will be recovered. Royalty income has increased due primarily to increased gas prices and additional production on existing royalty contracts. Royalty income received from third parties is calculated as a percentage of the third party sales price. 57 Table of Contents Interest income increased due to our improved cash position throughout 2006 compared to 2005. The improved cash position was primarily due to the August 2005 sale of 18.5% interest in CNX Gas. The private sale of this stock resulted in $420 million of proceeds. Service income represents various miscellaneous revenues from coal fines recovery projects, processing fees for third party coal and other miscellaneous activities. The increase in revenues is attributable to new agreements with third parties which allow them to recover coal fines from preparation slurry ponds for a fee. The decrease in gain on sale of assets in the 2006 period reflects various transactions that occurred throughout both periods, none of which were individually material. The equity in income of affiliates decreased in the period to period comparison due primarily to CONSOL Energys portion of a 2005 period gain on sale of land by an affiliate. Other income from the Harmar Environmental Trust (the Trust) Settlement was attributable to the Civil Division of the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny Countys decision to terminate a Trust among CONSOL Energy and other parties. The Trust was established in 1988 to provide funding for water treatment related to the now closed Harmar Mine. Other parties funded the Trust. CONSOL Energy was responsible to complete water treatment activities, but all costs associated with these activities were funded by the Trust Agreement. Any excess funding upon completion of water treatment or a specified date in the future was to be distributed to parties that originally funded the trust. In the decision, all previously funded, but unused, amounts remaining in the Trust were distributed. CONSOL Energys portion of the distributed funds was $15 million. CONSOL Energy is responsible for the ongoing water treatment at this facility. CONSOL Energy recorded the funds and the present value of the water treatment liability resulting in $6.5 million of income in the 2005 period. The $5 million increase in other income was due to various transactions that occurred throughout both periods, none of which were individually material. Costs 2006 2005 Dollar Variance Percentage Change Cost of Goods Sold and Other Charges Produced Coal $ 1,705 $ 1,613 $ 92 5.7 % Purchased Coal 80 89 (9 ) (10.1 )% Produced Gas 107 79 28 35.4 % Gas Royalty Interest 42 37 5 13.5 % Purchased Gas 45 279 (234 ) (83.9 )% Industrial Supplies 119 105 14 13.3 % Closed and Idle Mines 109 69 40 58.0 % Other 129 166 (37 ) (22.3 )% Total Cost of Goods Sold $ 2,336 $ 2,437 $ (101 ) (4.1 )% Increased cost of goods sold and other charges for company produced coal were due mainly to a 7.7% increase in cost per ton of produced coal sold and a 1.9% decrease in sales volumes. 2006 2005 Variance Percentage Change Produced Tons Sold (in millions) 67.6 68.9 (1.3 ) (1.9 )% Average Cost of Goods Sold and Other Charges Per Ton $ 25.22 $ 23.42 $ 1.80 7.7 % 58 Table of Contents Costs of goods sold and other charges for produced tons sold increased due mainly to an acceleration of previously unrecognized actuarial losses related to our salary pension plan. Our defined benefit pension plan for salaried employees allows such employees to receive a lump sum distribution for benefits earned through December 31, 2005 in lieu of annual payments when they retire from CONSOL Energy. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 88, Employers Accounting for Settlements & Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits, requires that when the lump sum distributions made for a plan year, which for CONSOL Energy is October 1 to September 30, exceed the total of the service cost and interest cost for the plan year, an adjustment equaling the unrecognized actuarial gain or loss resulting from each individual who received a lump sum in that year be recognized. The total accelerated actuarial amortization was $17.8 million, of which $13.8 impacted costs of goods sold and other charges for produced coal. Increased cost of goods sold and other charges were also attributable to higher supply costs, contract mining fees, labor costs, subsidence costs, and higher insurance premiums. Higher supply costs were attributable to additional maintenance projects and increased cost for electrical products, petroleum products and chemicals, such as diesel fuel and magnetite used in the mining and coal preparation process. Supply costs have also increased due to additional costs being incurred related to the adoption of new safety regulations, as previously discussed. Increased contract mining fees were attributable to increased fees negotiated with the contractors used primarily in our central Appalachian operations. Increased labor costs were attributable to increased employee counts and increased wages at certain mining operations. Employee counts have been increased in certain locations to maintain development rates ahead of the longwall mining units. New employees have also been added as trainees who will replace skilled employees expected to retire between now and the end of the decade. Increased employee counts were also necessary to maintain underground belt haulage systems and complete additional roof and rib support. Additional roof and rib support requirements have been necessary due to changes in underground geology and mining conditions. Labor rates were increased in order to stay competitive in certain labor markets. Higher subsidence costs reflect higher costs related to the Pennsylvania Department Environmental Protection regulation titled Surface Water Protection Underground Bituminous Coal Mining Operation. The application of this regulation requires additional costs when mining may affect perennial and intermittent streams. Subsidence costs also increased due to the location of mining activities affecting more surface structures in the 2006 period than in the 2005 period. Higher insurance premiums are attributable to higher costs of property damage and business interruption coverage in the 2006 period compared to the 2005 period. These increases in costs were offset, in part, by lower other post employment benefit costs, workers compensation costs and combined fund costs. Other post employment benefit costs were lower in the 2006 period compared to the 2005 period due to CONSOL Energys 2005 plan amendment removing the election of the Federal Subsidy provision of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the Act). Instead, we will coordinate benefits with available Medicare coverage considered the primary payer. Medicare is considered the primary payer under our plan. This plan amendment resulted in a reduction of the accumulated projected benefit obligation and will be amortized to earnings. Workers compensation expenses have been reduced due to lower state administrative fees charged by the state of West Virginia due to changes in that states workers compensation program. Unit costs were also improved due to lower combined fund costs as a result of lower monthly premiums as well as lower sales volumes in the period to period comparison. Purchased coal cost of goods sold and other charges decreased in the 2006 period compared to the 2005 period. 2006 2005 Variance Percentage Change Purchased Tons Sold (in millions) 1.3 1.5 (0.2 ) (13.3 )% Average Cost of Goods Sold and Other Charges Per Ton $ 60.47 $ 59.28 $ 1.19 2.0 % The higher average cost of purchased coal is primarily due to overall increases in prices for domestic coals. 59 Table of Contents Produced gas cost of goods sold and other charges increased due to increased sales volumes and higher unit costs. 2006 2005 Variance Percentage Change Produced Gas Sales Volumes (in billion cubic feet) 55.3 47.9 7.4 15.4 % Average Cost Per Thousand Cubic Feet $ 1.93 $ 1.65 $ 0.28 17.0 % The increase in average cost per thousand cubic feet of gas sold was primarily attributable to firm transportation. Firm transportation costs increased approximately $0.13 per thousand cubic feet in the period to period comparison. Approximately $0.06 per thousand cubic feet of the firm transportation increase is the result of the application of EITF 04 13, Accounting for Purchases and Sales of Inventory with the Same Counterparty as of January 1, 2006. EITF 04 13 requires the combining of matching buy/sell transactions, done in contemplation of one another, committed to on or after January 1, 2006. The net result for transactions that meet the above criteria are reflected in transportation expense in the current year. Previously, these transactions were accounted for as purchased gas revenue and purchased gas expense. Approximately $0.07 per thousand cubic feet of the increase in firm transportation was due to additional fees to purchase firm transportation capacity on the TCO interstate pipeline in order to avoid potential curtailments on portions of shipment capacity allocated to CNX Gas. The potential curtailments are due to increased demand for pipeline access in the 2006 period. Unit costs also increased due to higher power costs. Power costs per unit were $0.06 per thousand cubic feet higher due to both increased megawatt hour rates charged by our power provider and the use of more electric compressors during the current year that were previously powered by gas for most of the prior year. Salary and wages have also increased approximately $0.08 per thousand cubic feet due to additional staffing added to achieve desired drilling and production results. Unit costs have increased due to an additional $0.04 per thousand cubic feet related to leasing and brokering of land. Produced gas cost of goods sold per unit also increased by $0.06 per thousand cubic feet due to various transactions that occurred throughout both periods, none of which were individually material. These increases in unit costs were offset, in part, by lower well maintenance costs per unit. Maintenance costs per unit decreased $0.09 per thousand cubic feet in the period to period comparison. This improvement was due to maintenance projects being accelerated in prior periods. The improvement was also due to efficiencies in the water collection infrastructure being realized subsequent to the improvements that were made in the prior year. Well maintenance costs per unit also decreased due to additional production in the period to period comparison. 2006 2005 Variance Percentage Change Gas Royalty Interest Sales Volumes (in billion cubic feet) 7.6 6.6 1.0 15.2 % Average Cost Per Thousand Cubic Feet $ 5.54 $ 5.57 $ (0.03 ) (0.5 )% Included in royalty interest gas costs are the expenses related to the portion of production associated with royalty interest owners. The decrease in average cost per unit is a function of the market price in the current period compared to the prior period. Volumes increased as a result of additional wells coming online from our on going drilling program and the 2005 period sales volumes being negatively impacted by the shutdown of Buchanan Mine due to the mine fire. 2006 2005 Variance Percentage Change Purchased Gas Sales Volumes (in billion cubic feet) 6.1 28.7 (22.6 ) (78.7 )% Average Cost Per Thousand Cubic Feet $ 7.34 $ 9.71 $ (2.37 ) (24.4 )% Included in purchased gas costs are volumes of gas we simultaneously purchased from and sold to the same counterparties between the segmentation and interruptible pools on the Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation (TCO) pipeline in order to satisfy obligations to certain customers. In accordance with EITF 99 19, we have historically recorded our revenues and our costs on a gross basis. However, because we adopted EITF 04 13 on 60 Table of Contents January 1, 2006, purchased gas sales and volumes have decreased. The net result for transactions that meet the above criteria are reflected in transportation expense in the current period. The decrease in costs per unit is a function of the average sales price, before the effects of financial swap transactions, being higher in the prior year than in the current year. Additionally, there were small volumes of gas we purchase from third party producers at market prices less our gathering charge, which we then resell. Industrial supplies cost of goods sold increased $14 million primarily due to higher sales volumes and higher unit costs. Closed and idle mine cost of goods sold increased $40 million in the 2006 period compared to the 2005 period. These expenses increased $28 million due to Shoemaker Mine, VP #8 Mine and various other locations being idle for the majority of the 2006 period. These locations were in production for the full 2005 period. The increase was also attributable to higher expenses related to mine closing, perpetual care water treatment and reclamation liability adjustments that were the result of updated engineering surveys. Survey adjustments resulted in $10 million of additional expense in the 2006 period for closed and idled locations compared to the results of the survey adjustment in the 2005 period. Closed and idle mine cost of good sold and other charges also increased $2 million due to various transactions that occurred throughout both periods, none of which were individually material. Miscellaneous cost of goods sold and other charges decreased due to the following items: 2006 2005 Dollar Variance Percentage Change Buchanan Mine fire $ $ 34 $ (34 ) (100.0 )% Buchanan Mine skip hoist accident 3 (3 ) (100.0 )% Sales contract buy outs 13 (13 ) (100.0 )% Litigation settlements and contingencies 1 10 (9 ) (90.0 )% Incentive compensation 24 35 (11 ) (31.4 )% Bank fees 9 12 (3 ) (25.0 )% Accounts receivable securitization fees 2 (2 ) (100.0 )% Coal property holdings costs 9 10 (1 ) (10.0 )% Terminal/River operations 51 24 27 112.5 % Stock based compensation expense 23 4 19 475.0 % Miscellaneous transactions 12 19 (7 ) (36.8 )% Total Miscellaneous Cost of Goods Sold and Other Charges $ 129 $ 166 $ (37 ) (22.3 )% CONSOL Energys Buchanan Mine, located near Keen Mountain, Virginia, experienced a large rock fall behind its longwall mining section on February 14, 2005. While caving behind the longwall is a normal part of the mining process, the size of this cave in created a large air pressure wave that disrupted ventilation and also caused an ignition of methane gas in the area. CONSOL Energy temporarily sealed the mine in order to extinguish the fire that developed after the ignition. Various materials, including nitrogen foam and water were pumped into the mine in order to accelerate the process of creating an inert environment within the mine to extinguish the fire. Coal production resumed on June 16, 2005. Costs of goods sold incurred for the Buchanan Mine fire, net of expected insurance recovery, for the year ended December 31, 2005 were $34 million. The incident was covered under CONSOL Energys property and business interruption insurance policy as previously discussed. On September 16, 2005, CONSOL Energys Buchanan Mine also had an accident with its skip hoist, the device that lifts coal from underground to the surface, forcing the mine to suspend coal production. The braking mechanism on the hoist failed to hold a loaded skip at the surface before it could dump its load. The loaded skip fell approximately 1,600 feet back through the shaft to the bottom. Simultaneously, the empty skip was propelled upward to the surface as the loaded skip fell, causing the empty skip to strike the top of the hoist mechanism 61 Table of Contents before also falling back to the shaft bottom. Expenses related to clean up of the damaged hoist for the year ended December 31, 2005, were approximately $3 million. This accident was covered under our property and business interruption insurance policy. In the 2005 period, agreements were made to buy out sales contracts with several customers in order to release tons committed under lower priced contracts for sale to other customers at higher pricing. No such agreements were made in the 2006 period. Litigation settlements and contingencies in the 2005 period were attributable to a settlement agreement with certain lessors in western Kentucky. The settlement agreement included the transfer of certain properties and permits, as well as a cash payment to the lessors, with the lessors assuming all reclamation liability for the mine property which is being transferred. Various other contingencies were incurred in both periods, none of which were individually material. Incentive compensation expense decreased due to a lower amount projected to be paid to employees for the 2006 period compared to the 2005 period. The lower amount expected to be paid to employees is due to CONSOL Energy falling short of the predetermined earnings level under the plan. The incentive compensation program is designed to increase compensation to eligible employees when CONSOL Energy reaches predetermined earnings targets and the employees reach predetermined performance targets. Bank fees decreased primarily due to no borrowings on our credit facility being made throughout the 2006 period. Accounts receivable securitization fees decreased in the period to period comparison. No amounts have been drawn under this program in the 2006 period. Lower coal property holding costs were attributable to decreased expenses related to leasehold surrenders in the current period. CONSOL Energy has an initiative to increase towing revenues for outside parties now that we are no longer restricted under the Jones Act Bowater exemption. Prior to February 2004, foreign ownership of CONSOL Energy exceeded 25%, prohibiting us from providing river barge towing to third parties. This initiative to increase revenues has also increased costs. In January 2006, CONSOL Energy completed the acquisition of Mon River Towing and J.A.R. Barge Lines, LLC, which also contributed to the increase in costs. Effective January 1, 2006, CONSOL Energy adopted the fair value recognition provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R), Share Based Payment (SFAS 123R). Stock based compensation expense now includes compensation expense for all stock based compensation awards granted prior to, but not yet vested as of January 1, 2006. The grant date fair value is recognized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award, which is generally the option vesting term. Prior to implementing SFAS 123R, CONSOL Energy followed previously issued accounting guidance which did not require compensation expense to be recognized for stock option awards. Also, in April 2004, CONSOL Energy began to issue restricted stock units as part of its equity incentive plan. Compensation cost for the restricted stock units is based upon the closing share price at the date of grant and is recognized over the vesting period of the units. The increase in stock based compensation expense in the 2006 period is also due to additional compensation costs for restricted stock unit grants that occurred in the 2006 period. Miscellaneous cost of goods sold and other charges decreased $7 due to various transactions that occurred throughout both periods, none of which were individually material. 62 Table of Contents Freight expense is based on weight of coal shipped, negotiated freight rates and method of transportation (i.e., rail, barge, truck, etc.) used for the customers to whom CONSOL Energy contractually provides transportation. Freight expense is billed to customers and the revenue from such billing equals the transportation expense. 2006 2005 Dollar Variance Percentage Change Freight expense $ 163 $ 120 $ 43 35.8 % Selling, general and administrative costs have increased due to the following items: 2006 2005 Dollar Variance Percentage Change Wages and salaries $ 32 $ 27 $ 5 18.5 % Employee benefits 11 11 Professional, consulting and other purchased services 23 20 3 15.0 % Other 25 23 2 8.7 % Total Selling, General and Administrative $ 91 $ 81 $ 10 12.3 % Wages and salaries have increased in the period to period comparison due to additional positions being added related to CNX Gas, an 81.5% owned subsidiary, being a separate publicly traded company. Salary retirement costs increased due mainly to an acceleration of previously unrecognized actuarial losses related to our salary pension plan. Our defined benefit pension plan for salaried employees allows such employees to receive a lump sum distribution in lieu of annual payments when they retire from CONSOL Energy. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 88, Employers Accounting for Settlements & Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits, requires that when the lump sum distributions for benefits earned through December 31, 2005 made for a plan year, which for CONSOL Energy is October 1 to September 30, exceed the total of the service cost and interest cost for the plan year, an adjustment equaling the unrecognized actuarial gain or loss resulting from each individual who received a lump sum in that year be recognized. The total accelerated actuarial amortization was $17.8 million, of which $2.1 million impacted selling, general and administrative expense. The salary retirement increase was offset by a reduction in other post employment benefits. Other post employment benefit costs were lower in the 2006 period compared to the 2005 period due to CONSOL Energys 2005 plan amendment removing the election of the Federal Subsidy provision of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the Act). Instead, we will coordinate benefits with available Medicare coverage considered the primary payer. This plan amendment resulted in a reduction of the accumulated projected benefit obligation and will be amortized to earnings. Costs of professional, consulting and other purchased services were higher in the 2006 period compared to the 2005 period primarily due to additional costs related to CNX Gas being a separate publicly traded company throughout all of 2006, offset, in part, by reduction of professional, consulting and other purchased services by CONSOL Energy. Other selling, general and administrative costs increased $2 million due to various transactions that occurred throughout both periods, none of which were individually material. 63 Table of Contents Depreciation, depletion and amortization increased due to the following items: 2006 2005 Dollar Variance Percentage Change Coal $ 241 $ 214 $ 27 12.6 % Gas: Production 25 23 2 8.7 % Gathering 13 12 1 8.3 % Total Gas 38 35 3 8.6 % Other 17 13 4 30.8 % Total Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization $ 296 $ 262 $ 34 13.0 % The increase in coal depreciation, depletion and amortization was primarily attributable to assets placed in service after the 2005 period. Assets placed in service after the 2005 period include various airshafts, longwall assets, haulage assets and various other projects completed at our mines. The increase in gas production related depreciation, depletion and amortization was primarily due to the net effect of additional volumes in the current year and a slightly lower unit of production rate in 2006 compared to 2005. Rates are generally calculated using the net book value of assets at January 1, divided by either proved or proved developed reserves. Gathering depreciation, depletion and amortization is recorded on the straight line method and increased due to additional assets being placed in service in 2006, including the effects of the Jewell Ridge lateral pipeline. The Jewell Ridge lateral pipeline was completed in October 2006. CNX Gas entered into a 15 year firm transportation agreement with ETNG, a subsidiary of Duke Energy, at pre determined fixed rates. The present value of the payments under this firm transportation agreement is approximately $67 million. In addition to providing us with transportation flexibility, the Jewell Ridge lateral will provide access for our production to growing Southeastern and East Coal markets. Other depreciation increased $4 million in the 2006 period primarily due to the January 2006, acquisition of Mon River Towing and J.A.R. Barge Lines, LLC. The acquisition included 13 towboats and more than 350 barges with the capacity to transport 13 million tons of coal annually. Interest expense decreased in the 2006 period compared to the 2005 period. 2006 2005 Dollar Variance Percentage Change Long term Secured notes $ 24 $ 24 $ Capitalized lease 2 2 100.0 % Other (1 ) 3 (4 ) (133.3 )% Total Interest Expense $ 25 $ 27 $ (2 ) (7.4 )% Interest on long term debt remained consistent in the period to period comparison. Capitalized lease interest expense relates to an agreement that was entered into in March 2006. The agreement was for the acquisition of longwall equipment that was required to be treated as a capital lease under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 13, Accounting for Leases. Capitalized lease interest expense also increased due to the Jewell Ridge lateral pipeline coming on line in October 2006. The firm transportation agreement related to the use of this pipeline was also treated as a capital lease. Other interest expense decreased due to higher amounts of interest capitalized in the 2006 period compared to the 2005 period. Higher capitalized interest was attributable to the higher level of capital projects funded from operating cash flow in the 2006 period, primarily due to the slope, overland belt and preparation plant projects at the Robinson Run Mine. 64 Table of Contents Taxes other than income increased primarily due to the following items: 2006 2005 Dollar Variance Percentage Change Production taxes: Coal $ 157 $ 145 $ 12 8.3 % Gas 12 10 2 20.0 % Total Production Taxes 169 155 14 9.0 % Other taxes: Coal 71 62 9 14.5 % Gas 4 4 Other 9 8 1 12.5 % Other 84 74 10 13.5 % Total Taxes Other Than Income $ 253 $ 229 $ 24 10.5 % Increased coal production taxes are primarily due to higher severance taxes and higher black lung excise taxes attributable to higher average sales price. Severance taxes have also increased due to an additional tax imposed by the State of West Virginia. Under the new West Virginia severance tax rules, an additional $0.56 per ton of coal produced is due to the State. Increased gas production taxes are primarily due to higher severance taxes attributable to higher average sales price for gas and higher sales volumes. Other coal taxes increased due to higher property taxes. Property tax increases are primarily attributable to higher assessments in various counties where our coal holdings are located. Other coal taxes also increased due to capital stock and franchise taxes. Additional capital stock and franchise taxes are attributable to the higher earnings achieved in the year ended December 31, 2005. Other gas taxes remained consistent in the period to period comparison. Other miscellaneous taxes increased due to capital stock and franchise taxes. Additional capital stock and franchise taxes are attributable to the higher earnings achieved in the year ended December 31, 2005. 2006 2005 Variance Percentage Change Earnings Before Income Taxes and Minority Interest $ 551 $ 655 $ (104 ) (15.9 )% Tax Expense 112 64 48 75.0 % Effective Income Tax Rate 20.3 % 9.8 % 10.5 % CONSOL Energys effective tax rate is sensitive to changes to the relationship between pre tax earnings and percentage depletion, as well as increases and decreases in valuation allowances. See Note 7 Income Taxes in Item 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statement in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. CONSOL Energys effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2005 was impacted by the gain of $327 million resulting from the sale of 18.5% of CNX Gas stock, as previously discussed. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, no deferred tax has been provided on this transaction as current tax law provides a means by which the excess of the reported amount of this investment over its tax basis can be recovered tax free. Also, management has no current intention of entering into a transaction that would cause CNX Gas to leave the consolidated tax group. Minority Interest Minority interest represents 18.5% of CNX Gas net income which CONSOL Energy does not own. 65 Table of Contents Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2005 Compared with Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2004 Net Income Net income changed primarily due to the following items (table in millions): 2005 2004 Dollar Variance Percentage Change Coal Sales Produced and Purchased (Outside and Related Party) $ 2,527 $ 2,087 $ 440 21.1 % Produced Gas Sales 281 233 48 20.6 % Gas Royalty Interests 45 42 3 7.1 % Purchased Gas Sales 275 112 163 145.5 % Gain on Sale of 18.5% interest in CNX Gas 327 327 100.0 % Other Sales and Other Income 355 303 52 17.2 % Total Revenue and Other Income 3,810 2,777 1,033 37.2 % Coal Cost of Goods Sold Produced and Purchased 1,702 1,533 169 11.0 % Produced Gas Cost of Goods Sold 79 72 7 9.7 % Gas Royalty Interest Cost of Goods Sold 37 33 4 12.1 % Purchased Gas Cost of Goods Sold 279 113 166 146.9 % Other Cost of Goods Sold 340 250 90 36.0 % Total Cost of Goods Sold 2,437 2,001 436 21.8 % Other 719 693 26 3.8 % Total Costs 3,156 2,694 462 17.1 % Earnings Before Income Taxes, Minority Interest and Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting 654 83 571 688.0 % Income Tax Expense (Benefit) 64 (33 ) 97 293.9 % Earnings Before Minority Interest and Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle 590 116 474 408.6 % Minority Interest (9 ) (9 ) (100.0 )% Earnings Before Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle 581 116 465 400.9 % Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle 83 (83 ) (100.0 )% Net Income $ 581 $ 199 $ 382 192.0 % Earnings before cumulative effect of change in accounting for the 2005 period were improved primarily due to the gain on sale of 18.5% interest in CNX Gas. In August 2005, CNX Gas, a subsidiary of CONSOL Energy, sold 27.9 million shares in a private transaction. CNX Gas received proceeds of $420.2 million, which it used to pay a special dividend to CONSOL Energy. The proceeds received less the financial basis in the assets and liabilities given up by CONSOL Energy were recognized as a gain on sale of a subsidiarys stock in the year ended December 31, 2005. The pre tax gain recognized on this transaction was $327.3 million. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards Board No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, no deferred tax has been provided on this transaction as current tax law provides a means by which the excess of the reported amount of this investment over its tax basis can be recovered tax free. Also, management has no current intention of entering into a transaction that would cause CNX Gas to leave the consolidated tax group. Earnings before cumulative effect of change in accounting were also improved due to increased average sales prices for both coal and gas and increased volume of produced coal sold. These increases were offset, in part, by costs related to the Buchanan Mine fire and by higher cost per units sold for both coal and gas. Higher coal unit costs were primarily due to increased supply costs, higher labor costs, higher contractor mining fees and higher other post employment benefits. Higher gas unit costs were primarily due to increased royalty expense, imbalance charges and firm transportation expenses. Net income in the 2004 period included a cumulative effect of change in 66 Table of Contents accounting related to workers compensation. Effective January 1, 2004, CONSOL Energy changed our method of accounting for workers compensation. Prior to the change, CONSOL Energy recorded our workers compensation liability on an undiscounted basis. Under the new method, CONSOL Energy records our liability on a discounted basis. Revenue Revenue and other income increased due to the following items: 2005 2004 Dollar Variance Percentage Change Sales Produced Coal Outside and Related Party $ 2,448 $ 2,008 $ 440 21.9 % Purchased Coal 79 79 % Produced Gas 281 233 48 20.6 % Gas Royalty Interest 45 42 3 7.1 % Purchased Gas 275 112 163 145.5 % Industrial Supplies 93 79 14 17.7 % Other 35 27 8 29.6 % Total Sales 3,256 2,580 676 26.2 % Freight Revenue 120 110 10 9.1 % Gain on Sale of 18.5% of CNX Gas 327 327 100.0 % Other Income 107 87 20 23.0 % Total Revenue and Other Income $ 3,810 $ 2,777 $ 1,033 37.2 % The increase in company produced coal sales revenue, including related party, during the 2005 period was due mainly to the increase in average sales price per ton and increased sales volumes. 2005 2004 Variance Percentage Change Produced Tons Sold (in millions) 68.9 67.3 1.6 2.4 % Average Sales Price Per Ton $ 35.54 $ 29.84 $ 5.70 19.1 % The increase in average sales price primarily reflects stronger prices negotiated in 2004 and early 2005 resulting from an overall improvement in prices in the eastern coal market for domestic and foreign power generators and steel producers. The increase was also attributable to pricing premiums due to improved quality on coal shipments. The increase in tons sold was due primarily to increased production at McElroy, Loveridge, Bailey, the reactivation of Emery Mine in August 2004 and the opening of the Miller Creek complex in October 2004. These production increases were offset, in part, by a decrease in tons sold due to lower production at Buchanan and various contractor locations. The McElroy production increase is related to running two longwall mining units in the 2005 period compared to running one longwall mining unit in the 2004 period. The Loveridge production increase is due to the mine operating for the full twelve months of the 2005 period compared to only a portion of the 2004 period due to the fire at this location in 2003. Bailey production increases were due to increased productivity in the period to period comparison. Buchanan production decreased in the 2005 period due to a fire that developed in the mine after a large rock fall behind the longwall mining section on February 14, 2005. The mine was temporarily sealed in order to extinguish the fire. Buchanan resumed production on June 16, 2005. On September 16, 2005, Buchanan experienced an accident with the skip hoist which brings the coal from underground to the surface. The mine was idled until repairs to the skip hoist were completed. The mine resumed production on December 13, 2005. 67 Table of Contents Company purchased coal sales revenue remained consistent in the period to period comparison due to an increase in average sales price per ton of purchased coal, offset by reduced sales volumes. 2005 2004 Variance Percentage Change Purchased Tons Sold (in millions) 1.5 2.1 (0.6 ) (28.6 )% Average Sales Price Per Ton $ 52.81 $ 37.60 $ 15.21 40.5 % The increased average sales price is primarily due to sales of purchased coal tons being sold in higher priced export and metallurgical markets. Increased revenue from higher average sales prices were offset by lower sales volumes of purchased coal in the 2005 period compared to the 2004 period. The increase in produced gas sales revenue was due to a higher average sales price per thousand cubic feet sold in the 2005 period compared to the 2004 period. 2005 2004 Variance Percentage Change Produced Gas Sales Volumes (in billion gross cubic feet) 47.9 47.7 0.2 0.4 % Average Sales Price per thousand cubic feet (including effects of derivative transactions) $ 5.88 $ 4.89 $ 0.99 20.2 % We believe the 2005 gas market price increases were largely driven by continued concerns over levels of North American gas production, as well as increased oil prices and favorable economic conditions in the United States that encourage demand for natural gas. The adverse affect of the 2005 hurricane season also shut in significant portions of Gulf Coast gas, increasing the tight supply, and leading to even higher prices in 2005. CONSOL Energy enters into various physical gas swap transactions with both gas marketers and other counterparties for terms varying in length. CONSOL Energy has also entered into various gas swap transactions that qualify as financial cash flow hedges. These gas swap transactions exist parallel to the underlying physical transactions. These physical and financial hedges represented approximately 70% of our produced gas sales volumes for the year ended December 31, 2005 at an average price of $4.77 per thousand cubic feet. The increase in sales volumes were a result of additional volumes coming on line from our ongoing drilling program, and by successfully initiating a frac well enhancement and stimulation program on wells unaffected by the mine fire. This increase was offset by the loss of approximately 4.0 billion cubic feet of gas related to the Buchanan Mine incident and 1.4 billion cubic feet due to maintenance related capacity constraints on CONSOL Energys transportation capacity on the Columbia interstate pipeline. As a result of increased demand for pipeline use on the Columbia interstate pipeline, and the potential for curtailment on portions of the shipment capacity allocated to CONSOL Energy, we purchased firm transportation capacity on the pipeline during 2005. This arrangement offset a portion of the expected impact from periodic curtailments. In April 2005, we were given notice by Columbia regarding reductions in allowable gas flow due to routine maintenance and construction activities. Interruptible gas was completely shut in and our contracted firm transportation flows were reduced by 60% which resulted in reduced revenues of $6.8 million along with other smaller curtailments throughout the year that were also eventually lifted. 2005 2004 Variance Percentage Change Gas Royalty Interest Sales Volumes (in billion cubic feet) 6.6 6.9 (0.3 ) (4.3 )% Average Sales Price per thousand cubic feet $ 6.92 $ 6.06 $ 0.86 14.2 % Included in royalty interest gas sales are the revenues related to the portion of production associated with royalty interest owners. The increase in sales price is a function of the average gas price before the effects of financial swap transactions being higher in the current year than in the prior year. Volumes decreased due to 68 Table of Contents lower sales volumes related to the Buchanan Mine incidents and capacity constraints on the Columbia interstate pipeline, offset, in part, by additional volumes coming on line as a result of our on going drilling program. 2005 2004 Variance Percentage Change Purchased Gas Sales Volumes (in billion gross cubic feet) 28.7 17.5 11.2 64.0 % Average Sales Price per thousand cubic feet $ 9.59 $ 6.39 $ 3.20 50.1 % Additionally, we simultaneously purchased gas from and sold gas to other counterparties between the segmentation and interruptible pools on the Columbia interstate pipeline in order to satisfy obligations to certain customers. In accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force 99 19, we have increased our revenues and our costs. Sales of purchased gas volumes have increased primarily due to CONSOL Energy utilizing higher levels of firm transportation throughout the 2005 period that required us to purchase from and sell to other counterparties. CONSOL Energy began to enter into this type of transaction in May of 2004. The $14 million increase in revenues from the sale of industrial supplies was primarily due to increased sales volumes. The $8 million increase in other sales was attributable to revenues from river barge towing. Under the Jones Act Bowater exemption, because CONSOL Energy was more than 25% owned by a foreign company, we were prohibited from providing river barge towing to third parties. CONSOL Energy began third party river barge towing shortly after RWE AG divested their ownership interest in the 2004 period as we were no longer restricted by the Jones Act. Freight revenue is based on weight of coal shipped, negotiated freight rates and method of transportation (i.e., rail, barge, truck, etc.) used for the customers to which CONSOL Energy contractually provides transportation services. Freight revenue is the amount billed to customers for transportation costs incurred. On June 21, 2005, the Board of Directors of CONSOL Energy authorized the incorporation of CNX Gas Corporation (CNX Gas). On June 30, CNX Gas was incorporated and issued 100 shares of its $0.01 par value common stock to Consolidation Coal Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of CONSOL Energy. CNX Gas was incorporated to conduct CONSOL Energys gas exploration and production activities. In August 2005, CONSOL Energy contributed or leased substantially all of the assets of its gas business, including all of CONSOL Energys rights to coalbed methane associated with 4.5 billion tons of coal reserves owned or controlled by CONSOL Energy as well as all of CONSOL Energys rights to conventional gas. In exchange for CONSOL Energys contribution of assets, CONSOL Energy received approximately 122.9 million shares of CNX Gas common stock. CNX Gas entered into various agreements with CONSOL Energy that define various operating and service relationships between the two companies. In August 2005, CNX Gas entered into an agreement to sell approximately 24.3 million shares in a private transaction and granted a 30 day option to purchase an additional 3.6 million shares. In August 2005, CNX Gas closed on the sale of all 27.9 million shares. The shares were sold to qualified institutional, foreign and accredited investors in a private transaction exempt from registration under Rule 144A, Regulation S and Regulation D. In August 2005, a Registration Statement on Form S 1 was filed with the SEC with respect to those shares. The registration statement was declared effective on January 18, 2006. The proceeds (approximately $420.2 million including proceeds from the sale of the additional 3.6 million shares) were used to pay a special dividend to CONSOL Energy. The gain recognized on this transaction was $327.3 million. 69 Table of Contents Other income consists of interest income, gain or loss on the disposition of assets, equity in earnings of affiliates, service income, royalty income, rental income and miscellaneous income. 2005 2004 Dollar Variance Percentage Change Royalty Income $ 26 $ 19 $ 7 36.8 % Buchanan fire business interruption insurance proceeds 18 18 100.0 % Gain on sale of assets 15 41 (26 ) (63.4 )% Interest Income 8 5 3 60.0 % Harmar Trust Settlement 7 7 100.0 % Equity in income (loss) of affiliates 3 (4 ) 7 175.0 % Other miscellaneous 28 26 2 7.7 % Total Other Income $ 105 $ 87 $ 18 20.7 % Royalty income has increased due primarily to third parties producing more tonnage from CONSOL owned property in the period to period comparison. Buchanan Mine experienced a fire that developed in the mine after a large rock fall behind our longwall mining section on February 14, 2005. The mine was temporarily sealed in order to extinguish the fire. Coal production resumed on June 16, 2005. CONSOL Energy filed an insurance claim for reimbursement of various costs and business interruption related to the fire at Buchanan Mine. During the three months ended December 31, 2005, CONSOL Energy received an advance on the filed claim from the insurance companies. The portion of the advance related to fire abatement and various related costs relieved the previously established receivable. The portion related to business interruption was recognized as other income in the period received. The decrease in gain on sale of assets in the 2005 period reflects CONSOL Energys sale of stock in our wholly owned subsidiary CNX Australia Pty Limited to certain affiliates of AMCI, Inc. for $27.5 million, the assumption of approximately $21.3 million of debt, and associated interest rate swaps and foreign currency hedges in the 2004 period. The sale resulted in a pre tax gain of approximately $14.4 million. The additional gain on sale of assets in the 2004 period is primarily related to the sale of several previously closed operations. The 2005 period gain on sale of assets is primarily related to the sale of several previously closed operations. Interest income increased in the period to period comparison due to our improved cash position. Cash and cash equivalent balances at December 31, 2005 were $340.6 million compared to $6.4 million at December 31, 2004. The improved cash position was primarily due to the August sale of 18.5% interest in CNX Gas stock. The private sale of this stock resulted in $420.2 million of proceeds. Other income from the Harmar Environmental Trust (the Trust) Settlement was attributable to the Civil Division of the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny Countys decision to terminate a Trust among CONSOL Energy and other parties. The Trust was established in 1988 to provide funding for water treatment related to the now closed Harmar Mine. Other parties funded the trust. CONSOL Energy was responsible to complete water treatment activities, but all costs associated with these activities were funded by the Trust Agreement. Any excess funding upon completion of water treatment or a specified date in the future was to be distributed to parties that originally funded the trust. In the decision, all previously funded, but unused, amounts remaining in the Trust were distributed. CONSOL Energys portion of the distributed funds was $15.0 million. CONSOL Energy is responsible for the ongoing water treatment at this facility. CONSOL Energy recorded the funds and the present value of the water treatment liability resulting in $6.5 million of income in the 2005 period. The equity income of affiliates in the 2005 period is attributable to CONSOL Energys portion of a gain on sale of land by an affiliate. The equity losses of affiliates in the 2004 period is due mainly to the equity losses related to Glennies Creek Mine operating results prior to the sale that occurred in February 2004. 70 Table of Contents An additional $2 million increase in other income was due to various transactions that occurred throughout both periods, none of which were individually material. Costs 2005 2004 Dollar Variance Percentage Change Cost of Good Sold and Other Charges Produced Coal $ 1,613 $ 1,457 $ 156 10.7 % Purchased Coal 89 76 13 17.1 % Produced Gas 79 72 7 9.7 % Gas Royalty Interest 37 33 4 12.1 % Purchased Gas 279 113 166 146.9 % Industrial Supplies 105 94 11 11.7 % Closed and Idle Mines 69 72 (3 ) (4.2 )% Other 166 84 82 97.6 % Total Cost of Goods Sold $ 2,437 $ 2,001 $ 436 21.8 % Increased cost of goods sold and other charges for company produced coal was due mainly to an 8.2% increase in cost per ton of produced coal sold and a 2.4% increase in sales volumes. 2005 2004 Variance Percentage Change Produced Tons Sold (in millions) 68.9 67.3 1.6 2.4 % Average Cost of Goods Sold and Other Charges Per Ton $ 23.42 $ 21.64 $ 1.78 8.2 % Average cost of goods sold and other charges for produced coal increased due mainly to increased unit costs. This increase is attributable to higher supply costs, higher labor costs, higher contract mining fee costs and higher other post employment benefits per unit sold. Higher supply costs were attributable to increased maintenance costs and increased costs for steel, petroleum products and chemicals, such as magnetite, used in the mining and coal preparation process. Higher supply costs were also related to certain locations being in difficult mining conditions which increase costs on a per unit of output basis. Increased labor costs were attributable to increased employee counts and increased wages at certain mining operations. Mancounts have been increased in certain locations to maintain development rates ahead of the longwall mining units. Labor rates were increased in order to stay competitive in certain labor markets. Increased contract mining fees were attributable to increased fees negotiated with the contractors used primarily in our central Appalachian operations. Increased other post employment benefits were primarily due to the impact of cost increases for medical and drug benefits. Increased produced coal costs of goods sold was also due to higher sales volumes in the 2005 period compared to the 2004 period. These increases in costs were offset, in part, by reduced Combined Fund premiums related to a premium differential that was paid in the 2004 period. Due to the recent insured losses at our mines, property and business interruption insurance coverage may be difficult to renew at the current pricing levels and terms. Purchased coal cost of goods sold and other charges increased in the period to period comparison. 2005 2004 Variance Percentage Change Purchased Tons Sold (in millions) 1.5 2.1 (0.6 ) (28.6 )% Average Cost of Goods Sold and Other Charges Per Ton $ 59.28 $ 36.34 $ 22.94 63.1 % The higher average cost of purchased coal is primarily due to overall increases in prices for domestic coals, offset by reduced volumes of purchased coal sold. 71 Table of Contents Produced gas cost of goods sold and other charges increased due primarily to increased unit costs. 2005 2004 Variance Percentage Change Produced Gas Sales Volumes (in billion gross cubic feet) 47.9 47.7 0.2 0.4 % Average Cost Per Thousand Cubic Feet $ 1.65 $ 1.52 $ 0.13 8.6 % The increase in average cost per thousand cubic feet of gas sold was primarily attributable to increased royalty expense, offset, in part by changes in imbalance amounts. The average cost per thousand cubic feet of gas sold increased due to a $0.03 increase per thousand cubic feet of gas sold related to the purchase of firm transportation capacity on the Columbia interstate pipeline because of potential curtailments on portions of shipment capacity allocated to CONSOL Energy as a result of increased demand for pipeline access in the 2005 period. Cost per unit increased $0.01 per thousand cubic feet of gas sold due to higher well maintenance fees. These fees have increased due to more wells being serviced in 2005. The increase in average unit costs was also due to an increase of approximately $0.02 per thousand cubic feet in the period to period comparison due to changes in the gas imbalance amounts. Because contracted quantities of gas delivered to the pipeline rarely equal physical deliveries to customers, CONSOL Energy is responsible for monitoring this imbalance and requesting adjustments to contracted volumes as circumstances warrant. The increase in imbalance cost per unit sold was offset by corresponding increases in gas sales revenue. In addition, unit costs increased $0.02 per thousand cubic feet due to additional power expense as a result of converting several compressors from gas powered to electric powered in the 2005 period. An increase of $0.05 per thousand cubic feet was attributable to various costs which were incurred throughout both periods, none of which were individually material. 2005 2004 Variance Percentage Change Gas Royalty Interest Sales Volumes (in billion cubic feet) 6.6 6.9 (0.3 ) (4.3 )% Average Cost Per thousand cubic feet $ 5.57 $ 4.76 $ 0.81 17.0 % Included in royalty interest gas costs are the expenses related to the portion of production associated with royalty interest owners. The increase in sales price is a function of the average gas price, before the effects of financial swap transactions, being higher in the current year than in the prior year. Volumes decreased as a result of curtailments and maintenance related to capacity constraints, which were offset, in part, by additional wells coming on line. Purchased gas information is as follows: 2005 2004 Variance Percentage Change Purchased Gas Sales Volumes (in billion gross cubic feet) 28.7 17.5 11.2 64.0 % Average Cost Per Thousand Cubic Feet $ 9.71 $ 6.45 $ 3.26 50.5 % In connection with the purchase of firm transportation capacity on the Columbia pipeline, we purchased from and sold to other gas suppliers, which increased our revenues and our costs. CONSOL Energy believes this type of transaction may continue as a result of increased capacity demands on the Columbia pipeline. The 2004 period included a smaller volume of firm transportation activity as we did not begin to purchase this capacity until May of 2004. Industrial supplies cost of goods sold have increased $11 million primarily due to higher sales volumes. Closed and idle mine cost of goods sold was $3 million lower in the 2005 period compared to the 2004 period primarily due to lower workers compensation expense. Workers compensation expense related to closed and idled locations has decreased $9 million primarily due to the actuarial effects of several law changes in the state of West Virginia related to workers compensation. Lower expense was also due to Emery being active for 72 Table of Contents all of the 2005 period compared to being idled for most of the 2004 period. Other reductions in closed and idle mine cost of goods sold were due to various transactions that occurred throughout both periods, none of which were individually material. These improvements were offset, in part, by higher expenses related to mine closing, perpetual care water treatment and reclamation liability adjustments that were a result of updated engineering surveys. Survey adjustments resulted in $10 million of additional expense in the 2005 period for closed and idled locations compared to the results of the survey adjustments in the 2004 period. Miscellaneous cost of goods sold and other charges increased due to the following items: 2005 2004 Dollar Variance Percentage Change Incentive compensation $ 35 $ 25 $ 10 40.0 % Buchanan Mine fire 34 34 100.0 % Buchanan skip hoist accident 3 3 100.0 % Sales contract buy outs 13 9 4 44.4 % Bank fees 12 12 % Litigation settlements and contingencies 10 4 6 150.0 % Coal Property holding costs 10 5 5 100.0 % Stock based compensation expense 4 1 3 300.0 % Accounts receivable securitization fees 2 2 % Other post employee benefit curtailment gain (3 ) 3 100.0 % Buckeye landfill superfund site liability transfer (1 ) 1 100.0 % Miscellaneous transactions 43 30 13 43.3 % Total Miscellaneous Cost of Goods Sold and Other Charges $ 166 $ 84 $ 82 97.6 % Incentive compensation expense increased due to an increase in the projected amount expected to be paid out to employees for the 2005 period compared to the 2004 period. The incentive compensation program is designed to increase compensation to eligible employees when CONSOL Energy reaches predetermined earnings targets and the employees reach predetermined performance targets. CONSOL Energys Buchanan Mine, located near Keen Mountain, Virginia, experienced a large rock fall behind our longwall mining section on February 14, 2005. While caving behind the longwall is a normal part of the mining process, the size of this cave in created a large air pressure wave that disrupted ventilation and also caused an ignition of methane gas in the area. CONSOL Energy temporarily sealed the mine in order to extinguish the fire that developed after the ignition. Various materials, including nitrogen foam and water were pumped into the mine in order to accelerate the process of creating an inert environment within the mine to extinguish the fire. Coal production resumed on June 16, 2005. Costs of goods sold incurred, net of expected insurance recovery, for the year ended December 31, 2005 were $34 million. The Buchanan Mine was idled on September 16, 2005 following a problem with the mines skip hoist mechanism. Repairs to the skip hoist shaft and structures were completed and the mine resumed production on December 13, 2005. Expenses of approximately $3 million related to the damaged area were incurred during this time frame. Also, approximately $7 million were capitalized related to the installation and replacement of equipment and facilities damaged in the accident. We filed property damage and business interruption claims related to this incident. As of December 31, 2005, no insurance receivables have been recognized for these claims. In the 2005 and 2004 periods, agreements were made to buy out sales contracts with several customers in order to release tons committed under lower priced contracts for sale to other customers at higher pricing. Bank fees remained consistent in the period to period comparison. 73 Table of Contents Litigation settlements and contingencies increased in the 2005 period compared to the 2004 period. The increase is attributable to a proposed settlement agreement with certain lessors in western Kentucky which would require the transfer of certain properties and permits, as well as a cash payment to the lessors, with the lessors assuming all reclamation liability for the mine property which is being transferred. Various other contingencies were incurred in both periods, none of which were individually material. Coal property holding costs increased in the 2005 period primarily due to leasehold surrenders that occurred in 2005. In April 2004, CONSOL Energy began to issue restricted stock units as part of its equity incentive plan. Compensation cost for the restricted stock units is based upon the closing share price at the date of grant and is recognized over the vesting period of the units. The increase in stock based compensation expense in the 2005 period is due to compensation cost for the 2004 grants being recognized for the full 2005 period as well as additional compensation costs for restricted stock unit grants that occurred in the 2005 period. Accounts receivable securitization fees remained consistent in the period to period comparison. Due to the restructuring that occurred in December 2003, a curtailment gain related to the other post employment benefit plan of approximately $3 million was recognized in the 2004 period. Due to CONSOL Energys measurement date being September 30, the gain was not able to be recognized in the financial statements until the quarter ended March 31, 2004. In April 2004, CONSOL Energy entered into an Environmental Liability Transfer and Indemnity Agreement that transferred our liability related to the Buckeye Landfill Superfund Site to another party. In 1991, CONSOL Energy was named a potentially responsible party related to the Buckeye Landfill Superfund Site and accordingly recognized an estimated liability for remediation of this site. The Transfer and Indemnity transaction resulted in the reversal of the remaining liability and the recognition of approximately $1 million of income. Miscellaneous cost of goods sold and other charges increased $13 million due to various miscellaneous transactions that occurred throughout both periods, none of which were individually material. Freight expense is based on weight of coal shipped, negotiated freight rates and method of transportation (i.e., rail, barge, truck, etc.) used for the customers to whom CONSOL Energy contractually provides transportation. Freight expense is billed to customers and the revenue from such billing equals the transportation expense. 2005 2004 Dollar Variance Percentage Change Freight expense $ 120 $ 110 $ 10 9.1 % Selling, general and administrative costs have increased due to the following items: 2005 2004 Dollar Variance Percentage Change Professional consulting and other purchased services $ 20 $ 14 $ 6 42.9 % Wages and salaries 27 25 2 8.0 % Other 34 34 % Total Selling, General and Administrative $ 81 $ 73 $ 8 11.0 % Costs of professional consulting and other purchased services were higher in the 2005 period compared to the 2004 period primarily due to services provided related to various corporate initiatives. Wages and salaries have increased in the 2005 period due to additional employees hired in 2005. 74 Table of Contents Depreciation, depletion and amortization decreased due to the following items: 2005 2004 Dollar Variance Percentage Change Coal $ 214 $ 234 $ (20 ) (8.5 )% Gas: Production 23 22 1 4.5 % Gathering 12 11 1 9.1 % Total Gas 35 33 2 6.1 % Other 13 13 % Total Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization $ 262 $ 280 $ (18 ) (6.4 )% The decrease in coal depreciation, depletion and amortization was primarily attributable to the acceleration of approximately $32 million of depreciation for equipment and facilities at Rend Lake and other idle mines in the 2004 period. CONSOL Energys management reviewed the assets at these idled locations in conjunction with changes in mine plans for these locations. No plan of use for these items was determined. These pieces of equipment and facilities were considered abandoned and estimated useful lives were adjusted accordingly. Rend Lake and the other idled locations have existing coal reserves that may be accessed through new facilities or from other active locations. This decrease was offset, in part, by additional equipment being placed in service at active locations, such as McElroy Mine, Bailey Mine and Enlow Mine, after the 2004 period. Increases were also attributable to expansion projects, such as McElroy and Bailey refuse area and plant expansion, that were completed and in service in the 2005 period. The increase in gas production depreciation, depletion and amortization was primarily due to higher unit of production rates in the 2005 period compared to the 2004 period. Rates are generally calculated using the net book value of assets at the end of the year divided by proven developed reserves. Gathering depreciation, depletion and amortization is recorded on the straight line method and increased due to additional assets coming on line in 2005. Interest expense decreased in the 2005 period compared to the 2004 period. 2005 2004 Dollar Variance Percentage Change Short term borrowings $ $ 4 $ (4 ) (100.0 )% Long term Secured notes 24 25 (1 ) (4.0 )% Other 3 2 1 50.0 % Total Interest Expense $ 27 $ 31 $ (4 ) (12.9 )% Interest expense decreased primarily due to a reduction in the weighted average outstanding balance under short term borrowings in the 2005 period compared to the 2004 period. The weighted average outstanding balance was approximately $7 million in the 2005 period compared to $74 million in the 2004 period. The decrease in interest expense related to the 12 year and 15 year secured notes is attributable to the scheduled long term debt payment of $45 million for the 12 year secured note in June 2004. Other interest expense increased due to reduced amounts of interest capitalized in the 2005 period compared to the 2004 period. The reduced capitalized interest was attributable to the lower level of capital projects funded from operating cash flow, primarily due to the completion of the McElroy expansion project. 75 Table of Contents Taxes other than income increased primarily due to the following items: 2005 2004 Dollar Variance Percentage Change Production taxes: Coal $ 145 $ 122 $ 23 18.9 % Gas 10 9 1 11.1 % Total Production Taxes 155 131 24 18.3 % Other taxes: Coal 62 58 4 6.9 % Gas 4 4 Other 8 5 3 60.0 % Other 74 67 7 10.4 % Total Taxes Other Than Income $ 229 $ 198 $ 31 15.7 % Increased coal production taxes are primarily due to higher severance taxes and higher black lung excise taxes attributable to higher coal volumes and higher average sales price. Increased gas production taxes are primarily due to higher severance taxes attributable to higher average sales price for gas. Other coal taxes and other taxes have increased due primarily to increased franchise taxes related to the sale of 18.5% interest in CNX Gas. Other coal taxes have also increased due to lower miscellaneous tax credits from the state of Virginia, which are based on tonnage produced in that state. Due to Buchanan Mine production being idled from mid September to mid December 2005, Virginia based production for the fourth quarter 2005 was lower than production for the fourth quarter 2004. Income Taxes 2005 2004 Variance Percentage Change Earnings Before Income Taxes $ 655 $ 83 $ 572 689.2 % Tax Expense (Benefit) $ 64 $ (33 ) $ 97 293.9 % Effective Income Tax Rate 9.8 % (39.5 )% 49.3 % CONSOL Energys effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2005 was impacted by the gain of $327 million resulting from the sale of 18.5% interest in CNX Gas, as previously discussed. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, no deferred tax has been provided on this transaction as current tax law provides a means by which the excess of the reported amount of this investment over its tax basis can be recovered tax free. Also, management has no current intention of entering into a transaction that would cause CNX Gas to leave the consolidated tax group. CONSOL Energys effective tax rate is also sensitive to changes in the relationship between pre tax earnings and percentage depletion. See Note 7 Income Taxes to the consolidated financial statements included in this form 10 K for additional information. Minority interest represents the 18.5% of CNX Gas net income which CONSOL Energy does not own. Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle Effective January 1, 2004, CONSOL Energy changed our method of accounting for workers compensation. Prior to the change, CONSOL Energy recorded our workers compensation liability on an undiscounted basis. Under the new method, CONSOL Energy recorded our liability on a discounted actuarial basis, using various 76 Table of Contents assumptions, including discount rate and future cost trends. We believe this actuarial approach is more explicit in its methodology, which should lead to better estimates of the liability and related periodic costs. The change is also preferable because it aligns the accounting with our other long term employee benefit obligations, which are recorded on a discounted basis. Additionally, it provides a better comparison with our industry peers, the majority of which record the workers compensation liability on a discounted basis. As a result of the change, CONSOL Energy reduced our workers compensation liability by $136 million and reduced the related deferred tax asset by $53 million. The cumulative effect adjustment recognized upon adoption was a gain of $83 million, net of a tax cost of approximately $53 million. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period. Note 1 of the Notes to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10 K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates upon subsequent resolution of identified matters. Management believes that the estimates utilized are reasonable. The following critical accounting policies are materially impacted by judgments, assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Other Post Employment Benefits CONSOL Energy has historically provided retiree health benefits to employees that retire with at least ten years of service and have attained age 55. Effective August 1, 2003, the eligibility requirement for salaried employees was changed to either twenty years of service and age 55, or fifteen years of service and age 62. Additionally, any salaried or non represented hourly employees that are hired or rehired effective August 1, 2004 or later will not become eligible for retiree health benefits. In lieu of traditional retiree health coverage, if certain eligibility requirements are met, these employees may be eligible to receive a retiree medical spending allowance of $1,000 per year of service at retirement. Eligibility requirements for represented hourly employees at December 31, 2006 have not changed from CONSOL Energys historical requirements. Newly employed inexperienced employees represented by the UMWA, hired after January 1, 2007 will not be eligible to receive retiree benefits. In lieu of these benefits, these employees will receive a defined contribution benefit of $1 per each hour worked. At December 31, 2006, the retiree health plan provided benefits to approximately 24,250 of our former employees and their eligible dependents. The medical plan which covers eligible salaried employees and retirees also includes a cost sharing structure where essentially all participants contribute 20% of plan costs. Annual cost increases for the salary plan in excess of 6% are paid entirely by the salaried participants. After our review, various actuarial assumptions, including discount rate, expected trend in health care costs, average remaining service period, average remaining life expectancy and per capita costs, are used by our independent actuary to estimate the cost and benefit obligations for our retiree health plans. Effective December 31, 2005, a persistency assumption was introduced into the salaried retiree medical plan liability valuation. This assumption estimates the overall participation level in the plan in each future year. Due to the salaried plans cost sharing and trend capping design features, it is assumed that the overall level of plan participation will gradually drop to 50% of the current levels by 2021. Assumptions used in 2006 have not differed materially from the prior year actual experience. The discount rate is determined each year at the measurement date (currently September 30). The discount rate is an estimate of the current interest rate at which the Other Post Employment Benefit liabilities could be effectively settled at the measurement date. In estimating this rate, CONSOL Energy looks to rates of return on high quality, fixed income investments that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized ratings agency. For the year ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, the discount rate used to calculate the period end liability and the following years expense was 6.00% and 5.75%, respectively. A 0.25% increase in the discount rate would have decreased 2006 net periodic postretirement benefit costs by approximately $3.9 million. A 0.25% decrease in the discount rate would have 77 Table of Contents increased 2006 net periodic postretirement benefit costs by approximately $4.0 million. Deferred gains and losses are primarily due to historical changes in the discount rate and medical cost inflation differing from expectations in prior years. Changes to interest rates for the rates of returns on instruments that could be used to settle the actuarially determined plan obligations introduce substantial volatility to our costs. Accumulated actuarial gains or losses in excess of a pre established corridor are amortized on a straight line basis over the expected future service of active salary employees to their assumed retirement age. The average remaining service period for our salaried plans is approximately 11 years for the year ended December 31, 2006. Accumulated actuarial gains or losses in excess of a pre established corridor are amortized on a straight line basis over the expected remaining life of our retired United Mine Workers of America (UMWA) population. The average remaining service period of this population is not used for amortization purposes because the majority of the UMWA population of our plan is retired. The average remaining life expectancy of our retired UMWA population used to calculate the following years expense is approximately 13 years for the year ended December 31, 2006. Per capita costs on a per annum basis for Other Postretirement Benefits were assumed to be $6,759 at December 31, 2006. This was approximately a 5.43% increase over the per capita cost on a per annum basis at December 31, 2005 after adjusting for demographic shifts. The increase was due to healthcare cost trends and demographic shifts in participants. If the actual increase in per capita cost of medical services or other post retirement benefits are significantly greater or less than the projected trend rates, the per capita cost assumption would need to be adjusted annually, which could have a significant effect on the costs and liabilities recognized in the financial statements. Significant increases in health and prescription drug costs for represented hourly retirees could have a material adverse effect on CONSOL Energys operating cash flow. The effect on CONSOL Energys cash flow from operations for salaried and non represented hourly employees has been limited to approximately 6% of the previous years medical cost for salaried employees due to the cost sharing provision in the benefit plan. On September 29, 2006 Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans (SFAS 158) was issued. SFAS 158 requires, among other things, the recognition of the funded status of each defined pension benefit plan and other postretirement benefit plan on the balance sheet. Each overfunded plan is recognized as an asset and each underfunded plan is recognized as a liability. The initial impact of the standard, as well as subsequent changes, in the funded status of the plans is recognized as a component of accumulated comprehensive income in stockholders equity. Additional minimum pension liabilities and related intangible assets are no longer recognized upon adoption of the new standard. Additionally, SFAS 158 requires an employer to measure the funded status of its plans as of the date of its year end statement of financial position. This provision becomes effective for CONSOL Energy for its December 31, 2008 year end. Currently, CONSOL Energy uses a September 30 measurement date for its pension and other postretirement benefit plans. The estimated liability recognized in the December 31, 2006 financial statements after the impact of SFAS 158 was $2.4 billion. The recognition of SFAS 158 resulted in an increase of $652.5 million to the Other Post Employment liability, an increase in our deferred tax asset of approximately $228.5 million and a decrease to Other Comprehensive Income of $424.0 million. For the year ended December 31, 2006 we paid approximately $122.9 million for Other Post Employment Benefits, all of which were paid from operating cash flow. Our obligations with respect to these liabilities are unfunded at December 31, 2006. CONSOL Energy does not expect to contribute to the other post employment plan in 2007. We intend to pay benefit claims as they are due. CONSOL Energy recognized the effects of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act (Medicare Part D) of 2003 (the Act) in the year ended December 31, 2004 in accordance with FASB Staff Position No. 106 2, Accounting and Disclosure Requirements related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003. In December 2005, CONSOL Energy amended its election of the Federal Subsidy provision of the Act. Instead, we will coordinate benefits with available Medicare coverage considered the primary payer so that CONSOL Energys plan pays secondary to Medicare. The 2005 plan amendment resulted in a net reduction of $150 million in the accumulated projected benefit obligation (APBO) and is reflected as a plan amendment and as an actuarial (gain)/loss. In 2006, there was an additional 78 Table of Contents plan amendment related to Medicare Part D which specified that CONSOL Energy would pay the related premiums for certain participants. This amendment increased the APBO by $37 million. These adjustments will be amortized to earnings over approximately 10 years. Salaried Pensions CONSOL Energy has non contributory defined benefit retirement plans covering substantially all employees not covered by multiemployer plans. The benefits for these plans are based primarily on years of service and employees pay near retirement. Effective January 1, 2006, employees hired between August 1, 2004 and December 31, 2005 that were not previously eligible to participate in the plans will begin accruing service. The CONSOL Energy salaried plan allows for lump sum distributions earned up until December 31, 2005 at the employees election. As of January 1, 2006, lump sum benefits have been frozen and the lump sum option has been eliminated for benefits accrued prospectively. Effective January 1, 2007, employees hired by CNX Gas, an 81.5% owned subsidiary, will not be eligible to participate in CNX Gas non contributory defined benefit retirement plan. In lieu of participation in the non contributory defined benefit plan, these employees will begin receiving an additional 3% company contribution into their defined contribution plan. CNX Gas employees who were hired prior to December 31, 2005 or who were employees of CONSOL Energy prior to this date were given a one time opportunity to elect to remain in the defined benefit plan or opt to freeze their service accruals and participate in the additional 3% company contribution into their defined contribution plan. All employees hired on or after January 1, 2006 but on or before December 31, 2006 will have their current non contributory defined benefit frozen and will begin receiving the additional 3% company contribution into their defined contribution plan, effective January 1, 2007. CNX Gas intends to freeze all defined benefit accruals after ten years for CNX Gas employees that elected to remain in the defined benefit plan. Our independent actuaries calculate the actuarial present value of the estimated retirement obligation based on assumptions including rates of compensation, mortality rates, retirement age and interest rates. These assumptions have not differed materially from the prior year actual experience. For the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, compensation increases are assumed to range from 3% to 6% depending on age and job classification. Retirement rate assumptions were unchanged for the year ended December 31, 2006. Retirement rate assumptions begin at 1% for employees at age 50 and increase to 100% for employees at age 65. The discount rate is determined each year at the measurement date (currently September 30). The discount rate is an estimate of the current interest rate at which the retirement plans could be effectively settled at the measurement date. In estimating this rate, CONSOL Energy looks to rates of return on high quality, fixed income investments that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized ratings agency. For the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, the discount rate used to calculate the period end liability and the following years expense was 6.00% and 5.75%, respectively. A 0.25% increase in the discount rate would have decreased the 2006 net periodic pension cost by $0.8 million. A 0.25% decrease in the discount rate would have increased the 2006 net periodic pension cost by $0.9 million. Deferred gains and losses are primarily due to historical changes in the discount rate and earnings on assets differing from expectations in prior years. The average remaining service period is approximately 11 years for the year ended December 31, 2006. Changes to any of these assumptions introduce substantial volatility to our costs. The estimated liability at December 31, 2006 after the implementation of SFAS 158 was $116.8 million. The recognition of SFAS 158 resulted in an increase of $68.1 million in our salary retirement plan liability, an increase in our deferred tax assets of $26.5 million and a decrease to other comprehensive income of $41.6 million. CONSOL Energy expects to contribute approximately $76.0 million to the pension plan in 2007. The market related asset value is derived by taking the cost value of assets as of September 30, 2006 and multiplying it by the average 36 month ratio of the market value of assets to the cost value of assets. CONSOL Energys pension plan weighted average asset allocations at September 30, 2006 consisted of 60% equity securities and 40% debt securities. 79 Table of Contents The CONSOL Energy salaried plan allows for lump sum distributions earned up until December 31, 2005 at the employees election. As of January 1, 2006, lump sum benefits have been frozen and prospectively the lump sum option has been eliminated. According to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 88, Employers Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits, if the lump sum distributions made for the plan year, which is October 1 to September 30, exceed the total of the service cost and interest cost for the plan year, settlement accounting is required. Lump sum payments exceeded this threshold during 2006. CONSOL Energy recognized expense of $17.8 million in the current years results of operations. The adjustment equaled the previously unrecognized actuarial loss resulting from each individual who received a lump sum in that year. CONSOL regularly monitors this situation. If this settlement accounting is triggered again in the future, the adjustment could materially impact operating results. Workers Compensation and Coal Workers Pneumoconiosis Workers compensation is a system by which individuals who sustain employment related physical injuries or some type of occupational diseases are compensated for their disabilities, medical costs, and on some occasions, for the costs of their rehabilitation. Workers compensation will also compensate the survivors of workers who suffer employment related deaths. The workers compensation laws are administered by state agencies with each state having its own set of rules and regulations regarding compensation that is owed to an employee that is injured in the course of employment. CONSOL Energy records an actuarially calculated liability, which is determined using various assumptions, including discount rate and future cost trends. The discount rate is determined each year at the measurement date (currently September 30). The discount rate is an estimate of the current interest rate at which the workers compensation liabilities could be effectively settled at the measurement date. In estimating this rate, CONSOL Energy looks to rates of return on high quality, fixed income investments that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized ratings agency. For the year ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, the discount rate used to calculate the period end liability and the following years expense was 6.00% and 5.75%, respectively. A 0.25% increase or decrease in the discount rate would not have materially decreased or increased the 2005 workers compensation expense. The estimated liability after the impact of SFAS 158 recognized in the financial statements at December 31, 2006, was approximately $166.7 million. The recognition of SFAS 158 resulted in a decrease of $35.2 million in our workers compensation liability, a decrease in our deferred tax asset of $13.7 million and an increase in other comprehensive income of $21.5 million. CONSOL Energys policy has been to provide for workers compensation benefits from operating cash flow. No funding has been provided to cover these benefits. For the year ended December 31, 2006, we made payments for workers compensation benefits of approximately $43.2 million, all of which was paid from operating cash flow. CONSOL Energy is responsible under the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969, as amended, for medical and disability benefits to employees and their dependents resulting from occurrences of coal workers pneumoconiosis disease. CONSOL Energy is also responsible under various state statutes for pneumoconiosis benefits. After our review, our independent actuaries calculate the actuarial present value of the estimated pneumoconiosis obligation based on assumptions regarding disability incidence, medical costs, mortality, death benefits, dependents and discount rates. The discount rate is determined each year at the measurement date (currently September 30). The discount rate is an estimate of the current interest rate at which the Coal Workers Pneumoconiosis liabilities could be effectively settled at the measurement date. In estimating this rate, CONSOL Energy looks to rates of return on high quality, fixed income investments that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized ratings agency. For the year ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, the discount rate used to calculate the period end liability and the following years expense was 6.00% and 5.75%, respectively. In January 2001, the United States Department of Labor amended the regulations implementing the federal black lung laws to give greater weight to the opinion of a claimants treating physician, expand the definition of black lung disease and limit the amount of medical evidence that can be submitted by claimants and respondents. The amendments also alter administrative procedures for the adjudication of claims, which according to the Department of Labor, results in streamlined procedures that are less formal, less adversarial and easier for participants to understand. The estimated liability recognized in the financial 80 Table of Contents statements at December 31, 2006 after the implementation of SFAS 158 was approximately $195.6 million. The recognition of SFAS 158 resulted in a decrease of $215.8 million in our Coal Workers Pneumoconiosis liability, a decrease of approximately $84.0 million in our deferred tax asset and an increase to Other Comprehensive Income of $131.8 million. For the year ended December 31, 2006, we paid Coal Workers Pneumoconiosis benefits of approximately $10.8 million. Our obligations with respect to these liabilities are unfunded at December 31, 2006. Reclamation and Mine Closure Obligations The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act establishes operational, reclamation and closure standards for all aspects of surface mining as well as most aspects of deep mining. CONSOL Energy accrues for the costs of current mine disturbance and final mine and gas well closure, including the cost of treating mine water discharge where necessary. Estimates of our total reclamation and mine closing liabilities, which are based upon permit requirements and CONSOL Energy engineering expertise related to these requirements, including the current portion, were approximately $454.5 million at December 31, 2006. This liability is reviewed annually by CONSOL Energy management and engineers. The estimated liability can significantly change if actual costs vary from assumptions or if governmental regulations change significantly. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations (SFAS No. 143) requires that the fair value of an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The present value of the estimated asset retirement costs is capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset. Asset retirement obligations primarily relate to the closure of mines and gas wells and the reclamation of land upon exhaustion of coal and gas reserves. Changes in the variables used to calculate the liabilities can have a significant effect on the mine closing, reclamation and gas well closing liabilities. The amounts of assets and liabilities recorded are dependent upon a number of variables, including the estimated future retirement costs, estimated proven reserves, assumptions involving profit margins, inflation rates, and the assumed credit adjusted risk free interest rate. SFAS No. 143 requires depreciation of the capitalized asset retirement cost and accretion of the asset retirement obligation over time. The depreciation will generally be determined on a units of production basis, whereas the accretion to be recognized will escalate over the life of the producing assets, typically as production declines. Deferred Taxes CONSOL Energy accounts for income taxes in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS No. 109) which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax basis of recorded assets and liabilities. SFAS No. 109 also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. All available evidence both positive and negative, must be considered in determining the need for a valuation allowance. At December 31, 2006, CONSOL Energy has deferred tax assets in excess of deferred tax liabilities of approximately $625.2 million. The deferred tax assets are evaluated periodically to determine if a valuation allowance is necessary. During 2006 CONSOL Energy concluded that a valuation allowance was no longer warranted against a portion of its state net operating loss carry forwards in certain tax jurisdictions. In 2007 CONSOL Energy will implement certain prudent and feasible tax strategies to insure the realization of Pennsylvania loss carry forward tax benefits. The value of CONSOL Energys net operating loss carry forwards increased significantly in 2006 as a result of a change in the Pennsylvania Statute which increased the annual limitation on the deduction for net operating losses to be applied against future taxable income from $2 million to the greater of $3 million or 12.5% of taxable income for tax years beginning after 2006. CONSOL Energys valuation allowance attributable to its operating loss carry forwards in West Virginia was also released during 2006. CONSOL Energy reported a 81 Table of Contents cumulative tax loss for West Virginia tax purposes for the three year period that includes December 31, 2004 through December 31, 2006 due to non recurring tax return adjustments in 2004 and 2005 relating to adoption of SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, non taxable OPEB subsidy accruals, and the refund of reclamation proceeds. Absent the non recurring tax adjustments CONSOL Energy would have reported cumulative taxable income on its West Virginia tax returns for the three year period. Based on the analysis of prior years tax filings and projections of West Virginia taxable income for 2006 and future years, management believes that the benefits of the state operating loss carry forwards will be realized. As a result of the reduction of the valuation allowance relating to Pennsylvania and West Virginia operating loss carry forwards, CONSOL Energy reported a state income tax benefit in 2006 of $28,747 on an after Federal tax adjusted basis. For 2006, CONSOL Energy continues to report a deferred tax asset of approximately $38.2 million relating to the remainder of CONSOL Energys state net operating loss carry forwards with a full valuation allowance. A review of the positive and negative evidence regarding these benefits, primarily the history of book and tax losses on a separate company basis, concluded that a valuation allowance was warranted. A valuation allowance of $28.7 million has also been recorded against the deferred state tax asset attributable to future deductible differences for certain subsidiaries with histories of book and tax losses. These net operating losses expire at various times from 2007 to 2026. Management will continue to assess the realization of deferred tax assets based upon updated income forecast data and the feasibility of future tax planning strategies, and may record adjustments to valuation allowances against deferred tax assets in future periods as appropriate that could materially impact net income. Stock Options Prior to January 1, 2006, CONSOL Energy accounted for stock based compensation under the recognition and measurement provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion (APB) No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, as amended. Generally no stock based employee compensation cost for stock options is reflected in net income, as all options granted under the plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of the grant. On January 1, 2006, we adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R, Share Based Payments (SFAS No. 123R) using the modified prospective transition method. SFAS No. 123 eliminates the option of using the intrinsic value method of accounting previously available under APB No. 25, and requires companies to recognize in the financial statements the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of those awards. CONSOL Energy recorded $9.2 million of expense, net of tax, as a result of the adoption of SFAS 123R. We anticipate the future impact of SFAS 123R to approximate current year expense. The Black Scholes option pricing model is used to determine fair value of stock options at the grant date. Various inputs are utilized in the Black Scholes pricing model, such as: stock price on measurement date, exercise price defined in the award, expected dividend yield based on historical trend of dividend payouts, risk free interest rate based on a zero coupon treasury bond rate, expected term based on historical grant and exercise behavior, and expected volatility based on historic and implied stock price volatility of CONSOL Energy stock and public peer group stock. These factors can significantly impact the value of stock options expense recognized over the requisite service period of option holders. As of December 31, 2006, $17.5 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested awards is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.34 years. See Note 19 to our audited financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10 K for more information. 82 Table of Contents Contingencies CONSOL Energy is currently involved in certain legal proceedings. We have accrued our estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of these claims. This estimate has been developed in consultation with legal counsel involved in the defense of these matters and is based upon an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies. Future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the outcome of these proceedings. Successful Efforts Accounting We are required to select among alternative acceptable accounting policies. There are two generally acceptable methods for accounting for oil and gas producing activities. The full cost method allows the capitalization of all costs associated with exploring for, acquiring and developing oil and natural gas reserves. The successful efforts method allows only for the capitalization of costs directly associated with exploring for, acquiring and developing proven natural gas properties. Costs related to exploration that are not successful are expensed when it is determined that commercially productive gas reserves were not found. We have elected to use the successful efforts method to account for our gas producing activities. Coal and Gas Reserve Values There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities and values of economically recoverable coal and gas reserves, including many factors beyond our control. As a result, estimates of economically recoverable coal and gas reserves are by their nature uncertain. Information about our reserves consists of estimates based on engineering, economic and geological data assembled and analyzed by our staff. Our gas reserves have been reviewed by independent experts. Approximately 60% of our 2005 reported reserves have been reviewed and confirmed by an independent third party consultant. Some of the factors and assumptions which impact economically recoverable reserve estimates include: geological conditions; historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas; the assumed effects of regulations and taxes by governmental agencies; assumptions governing future prices; and future operating costs. Each of these factors may in fact vary considerably from the assumptions used in estimating reserves. For these reasons, estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of coal and gas attributable to a particular group of properties, and classifications of these reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of future net cash flows, may vary substantially. Actual production, revenues and expenditures with respect to our reserves will likely vary from estimates, and these variances may be material. See Risk Factors in Item 1A of this report for a discussion of the uncertainties in estimating our reserves. Liquidity and Capital Resources CONSOL Energy generally has satisfied our working capital requirements and funded our capital expenditures and debt service obligations from cash generated from operations and proceeds from borrowings. We utilize a $750 million revolving credit facility which expires in 2010. The facility is collateralized by liens on substantially all of the assets of CONSOL Energy and our wholly owned subsidiaries. Collateral is shared equally and ratably with the holders of CONSOL Energys 7.875% bonds that mature in 2012 and CONSOL Energys subsidiarys 8.25% medium term notes maturing in 2007. Fees and interest rate spreads are based on a ratio of financial covenant debt to twelve month trailing earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). Covenants in the facility limit our ability to dispose of assets, make investments, 83 Table of Contents purchase or redeem CONSOL Energy common stock and merge with another corporation. The facility includes a leverage ratio covenant of not more than 3.25 to 1.00, measured quarterly. This ratio was 0.59 to 1.00 at December 31, 2006. The facility also includes an interest coverage ratio covenant of no less than 4.50 to 1.00, measured quarterly. This ratio was 16.83 to 1.00 at December 31, 2006. At December 31, 2006, this facility had approximately $393 million letters of credit issued and had no outstanding borrowings, leaving approximately $357 million of unused capacity. We have been notified that approximately $118 million of financial security, currently provided through issuance of letters of credit, will be no longer required by the 1992 Fund. The reduction of security is due to the legislative change that The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act Amendments of 2006 provides. The new legislation requires certain annual transfers to be made from the Abandoned Mine Land (AML) program to the Combined Fund, 1992 fund and the 1993 Fund. The current law was amended so that after a phase in period, the new legislation removes the annual cap on the amount of interest to be transferred and requires annual transfers of AML Fund interest to the Combined Benefit Fund, 1992 Fund and 1993 Fund to pay the health care benefits of retirees whose employers have gone out of business. Previous to the legislative change, benefits of retirees whose employers have gone out of business have been paid by the surviving companies participating in the funds. Because this funding requirement will be eliminated after the phase in period, security required by the funds has been reduced. On October 7, 2005, CNX Gas, an 81.5% controlled and consolidated subsidiary of CONSOL Energy, entered into a credit agreement with a group of commercial lenders. The credit agreement provides for a revolving credit facility providing an initial aggregate outstanding principal amount of up to $200 million, including borrowings and letters of credit. CNX Gas also has the ability to request an increase in aggregate outstanding principal amount of up to $300 million, including borrowings and letters of credit. This facility includes a leverage ratio covenant of not more than 3.00 to 1.00, measured quarterly. This ratio was 0.00 to 1.00 at December 31, 2006. The facility also includes an interest coverage ratio covenant of no less than 3.00 to 1.00, measured quarterly. This ratio was met at December 31, 2006. At December 31, 2006, this facility had approximately $17 million letters of credit issued and had no outstanding borrowings, leaving approximately $183 million of unused capacity. As a result of entering into the new credit agreement, CNX Gas and their subsidiaries executed a Supplemental Indenture and as of October 21, 2005 are also guarantors of CONSOL Energys 7.875% bonds. CONSOL Energy and certain of our U.S. subsidiaries also participate in a receivables securitization facility for the sale on a continuous basis of eligible trade accounts receivable that will provide, on a revolving basis, up to $125.0 million of short term funding. CONSOL Energy formed CNX Funding Corporation, a wholly owned, special purpose, bankruptcy remote subsidiary, for the sole purpose of buying and selling eligible trade receivables generated by certain subsidiaries of CONSOL Energy. Under the receivables facility, CONSOL Energy and certain subsidiaries, irrevocably and without recourse, sell all of their eligible trade accounts receivable to CNX Funding Corporation. CNX Funding Corporation then sells, on a revolving basis, an undivided percentage interest in the pool of eligible trade accounts receivable to financial institutions and their affiliates, while maintaining a subordinated interest in a portion of the trade receivables. CONSOL Energy has agreed to continue servicing the sold receivables for the financial institutions for a fee based upon market rates for similar services. The cost of funds is consistent with commercial paper rates plus a charge for administrative services paid to the financial institution. The receivables facility expires in April 2007, although CONSOL Energy intends to renew the facility. No accounts receivable were removed from the consolidated balance sheet related to this facility during the year ended December 31, 2006 as all eligible accounts receivables have been retained. CONSOL Energy believes that cash generated from operations and our borrowing capacity will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements, anticipated capital expenditures (other than major acquisitions), scheduled debt payments, anticipated dividend payments and to provide required letters of credit. Nevertheless, the ability of CONSOL Energy to satisfy our working capital requirements, debt service obligations, to fund 84 Table of Contents planned capital expenditures or pay dividends will depend upon future operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions in the coal and gas industries and other financial and business factors, some of which are beyond CONSOL Energys control. In order to manage the market risk exposure of volatile natural gas prices in the future, CONSOL Energy enters into various physical gas supply transactions with both gas marketers and end users for terms varying in length. CONSOL Energy has also entered into various gas swap transactions that qualify as financial cash flow hedges, which exist parallel to the underlying physical transactions. The fair value of these contracts was a gain of $2.5 million (net of $1.6 million of deferred tax) at December 31, 2006. The ineffective portion of the changes in the fair value of these contracts was insignificant to earnings in the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005. CONSOL Energy frequently evaluates potential acquisitions. CONSOL Energy has funded acquisitions primarily with cash generated from operations and a variety of other sources, depending on the size of the transaction, including debt financing. There can be no assurance that additional capital resources, including debt financing, will be available to CONSOL Energy on terms which CONSOL Energy finds acceptable, or at all. Cash Flows (in millions) 2006 2005 Change Cash flows from operating activities $ 665 $ 409 $ 256 Cash used in investing activities $ (662 ) $ (74 ) $ (588 ) Cash used in financing activities $ (120 ) $ $ (120 ) Cash flows from operating activities have increased primarily due to the following items: Operating cash flows improved $155 million due to increases in earnings excluding the gain on sale of 18.5% of CNX Gas, as previously discussed in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Operating cash flows were lower in the 2005 period due to $125 million repaid under the accounts receivable securitization program during the year ended December 31, 2005. The accounts receivable securitization program had no activity during the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating cash flows were higher by approximately $6 million due to coal inventories. Coal inventories decreased 0.2 million tons in the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to an increase of 0.2 million tons in the year ended December 31, 2005. Operating cash flows also fluctuated due to various changes in operating assets, operating liabilities, other assets and other liabilities which occurred throughout both periods. Net cash used in investing activities changed primarily due to the following items: During 2005, proceeds of $420 million were received from the sale of 18.5% of CNX Gas, a subsidiary of CONSOL Energy, when 27.9 million shares were sold in a private transaction. CNX Gas received proceeds of $420 million, which it used to pay a special dividend to CONSOL Energy. Capital expenditures were $659 million in the 2006 period compared to $523 million in the 2005 period. Capital expenditures were higher in 2006 primarily due to work being completed on the slope, overland belt and new preparation plant at our Robinson Run Mine, our enhanced gas well drilling program and various other projects being completed. In January 2006, CONSOL Energy, completed the acquisition of Mon River Towing and J.A.R. Barge Lines, LLC, from The Guttman Group for a cash payment of approximately $25 million, as discussed previously. In November 2006, CONSOL Energy, invested $30 million for a 50% interest in a specialty contracting company. 85 Table of Contents Proceeds from the sale of assets were $60 million in the 2006 period compared to $34 million in the 2005 period. Proceeds in the 2006 period are primarily related to the sale and subsequent lease back of longwall mining equipment. The lease has been reported as a capital lease, and accordingly a liability for the present value of the lease payments has been recognized. Proceeds in the 2005 period are related to the sale and subsequent lease back of the corporate office building. Both periods also include proceeds related to the sale of various properties held by CONSOL Energy. Net cash used in financing activities changed primarily due to the following items: In the 2006 period, approximately $116 million of CONSOL Energy stock was repurchased under the share repurchase program that was approved in December 2005. As of December 31, 2006, we have repurchased 3,514,800 shares at an average price of $33.11 under this program. $1 million of stock was issued in the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $39 million issued in the year ended December 31, 2005. Stock issuances in both periods were a result of stock option exercises. Also, $13 million of treasury stock was issued in the year ended December 31, 2006 as a result of stock option exercises. In the 2006 period, approximately $5 million was paid on miscellaneous outstanding borrowings. Due to the implementation of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) No. 123(R) Share Based Payment, $39 million of cash retained as a result of the tax deductibility of increases in the value of equity instruments issued under share based payment arrangements that are not included in the cost of goods sold on the financial statements were included as a financing activity in the 2006 period. In previous periods, in accordance with accounting standards in effect at the time, these transactions were recognized as operating cash flow. The following is a summary of our significant contractual obligations at December 31, 2006 (in thousands): Payments due by year Within 1 Year 13 Years 3 5 Years After 5 Years Total Short Term Notes Payable $ $ $ $ $ Gas Firm Transportation Obligation 7,897 14,642 12,430 21,453 56,422 Purchase Order Firm Commitments 14,370 14,370 Long term Debt 50,249 9,333 111,493 272,243 443,318 Capital Lease Obligations (a) 9,269 20,503 19,032 51,493 100,297 Operating Lease Obligations 35,884 65,305 30,478 130,292 261,959 Other Long Term Liabilities (b) 306,980 521,740 499,815 2,153,329 3,481,864 Total Contractual Obligations $ 424,649 $ 631,523 $ 673,248 $ 2,628,810 $ 4,358,230 (a) In conjunction with the completion of the Jewell Ridge lateral pipeline in October 2006, CNX Gas entered into a 15 year firm transportation agreement with ETNG, a subsidiary of Duke Energy, at pre determined fixed rates. The present value of our payments under this firm transportation agreement is approximately $67 million. In addition to providing us with transportation flexibility, the Jewell Ridge lateral will provide access for our production to alternate and growing Southeastern and East Coast markets. (b) Long term liabilities include other post employment benefits, work related injuries and illnesses, defined benefit pension plans, mine reclamation and closure, and other long term liability costs. As discussed in Critical Accounting Policies and in the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this annual report on Form 10 K, our determination of these long term liabilities is calculated annually and is based on several assumptions, including then prevailing conditions, which may change from the amounts included in the table, and may change significantly, if our assumptions change to reflect changing conditions. 86 Table of Contents Capital expenditures were approximately $659 million, excluding $25 million expended to acquire Mon River Towing and J.A.R. Barge Lines, LLC, in the year December 31, 2006 compared to $523 million in the year ended December 31, 2005. We currently anticipate capital expenditures for the year ending December 31, 2007 to be approximately $754 million, of which approximately $203 million is to maintain current coal production levels. There is also $308 million included in the total related to the gas well drilling program. We may choose to defer certain capital projects in light of operating results, market conditions or the availability of financing. Capital expenditures for pollution abatement and reclamation are projected to be $29 million for the year ending December 31, 2007. Our capital expenditures have been and will be primarily used for replacement of mining and gas equipment, the expansion of mining and gas capacity and projects to improve the efficiency of the mining and gas operations. The projected capital expenditures for 2007 are not committed and are expected to be funded with cash generated by operations and existing borrowing capacity. In addition, cash requirements to fund employee related, mine closure and other long term liabilities included above, along with obligations related to long term debt, capital and operating leases, are expected to be funded with cash generated by operations and existing borrowing capacity. Debt At December 31, 2006, CONSOL Energy had total long term debt of $552 million outstanding, including current portion of long term debt of $60 million. This long term debt consisted of: An aggregate principal amount of $249 million of 7.875% notes ($250 million of 7.875% notes due in 2012, net of $1 million unamortized debt discount). The notes were issued at 99.174% of the principal amount. Interest on the notes is payable March 1 and September 1 of each year. Payment of the principal and premium, if any, and interest on the notes are guaranteed by most of CONSOL Energys subsidiaries. The notes are senior secured obligations and rank equally with all other secured indebtedness of the guarantors; An aggregate principal amount of $45 million of secured notes which bear interest at fixed rates of 8.25% per annum and are due in 2007; An aggregate principal amount of $103 million of two series of industrial revenue bonds which were issued to finance the Baltimore port facility and bear interest at 6.50% per annum and mature in 2010 and 2011; $32 million in advance royalty commitments with an average interest rate of 7.213% per annum; An aggregate principal amount of $13 million on a variable rate note that bears interest at the prime rate, or 8.25% at December 31, 2006. This note was incurred by a variable interest entity that is fully consolidated in which CONSOL Energy holds a 49% ownership interest; An aggregate principal amount of $110 million of capital leases with an interest rate of 7.08% per annum. At December 31, 2006, CONSOL Energy had no aggregate principal amounts of borrowings and approximately $393 million of letters of credit outstanding under the revolving credit facility. At December 31, 2006, CNX Gas, an 81.5% owned subsidiary, had no aggregate principal amounts of borrowings and approximately $17 million of letters of credit outstanding under their revolving credit facility. Stockholders Equity and Dividends CONSOL Energy had stockholders equity of $1,066 million at December 31, 2006 and $1,025 million at December 31, 2005. The increase is primarily attributable to $409 million of net income. The increase in stockholders equity was offset, in part, by the implementation of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, (SFAS 158) in December 2006. This statement required the recognition of the underfund/overfunded status of our long term 87 Table of Contents employee liabilities through accumulated other comprehensive income/loss. The recognition of SFAS 158 resulted in a reduction of stockholders equity, net of tax, of $310 million. Stockholders equity was also impacted by the repurchases of shares under the CONSOL Energy share repurchase program and the payment of dividends during the year. These decreases in stockholders equity were offset, in part, by changes in cash flow hedges, the two benefits associated with stock based compensation awards and net income of $409 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. CONSOL Energy began a share repurchase program of up to $300 million of the companys common stock during a 24 month period beginning January 1, 2006 and ending December 31, 2007. As of December 31, 2006, we have repurchased 3,514,800 shares at an average price of $33.11 under this program. On May 4, 2006, CONSOL Energys Board of Directors declared a two for one stock split of the common stock payable on or about May 31, 2006 to shareholders of record on May 15, 2006. The stock split was effected in the form of a stock dividend. This stock split resulted in the issuance of approximately 92.5 million additional shares of common stock and was accounted for by the transfer of approximately $925 thousand from capital in excess of par value to common stock. The stock split also resulted in additional shares available for awards under the CONSOL Energy Inc. Equity Incentive Plan. Dividend information for the current year to date is as follows: Declaration Date Amount Per Share Record Date Payment Date January 26, 2007 $0.07 February 8, 2007 February 23, 2007 October 27, 2006 $0.07 November 8, 2006 November 24, 2006 July 28, 2006 $0.07 August 10, 2006 August 28, 2006 April 28, 2006 $0.14(a) May 9, 2006 May 30, 2006 January 27, 2006 $0.14(a) February 9, 2006 February 24, 2006 (a) Amount represents a pre stock split dividend amount declared by CONSOL Energys Board of Directors. Our credit facility limits our ability to pay cash dividends over $0.56 per share annually if our leverage ratio covenant is 1.00 to 1.00 or less. The leverage ratio was 0.59 to 1.00 at December 31, 2006. The credit facility does not permit dividend payments in the event of default. There were no defaults in the year ended December 31, 2006. Off Balance Sheet Transactions CONSOL Energy does not maintain any off balance sheet transactions, arrangements, obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or others that are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on CONSOL Energys financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources which are not disclosed in the Notes to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157), which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and requires additional disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 aims to improve the consistency and comparability of fair value measurements by creating a single definition of fair value. The Statement emphasizes that fair value is not entity specific, but instead is a market based measurement of an asset or liability. SFAS 157 upholds the requirements of previously issued pronouncements concerning fair value measurements and expands the required disclosures. This Statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, however earlier application is permitted provided the reporting entity has not yet issued financial statements for that fiscal year. We do not expect this guidance to have a significant impact on CONSOL Energy. 88 Table of Contents In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans (SFAS 158), which requires the recognition of the funded status of defined benefit postretirement plans and related disclosures. SFAS 158 was issued to address concerns that prior standards on employers accounting for defined benefit postretirement plans failed to communicate the funded status of those plans in a complete and understandable way and to require an employer to recognize completely in earnings or accumulated other comprehensive income the financial impact of certain events affecting the plans funded status when those events occurred. This Statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2006. Retrospective application of this Statement is not permitted. The financial impact of this statement decreased accumulated other comprehensive income by $310.4 million, increased long term liabilities by $466.5 million, and increased long term assets by $156.1 million as of December 31, 2006. Additionally, SFAS 158 requires an employer to measure the funded status of each of its plans as of the date of its year end statement of financial position. This provision becomes effective for CONSOL Energy for its December 31, 2008 year end. The funded status of CONSOL Energys pension and other postretirement benefit plans are currently measured as of September 30. In September 2006, the FASB issued Financial Accounting Standards Board Staff Position No. AUG AIR 1, Accounting for Planned Major Maintenance Activities (FSP AUG AIR 1), which amended certain provisions in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Industry Audit Guide, Audits of Airlines (Airline Guide), and Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 28: Interim Financial Reporting. The Board rescinded the accrue in advance method of accounting for planned major maintenance activities as it results in the recognition of liabilities that do not meet the definition of a liability in FASB Concepts Statement No. 6, Elements of Financial Statements, because it causes the recognition of a liability in a period prior to the occurrence of the transaction or event obligating the entity. The guidance in FSP AUG AIR 1 shall be applied to the first fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2006. Earlier adoption is permitted as of the beginning of an entitys fiscal year. The guidance in FSP AUG AIR 1 shall be applied retrospectively for all financial statements presented, unless it is impracticable to do so. We do not expect this guidance to have a significant annual financial impact on CONSOL Energy, however, management is currently assessing the retrospective impact on interim periods. In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) released FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement 109 (FIN 48). FIN 48 provides a model for how a company should recognize, measure, present and disclose in its financial statements uncertain tax positions that it has taken or expects to take on a tax return. FIN 48 is effective for CONSOL Energy on January 1, 2007. Management is currently assessing the financial impact of adopting FIN 48 but does not expect the adoption to have a material impact on CONSOL Energys consolidated financial statements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. In addition to the risks inherent in operations, CONSOL Energy is exposed to financial, market, political and economic risks. The following discussion provides additional detail regarding CONSOL Energys exposure to the risks of changing natural gas prices, interest rates and foreign exchange rates. CONSOL Energy is exposed to market price risk in the normal course of selling natural gas production and to a lesser extent in the sale of coal. CONSOL sells coal under both short term and long term contracts with fixed price and or indexed price contracts that reflect market value. CONSOL Energy uses fixed price contracts and derivative commodity instruments that qualify as cash flow hedges under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 to minimize exposure to market price volatility in the sale of natural gas. Our risk management policy strictly prohibits the use of derivatives for speculative purposes. CONSOL Energy has established risk management policies and procedures to strengthen the internal control environment of the marketing of commodities produced from our asset base. All of the derivative instruments are 89 Table of Contents held for purposes other than trading. They are used primarily to mitigate uncertainty and volatility and cover underlying exposures. CONSOL Energys market risk strategy incorporates fundamental risk management tools to assess market price risk and establish a framework in which management can maintain a portfolio of transactions within pre defined risk parameters. CONSOL Energy believes that the use of derivative instruments along with the risk assessment procedures and internal controls does not expose CONSOL Energy to material risk. The use of derivative instruments could materially affect CONSOL Energys results of operations depending on market prices. However, we believe that use of these instruments will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or liquidity. For a summary of accounting policies related to derivative instruments, see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Sensitivity analyses of the incremental effects on pre tax earnings for the year ended December 31, 2006 of a hypothetical 10% and 25% change in natural gas prices for open derivative instruments as of December 31, 2006 are provided in the following table: Incremental Decreasein Pre tax EarningsAssuming aHypothetical PriceChange of: 10% 25% (in millions) Natural Gas $ 8.1 $ 31.0 CONSOL Energy remains at risk for possible changes in the market value of these derivative instruments; however, such risk should be mitigated by price changes in the underlying hedged item. The effect of this offset is not reflected in the sensitivity analyses. CONSOL Energy entered into derivative instruments to convert the market prices related to portions of the 2007 through 2008 anticipated sales of natural gas to fixed prices. The sensitivity analysis reflects an inverse relationship between increases in commodity prices and a benefit to earnings. When commodity prices increase, pretax income decreases. The fair value of these contracts was a net gain of $2.5 million (net of $1.6 million deferred tax). We continually evaluate the portfolio of derivative commodity instruments and adjust the strategy to anticipated market conditions and risks accordingly. CONSOL Energy is exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by counterparties. The credit worthiness of counterparties is subject to continuing review. CONSOL Energys interest expense is sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates in the United States. At December 31, 2006, CONSOL Energy had outstanding $539 million aggregate principal amount of debt under fixed rate instruments and $13 million aggregate principal amount of debt under variable rate instruments. CONSOL Energys primary exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our revolving credit facility, under which there was no borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2006. Due to the level of borrowings against this facility in the year ended December 31, 2006, a 100 basis point increase in the average rate for CONSOL Energys revolving credit facility would not have significantly decreased net income for the period. The fair value of CONSOL Energys financial instruments is set forth in Note 24 and Note 25 of the Notes to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements. Almost all of CONSOL Energys transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars, and, as a result, we do not have material exposure to currency exchange rate risks. 90 Table of Contents
