Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. General CONSOL Energy had net income of $268 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to $409 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. Net income for the 2007 period decreased in comparison to the 2006 period primarily due to several roof falls which suspended production at the Buchanan Mine in early July 2007. Production was suspended after several roof falls in previously mined areas damaged some of the ventilation controls inside the mine, requiring a general evacuation of the mine. We drilled bore holes and injected nitrogen in order to stabilize and evaluate the mine atmosphere. In the year ended December 31, 2007, we incurred expenses of $119 million, primarily classified as cost of goods sold and depreciation, depletion and amortization, in relation to these activities. These costs were offset, in part, by a $15 million advance under CONSOL Energy insurance policies. We have also received notice from our insurance carriers that an advance of $10 million will be paid related to business interruption coverage; $8 million related to the coal segment and $2 million related to the gas segment. We intend to pursue additional reimbursement under our existing insurance policies. Insurance coverage, after certain deductibles have been reached including a 90 day waiting period, includes property damage and cost recoveries as well as business interruption recoveries. There is no guarantee any additional recovery will be received under our policies. Net income was also adversely affected by reduced sales of coal from the Buchanan Mine. Customers who purchase coal from the mine were notified that a force majeure condition exists and deliveries under their sales agreements for coal from the mine were reduced during the year ended December 31, 2007. CNX Gas production was also adversely impacted by the idling of the Buchanan Mine. Also, the 2006 period included proceeds from the insurance company of $79 million; the coal segment recognized $69 million and the gas segment recognized $10 million, related to the 2005 skip hoist incident at the Buchanan Mine. Net income was also impacted by $24 million of expense related to the previously recognized export excise tax receivable being reversed in the 2007 period. The Federal Circuit court had ruled that the damage claim for export excise taxes paid for the period 1991 1993 be repaid. The Government appealed a similar case to the U.S. Supreme Court. On December 3, 2007 the United States Supreme Court granted the Governments appeal to hear that case. The Supreme Courts granting of the appeal makes collection of the refund and interest by CONSOL Energy no longer highly probable because of adverse rulings by the Supreme Court during 2007 under the statute on which our claim for this period is based. Accordingly, CONSOL Energy reversed the export excise tax receivable until the Supreme Court decides the appeal. We intend to vigorously pursue this action, although there is no assurance that CONSOL Energy will receive any tax refund. Net income in the 2007 period was also impacted by a lower volume of produced coal sales, and higher cost per ton sold. Net income was also lower due to higher depreciation, depletion and amortization related to the additional assets received in the July 31, 2007 acquisition of AMVEST. Income tax expense also adversely impacted the period to period comparison. In 2006, income tax expenses were reduced by the release of certain valuation allowances related to state income taxes in Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Reductions to net income were offset, in part, by two transactions which occurred in the 2007 period; an asset exchange and an asset sale that resulted in pretax income of approximately $100 million and net income of approximately $59 million. Net income reductions were also offset, in part, by the March 2007 settlement agreement with the Combined Fund that resolved all previous issues relating to the calculation of payments to the Combined Fund. Total pre tax income, including interest, recognized related to the Combined Fund settlement was approximately $33 million. Reductions to net income were also offset, in part, by lower salary pension costs. Our defined benefit pension plan for salaried employees allows such employees to receive a lump sum distribution in lieu of annual payments when they retire from CONSOL Energy and its subsidiaries. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 88, Employers Accounting for Settlement & Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits, requires that when the lump sum distributions made for a plan year, which for CONSOL Energy is October 1 to September 30, exceed the total of the service cost and interest cost for the plan year, an adjustment equaling the unrecognized actuarial gain or loss resulting from each individual who received a lump sum in that year be recognized. The total 2007 accelerated actuarial amortization was approximately $3 million of expense. The total 2006 accelerated actuarial amortization was approximately $18 million of expense. 55 Table of Contents Total coal sales for the year ended December 31, 2007 were 65.5 million tons, of which 64.9 million tons were produced by CONSOL Energy operations, our equity affiliates, consolidated variable interest entities, or sold from inventory of company produced coal. This compares with total coal sales of 68.9 million tons for the year ended December 31, 2006, of which 67.6 million tons were produced by CONSOL Energy operations, consolidated variable interest entities, or sold from inventory of company produced coal. Company produced coal production was 64.6 million tons, including our portion of equity affiliates and consolidated variable interest entities, for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 67.4 million tons for the year ended December 31, 2006. Production was lower due to the continued idling of the Buchanan Mine as discussed above; McElroy Mine had lower production due to poor geological conditions and the idling of certain Central Appalachian mines due to market conditions. Lower production was offset, in part, by production from the AMVEST mines that were acquired on July 31, 2007. Produced coalbed methane gas sales volumes, including a percentage of the sales of equity affiliates equal to our interest in these affiliates, increased 3.6% to 57.5 billion cubic feet for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared with 55.5 billion cubic feet in the year ended December 31, 2006 period. Sales volumes in the 2007 period increased as a result of additional wells coming online from our on going drilling program, offset by reduced active and sealed gob production related to the idling of the Buchanan Mine. Our average sales price for coalbed methane gas, including sales of equity affiliates increased 2.0% to $7.19 per thousand cubic feet in the year ended December 31, 2007 compared with $7.05 per thousand cubic feet in the year ended December 31, 2006. In January 2008, CONSOL Energy announced its intentions to offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of CNX Gas Corporation that it does not currently own in a stock for stock transaction. CONSOL Energy currently owns 81.7% of the approximately 151 million shares of CNX Gas common stock outstanding. In July 2007, production at the Buchanan Mine was suspended after several roof falls in previously mined areas damaged some of the ventilation controls inside the mine, requiring a general evacuation of the mine by employees. The mine atmosphere was continually monitored to determine the impact of the roof falls on the mines ventilation system and the overall mine atmosphere. Two mine atmosphere monitoring stations showed levels of carbon monoxide above ambient levels for several months after the roof falls damaged the ventilation controls. Efforts to eliminate carbon monoxide in the mine were narrowed to an underground area about 400 feet in diameter into which the company pumped inert gas through a number of bore holes that had been drilled. The underground area of the Buchanan Mine encompasses about five square miles. In compliance with safety agency requirements, the mine was temporarily sealed in late November as a final step before reentry into the mine. On January 20, 2008, the restart of the fans was approved by the Commonwealth of Virginia Department of Mines, Minerals and Energy, and by the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration. The temporary mine seals were removed and the ventilation fans were restarted. Specially trained mine rescue teams re entered the mine on January 28, 2008 and are in the process of evaluating the extent of damage to the mines ventilation system and making temporary repairs. On July 31, 2007, CONSOL Energy acquired AMVEST Corporation and certain subsidiaries and affiliates (AMVEST) for a cash payment, net of cash acquired, of approximately $297 million in a transaction accounted for under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141 (SFAS 141), Business Combinations. The coal reserves acquired consist of approximately 160 million tons of high quality, low sulfur steam and high volatile metallurgical coal. Also included in the acquisition were four coal preparation plants, several fleets of modern mining equipment and a common short line railroad that connects the coal preparation plants to the CSX and Norfolk and Southern rail interchanges. The results of operations of the acquired entities are included in CONSOL Energys Consolidated Statement of Income as of August 1, 2007. The AMVEST acquisition, when combined with CONSOL Energys subsidiaries adjacent coal reserves, creates a large contiguous block of coal reserves in the Central Appalachian region. Also, included in the acquisition was a highly skilled workforce proficient in Central Appalachian surface mining. This workforce combined with CONSOL Energys and its subsidiaries underground mining expertise will allow us to build and transfer knowledge among operations to focus the best skill sets to development requirements of the various parts of this reserve block. See Note 2 in Item 8, Notes to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10 K. 56 Table of Contents In August 2007, the Board of Directors of CONSOL Energy amended the companys dividend policy, allowing the company to increase its dividend from $0.28 per share to $0.40 per share on an annualized basis, an increase of 43 percent. In September 2007, CONSOL Energy entered into an agreement to investigate the development of coal based gasification facilities to produce feedstock for various industrial chemical manufacturers. CONSOL Energy and Synthesis Energy Systems will also investigate the feasibility of producing substitute natural gas to meet the demand for clean, affordable energy. CNX Gas, our 81.7% subsidiary, became a registered offset provider on the Chicago Climate Exchange (CCX) during the fourth quarter 2007. CCX is a rules based Greenhouse Gas (GhG) allowance trading system. CCX emitting members make a voluntary but legally binding commitment to meet annual GhG emission reduction targets. Those emitting members who exceed their targets have surplus allowances to sell or bank; those who fall short of their targets comply by purchasing offsets which are called CCX Carbon Financial Instruments (CFI) contracts. As a CCX offset provider, CNX Gas is not bound to any emission reduction targets. An offset provider is an owner of an offset project that registers and sells offsets on its own behalf. In order to sell or trade CFIs, approval must be received by the CCX Committee on Offsets and approved projects must then be validated by an independent CCX verifier. Once verified, CCX then issues CFIs for each specific project. As of December 31, 2007, we are awaiting verification for several projects to convert captured coal mine methane into tradable credits. Credits are granted on the basis of avoiding methane emissions by diverting gas into gas pipelines for commercial sale. No CFIs have been issued or received as of December 31, 2007, however we expect approval for these projects will be received during the first quarter 2008. Sales of these credits will be reflected in income as they occur. In June 2007, CONSOL Energy and certain of its subsidiaries completed a $1 billion Senior Secured Loan Agreement, effective June 27, 2007, to replace an existing facility of $750 million. The new agreement, which includes more favorable pricing and flexibility, provides a five year revolving credit facility. In June 2007, CONSOL Energy, through a subsidiary, exchanged certain coal assets in Northern Appalachia to Peabody Energy in exchange for coalbed methane and gas rights. This transaction was accounted for as a non monetary exchange under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 153, Exchanges of Non Monetary Assets, resulting in a pretax gain of $50 million. In June 2007, CONSOL Energy, through a subsidiary, sold the rights to certain western Kentucky coal in the Illinois Basin to Alliance Resource Partners, L.P. for $53 million. This transaction resulted in a pretax gain of approximately $50 million. In April and November 2007, the company amended its trade accounts receivable facility to allow CONSOL Energy to receive up to $165 million, an increase in capacity of $40 million over the December 31, 2006 trade accounts receivable facility. The amended facility also provides the ability to issue letters of credit and has reduced the associated fees. Mine accidents involving multiple fatalities occurred during the calendar years 2006 and 2007 at mines operated by other coal companies. These accidents attracted widespread public attention and have resulted in both federal government and some state government changes to statutory and regulatory control of mine safety, particularly for underground mines. Because nearly all of our mines are underground, these legislative and regulatory changes could affect our performance. The actions taken thus far by federal and state governments include requiring: the caching of additional supplies of self contained self rescuer (SCSR) devices underground; providing breathable air for all underground miners for 96 hours; the purchase and installation during the next several years of electronic communication and personal tracking devices underground; the placement, in various mine areas, of rescue chambers, structures designed to provide refuge for groups of miners for long periods of time during a mine emergency when 57 Table of Contents evacuation from the mine is not possible which will provide breathable air for all underground miners for 96 hours; the possible reconstruction of existing seals in worked out areas of mines; and additional training and testing requirements that created the need to hire additional employees. In reviewing actions taken to date, we estimate that implementation of these new requirements could cost $35 million to $45 million during the period from 2006 until the end of 2009. The actual costs will depend primarily on: the number of additional SCSR oxygen units purchased, the design requirements as well as the extent of deployment of rescue chambers, final guidelines regarding sealed areas, final interpretation of other regulatory requirements, and final approval of mine by mine implementation plans. We have reviewed our coal sales agreements to determine the degree to which costs related to these regulatory requirements may be passed through to customers. While the amount will vary by contract, we have been billing the cost of implementation to customers in most of our existing sales agreements. Responses from customers have varied. In December 2006, the Surface Mining Act was amended. The Surface Mining Act amendments have several impacts on CONSOL Energy, including: the reduction over time in the production tax paid to fund the reclamation of abandoned mining sites; and the assumption of responsibility by the federal government by 2011 for so called orphan miners who receive retirement benefits from several multi employer funds into which CONSOL Energy contributes. Results of Operations Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2007 Compared with Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2006 Net Income Net income changed primarily due to the following items (table in millions): 2007 2006 DollarVariance PercentageChange Coal Sales Produced and Purchased $ 2,678 $ 2,694 $ (16 ) (0.6 )% Produced Gas Sales 410 389 21 5.4 % Purchased Gas Sales 8 44 (36 ) (81.8 )% Other Sales and Other Income 666 588 78 13.3 % Total Revenue and Other Income 3,762 3,715 47 1.3 % Coal Cost of Goods Sold Produced and Purchased 1,737 1,785 (48 ) (2.7 )% Produced Gas Cost of Goods Sold 129 107 22 20.6 % Purchased Gas Cost of Goods Sold 7 45 (38 ) (84.4 )% Other Cost of Goods Sold 526 399 127 31.8 % Total Cost of Goods Sold 2,399 2,336 63 2.7 % Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization 325 296 29 9.8 % Other 585 532 53 10.0 % Export Excise Tax Adjustment 24 24 100.0 % Total Costs 3,333 3,164 169 5.3 % Earnings Before Income Taxes and Minority Interest 429 551 (122 ) (22.1 )% Income Tax Expense (136 ) (112 ) (24 ) 21.4 % Earnings Before Minority Interest 293 439 (146 ) 33.3 % Minority Interest (25 ) (30 ) 5 (16.7 )% Net Income $ 268 $ 409 $ (141 ) (34.5 )% 58 Table of Contents CONSOL Energy had net income of $268 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to $409 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. Net income for the 2007 period decreased in comparison to the 2006 period primarily due to several roof falls which suspended production at the Buchanan Mine in early July 2007. Production was suspended after several roof falls in previously mined areas damaged some of the ventilation controls inside the mine, requiring a general evacuation of the mine. We drilled bore holes and injected nitrogen in order to stabilize and evaluate the mine atmosphere. In the year ended December 31, 2007, we incurred expenses of $119 million, primarily classified as cost of goods sold and depreciation, depletion and amortization, in relation to these activities. These costs were offset, in part, by a $15 million advance under CONSOL Energy insurance policies. We have also received notice from our insurance carriers that an advance of $10 million will be paid related to business interruption coverage; $8 million related to the coal segment and $2 million related to the gas segment. We intend to pursue additional reimbursement under our existing insurance policies. Insurance coverage, after certain deductibles have been reached including a 90 day waiting period, includes property damage and cost recoveries as well as business interruption recoveries. There is no guarantee any additional recovery will be received under our policies. Net income was also adversely affected by reduced sales of coal from the Buchanan Mine. Customers who purchase coal from the mine were notified that a force majeure condition exists and deliveries under their sales agreements for coal from the mine were reduced during the year ended December 31, 2007. CNX Gas production was also adversely impacted by the idling of the Buchanan Mine. Also, the 2006 period included proceeds from the insurance company of $79 million; the coal segment recognized $69 million and the gas segment recognized $10 million, related to the 2005 skip hoist incident at the Buchanan Mine. Net income was also impacted by $24 million of expense related to the previously recognized Export Excise Tax receivable being reversed in the 2007 period. The Federal Circuit court had ruled that the damage claim for export excise taxes paid for the period 19911993 be repaid. The Government appealed a similar case to the U.S. Supreme Court. On December 3, 2007 the United States Supreme Court granted the Governments new petition to hear that case. The Supreme Courts granting of the appeal makes collection of the refund and interest by CONSOL Energy no longer highly probable because of adverse rulings by the Supreme Court during 2007 under the statute of which our claim for this period is based. Accordingly, CONSOL Energy reversed the export excise tax receivable until the Supreme Court decides the appeal. We intend to vigorously pursue this action, although there is no assurance that CONSOL Energy will receive any tax refund. Net income in the 2007 period was also impacted by a lower volume of produced coal sales, and higher cost per ton sold. Net income was also lower due to higher depreciation, depletion and amortization related to the additional assets received in the July 31, 2007 acquisition of AMVEST. Income tax expense also adversely impacted the period to period comparison. In 2006, income tax expense was reduced by the release of certain valuation allowances related to state income taxes in Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Reductions to net income were offset, in part, by two transactions which occurred in the 2007 period; an asset exchange and an asset sale that resulted in pretax income of approximately $100 million and net income of approximately $59 million. Net income reductions were also offset, in part, by the March 2007 settlement agreement with the Combined Fund that resolved all previous issues relating to the calculation of payments to the Combined Fund. Total pre tax income, including interest, recognized related to the Combined Fund settlement was approximately $33 million. Reductions to net income were also offset, in part, by lower salary pension costs. Our defined benefit pension plan for salaried employees allows such employees to receive a lump sum distribution in lieu of annual payments when they retire from CONSOL Energy and its subsidiaries. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 88, Employers Accounting for Settlement & Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits, requires that when the lump sum distributions made for a plan year, which for CONSOL Energy is October 1 to September 30, exceed the total of the service cost and interest cost for the plan year, an adjustment equaling the unrecognized actuarial gain or loss resulting from each individual who received a lump sum in that year be recognized. The total 2007 accelerated actuarial amortization was approximately $3 million of expense. The total 2006 accelerated actuarial amortization was approximately $18 million of expense. 59 Table of Contents Revenue Revenue and other income increased due to the following items: 2007 2006 DollarVariance PercentageChange Sales Produced Coal $ 2,640 $ 2,620 $ 20 0.8 % Purchased Coal 38 74 (36 ) (48.6 )% Produced Gas 410 389 21 5.4 % Industrial Supplies 147 120 27 22.5 % Other 89 84 5 6.0 % Total Sales Outside 3,324 3,287 37 1.1 % Gas Royalty Interest 47 51 (4 ) (7.8 )% Purchased Gas 8 44 (36 ) (81.8 )% Freight Revenue 187 163 24 14.7 % Other Income 196 170 26 15.3 % Total Revenue and Other Income $ 3,762 $ 3,715 $ 47 1.3 % The increase in company produced coal sales revenue during 2007 was due to an increase in the average sales price per ton, partially offset by a decrease in sales volumes. 2007 2006 Variance PercentageChange Produced Tons Sold (in millions) 64.8 67.6 (2.8 ) (4.1 )% Average Sales Price Per Ton $ 40.74 $ 38.77 $ 1.97 5.1 % Sales of company produced coal decreased in the period to period comparison due to the idling of the Buchanan Mine as previously discussed, lower production at the McElroy Mine due to poor geological conditions and the idling of certain Central Appalachian mines due to market conditions. Lower sales tons were offset, in part, by coal sales from the AMVEST mines that were acquired on July 31, 2007. Company coal production, excluding equity affiliates, was 64.5 million tons in 2007 compared to 67.4 million tons in 2006. The increase in average sales price primarily reflects stronger term prices negotiated in 2006 and early 2007 resulting from an overall improvement in prices in the eastern coal market for domestic and foreign power generators and steel producers. There was also a surge in spot market prices in the 2007 period. Purchased coal sales consist of revenues from processing third party coal in our preparation plants for blending purposes to meet customer coal specifications, coal purchased from a third party and sold directly to our customers and revenues from processing third party coal in our preparation plants. The decrease of $36 million in company purchased coal sales revenue was primarily due to lower sales volumes. The increase in produced gas sales revenue in 2007 compared to 2006 was primarily due to higher average sales price per thousand cubic feet sold and higher sales volumes. 2007 2006 Variance PercentageChange Produced Gas Sales Volumes (in billion cubic feet) 57.1 55.3 1.8 3.3 % Average Sales Price Per Thousand Cubic Feet $ 7.18 $ 7.04 0.14 2.0 % The increase in average sales price is the result of realizing general price increases on higher hedging gains in the current year. We periodically enter into various gas swap transactions that qualify as financial cash flow hedges. These gas swap transactions exist parallel to the underlying physical transactions. These financial hedges represented approximately 18.4 billion cubic feet of our produced gas sales volume for the year ended December 31, 2007 at an average price of $8.01 per thousand cubic feet. In the prior year, these hedges represented 60 Table of Contents approximately 17.0 billion cubic feet at an average price of $7.42 per thousand cubic feet. Sales volumes increased as a result of additional wells coming online from our on going drilling program, offset, in part, by decreased active and sealed gob production as a result of the idled Buchanan Mine. Also included within 2007 are the non operating net revenue interest volumes and revenues associated with royalty and working interests. These volumes were not available in 2006. The associated revenues were included in other income in the prior period. The $27 million increase in revenues from the sale of industrial supplies was primarily due to increased sales volumes. Sales volumes have increased primarily due to the July acquisition of Piping & Equipment Inc. See Note 2 in Item 8, Note to the Audited Financial Statements in this Form 10 K. The $5 million increase in other sales was due to various transactions that occurred throughout both years, none of which were individually material. 2007 2006 Variance PercentageChange Gas Royalty Interest Sales Volumes (in billion cubic feet) 7.2 7.6 (0.4 ) (5.3 )% Average Sales Price Per Thousand Cubic Feet $ 6.44 $ 6.76 $ (0.32 ) (4.7 )% Included in royalty interest gas sales are the revenues related to the portion of production belonging to royalty interest owners sold by CNX Gas on their behalf. The decreased average sales price relates primarily to reductions in a provision for royalty settlements. The volatility in the monthly volumes, contractual differences among leases, as well as the mix of average and index prices used in calculating royalties also contributed to the variance. 2007 2006 Variance PercentageChange Purchased Gas Sales Volumes (in billion cubic feet) 1.1 6.1 (5.0 ) (82.0 )% Average Sales Price Per Thousand Cubic Feet $ 7.19 $ 7.20 $ (0.01 ) (0.1 )% Purchased gas sales volumes in the current year represent volumes of gas we sell at market prices that were purchased from third party producers, less our gathering and marketing fees. In 2006, purchased gas sales and volumes represented volumes of gas we simultaneously purchased from and sold to the same counterparties under contracts that were committed prior to January 1, 2006. Accordingly, Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 04 13 (EITF 04 13), which we adopted on January 1, 2006, did not apply to these transactions. All contracts entered into prior to January 1, 2006 expired in 2006, while all activity related to 2007 is reflected in transportation expense on a net basis. Freight revenue is based on weight of coal shipped, negotiated freight rates and method of transportation (i.e., rail, barge, truck, etc.) used for the customers to which CONSOL Energy contractually provides transportation services. Freight revenue is the amount billed to customers for transportation costs incurred. Other income consists of interest income, gain or loss on the disposition of assets, equity in earnings of affiliates, service income, royalty income, derivative gains and losses, rental income and miscellaneous income. 2007 2006 DollarVariance PercentageChange Gain on Sales of Assets $ 112 $ 10 $ 102 1,020.0 % Equity in Earnings of Affiliates 7 1 6 600.0 % Litigation Settlement 5 5 100.0 % Business Interruption Insurance 10 79 (69 ) (87.3 )% Royalty Income 14 28 (14 ) (50.0 )% Interest Income 13 15 (2 ) (13.3 )% Other miscellaneous 35 37 (2 ) (5.4 )% Total Other Income $ 196 $ 170 $ 26 15.3 % 61 Table of Contents Gain on sales of assets increased $102 million primarily due to two transactions that occurred in 2007. In June 2007, CONSOL Energy, through a subsidiary, exchanged certain coal assets in Northern Appalachia to Peabody Energy in exchange for coalbed methane and gas rights. This transaction was accounted for as a non monetary exchange under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 153 resulting in a pre tax gain of $50 million. Also, in June 2007, CONSOL Energy, through a subsidiary, sold the rights to certain western Kentucky coal in the Illinois Basin to Alliance Resource Partners, L.P. for $53 million. This transaction resulted in a pre tax gain of approximately $50 million. Gain on sales of assets also increased $2 million in the period to period comparison due to various miscellaneous transactions that occurred throughout both years, none of which were individually material. Equity in Earnings of Affiliates increased $6 million in the year to year comparison due to various activities of our joint ventures, none of which were individually material. A litigation settlement with a coal customer resulted in an additional $5 million of income in 2007. In 2007, CONSOL Energy received notice from its insurance carriers that $25 million would be advanced toward the insurance claim related to several roof falls which suspended production at the Buchanan Mine in early July. The $25 million represents $10 million of business interruption reimbursement which was recognized in other income; the coal segment recognized $8 million and the gas segment recognized $2 million. The remaining $15 million of the reimbursement relates to cost recovery for activities at the Mine since production was suspended. These activities included the cost of drilling bore holes to monitor the mine atmosphere, the cost of injecting nitrogen in order to stabilize the mine atmosphere as well as various other costs incurred related to these activities. We intend to pursue additional reimbursement under our existing insurance policies. Insurance coverage, after certain deductibles have been reached including a 90 day waiting period, includes property damage and cost recoveries as well as business interruption recoveries. There is no guarantee any additional recovery will be received under our policies. In February 2005, Buchanan Mine experienced a fire that developed in the mine after a large rock fall behind the longwall mining section. The mine was temporarily sealed in order to extinguish the fire. Coal production resumed on June 16, 2005. During 2006, CONSOL Energy received proceeds from the insurance companies of $38 million. The $38 million was recognized as other income; the coal segment recognized $29 million and the gas segment recognized $9 million. Buchanan Mine also experienced a problem with the mines skip hoist mechanism on September 16, 2005 which caused the mine to be idled. Repairs to the skip hoist shaft and structures were completed and the mine resumed production on December 13, 2005. During 2006, CONSOL Energy recognized proceeds from the insurance companies of $41 million. The $41 million was recognized as other income; the coal segment recognized $40 million and the gas segment recognized $1 million. Royalty income decreased $14 million primarily due to royalties received from third party gas sales now being classified in outside gas sales versus royalty income. In the prior period, the volumes were not available nor were they considered in the prior period reserve report. Interest income decreased $2 million in the year to year comparison due to lower cash balances throughout 2007 compared to 2006. Lower cash balances were primarily the result of the purchase price paid for the July 31, 2007 acquisition of AMVEST and the June 2007 purchase of certain coalbed methane and gas reserves from Peabody Energy. Other miscellaneous income decreased $2 million due to various transactions that occurred throughout both years, none of which were individually material. 62 Table of Contents Costs 2007 2006 DollarVariance PercentageChange Cost of Goods Sold and Other Charges Produced Coal $ 1,685 $ 1,705 $ (20 ) (1.2 )% Purchased Coal 52 80 (28 ) (35.0 )% Produced Gas 129 107 22 20.6 % Industrial Supplies 141 119 22 18.5 % Closed and Idle Mines 105 109 (4 ) (3.7 )% Other 240 129 111 86.0 % Total Cost of Goods Sold and Other Charges 2,352 2,249 103 4.6 % Royalty Interest Gas 40 42 (2 ) (4.8 )% Purchased Gas 7 45 (38 ) (84.4 )% Total Cost of Goods Sold $ 2,399 $ 2,336 $ 63 2.7 % Decreased cost of goods sold and other charges for company produced coal was due mainly to lower sales volumes, offset, in part by an increase in the average unit cost per ton sold. 2007 2006 Variance PercentageChange Produced Tons Sold (in million) 64.8 67.6 (2.8 ) (4.1 )% Average Cost of Goods Sold and Other Charges Per Ton $ 26.01 $ 25.22 $ 0.79 3.1 % Cost of goods sold and other charges for produced coal decreased $20 million mainly due to lower volumes of company produced coal. Average cost of goods sold and other charges per ton increased in the year to year comparison primarily due to higher health and retirement costs, higher labor costs, higher supply costs and the lower volume impact on fixed unit costs. Higher health and retirement costs were attributable to additional contributions required to be made into employee benefit funds as a result of the five year labor agreement with the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA) that commenced January 1, 2007. The contribution increase over 2006 was $3.50 per UMWA hour worked. Higher labor costs were due to the effects of wage increases at the union and non union mines due to new labor contracts. Higher labor unit costs were also due to additional costs incurred to comply with health and safety standards. Supply costs increased due to additional costs incurred to comply with new federal and state safety regulations. These regulations require additional supplies of self contained self rescuer devices and other safety items as previously discussed. Supply cost increases were also the result of higher costs for products and chemicals, such as roof control products and magnetite, used in the mining and coal preparation process. These increases were offset, in part, by income recorded as a result of the Combined Fund settlement. In March 2007, CONSOL Energy entered into a settlement agreement with the Combined Fund that resolved all previous issues relating to the calculation of the payments. The total income, including interest, as a result of this settlement was approximately $33.4 million, of which approximately $28.1 million impacted cost of goods sold and other charges for produced coal. Decreased costs also reflect the prior year adjustment which accelerated previously unrecognized actuarial losses related to our salary pension plan. Our defined benefit pension plan for salaried employees allows such employees to receive a lump sum distribution in lieu of annual payments when they retire from CONSOL Energy and its subsidiaries. Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 88, Employers Accounting for Settlements & Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits, requires that when the lump sum distributions made for a plan year, which for CONSOL Energy is October 1 to September 30, exceeds the total of the service costs and interest costs for the plan year, an adjustment equaling the unrecognized actuarial gain or loss resulting from each individual who received a lump sum in that year be recognized. The total 2007 accelerated actuarial amortization was $2.7 million of expenses, of which $2.1 million impacted cost of goods sold and other charges for produced coal. The total prior year accelerated actuarial amortization was $17.8 million, of which $13.8 million impacted cost of goods sold and other charges for produced coal. Increased costs were also offset, in part, 63 Table of Contents by lower contract mining fees due to the idling of certain Central Appalachia contract mine locations. Royalty expenses were also lower in 2007 compared to 2006 due to a larger proportion of coal production coming from owned reserves versus leased reserves. Purchased coal cost of goods sold consists of costs from processing purchased coal in our preparation plants for blending purposes to meet customer coal specifications, coal purchased and sold directly to the customer and costs for processing third party coal in our preparation plants. The decrease of $28 million in purchased coal cost of goods sold and other charges in 2007 was primarily due to lower volumes purchased. Produced gas cost of goods sold and other charges increased due primarily to a 16.6% increase in unit cost of goods sold and other charges and a 3.3% increase in volumes of produced gas sold. 2007 2006 Variance PercentageChange Produced Gas Sales Volumes (in billion cubic feet) 57.1 55.3 1.8 3.3 % Average Cost Per Thousand Cubic Feet $ 2.25 $ 1.93 $ 0.32 16.6 % The increase in average cost per thousand cubic feet of gas sold was primarily attributable to increased salary labor and related employee costs, increased gas well maintenance costs, increased compressor rental costs, increased power costs and the deferral of gob gas production related to the idling of Buchanan Mine. Salary labor and related employee costs increased due to the hiring of additional employees in 2007. Gas well maintenance costs increased due to the increased number of wells in service compared to the prior year. Compressor rental costs increased due to more rentals in the current year. Power costs per unit were higher due to increased megawatt hour rates charged by the power companies in 2007, offset, in part, by credits received from the power company in 2007. These increases in unit costs were offset, in part, by lower firm transportation costs per unit and lower gas well closing costs. The firm transportation improvement was due to the in service of the Jewell Ridge Pipeline in October 2006. Also, gas well closing costs decreased due to a change in the lives for the wells to coincide with the reserve reports. Industrial supplies cost of goods sold increased $22 million primarily due to the July acquisition of Piping & Equipment Inc. See Note 2 in Item 8, Notes to Audited Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10 K. Closed and idle mine cost of goods sold and other charges decreased approximately $4 million in 2007 compared to 2006. Closed and idle mine cost of goods sold and other charges were improved $6 million due to additional expenses in the 2006 period related to reclamation liability adjustments and associated accretion expenses that were the result of updated engineering surveys. Closed and idle mine cost of goods sold and other charges also decreased $3 million due to various transactions that occurred throughout both years, none of which were individually material. This improvement was offset, in part, by $5 million of additional expenses due to Shoemaker being idled throughout all of 2007 and only a portion of 2006. Other cost of goods sold and other charges increased due to the following items: 2007 2006 DollarVariance PercentageChange Buchanan roof collapse $ 95 $ $ 95 100.0 % Incentive compensation 35 24 11 45.8 % Contract settlement 6 6 100.0 % Accounts Receivable Securitization 3 3 100.0 % Stock based compensation 24 23 1 4.3 % Miscellaneous transactions 77 82 (5 ) (6.1 )% Total Miscellaneous Cost of Goods Sold and Other Charges $ 240 $ 129 $ 111 86.0 % 64 Table of Contents In July 2007, production at the Buchanan Mine was suspended after several roof falls in previously mined areas damaged some of the ventilation controls inside the mine, requiring a general evacuation of the mine. We drilled bore holes and injected nitrogen in order to stabilize and evaluate the mine atmosphere. In 2007, we have incurred cost of goods sold expenses of approximately $110 million in relation to these activities. We have also received notice from the insurance carriers that a $15 million advance will be paid to recover a portion of the cost incurred to date for this incident. We intend to pursue additional reimbursement under our existing insurance policies. Insurance coverage, after certain deductibles have been reached including a 90 day waiting period, includes property damage and cost recoveries as well as business interruption recoveries. There is no guarantee any additional recovery will be received under our policies. Incentive compensation expense increased $11 million due to higher projected amounts expected to be paid to employees for 2007 compared to the projected amounts expected for 2006. The increase also relates to an actualization of the 2006 accrual which resulted in approximately $2 million of additional expense in 2007. The incentive compensation program is designed to increase compensation to eligible employees when CONSOL Energy reaches predetermined earnings targets and the employees reach predetermined performance targets. During 2007, CONSOL Energy agreed to a settlement for a contract violation with a customer. The amount owed to the customer has been accrued as of December 31, 2007. Accounts receivable securitization fees increased in the year to year comparison. Amounts have been drawn under this program since July 2007. No amounts were drawn under this program in 2006. Stock based compensation expense increased $1 million primarily as a result of additional awards granted in the 2007 period. Miscellaneous cost of goods sold and other charges decreased $5 million due to various transactions that occurred throughout both periods, none of which were individually material. 2007 2006 Variance PercentageChange Gas Royalty Interest Sales Volumes (in billion cubic feet) 7.2 7.6 (0.4 ) (5.3 )% Average Cost Per Thousand Cubic Feet $ 5.52 $ 5.54 $ (0.02 ) (0.4 )% Included in royalty interest gas costs are the expenses related to the portion of production belonging to royalty interest owners sold by CNX Gas on their behalf. The decrease in volumes and costs relate to the volatility and contractual differences among leases, as well as the mix of average and index prices used in calculating royalties. 2007 2006 Variance PercentageChange Purchased Gas Sales Volumes (in billion gross cubic feet) 1.1 6.1 (5.0 ) (82.0 )% Average Cost Per Thousand Cubic Feet $ 6.66 $ 7.34 $ (0.68 ) (9.3 )% Purchased gas sales volumes in the current year represent volumes of gas we sell at market prices that were purchased from third party producers, less our gathering and marketing fees. In 2006, purchased gas costs and volumes represented volumes of gas we simultaneously purchased from and sold to the same counterparties under contracts that were committed prior to January 1, 2006. Accordingly, Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 04 13 (EITF 04 13), which we adopted on January 1, 2006, did not apply to these transactions. All contracts entered into prior to January 1, 2006 expired in 2006, while all activity related to 2007 is reflected in transportation expense on a net basis. Freight expense is based on weight of coal shipped, negotiated freight rates and method of transportation (i.e., rail, barge, truck, etc.) used for the customers to whom CONSOL Energy contractually provides transportation. Freight expense is billed to customers and the revenue from such billing equals the transportation expense. 65 Table of Contents 2007 2006 Variance PercentageChange Freight Expense $ 187 $ 163 $ 24 14.7 % Selling, general and administrative costs have increased due to the following items: 2007 2006 DollarVariance PercentageChange Wages and salaries $ 40 $ 35 $ 5 14.3 % Professional, consulting and other purchased services 29 23 6 26.1 % Advertising and promotion 4 1 3 300.0 % Rentals 4 2 2 100.0 % Insurance 4 2 2 100.0 % Employee benefits 8 11 (3 ) (27.3 )% Other 20 17 3 17.6 % Total Selling, General and Administrative $ 109 $ 91 $ 18 19.8 % Wages and salaries have increased $5 million due to additional employees as a result of several acquisitions throughout 2007 and additional employees being hired after the 2006 period. Costs of professional, consulting and other purchased services were higher in 2007 compared to 2006 primarily due to $4 million of additional costs incurred by our 81.7% subsidiary, CNX Gas, related to a new computer system and legal fees associated with outstanding legal cases. The remaining $2 million increase is due to various transactions that occurred throughout both periods, none of which are individually material. Advertising and promotion expenses were $3 million higher in 2007 compared to 2006 due to an advertising campaign launched in the 2007 period to raise corporate awareness and recruit the next generation of employees. Rentals of equipment, primarily computers, have increased $2 million in the year to year comparison due to additional employees that have been added related to growth of CNX Gas as well as several acquisitions that occurred throughout 2007. Insurance expense increase of $2 million was primarily related to increased premium costs for property, business interruption and excess general liability insurance. Employee benefits decreased due mainly to an acceleration in 2006 of previously unrecognized actuarial losses related to our salary pension plan. Our defined benefit pension plan for salaried employees allows such employees to receive a lump sum distribution in lieu of annual payments when they retire from CONSOL Energy. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 88, Employers Accounting for Settlement & Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits, requires that when the lump sum distributions made for a plan year, which for CONSOL Energy is October 1 to September 30, exceed the total of the service cost and interest cost for the plan year, an adjustment equaling the unrecognized actuarial gain or loss resulting from each individual who received a lump sum in that year be recognized. The total accelerated actuarial amortization recognized in 2007 was $2.7 million, of which $0.2 million impacted selling, general and administrative expense. The total accelerated actuarial amortization recognized in 2006 was $17.8 million, of which $2.1 million impacted selling, general and administrative expense. Other selling, general and administrative costs increased $3 million due to miscellaneous costs related to various transactions that occurred throughout both years, none of which were individually material. 66 Table of Contents Depreciation, depletion and amortization increased due to the following items: 2007 2006 DollarVariance PercentageChange Coal $ 258 $ 241 $ 17 7.1 % Gas: Production 31 25 6 24.0 % Gathering 18 13 5 38.5 % Total Gas 49 38 11 28.9 % Other 18 17 1 5.9 % Total Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization $ 325 $ 296 $ 29 9.8 % The increase in coal depreciation, depletion and amortization was primarily due to additional expense related to the assets received in the acquisition of AMVEST. The increase was also attributable to assets placed in service after December 31, 2006. Assets placed in service after December 31, 2006 include various airshafts, longwall assets, haulage assets and other projects completed at our mines. These increases were offset, in part, by a reduction in depletion expense due to depletion of economic reserves at VP#8 Mine and decreased amortization due to decreased production in 2007 compared to 2006. The increase in gas production related depreciation, depletion and amortization was primarily due to an increase in units of production rates and increased production volumes year to year. These rates, which are recalculated annually, increased due to the higher proportion of capital assets placed in service versus the proportion of proved developed reserve additions. Rates are generally calculated using the net book value of assets at the end of the year divided by either proved or proved developed reserves. Gathering depreciation, depletion and amortization is recorded on the straight line method and increased primarily as a result realizing a full year of the capital lease treatment of the Jewell Ridge lateral, which went into service in October 2006. Other depreciation, depletion and amortization increased $1 million primarily related to capitalized computer software being placed in service after December 31, 2006. Interest expense increased in 2007 compared to 2006 due to the following items: 2007 2006 DollarVariance PercentageChange Capitalized lease $ 7 $ 2 $ 5 250.0 % Revolver 5 5 100.0 % Interest on unrecognized tax benefits 3 3 100.0 % Long term secured notes 28 30 (2 ) (6.7 )% Other (12 ) (7 ) (5 ) 71.4 % Total Interest Expense $ 31 $ 25 $ 6 24.0 % In conjunction with the completion of the Jewell Ridge lateral pipeline in October 2006, CNX Gas entered into a 15 year firm transportation agreement with ETNG, a subsidiary of Duke Energy. Also, in April 2006, CONSOL Energy entered into an agreement for the acquisition of longwall equipment. These agreements were required to be treated as capital leases under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 13, Accounting for Leases and accordingly incur interest expense each period. Revolver interest expense increased $5 million due to amounts being drawn on our revolving credit facility in 2007. The facility had $248 million outstanding at December 31, 2007. No amounts were drawn on the facility in 2006. 67 Table of Contents CONSOL Energy began recording interest on unrecognized tax benefits as a result of the adoption of FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement 109 (FIN 48) in 2007. See Note 5 in Item 8, Notes to the Audited Financial Statements Data of this Form 10 K. Interest on long term debt decreased $2 million due to the planned June 2007 principal payment on our $45 million secured note. Other reductions in interest expense were related to higher amounts of interest capitalized in 2007 compared to 2006. Higher capitalized interest was attributable to the higher level of capital projects funded from operating cash flow in 2007 compared to 2006. Taxes other than income increased primarily due to the following items: 2007 2006 DollarVariance PercentageChange Production taxes: Coal $ 175 $ 157 $ 18 11.5 % Gas 13 12 1 8.3 % Total Production Taxes 188 169 19 11.2 % Other taxes: Coal 79 71 8 11.3 % Gas 5 4 1 25.0 % Other 12 9 3 33.3 % Other 96 84 12 14.3 % Total Taxes Other Than Income $ 284 $ 253 $ 31 12.3 % Increased coal production taxes are primarily due to $24 million of expense related to the Export Excise Tax receivable being reversed in the 2007 period. The Federal Circuit court had ruled that the damage claim for export excise taxes paid for the period 1991 1993 be repaid. The Government appealed a similar case to the U.S. Supreme Court. On December 3, 2007 the United States Supreme Court granted the Governments appeal to hear that case. The Supreme Courts appeal of the petition makes collection of the refund and interest by CONSOL Energy no longer highly probable because of adverse rulings by the Supreme Court during 2007 under the statute on which our claim for this period is based. Accordingly, CONSOL Energy reversed the export excise tax receivable until the Supreme Court decides the appeal. We intend to vigorously pursue this action, although there is no assurance that CONSOL Energy will receive any tax refund. Coal production taxes also include a $6 million improvement related to lower coal production in 2007 compared to 2006. Lower production reduces severance taxes, reclamation fee taxes and black lung excise taxes, although these reductions were somewhat offset by higher average sales prices. Gas production taxes increased $1 million due to higher severance taxes attributable to higher average sales prices for gas and higher gas sales volumes. Other coal taxes have increased in 2007 due to property taxes which are based on current assessment values which have increased over the prior year primarily related to the acquisition of AMVEST, as previously discussed. Other coal taxes are also higher due to lower Virginia employment enhancement tax credits. Virginia provides a tax credit based on employment figures attributable to operations in that state. Due to the previously discussed Buchanan Mine situation, our employment figures have been temporarily reduced. The employment figure reduction has correspondingly reduced the tax credit that we earn. Other gas taxes have increased in 2007 due to various transactions that occurred throughout both years, none of which were individually material. 68 Table of Contents Other taxes have increased $3 million due to various transactions that occurred throughout both periods, none of which were individually material. 2007 2006 Variance PercentageChange Earnings Before Income Taxes $ 429 $ 551 $ (122 ) (22.1 )% Tax Expense $ 136 $ 112 $ 24 21.4 % Effective Income Tax Rate 31.7 % 20.4 % 11.3 % CONSOL Energys effective tax rate is sensitive to changes to the relationship between pre tax earnings and percentage depletion. See Note 5 in Item 8, Notes to the Audited Financial Statements of this Form 10 K. CONSOL Energys 2006 effective income tax rate includes the impact of state income tax benefits resulting from a change in a state tax statute. Minority Interest Minority interest represents 18.3% of CNX Gas net income for the five month period ended December 31, 2007 which CONSOL Energy did not own. It also represents 18.5% of Gass net income for the seven month period ended July 31, 2007 which CONSOL Energy did not own. During the period ended December 31, 2007, CONSOL Energy purchased $10 million of CNX Gas shares on the open market. The purchase of the additional shares changed CONSOL Energys ownership percentage in CNX Gas from 81.5% to 81.7%. Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2006 Compared with Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2005 Net Income Net income changed primarily due to the following items (table in millions): 2006 2005 DollarVariance PercentageChange Coal Sales Produced and Purchased (Outside and Related Party) $ 2,694 $ 2,527 $ 167 6.6 % Produced Gas Sales 389 281 108 38.4 % Gas Royalty Interest 51 45 6 13.3 % Purchased Gas Sales 44 275 (231 ) (84.0 )% Gain on Sale of 18.5% of CNX Gas 327 (327 ) (100.0 )% Other Sales and Other Income 537 355 182 51.3 % Total Revenue and Other Income 3,715 3,810 (95 ) (2.5 )% Coal Cost of Goods Sold Produced and Purchased 1,785 1,702 83 4.9 % Produced Gas Cost of Goods Sold 107 79 28 35.4 % Gas Royalty Interest Cost of Goods Sold 42 37 5 13.5 % Purchased Gas Cost of Goods Sold 45 279 (234 ) (83.9 )% Other Cost of Goods Sold 357 340 17 5.0 % Total Cost of Goods Sold 2,336 2,437 (101 ) (4.1 )% Other 828 719 109 15.2 % Total Costs 3,164 3,156 8 0.3 % Earnings before Income Taxes and Minority Interest 551 654 (103 ) (15.7 )% Income Tax Expense 112 64 48 75.0 % Earnings Before Minority Interest 439 590 (151 ) (25.6 )% Minority Interest (30 ) (9 ) (21 ) 233.3 % Net Income $ 409 $ 581 $ (172 ) (29.6 )% 69 Table of Contents Net income for 2006 declined in comparison to 2005 primarily due to the 2005 gain on the sale of 18.5% of CNX Gas. In August 2005, CNX Gas, a subsidiary of CONSOL Energy, sold 27.9 million shares of common stock. CNX Gas received proceeds of $420 million, which it used to pay a special dividend to CONSOL Energy. The pre tax gain recognized on this transaction was $327 million. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, no deferred tax has been provided on this transaction as current tax law provides a means by which the excess of the reported amount of this investment over its tax basis can be recovered tax free. Also, management has no current intention of entering into a transaction that would cause CNX Gas to leave the consolidated tax group. Net income was also impacted by the acceleration of previously unrecognized actuarial losses related to our salary pension plan. Our defined benefit pension plan for salaried employees allows such employees to receive a lump sum distribution for benefits earned through December 31, 2005 in lieu of annual payments when they retire from CONSOL Energy. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 88, Employers Accounting for Settlements & Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits, requires that when the lump sum distributions made for a plan year, which for CONSOL Energy is October 1 to September 30, exceed the total of the service cost and interest cost for the plan year, an adjustment equaling the unrecognized actuarial gain or loss resulting from each individual who received a lump sum in that year be recognized. The total pre tax accelerated actuarial amortization was $18 million and was included in costs of goods sold and other charges and selling, general and administrative costs. These decreases in net income were offset, in part, by $79 million of property and business interruption insurance proceeds recognized in other income related to the Buchanan Mine fire and skip hoist incident that occurred in 2005. Net income was also impacted by increased average sales prices for both coal and gas. Coal unit costs increased in the period to period comparison, impairing net income. Increased cost of goods sold and other charges were also attributable to higher supply costs, contract mining fees, labor costs, subsidence costs, and higher insurance premiums. Higher gas unit costs were primarily attributable to higher firm transportation costs and higher power costs. Revenue Revenue and other income increased due to the following items: 2006 2005 DollarVariance PercentageChange Sales Produced Coal Outside and Related Party $ 2,620 $ 2,448 $ 172 7.0 % Purchased Coal 74 79 (5 ) (6.3 )% Produced Gas 389 281 108 38.4 % Industrial Supplies 120 93 27 29.0 % Other 84 35 49 140.0 % Total Sales Outside 3,287 2,936 351 12.0 % Gas Royalty Interest 51 45 6 13.3 % Purchased Gas 44 275 (231 ) (84.0 )% Freight Revenue (Outside and Related Party) 163 120 43 35.8 % Gain on Sale of 18.5% of CNX Gas 327 (327 ) (100.0 )% Other Income 170 107 63 58.9 % Total Revenue and Other Income $ 3,715 $ 3,810 $ (95 ) (2.5 )% The increase in company produced coal sales revenue, including related party, during the 2006 period was due to the increase in average sales price per ton, offset, in part, by decreased sales volumes. 2006 2005 Variance PercentageChange Produced Tons Sold (in millions) 67.6 68.9 (1.3 ) (1.9 )% Average Sales Price Per Ton $ 38.77 $ 35.54 $ 3.23 9.1 % 70 Table of Contents Increased average sales price primarily reflects stronger prices negotiated in 2005 and early 2006 resulting from an overall improvement in prices in the eastern coal market for domestic and foreign power generators and steel producers. Sales of company produced coal decreased in the 2006 period due to lower company production causing fewer tons to be available for sale. Company produced coal production was 67.4 million tons in the 2006 period compared to 69.1 million tons in the 2005 period. The decrease in company purchased coal sales revenue was due to lower sales tons in the 2006 period compared to the 2005 period, offset, in part, by increased average sales price per ton of purchased coal. 2006 2005 Variance PercentageChange Purchase Tons Sold (in million) 1.3 1.5 (0.2 ) (13.3 )% Average Sales Price Per Ton $ 55.87 $ 52.81 $ 3.06 5.8 % Higher average sales prices were primarily due to sales of purchased coal tons being sold in higher priced export and metallurgical markets. The increase in gas sales revenue was due to a higher average sales price per thousand cubic feet sold and increased volumes in the 2006 period compared to the 2005 period. 2006 2005 Variance PercentageChange Produced Gas Sales Volumes (in billion cubic feet) 55.3 47.9 7.4 15.4 % Average Sales Price Per thousand cubic feet (including effects of derivative transactions) $ 7.04 $ 5.88 $ 1.16 19.7 % The increase in average sales price is primarily the result of selling the majority of our 2006 production at market rates that were higher than the prices we sold our gas under hedging contracts in 2005. CNX Gas enters into physical fixed price gas supply transactions with various counterparties for terms varying in length. CNX Gas also enters into financial gas swap transactions that qualify as financial cash flow hedges. These financial gas swap transactions exist parallel to the underlying physical transactions. These physical and financial hedges represented approximately 17.0 billion cubic feet of our produced gas sales volumes for the year ended December 31, 2006 at an average price of $7.42 per Mcf. For the year ended December 31, 2005, these hedges represented approximately 38.2 billion cubic feet of our produced gas sales volumes at an average price of $4.77 per Mcf. Sales volumes increased as a result of additional wells coming online from our on going drilling program and the 2005 period sales volumes being negatively impacted by the shutdown of Buchanan Mine due to the mine fire. The $27 million increase in revenues from the sale of industrial supplies was primarily due to increased sales volumes and higher average sales prices. The $49 million increase in other sales was primarily attributable to revenues from river barge towing. CONSOL Energy has an initiative to increase towing revenues from outside parties now that we are no longer restricted under the Jones Act Bowater exemption. Prior to February 2004, foreign ownership of CONSOL Energy exceeded 25%, prohibiting us from providing river barge towing to third parties. In January 2006, CONSOL Energy completed the acquisition of Mon River Towing and J.A.R. Barge Line, LLC, which contributed to the increase in revenues. 2006 2005 Variance PercentageChange Gas Royalty Interest Sales Volumes (in billion cubic feet) 7.6 6.6 1.0 15.2 % Average Sales Price Per thousand cubic feet $ 6.76 $ 6.92 $ (0.16 ) (2.3 )% 71 Table of Contents Included in royalty interest gas sales are the revenues related to the portion of production associated with royalty interest owners. The decrease in average sales price is a function of the average CNX Gas sales price being higher in the 2005 period than the 2006 period for royalty purposes. Sales volumes increased as a result of additional wells coming online from our on going drilling program and the 2005 period sales volumes being negatively impacted by the shutdown of Buchanan Mine due to the mine fire. 2006 2005 Variance PercentageChange Purchased Gas Sales Volumes (in billion cubic feet) 6.1 28.7 (22.6 ) (78.7 )% Average Sales Price Per thousand cubic feet $ 7.20 $ 9.59 $ (2.39 ) (24.9 )% Included in purchased gas sales revenue are volumes of gas we simultaneously purchased from and sold to the same counterparties between the segmentation and interruptible pools on the Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation (TCO) pipeline in order to satisfy obligations to certain customers. In accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent (EITF 99 19), we have historically recorded our revenues and our costs on a gross basis. However, because we adopted Emerging Issues Task Force 04 13 ,Accounting for Purchases and Sales of Inventory with the Same Counterparty (EITF 04 13) on January 1, 2006, purchased gas sales and volumes have decreased. EITF 04 13 requires the combining of matching buy/sell transactions, done in contemplation of one another, that were committed to on or after January 1, 2006. The net result for transactions that meet the above criteria are reflected in transportation expense in the 2006 period. Additionally, there are low volumes of gas we purchase from third party producers at market prices less our gathering charge, which we then resell. Freight revenue is based on weight of coal shipped, negotiated freight rates and method of transportation (i.e., rail, barge, truck, etc.) used for the customers to which CONSOL Energy contractually provides transportation services. Freight revenue is the amount billed to customers for transportation costs incurred. In July 2005, CONSOL Energy announced that it created CNX Gas Corporation, (CNX Gas) as a wholly owned subsidiary of CONSOL Energy, to conduct its gas exploration and production activities. In August 2005, CNX Gas sold 27.9 million shares of common stock. Proceeds of $420 million were received. CNX Gas used the proceeds to pay a special dividend to CONSOL Energy. The pre tax gain recognized on this transaction was $327 million. Other income consists of interest income, gain or loss on the disposition of assets, equity in earnings of affiliates, service income, royalty income, rental income and miscellaneous income. 2006 2005 DollarVariance PercentageChange Business Interruption Insurance $ 79 $ 18 $ 61 338.9 % Royalty income 28 26 2 7.7 % Interest income 15 8 7 87.5 % Service income 13 11 2 18.2 % Gain on sale of assets 10 15 (5 ) (33.3 )% Equity in income of affiliates 1 3 (2 ) (66.7 )% Harmar Trust Settlement 7 (7 ) (100.0 )% Other miscellaneous 24 19 5 26.3 % Total other income $ 170 $ 107 $ 63 58.9 % Buchanan Mine experienced a fire that developed in the mine after a large rock fall behind our longwall mining section on February 14, 2005. The mine was temporarily sealed in order to extinguish the fire. Coal production resumed on June 16, 2005. CONSOL Energy filed an insurance claim for reimbursement of various costs and business interruption related to the fire at Buchanan Mine. During the year ended December 31, 2006, 72 Table of Contents CONSOL Energy received proceeds from the insurance companies of $38 million. The $38 million was recognized as other income; coal segment recognized $29 million and gas segment recognized $9 million. We had received and recognized as other income $18 million of insurance proceeds in the 2005 period. We have received a total of $70 million from the insurance companies since the incident occurred. No additional reimbursement from the insurance carriers related to this claim will be recovered. Buchanan Mine also experienced a problem with the mines skip hoist mechanism on September 16, 2005 which caused the mine to be idled. Repairs to the skip hoist shaft and structures were completed and the mine resumed production on December 13, 2005. CONSOL Energy filed an insurance claim for reimbursement of various costs and business interruption related to the skip incident at Buchanan Mine. During the year ended December 31, 2006, CONSOL Energy recognized proceeds from the insurance companies of $41 million. The $41 million was recognized as other income; coal segment recognized $40 million and gas segment recognized $1 million. No additional reimbursement from the insurance carriers related to this claim will be recovered. Royalty income increased $2 million due primarily to higher gas prices and additional production on existing royalty contracts. Royalty income received from third parties is calculated as a percentage of the third party sales price. Interest income increased due to our improved cash position throughout 2006 compared to 2005. The improved cash position was primarily due to the August 2005 sale of 18.5% interest in CNX Gas. The private sale of this stock resulted in $420 million of proceeds. Service income represents various miscellaneous revenues from coal fines recovery projects, processing fees for third party coal and other miscellaneous activities. The increase in revenues is attributable to new agreements in 2006 with third parties which allow them to recover coal fines from preparation slurry ponds for a fee. The decrease in gain on sale of assets in the 2006 period reflects various transactions that occurred throughout both periods, none of which were individually material. The equity in income of affiliates decreased in the period to period comparison due primarily to CONSOL Energys portion of a 2005 period gain on sale of land by an affiliate. Other income from the Harmar Environmental Trust (the Trust) Settlement was attributable to the Civil Division of the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny Countys decision to terminate a Trust among CONSOL Energy and other parties. The Trust was established in 1988 to provide funding for water treatment related to the now closed Harmar Mine. Other parties funded the Trust. CONSOL Energy was responsible to complete water treatment activities, but all costs associated with these activities were funded by the Trust Agreement. Any excess funding upon completion of water treatment or a specified date in the future was to be distributed to parties that originally funded the trust. In the decision, all previously funded, but unused, amounts remaining in the Trust were distributed. CONSOL Energys portion of the distributed funds was $15 million. CONSOL Energy is responsible for the ongoing water treatment at this facility. CONSOL Energy recorded the funds and the present value of the water treatment liability resulting in $6.5 million of income in the 2005 period. The $5 million increase in other income was due to various transactions that occurred throughout both periods, none of which were individually material. 73 Table of Contents Costs 2006 2005 DollarVariance PercentageChange Cost of Goods Sold and Other Charges Produced Coal $ 1,705 $ 1,613 $ 92 5.7 % Purchased Coal 80 89 (9 ) (10.1 )% Produced Gas 107 79 28 35.4 % Industrial Supplies 119 105 14 13.3 % Closed and Idle Mines 109 69 40 58.0 % Other 129 166 (37 ) (22.3 )% Total Cost of Goods Sold and Other Charges 2,249 2,121 128 6.0 % Gas Royalty Interest 42 37 5 13.5 % Purchased Gas 45 279 (234 ) (83.9 )% Total Cost of Goods Sold $ 2,336 $ 2,437 $ (101 ) (4.1 )% Increased cost of goods sold and other charges for company produced coal were due mainly to a 7.7% increase in cost per ton of produced coal sold, offset particularly by a 1.9% decrease in sales volumes. 2006 2005 Variance PercentageChange Produced Tons Sold (in millions) 67.6 68.9 (1.3 ) (1.9 )% Average Cost of Goods Sold and Other Charges Per Ton $ 25.22 $ 23.42 $ 1.80 7.7 % Cost of goods sold and other charges for produced tons sold increased due mainly to an acceleration of previously unrecognized actuarial losses related to our salary pension plan. Our defined benefit pension plan for salaried employees allows such employees to receive a lump sum distribution for benefits earned through December 31, 2005 in lieu of annual payments when they retire from CONSOL Energy. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 88, Employers Accounting for Settlements & Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits, requires that when the lump sum distributions made for a plan year, which for CONSOL Energy is October 1 to September 30, exceed the total of the service cost and interest cost for the plan year, an adjustment equaling the unrecognized actuarial gain or loss resulting from each individual who received a lump sum in that year be recognized. The total accelerated actuarial amortization was $17.8 million, of which $13.8 impacted cost of goods sold and other charges for produced coal. Increased cost of goods sold and other charges were also attributable to higher supply costs, contract mining fees, labor costs, subsidence costs, and higher insurance premiums. Higher supply costs were attributable to additional maintenance projects and increased cost for electrical products, petroleum products and chemicals, such as diesel fuel and magnetite used in the mining and coal preparation process. Supply costs have also increased due to additional costs being incurred related to the adoption of new safety regulations, as previously discussed. Increased contract mining fees were attributable to increased fees negotiated with the contractors used primarily in our central Appalachian operations. Increased labor costs were attributable to increased employee counts and increased wages at certain mining operations. Employee counts have been increased in certain locations to maintain development rates ahead of the longwall mining units. New employees have also been added as trainees which will replace skilled employees expected to retire between now and the end of the decade. Increased employee counts were also necessary to maintain underground belt haulage systems and complete additional roof and rib support. Additional roof and rib support requirements have been necessary due to changes in underground geology and mining conditions. Labor rates were increased in order to stay competitive in certain labor markets. Higher subsidence costs reflect higher costs related to the Pennsylvania Department Environmental Protection regulation titled Surface Water Protection Underground Bituminous Coal Mining Operation. The application of this regulation requires additional costs when mining may affect perennial and intermittent streams. Subsidence costs also increased due to the location of mining activities affecting more surface structures in the 2006 period than in the 2005 period. Higher insurance premiums are attributable to higher costs of property 74 Table of Contents damage and business interruption coverage in the 2006 period compared to the 2005 period. These increases in costs were offset, in part, by lower other post employment benefit costs, workers compensation costs and combined fund costs. Other post employment benefit costs were lower in the 2006 period compared to the 2005 period due to CONSOL Energys 2005 plan amendment removing the election of the Federal Subsidy provision of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the Act). Instead, we will coordinate benefits with available Medicare coverage considered the primary payer. Medicare is considered the primary payer under our plan. This plan amendment resulted in a reduction of the accumulated projected benefit obligation and will be amortized to earnings. Workers compensation expenses have been reduced due to lower state administrative fees charged by the state of West Virginia due to changes in that states workers compensation program. Unit costs were also improved due to lower combined fund costs as a result of lower monthly premiums as well as lower sales volumes in the period to period comparison. Purchased coal cost of goods sold and other charges decreased in the 2006 period compared to the 2005 period. 2006 2005 Variance PercentageChange Purchased Tons Sold (in millions) 1.3 1.5 (0.2 ) (13.3 )% Average Cost of Goods Sold and Other Charges Per Ton $ 60.47 $ 59.28 $ 1.19 2.0 % The higher average cost of purchased coal is primarily due to overall increases in prices for domestic coals. Produced gas cost of goods sold and other charges increased due to increased sales volumes and higher unit costs. 2006 2005 Variance PercentageChange Produced Gas Sales Volumes (in billion cubic feet) 55.3 47.9 7.4 15.4 % Average Cost Per Thousand Cubic Feet $ 1.93 $ 1.65 $ 0.28 17.0 % The increase in average cost per thousand cubic feet of gas sold was primarily attributable to firm transportation. Firm transportation costs increased approximately $0.13 per thousand cubic feet in the period to period comparison. Approximately $0.06 per thousand cubic feet of the firm transportation increase is the result of the application of EITF 04 13, Accounting for Purchases and Sales of Inventory with the Same Counterparty as of January 1, 2006. EITF 04 13 requires the combining of matching buy/sell transactions, done in contemplation of one another, committed to on or after January 1, 2006. The net result for transactions that meet the above criteria are reflected in transportation expense in the current year. Previously, these transactions were accounted for as purchased gas revenue and purchased gas expense. Approximately $0.07 per thousand cubic feet of the increase in firm transportation was due to additional fees to purchase firm transportation capacity on the TCO interstate pipeline in order to avoid potential curtailments on portions of shipment capacity allocated to CNX Gas. The potential curtailments are due to increased demand for pipeline access in the 2006 period. Unit costs also increased due to higher power costs. Power costs per unit were $0.06 per thousand cubic feet higher due to both increased megawatt hour rates charged by our power providers and the use of more electric compressors during 2006 period that were previously powered by gas for most of the 2005 period. Salary and wages have also increased approximately $0.08 per thousand cubic feet due to additional staffing added to achieve desired drilling and production results. Unit costs have increased due to an additional $0.04 per thousand cubic feet related to leasing and brokering of land. Produced gas cost of goods sold per unit also increased by $0.06 per thousand cubic feet due to various transactions that occurred throughout both periods, none of which were individually material. These increases in unit costs were offset, in part, by lower well maintenance costs per unit. Maintenance costs per unit decreased $0.09 per thousand cubic feet in the period to period comparison. This improvement was due to maintenance projects being accelerated in prior periods. The improvement was also due to efficiencies in the water collection infrastructure being realized subsequent to the improvements that were made in the 2005 period. Well maintenance costs per unit also decreased due to additional production in the period to period comparison. 75 Table of Contents Industrial supplies cost of goods sold increased $14 million primarily due to higher sales volumes and higher unit costs. Closed and idle mine cost of goods sold increased $40 million in the 2006 period compared to the 2005 period. These expenses increased $28 million due to Shoemaker Mine, VP #8 Mine and various other locations being idle for the majority of the 2006 period. These locations were in production for the full 2005 period. The increase was also attributable to higher expenses related to mine closing, perpetual care water treatment and reclamation liability adjustments that were the result of updated engineering surveys. Survey adjustments resulted in $10 million of additional expense in the 2006 period for closed and idled locations compared to the results of the survey adjustment in the 2005 period. Closed and idle mine cost of good sold and other charges also increased $2 million due to various transactions that occurred throughout both periods, none of which were individually material. Miscellaneous cost of goods sold and other charges decreased due to the following items: 2006 2005 DollarVariance PercentageChange Buchanan Mine fire $ $ 34 $ (34 ) (100.0 )% Buchanan Mine skip hoist accident 3 (3 ) (100.0 )% Sales contract buy outs 13 (13 ) (100.0 )% Litigation settlements and contingencies 1 10 (9 ) (90.0 )% Incentive compensation 24 35 (11 ) (31.4 )% Bank fees 9 12 (3 ) (25.0 )% Accounts receivable securitization fees 2 (2 ) (100.0 )% Coal property holdings costs 9 10 (1 ) (10.0 )% Terminal/River operations 51 24 27 112.5 % Stock based compensation expense 23 4 19 475.0 % Miscellaneous transactions 12 19 (7 ) (36.8 )% Total Miscellaneous Cost of Goods Sold and Other Charges $ 129 $ 166 $ (37 ) (22.3 )% CONSOL Energys Buchanan Mine, located near Keen Mountain, Virginia, experienced a large rock fall behind its longwall mining section on February 14, 2005. While caving behind the longwall is a normal part of the mining process, the size of this cave in created a large air pressure wave that disrupted ventilation and also caused an ignition of methane gas in the area. CONSOL Energy temporarily sealed the mine in order to extinguish the fire that developed after the ignition. Various materials, including nitrogen foam and water were pumped into the mine in order to accelerate the process of creating an inert environment within the mine to extinguish the fire. Coal production resumed on June 16, 2005. Costs of goods sold incurred for the Buchanan Mine fire, net of expected insurance recovery, for the year ended December 31, 2005 were $34 million. The incident was covered under CONSOL Energys property and business interruption insurance policy as previously discussed. On September 16, 2005, CONSOL Energys Buchanan Mine also had an accident with its skip hoist, the device that lifts coal from underground to the surface, forcing the mine to suspend coal production. The braking mechanism on the hoist failed to hold a loaded skip at the surface before it could dump its load. The loaded skip fell approximately 1,600 feet back through the shaft to the bottom. Simultaneously, the empty skip was propelled upward to the surface as the loaded skip fell, causing the empty skip to strike the top of the hoist mechanism before also falling back to the shaft bottom. Expenses related to clean up of the damaged hoist for the year ended December 31, 2005, were approximately $3 million. This accident was covered under our property and business interruption insurance policy. In the 2005 period, agreements were made to buy out sales contracts with several customers in order to release tons committed under lower priced contracts for sale to other customers at higher pricing. No such agreements were made in the 2006 period. 76 Table of Contents Litigation settlements and contingencies in the 2005 period were attributable to a settlement agreement with certain lessors in western Kentucky. The settlement agreement included the transfer of certain properties and permits, as well as a cash payment to the lessors, with the lessors assuming all reclamation liability for the mine property which is being transferred. Various other contingencies were incurred in both periods, none of which were individually material. Incentive compensation expense decreased due to a lower amount projected to be paid to employees for the 2006 period compared to the 2005 period. The lower amount expected to be paid to employees is due to CONSOL Energy falling short of the predetermined earnings level under the plan. The incentive compensation program is designed to increase compensation to eligible employees when CONSOL Energy reaches predetermined earnings targets and the employees reach predetermined performance targets. Bank fees decreased primarily due to no borrowings on our credit facility being made throughout the 2006 period. Accounts receivable securitization fees decreased in the period to period comparison. No amounts were drawn under this program in the 2006 period. Lower coal property holding costs were attributable to decreased expenses related to leasehold surrenders in the 2006 period. CONSOL Energy has an initiative to increase towing revenues for outside parties now that we are no longer restricted under the Jones Act Bowater exemption. Prior to February 2004, foreign ownership of CONSOL Energy exceeded 25%, prohibiting us from providing river barge towing to third parties. This initiative to increase revenues has also increased costs. In January 2006, CONSOL Energy completed the acquisition of Mon River Towing and J.A.R. Barge Lines, LLC, which also contributed to the increase in costs. Effective January 1, 2006, CONSOL Energy adopted the fair value recognition provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R), Share Based Payment (SFAS 123R). Stock based compensation expense now includes compensation expense for all stock based compensation awards granted prior to, but not yet vested as of January 1, 2006. The grant date fair value is recognized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award, which is generally the option vesting term. Prior to implementing SFAS 123R, CONSOL Energy followed previously issued accounting guidance which did not require compensation expense to be recognized for stock option awards. Also, in April 2004, CONSOL Energy began to issue restricted stock units as part of its equity incentive plan. Compensation cost for the restricted stock units is based upon the closing share price at the date of grant and is recognized over the vesting period of the units. The increase in stock based compensation expense in the 2006 period is also due to additional compensation costs for restricted stock unit grants that occurred in the 2006 period. Miscellaneous cost of goods sold and other charges decreased $7 million due to various transactions that occurred throughout both periods, none of which were individually material. 2006 2005 Variance PercentageChange Gas Royalty Interest Sales Volumes (in billion cubic feet) 7.6 6.6 1.0 15.2 % Average Cost Per Thousand Cubic Feet $ 5.54 $ 5.57 $ (0.03 ) (0.5 )% 77 Table of Contents Included in royalty interest gas costs are the expenses related to the portion of production associated with royalty interest owners. The decrease in average cost per unit is a function of the market price in the 2006 period compared to the 2005 period. Volumes increased as a result of additional wells coming online from our on going drilling program and the 2005 period sales volumes being negatively impacted by the shutdown of Buchanan Mine due to the mine fire. 2006 2005 Variance PercentageChange Purchased Gas Sales Volumes (in billion cubic feet) 6.1 28.7 (22.6 ) (78.7 )% Average Cost Per Thousand Cubic Feet $ 7.34 $ 9.71 $ (2.37 ) (24.4 )% Included in purchased gas costs are volumes of gas we simultaneously purchased from and sold to the same counterparties between the segmentation and interruptible pools on the Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation (TCO) pipeline in order to satisfy obligations to certain customers. In accordance with EITF 99 19, we have historically recorded our revenues and our costs on a gross basis. However, because we adopted EITF 04 13 on January 1, 2006, purchased gas sales and volumes have decreased. The net result for transactions that meet the above criteria are reflected in transportation expense in the 2006 period. The decrease in costs per unit is a function of the average sales price, before the effects of financial swap transactions, being higher in the 2005 period than in the 2006 period. Additionally, there were small volumes of gas we purchase from third party producers at market prices less our gathering charge, which we then resell. Freight expense is based on weight of coal shipped, negotiated freight rates and method of transportation (i.e., rail, barge, truck, etc.) used for the customers to whom CONSOL Energy contractually provides transportation. Freight expense is billed to customers and the revenue from such billing equals the transportation expense. 2006 2005 Variance PercentageChange Freight expense $ 163 $ 120 $ 43 35.8 % Selling, general and administrative costs have increased due to the following items: 2006 2005 DollarVariance PercentageChange Wages and salaries $ 32 $ 27 $ 5 18.5 % Employee benefits 11 11 Professional, consulting and other purchased services 23 20 3 15.0 % Other 25 23 2 8.7 % Total Selling, General and Administrative $ 91 $ 81 $ 10 12.3 % Wages and salaries have increased in the period to period comparison due to additional positions being added related to CNX Gas, an 81.5% owned subsidiary, being a separate publicly traded company. Salary retirement costs increased due mainly to an acceleration of previously unrecognized actuarial losses related to our salary pension plan. Our defined benefit pension plan for salaried employees allows such employees to receive a lump sum distribution in lieu of annual payments when they retire from CONSOL Energy. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 88, Employers Accounting for Settlements & Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits, requires that when the lump sum distributions for benefits earned through December 31, 2005 made for a plan year, which for CONSOL Energy is October 1 to September 30, exceed the total of the service cost and interest cost for the plan year, an adjustment equaling the unrecognized actuarial gain or loss resulting from each individual who received a lump sum in that year be recognized. The total accelerated actuarial amortization was $17.8 million, of which $2.1 million impacted selling, general and administrative expense. The salary retirement increase was offset by a reduction in other post 78 Table of Contents employment benefits. Other post employment benefit costs were lower in the 2006 period compared to the 2005 period due to CONSOL Energys 2005 plan amendment removing the election of the Federal Subsidy provision of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the Act). Instead, we will coordinate benefits with available Medicare coverage considered the primary payer. This plan amendment resulted in a reduction of the accumulated projected benefit obligation and will be amortized to earnings. Costs of professional, consulting and other purchased services were higher in the 2006 period compared to the 2005 period primarily due to additional costs related to CNX Gas being a separate publicly traded company throughout all of 2006, offset, in part, by a reduction in professional, consulting and other purchased services by CONSOL Energy. Other selling, general and administrative costs increased $2 million due to various transactions that occurred throughout both periods, none of which were individually material. Depreciation, depletion and amortization increased due to the following items: 2006 2005 DollarVariance PercentageChange Coal $ 241 $ 214 $ 27 12.6 % Gas: Production 25 23 2 8.7 % Gathering 13 12 1 8.3 % Total Gas 38 35 3 8.6 % Other 17 13 4 30.8 % Total Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization $ 296 $ 262 $ 34 13.0 % The increase in coal depreciation, depletion and amortization was primarily attributable to assets placed in service after the 2005 period. Assets placed in service after the 2005 period include various airshafts, longwall assets, haulage assets and various other projects completed at our mines. The increase in gas production related depreciation, depletion and amortization was primarily due to the net effect of additional volumes in the current year and a slightly lower unit of production rate in 2006 compared to 2005. Rates are generally calculated using the net book value of assets at January 1, divided by either proved or proved developed reserves. Gathering depreciation, depletion and amortization is recorded on the straight line method and increased due to additional assets being placed in service in 2006, including the effects of the Jewell Ridge lateral pipeline. The Jewell Ridge lateral pipeline was completed in October 2006. CNX Gas entered into a 15 year firm transportation agreement with ETNG, a subsidiary of Duke Energy, at pre determined fixed rates. The present value of the payments under this firm transportation agreement is approximately $67 million. In addition to providing us with transportation flexibility, the Jewell Ridge lateral will provide access for our production to growing Southeastern and East Coal markets. Other depreciation increased $4 million in the 2006 period primarily due to the January 2006, acquisition of Mon River Towing and J.A.R. Barge Lines, LLC. The acquisition included 13 towboats and more than 350 barges with the capacity to transport 13 million tons of coal annually. Interest expense decreased in the 2006 period compared to the 2005 period. 2006 2005 DollarVariance PercentageChange Long term Secured notes $ 24 $ 24 $ Capitalized lease 2 2 100.0 % Other (1 ) 3 (4 ) (133.3 )% Total Interest Expense $ 25 $ 27 $ (2 ) (7.4 )% 79 Table of Contents Interest on long term debt remained consistent in the period to period comparison. Capitalized lease interest expense relates to an agreement that was entered into in March 2006. The agreement was for the acquisition of longwall equipment that was required to be treated as a capital lease under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 13, Accounting for Leases. Capitalized lease interest expense also increased due to the Jewell Ridge lateral pipeline coming on line in October 2006. The firm transportation agreement related to the use of this pipeline was also treated as a capital lease. Other interest expense decreased due to higher amounts of interest capitalized in the 2006 period compared to the 2005 period. Higher capitalized interest was attributable to the higher level of capital projects funded from operating cash flow in the 2006 period, primarily due to the slope, overland belt and preparation plant projects at the Robinson Run Mine. Taxes other than income increased primarily due to the following items: 2006 2005 DollarVariance PercentageChange Production taxes: Coal $ 157 $ 145 $ 12 8.3 % Gas 12 10 2 20.0 % Total Production Taxes 169 155 14 9.0 % Other taxes: Coal 71 62 9 14.5 % Gas 4 4 Other 9 8 1 12.5 % Other 84 74 10 13.5 % Total Taxes Other Than Income $ 253 $ 229 $ 24 10.5 % Increased coal production taxes are primarily due to higher severance taxes and higher black lung excise taxes attributable to higher average sales price. Severance taxes have also increased due to an additional tax imposed by the State of West Virginia. Under the new West Virginia severance tax rules, an additional $0.56 per ton of coal produced is due to the State. Increased gas production taxes are primarily due to higher severance taxes attributable to higher average sales price for gas and higher sales volumes. Other coal taxes increased due to higher property taxes. Property tax increases are primarily attributable to higher assessments in various counties where our coal holdings are located. Other coal taxes also increased due to capital stock and franchise taxes. Additional capital stock and franchise taxes are attributable to the higher earnings achieved in the year ended December 31, 2005. Other gas taxes remained consistent in the period to period comparison. Other miscellaneous taxes increased due to capital stock and franchise taxes. Additional capital stock and franchise taxes are attributable to the higher earnings achieved in the year ended December 31, 2005. 2006 2005 Variance PercentageChange Earnings Before Income Taxes and Minority Interest $ 551 $ 655 $ (104 ) (15.9 )% Tax Expense 112 64 48 75.0 % Effective Income Tax Rate 20.3 % 9.8 % 10.5 % 80 Table of Contents CONSOL Energys effective tax rate is sensitive to changes to the relationship between pre tax earnings and percentage depletion, as well as increases and decreases in valuation allowances. See Note 7 in Item 8 of the Notes to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10 K. CONSOL Energys effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2005 was impacted by the gain of $327 million resulting from the sale of 18.5% of CNX Gas stock, as previously discussed. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, no deferred tax has been provided on this transaction as current tax law provides a means by which the excess of the reported amount of this investment over its tax basis can be recovered tax free. Also, management has no current intention of entering into a transaction that would cause CNX Gas to leave the consolidated tax group. Minority Interest Minority interest represents 18.5% of CNX Gas net income which CONSOL Energy does not own. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and at the date of the financial statements. Note 1 of the Notes to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10 K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. On an on going basis, we evaluate our estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making the judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from those estimates upon subsequent resolution of identified matters. Management believes that the estimates utilized are reasonable. The following critical accounting policies are materially impacted by judgments, assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Other Post Employment Benefits CONSOL Energy has historically provided retiree health benefits to employees that retire with at least ten years of service and have attained age 55. Effective August 1, 2003, the eligibility requirement for salaried employees was changed to either twenty years of service and age 55, or fifteen years of service and age 62. Additionally, any salaried or non represented hourly employees that are hired or rehired effective January 1, 2007 or later will not become eligible for retiree health benefits. In lieu of traditional retiree health coverage, if certain eligibility requirements are met, these employees may be eligible to receive a retiree medical spending allowance of $2,250 per year of service at retirement. Eligibility requirements for represented hourly employees hired before January 1, 2007 have not changed from CONSOL Energys historical requirements. Newly employed inexperienced employees represented by the UMWA, hired after January 1, 2007 will not be eligible to receive retiree benefits. In lieu of these benefits, these employees will receive a defined contribution benefit of $1 per each hour worked. At December 31, 2007, the retiree health plan provided benefits to approximately 24,500 of our former employees and their eligible dependents. The medical plan which covers eligible salaried employees and retirees also includes a cost sharing structure where essentially all participants contribute 20% of plan costs. Annual cost increases for the salary plan in excess of 6% are paid entirely by the salaried participants. After our review, various actuarial assumptions, including discount rate, expected trend in health care costs, average remaining service period, average remaining life expectancy, per capita costs and participation level in each future year are used by our independent actuary to estimate the cost and benefit obligations for our retiree health plans. Most assumptions used in 2007 have not differed materially from the prior year actual experience. Expected trend in health care cost assumptions have been changed since the prior year. Separate trend assumptions have been established for medical, drug, pre 65 and post 65 costs as opposed to one trend 81 Table of Contents assumption for all costs in prior years. The initial expected trend in health care costs at this years measurement date (currently September 30) was 8.0% compared to a prior year expected 2008 trend in health care cost of 8.5%. A 1.0% decrease in the health care trend rate would decrease interest and service cost for 2007 by approximately $17.0 million. The discount rate is also determined each year at the measurement date. The discount rate is estimated by utilizing a hypothetical bond portfolio which approximates the future cash flow necessary to service our other postretirement liability. The hypothetical bond portfolio looks to rates of return on high quality, fixed income investments that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized ratings agency. For the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, the discount rate used to calculate the period end liability and the following years expense was 6.63% and 6.00%, respectively. A 0.25% increase in the discount rate would have decreased 2007 net periodic postretirement benefit costs by approximately $4.1 million. A 0.25% decrease in the discount rate would have increased 2007 net periodic postretirement benefit costs by approximately $4.4 million. Deferred gains and losses are primarily due to historical changes in the discount rate and medical cost inflation differing from expectations in prior years. Changes to interest rates for the rates of returns on instruments that could be used to settle the actuarially determined plan obligations introduce substantial volatility to our costs. Accumulated actuarial gains or losses in excess of a pre established corridor are amortized on a straight line basis over the expected future service of active salary employees to their assumed retirement age. The average remaining service period for our salaried plans is approximately 11 years at December 31, 2007. Accumulated actuarial gains or losses in excess of a pre established corridor are amortized on a straight line basis over the expected remaining life of our retired United Mine Workers of America (UMWA) population. The average remaining service period of this population is not used for amortization purposes because the majority of the UMWA population of our plan is retired. The average remaining life expectancy of our retired UMWA population used to calculate the following years expense is approximately 13 years at December 31, 2007. Per capita costs on a per annum basis for Other Postretirement Benefits were assumed to be $6,072 at December 31, 2007. This was approximately a 6.5% increase, after adjusting for plan design changes and demographic shifts from the per capita cost on a per annum basis at December 31, 2006. The increase was due to healthcare cost trends and was within the range expected by our assumptions. If the actual increase in per capita cost of medical services or other postretirement benefits are significantly greater or less than the projected trend rates, the per capita cost assumption would need to be adjusted, which could have a significant effect on the costs and liabilities recognized in the financial statements. Significant increases in health and prescription drug costs for represented hourly retirees could have a material adverse effect on CONSOL Energys operating cash flow. The effect on CONSOL Energys cash flow from operations for salaried and non represented hourly employees has been limited to approximately 6% of the previous years medical cost for salaried employees due to the cost sharing provision in the benefit plan. On September 29, 2006, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans (SFAS 158) was issued. SFAS 158 required, among other things, the recognition of the funded status of each defined pension benefit plan and other postretirement benefit plans on the balance sheet. Each overfunded plan is recognized as an asset and each underfunded plan is recognized as a liability. The subsequent change in the funded status of the plans is recognized as a component of accumulated comprehensive income in stockholders equity. Additionally, SFAS 158 requires an employer to measure the funded status of its plans as of the date of its year end statement of financial position. This provision becomes effective for CONSOL Energy for its December 31, 2008 year end. Currently, CONSOL Energy uses a September 30 measurement date for its other postretirement benefit plans. The estimated liability recognized in the December 31, 2007 financial statements was $2.5 billion. For the year ended December 31, 2007, we paid approximately $137.5 million for Other Postretirement Benefits, all of which were paid from operating cash flow. Our obligations with respect to these liabilities are unfunded at December 31, 2007. CONSOL Energy does not expect to contribute to the other postretirement plan in 2008. We intend to pay benefit claims as they are due. 82 Table of Contents Salaried Pensions CONSOL Energy has non contributory defined benefit retirement plans covering substantially all employees not covered by multi employer plans. The benefits for these plans are based primarily on years of service and employees pay near retirement. Effective January 1, 2006, employees hired between August 1, 2004 and December 31, 2005 that were not previously eligible to participate in the plans began accruing service. The CONSOL Energy salaried plan allows for lump sum distributions of benefits earned up until December 31, 2005, at the employees election. As of January 1, 2006, lump sum benefits have been frozen, and the lump sum option has been eliminated for benefits accrued prospectively. Effective January 1, 2007, employees hired by CNX Gas, an 81.7 % owned subsidiary, will not be eligible to participate in CNX Gas non contributory defined benefit retirement plan. In lieu of participation in the non contributory defined benefit plan, these employees began receiving an additional 3% company contribution into their defined contribution plan. CNX Gas employees who were hired prior to December 31, 2005 or who were employees of CONSOL Energy prior to this date were given a one time opportunity to elect to remain in the defined benefit plan or opt to freeze their service accruals and participate in the additional 3% company contribution into their defined contribution plan. All employees hired on or after January 1, 2006, but on or before December 31, 2006 had their current non contributory defined benefit frozen and began receiving the additional 3% company contribution into their defined contribution plan, effective January 1, 2007. CNX Gas intends to freeze all defined benefit accruals as of December 31, 2016 for CNX Gas employees that elected to remain in the defined benefit plan. Our independent actuaries calculate the actuarial present value of the estimated retirement obligation based on assumptions including rates of compensation, mortality rates, retirement age and interest rates. Several of these assumptions have been updated from the prior year to reflect anticipated future experience. For the year ended December 31, 2007, compensation increases are assumed to range from 3% to 8% depending on age and job classification. Retirement rate assumptions were also increased and begin at 1% for employees at age 50 and increase to 100% for employees at age 65. The discount rate is also determined each year at the measurement date. The discount rate is estimated by utilizing a hypothetical bond portfolio which approximates the future cash flow necessary to service our other postretirement liability. The hypothetical bond portfolio looks to rates of return on high quality, fixed income investments that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized ratings agency. For the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, the discount rate used to calculate the period end liability and the following years expense was 6.57% and 6.00%, respectively. A 0.25% increase in the discount rate would have decreased the 2007 net periodic pension cost by $1.3 million. A 0.25% decrease in the discount rate would have increased the 2006 net periodic pension cost by $1.3 million. Deferred gains and losses are primarily due to historical changes in the discount rate and earnings on assets differing from expectations in prior years. The average remaining service period is approximately 10 years at December 31, 2007. Changes to any of these assumptions introduce substantial volatility to our costs. On September 29, 2006, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans (SFAS 158) was issued. SFAS 158 required, among other things, the recognition of the funded status of each defined pension benefit plan and other postretirement benefit plans on the balance sheet. Each overfunded plan is recognized as an asset and each underfunded plan is recognized as a liability. The subsequent change in the funded status of the plans is recognized as a component of accumulated comprehensive income in stockholders equity. Additionally, SFAS 158 requires an employer to measure the funded status of its plans as of the date of its year end statement of financial position. This provision becomes effective for CONSOL Energy for its December 31, 2008 year end. Currently, CONSOL Energy uses a September 30 measurement date for its salaried pension plans. The estimated liability at December 31, 2007 was $70.2 million. CONSOL Energy expects to contribute approximately $28.0 million to the pension plan in 2008. The market related asset value is derived by taking the cost value of assets as of September 30, 2007 and multiplying it by the average 36 month ratio of the market value of assets to the cost value of assets. CONSOL Energys pension plan weighted average asset allocations at September 30, 2007 consisted of 60% equity securities and 40% debt securities. 83 Table of Contents The CONSOL Energy Employee Retirement and the Restoration Plan allow for lump sum distributions earned up until December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2006, respectively. As of January 1, 2006, lump sum benefits have been frozen and prospectively the lump sum option has been eliminated for the Employee Retirement Plan. As of January 1, 2007, the Restoration Plan has been frozen. According to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 88, Employers Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits, if the lump sum distributions made for the plan year, which is currently October 1 to September 30, exceed the total of the service cost and interest cost for the plan year, settlement accounting is required. Lump sum payments exceeded this threshold in the Restoration Plan during 2007. CONSOL Energy recognized expense of $2.7 million in the current years results of operations. The adjustment equaled the previously unrecognized actuarial loss resulting from each individual who received a lump sum in that year. CONSOL regularly monitors this situation. If this settlement accounting is triggered again in the future, the adjustment could materially impact operating results. Workers Compensation and Coal Workers Pneumoconiosis Workers compensation is a system by which individuals who sustain employment related physical injuries or some type of occupational diseases are compensated for their disabilities, medical costs, and on some occasions, for the costs of their rehabilitation. Workers compensation will also compensate the survivors of workers who suffer employment related deaths. The workers compensation laws are administered by state agencies with each state having its own set of rules and regulations regarding compensation that is owed to an employee that is injured in the course of employment. CONSOL Energy records an actuarially calculated liability, which is determined using various assumptions, including discount rate, future healthcare cost trends, benefit duration and recurrence of injuries. The discount rate is determined each year at the measurement date (currently September 30). The discount rate is estimated by utilizing a hypothetical bond portfolio which approximates the future cash flow necessary to service our workers compensation liability. The hypothetical bond portfolio looks to rates of return on high quality, fixed income investments that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized ratings agency. For the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, the discount rate used to calculate the period end liability and the following years expense was 5.94% and 6.00%, respectively. A 0.25% increase or decrease in the discount rate would not have materially decreased or increased the 2007 workers compensation expense. Deferred gains and losses are primarily due to historical changes in the discount rates, several years of favorable claims experience, various favorable claims experience, various favorable state legislation changes and an over all lower incident rate than our assumptions. Accumulated actuarial gains or losses are amortized on a straight line basis over the expected future benefit duration of current claimants. The average expected benefit duration for this group is approximately 9 years at December 31, 2007. The estimated liability recognized in the financial statements at December 31, 2007 was approximately $162.1 million. CONSOL Energys policy has been to provide for workers compensation benefits from operating cash flow. No funding has been provided to cover these benefits. For the year ended December 31, 2007, we made payments for workers compensation benefits of approximately $45.5 million, all of which was paid from operating cash flow. CONSOL Energy is responsible under the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969, as amended, for medical and disability benefits to employees and their dependents resulting from occurrences of coal workers pneumoconiosis disease. CONSOL Energy is also responsible under various state statutes for pneumoconiosis benefits. After our review, our independent actuaries calculate the actuarial present value of the estimated pneumoconiosis obligation based on assumptions regarding disability incidence, medical costs, mortality, death benefits, dependents and discount rates. The discount rate is determined each year at the measurement date (currently September 30). The discount rate is estimated by utilizing a hypothetical bond portfolio which approximates the future cash flow necessary to service our coal workers pneumoconiosis liability. The hypothetical bond portfolio looks to rates of return on high quality, fixed income investments that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized ratings agency. For the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, the discount rate used to calculate the period end liability and the following years expense was 6.62% and 6.00%, respectively. A 0.25% increase or decrease in the discount rate would not have materially 84 Table of Contents decreased or increased the 2007 coal workers pneumoconiosis expense. Actuarial gains associated with coal workers pneumoconiosis have resulted from numerous legislative changes over many years which have resulted in lower approval rates for filed claims than our assumptions originally reflected. Actuarial gains have also resulted from lower incident rates and lower severity of claims filed than our assumption originally reflected. The estimated liability recognized in the financial statements at December 31, 2007 was approximately $182.9 million. For the year ended December 31, 2007, we paid coal workers pneumoconiosis benefits of approximately $10.4 million. Our obligations with respect to these liabilities are unfunded at December 31, 2007. On September 29, 2006, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans (SFAS 158) was issued. SFAS 158 required, among other things, the recognition of the funded status of each defined pension benefit plan and other postretirement benefit plan on the balance sheet. Each overfunded plan is recognized as an asset and each underfunded plan is recognized as a liability. The subsequent change in the funded status of the plans is recognized as a component of accumulated comprehensive income in stockholders equity. Additionally, SFAS 158 requires an employer to measure the funded status of its plans as of the date of its year end statement of financial position. This provision becomes effective for CONSOL Energy for its December 31, 2008 year end. Currently, CONSOL Energy uses a September 30 measurement date for its workers compensation and coal workers pneumoconiosis plans. Reclamation and Mine Closure Obligations The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act establishes operational, reclamation and closure standards for all aspects of surface mining as well as most aspects of deep mining. CONSOL Energy accrues for the costs of current mine disturbance and final mine and gas well closure, including the cost of treating mine water discharge where necessary. Estimates of our total reclamation and mine closing liabilities, which are based upon permit requirements and CONSOL Energy engineering expertise related to these requirements, including the current portion, were approximately $482.3 million at December 31, 2007. This liability is reviewed annually by CONSOL Energy management and engineers. The estimated liability can significantly change if actual costs vary from assumptions or if governmental regulations change significantly. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations (SFAS No. 143) requires that the fair value of an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The present value of the estimated asset retirement costs is capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset. Asset retirement obligations primarily relate to the closure of mines and gas wells and the reclamation of land upon exhaustion of coal and gas reserves. Changes in the variables used to calculate the liabilities can have a significant effect on the mine closing, reclamation and gas well closing liabilities. The amounts of assets and liabilities recorded are dependent upon a number of variables, including the estimated future retirement costs, estimated proven reserves, assumptions involving profit margins, inflation rates, and the assumed credit adjusted risk free interest rate. SFAS No. 143 requires depreciation of the capitalized asset retirement cost and accretion of the asset retirement obligation over time. The depreciation will generally be determined on a units of production basis, whereas the accretion to be recognized will escalate over the life of the producing assets, typically as production declines. Income Taxes CONSOL Energy accounts for income taxes in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS No. 109) which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax basis of recorded assets and liabilities. SFAS No. 109 also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. All available evidence, both positive and negative, must be considered in determining the need for a valuation 85 Table of Contents allowance. At December 31, 2007, CONSOL Energy has deferred tax assets in excess of deferred tax liabilities of approximately $505.6 million. The deferred tax assets are evaluated periodically to determine if a valuation allowance is necessary. There were no significant changes in the deferred tax valuation allowances in the year ended December 31, 2007. For 2007, CONSOL Energy continues to report a deferred tax asset of approximately $36.2 million relating to CONSOL Energys state net operating loss carry forwards with a full valuation allowance. A review of the positive and negative evidence regarding these benefits, primarily the history of book and tax losses on a separate company basis, concluded that a valuation allowance was warranted. A valuation allowance of $23.1 million has also been recorded against the deferred state tax asset attributable to future deductible differences for certain subsidiaries with histories of book and tax losses. These net operating losses expire at various times from 2008 to 2027. Management will continue to assess the realization of deferred tax assets based upon updated income forecast data and the feasibility of future tax planning strategies, and may record adjustments to valuation allowances against deferred tax assets in future periods as appropriate that could materially impact net income. CONSOL Energy adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement 109 (FIN 48) on January 1, 2007. CONSOL Energy evaluates all tax positions taken on the state and federal tax filings to determine if the position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination. For positions that meet the more likely than not to be sustained criteria, an evaluation to determine the largest amount of benefit, determined on a cumulative probability basis that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement is determined. A previously recognized tax position is derecognized when it is subsequently determined that a tax position no longer meets the more likely than not threshold to be sustained. The evaluation of the sustainability of a tax position and the probable amount that is more likely than not is based on judgment, historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these estimates, that are not readily apparent from other sources, form the basis for recognizing a FIN 48 liability. Actual results could differ from those estimates upon subsequent resolution of identified matters. Estimates of our uncertain tax liabilities, including the current portion, were approximately $63.4 million at December 31, 2007. Stock Based Compensation On January 1, 2006, we adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R, Share Based Payments (SFAS No. 123R) using the modified prospective transition method. SFAS No. 123R eliminates the option of using the intrinsic value method of accounting previously available under APB No. 25, and requires companies to recognize in the financial statements the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of those awards. CONSOL Energy recorded $24.2 million of expense for the year ended December 31, 2007. The Black Scholes option pricing model is used to determine fair value of stock options at the grant date. Various inputs are utilized in the Black Scholes pricing model, such as: stock price on measurement date, exercise price defined in the award, expected dividend yield based on historical trend of dividend payouts, risk free interest rate based on a zero coupon treasury bond rate, expected term based on historical grant and exercise behavior, and expected volatility based on historic and implied stock price volatility of CONSOL Energy stock and public peer group stock. These factors can significantly impact the value of stock options expense recognized over the requisite service period of option holders. As of December 31, 2007, $15.6 million of total unrecognized compensation 86 Table of Contents cost related to unvested awards is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.15 years. See Note 19 in the Notes to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 in this Form 10 K for more information. Contingencies CONSOL Energy is currently involved in certain legal proceedings. We have accrued our estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of these claims. This estimate has been developed in consultation with legal counsel involved in the defense of these matters and is based upon an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies. Future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the outcome of these proceedings. Successful Efforts Accounting We use the successful efforts method to account for our exploration and production activities. Under this method, costs are accumulated on a field by field basis with certain exploratory expenditures and exploratory dry holes being expensed as incurred. Costs of productive wells and development dry holes are capitalized and amortized on the unit of production method. We use this accounting policy instead of the full cost method because it provides a more timely accounting of the success or failure of our exploration and production activities. Coal and Gas Reserve Values There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities and values of economically recoverable coal and gas reserves, including many factors beyond our control. As a result, estimates of economically recoverable coal and gas reserves are by their nature uncertain. Information about our reserves consists of estimates based on engineering, economic and geological data assembled and analyzed by our staff. Our gas reserves have been reviewed by independent experts. Approximately 95% of the amounts included in our 2007 coal reserves have been reviewed and confirmed by an independent third party consultant. Some of the factors and assumptions which impact economically recoverable reserve estimates include: geological conditions; historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas; the assumed effects of regulations and taxes by governmental agencies; assumptions governing future prices; and future operating costs. Each of these factors may in fact vary considerably from the assumptions used in estimating reserves. For these reasons, estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of coal and gas attributable to a particular group of properties, and classifications of these reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of future net cash flows, may vary substantially. Actual production, revenues and expenditures with respect to our reserves will likely vary from estimates, and these variances may be material. See Risk Factors in Item 1A of this report for a discussion of the uncertainties in estimating our reserves. Liquidity and Capital Resources CONSOL Energy generally has satisfied our working capital requirements and funded our capital expenditures and debt service obligations with cash generated from operations and proceeds from borrowings. On June 27, 2007, CONSOL Energy entered into an Amended and Restated five year $1 billion senior secured credit facility, which replaced the $750 million credit facility. The facility is secured by substantially all of the assets of CONSOL Energy and certain of its subsidiaries and collateral is shared equally and ratably with the 87 Table of Contents holders of CONSOL Energy Inc. 7.875% bonds maturing in 2012. The agreement provides for the release of collateral upon the achievement of certain credit ratings. Fees and interest rate spreads are based on a ratio of financial covenant debt to twelve month trailing earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization (EBITDA), measured quarterly. The facility includes a minimum interest coverage ratio of no less than 4.50 to 1.00, measured quarterly. The interest coverage ratio was 13.10 to 1.00 at December 31, 2007. The facility also includes a maximum leverage ratio of not more than 3.25 to 1.00, measured quarterly. The leverage ratio was 1.50 to 1.00 at December 31, 2007. Affirmative and negative covenants in the facility limit our ability to dispose of assets, make investments, purchase or redeem CONSOL Energy common stock, pay dividends and merge with another corporation. At December 31, 2007, the facility had approximately $248 million drawn and $259 million of letters of credit outstanding, leaving $493 million of unused capacity. In April and November 2007, CONSOL Energy and certain of our U.S. subsidiaries amended their existing trade accounts receivable facility with financial institutions for the sale on a continuous basis of eligible trade accounts receivable. The amended facility allows CONSOL Energy to receive, on a revolving basis, up to $165 million, a $40 million increase over the 2006 facility. The amended facility also allows for the issuance of letters of credit against the $165 million capacity. At December 31, 2007, eligible accounts receivable totaled approximately $116 million. There was no subordinated retained interest at December 31, 2007. Accounts receivable totaling $125 million were removed from the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2007. There were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2007. In accordance with the facility agreement, CONSOL Energy is able to receive proceeds based upon total eligible accounts receivable at the previous month end. Proceeds at December 31, 2007, determined by eligible accounts receivable at November 30, 2007, exceeded the eligible accounts receivable at December 31, 2007. The $10 million not supported by accounts receivable at December 31, 2007 is included in the $125 million of accounts receivable which were removed from the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2007. CONSOL Energys letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility have decreased by approximately $134 million at December 31, 2007 compared to December 31, 2006. This decrease was primarily due to a reduction of $118 million to the financial security required by the 1992 Fund. The reduction of security was due to the legislative change included in The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act Amendments of 2006. The new legislation requires certain annual transfers to be made from the Abandoned Mine Land (AML) program to the Combined Fund, 1992 Fund and the 1993 Fund. The current law was amended so that after a phase in period, the new legislation removes the annual cap on the amount of interest to be transferred and requires annual transfers of AML Fund interest to the Combined Fund, 1992 Fund and 1993 Fund to pay the health care benefits of retirees whose employers have gone out of business. Previous to the legislative change, benefits of retirees whose employers have gone out of business have been paid by the surviving companies participating in the funds. Because this funding requirement will be eliminated after the phase in period, security required by the funds has been reduced. In October 2005, CNX Gas, an 81.7% controlled and consolidated subsidiary of CONSOL Energy, entered into a credit agreement with a group of commercial lenders. The credit agreement provides for a revolving credit facility providing an initial aggregate outstanding principal amount of up to $200 million, including borrowings and letters of credit. CNX Gas also has the ability to request an increase in aggregate outstanding principal amount to $300 million, including borrowings and letters of credit. The agreement contains a negative pledge provision, whereas CNX Gas assets cannot be used to secure other obligations. Fees and interest rate spreads are based on the percentage of facility utilization, measured quarterly. Covenants in the facility limit CNX Gas ability to dispose of assets, make investments, purchase or redeem CNX Gas stock, pay dividends and merge with another corporation. This facility includes a leverage ratio covenant of not more than 3.00 to 1.00, measured quarterly. This ratio was 0.17 to 1.00 at December 31, 2007. The facility also includes an interest coverage ratio covenant of no less than 3.00 to 1.00, measured quarterly. This ratio was 51.19 to 1.00 at December 31, 2007. At December 31, 2007, this facility had approximately $15 million of letters of credit issued and had no outstanding borrowings, leaving approximately $185 million of unused capacity. As a result of entering into the credit agreement, CNX Gas and their subsidiaries executed a Supplemental Indenture and as of October 21, 2005, and are also guarantors of CONSOL Energys 7.875% bonds. 88 Table of Contents CONSOL Energy believes that cash generated from operations and our borrowing capacity will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements, anticipated capital expenditures (other than major acquisitions), scheduled debt payments, anticipated dividend payments and to provide required letters of credit. Nevertheless, the ability of CONSOL Energy to satisfy our working capital requirements, debt service obligations, to fund planned capital expenditures or pay dividends will depend upon future operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions in the coal and gas industries and other financial and business factors, some of which are beyond CONSOL Energys control. In order to manage the market risk exposure of volatile natural gas prices in the future, CONSOL Energy enters into various physical gas supply transactions with both gas marketers and end users for terms varying in length. CONSOL Energy has also entered into various gas swap transactions that qualify as financial cash flow hedges, which exist parallel to the underlying physical transactions. The fair value of these contracts was a net asset of $9.6 million at December 31, 2007. The ineffective portion of the changes in the fair value of these contracts was insignificant to earnings in the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005. CONSOL Energy frequently evaluates potential acquisitions. CONSOL Energy has funded acquisitions primarily with cash generated from operations and a variety of other sources, depending on the size of the transaction, including debt financing. There can be no assurance that additional capital resources, including debt financing, will be available to CONSOL Energy on terms which CONSOL Energy finds acceptable, or at all. Cash Flows (in millions) 2007 2006 Change Cash flows from operating activities $ 684 $ 665 $ 19 Cash used in investing activities $ (972 ) $ (662 ) $ (310 ) Cash provided by (used in) financing activities $ 106 $ (120 ) $ 226 Cash flows from operating activities have increased primarily due to the following items: Operating cash flows increased by approximately $125 million due to proceeds received in the 2007 period from the accounts receivable securitization program. The accounts receivable program had no activity during the 2006 period. Operating cash flows increased by approximately $21 million due to coal inventories. Coal inventories were 1.3 million tons at December 31, 2007, 1.5 million tons at December 31, 2006 and 1.7 million tons at December 31, 2005. Operating cash flows decreased due to lower net income in the year to year comparison. Operating cash flows also fluctuated due to various changes in operating assets, operating liabilities, other assets and other liabilities which occurred throughout both periods. Net cash used in investing activities changed primarily due to the following items: Capital expenditures were $743 million in 2007 compared to $691 million in 2006. Capital expenditures were higher in 2007 primarily due to the acquisition of certain coalbed methane and gas rights from Peabody Energy for $16 million plus various other acquisition costs, our enhanced gas well drilling program and various other projects being completed. Capital expenditures also include $17 million related to the August 2007 acquisition of Piping & Equipment Inc. These increases were offset, in part, by a $25 million cash payment in 2006 related to the January 2006 acquisition of Mon River Towing and J.A.R. Barge Lines, LLC, from The Guttman Group. See Note 2 in Item 8, Notes to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10 K. Increased capital expenditures were also due to additional capital expenditures in the gas segment due to the on going drilling program. These increases were offset, in part, by lower expenditures related to the coal and other segments. 89 Table of Contents Cash used in investing activities includes $297 million related to the July 2007 acquisition of AMVEST. See Note 2 in Item 8, Notes to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10 K. In the 2007 period, CONSOL Energy purchased 372,000 shares of CNX Gas, a majority owned subsidiary, on the open market at an average price of $26.87, or $10 million. Proceeds from the sale of assets were $85 million in 2007 compared to $60 million in 2006. Proceeds in 2007 were primarily related to $53 million of proceeds from the sale of certain western Kentucky coal reserves to Alliance Resource Partners, L.P. Proceeds in 2006 were primarily due to the sale and subsequent lease back of longwall mining equipment. The lease has been reported as a capital lease, and accordingly a liability for the present value of the lease payments has been recognized. Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities changed primarily due to the following items: In 2007, CONSOL Energy received proceeds of $248 million from our revolving credit facility. There was no activity under the revolving credit facility in 2006. In 2007, CONSOL Energy paid $45 million to redeem its medium term notes that were due in June 2007. There was no long term debt repayment in 2006. In 2007, $24 million of cash was retained compared to $39 million in 2006, as a result of the tax deductibility of increases in the value of equity instruments issued under share based payment arrangements. In 2007, approximately $80 million of CONSOL Energy stock was repurchased under the share repurchase program that was approved in December 2005. In 2006, approximately $116 million of CONSOL Energy stock was repurchased. $19 million of stock was issued in 2007 compared to $13 million of treasury stock and $1 million of common stock issued in 2006. Stock issuances in both periods were a result of stock option exercises. Dividends of $56 million were paid in 2007 compared to $51 million in 2006. The following is a summary of our significant contractual obligations at December 31, 2007 (in thousands): Payments due by Year Less Than1 Year 13 Years 3 5 Years More Than 5Years Total Short Term Notes Payable $ 247,500 $ $ $ $ 247,500 Gas Firm Transportation Obligation 7,870 14,379 9,948 17,095 49,292 Purchase Order Firm Commitments 4,561 4,561 Long Term Debt 8,374 46,493 330,865 21,614 407,346 Capital Lease Obligations 16,178 32,356 19,159 65,135 132,828 Operating Lease Obligations 39,792 61,536 31,400 131,017 263,745 Other Long Term Liabilities(a) 379,586 588,079 483,993 2,125,675 3,577,333 Total Contractual Obligations(b) $ 703,861 $ 742,843 $ 875,365 $ 2,360,536 $ 4,682,605 (a) Long term liabilities include other postemployment benefits, work related injuries and illnesses, defined benefit pension plans, mine reclamation and closure, and other long term liability costs. (b) The significant obligation table does not include obligations to taxing authorities due to the uncertainty surrounding the ultimate settlement of amounts and timing of these obligations. 90 Table of Contents Debt At December 31, 2007, CONSOL Energy had total long term debt of $507 million outstanding, including current portion of long term debt of $18 million. This long term debt consisted of: An aggregate principal amount of $249 million of 7.875% notes ($250 million due in 2012, net of $1 million unamortized debt discount). The notes were issued at 99.174% of the principal amount. Interest on the notes is payable March 1 and September 1 of each year. Payment of the principal and premium, if any, and interest on the notes are guaranteed by most of CONSOL Energys subsidiaries. The notes are senior secured obligations and rank equally with all other secured indebtedness of the guarantors; An aggregate principal amount of $103 million of two series of industrial revenue bonds which were issued to finance the Baltimore port facility and bear interest at 6.50% per annum and mature in 2010 and 2011; $33 million in advance royalty commitments with an average interest rate of 6.66% per annum; An aggregate principal amount of $11 million on a variable rate note that bears interest at the prime rate, or 7.25% at December 31, 2007. This note was incurred by a variable interest entity that is fully consolidated in which CONSOL Energy holds a 49% ownership interest; An aggregate principal amount of $9 million on various rate notes with a weighted average interest rate of 8.11% at December 31, 2007. These note were incurred by a variable interest entity that is fully consolidated in which CONSOL Energy holds no ownership interest; An aggregate principal amount of $101 million of capital leases with a weighted average interest rate of 7.11% per annum. An aggregate principal amount of $1 million of variable rate notes with a weighted average interest rate of 6.42% due at various dates ranging from 2008 through 2031. At December 31, 2007, CONSOL Energy had $248 million of borrowings and approximately $259 million of letters of credit outstanding under the revolving credit facility. At December 31, 2007, CNX Gas, an 81.7 % subsidiary, had no aggregate principal amounts of borrowings and approximately $15 million of letters of credit outstanding under its revolving credit facility. Stockholders Equity and Dividends CONSOL Energy had stockholders equity of $1,214 million at December 31, 2007 and $1,066 million at December 31, 2006. The increase was primarily attributable to net income for the year ended December 31, 2007, the tax benefit from stock based compensation and the issuance of treasury stock. This increase was partially offset by repurchases under the CONSOL Energy share repurchase program, payment of dividends during the year, changes to the actuarial long term liability gains and losses, and the cumulative effect of adopting FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement 109 (FIN 48). See Consolidated Statements of Stockholders Equity in the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. In December 2005, CONSOL Energy announced a share repurchase program of up to $300 million of the companys common stock during a 24 month period beginning January 1, 2006 and ending December 31, 2007. In 2007, CONSOL Energy repurchased 2,087,800 shares at an average price of $38.14. As of December 31, 2007, we have repurchased a total of 5,602,600 shares at an average price of $34.98 under this program. The program has not been renewed. In August 2007, CONSOL Energys Board of Directors amended the companys dividend policy, allowing the company to increase its dividend from $0.28 per share to $0.40 per share on an annualized basis, an increase of 43 percent. 91 Table of Contents On May 4, 2006, CONSOL Energys Board of Directors declared a two for one stock split of the common stock payable on or about May 31, 2006 to shareholders of record on May 15, 2006. The stock split was effected in the form of a stock dividend. This stock split resulted in the issuance of approximately 92.5 million additional shares of common stock and was accounted for by the transfer of approximately $925 thousand from capital in excess of par value to common stock. The stock split also resulted in additional shares available for awards under the CONSOL Energy Inc. Equity Incentive Plan. Dividend information for the current year to date is as follows: Declaration Date Amount Per Share Record Date Payment Date January 30, 2008 $0.10 February 7, 2008 February 22, 2008 October 26, 2007 $0.10 November 7, 2007 November 23, 2007 July 27, 2007 $0.07 August 9, 2007 August 27, 2007 April 27, 2007 $0.07 May 8, 2007 May 29, 2007 January 26, 2007 $0.07 February 8, 2007 February 23, 2007 The declaration and payment of dividends by CONSOL Energy is subject to the discretion of CONSOL Energys Board of Directors, and no assurance can be given that CONSOL Energy will pay dividends in the future. CONSOL Energys Board of Directors determines whether dividends will be paid quarterly. The determination to pay dividends will depend upon, among other things, general business conditions, CONSOL Energys financial results, contractual and legal restrictions regarding the payment of dividends by CONSOL Energy, planned investments by CONSOL Energy and such other factors as the Board of Directors deems relevant. Our credit facility limits our ability to pay dividends when our leverage ratio covenant is 2.50 to 1.00 or more and our availability is less than $100 million. The leverage ratio was 1.50 to 1.00 and our availability was approximately $494 million at December 31, 2007. The credit facility does not permit dividend payments in the event of default. There were no defaults in the year ended December 31, 2007. Off Balance Sheet Transactions CONSOL Energy does not maintain any off balance sheet transactions, arrangements, obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or others that are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on CONSOL Energys financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources which are not disclosed in the Notes to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In December 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141(R), Business Combinations (SFAS 141R), and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 160, Accounting and Reporting of Noncontrolling Interest in Consolidated Financial Statements, an amendment of ARB No. 51 (SFAS 160). SFAS 141R and SFAS 160 will significantly change the accounting for and reporting of business combination transactions and noncontrolling (minority) interests in consolidated financial statements. SFAS 141R retains the fundamental requirements in Statement 141 Business Combinations while providing additional definitions, such as the definition of the acquirer in a purchase and improvements in the application of how the acquisition method is applied. SFAS 160 will change the accounting and reporting for minority interests, which will be recharacterized as noncontrolling interests, and classified as a component of equity. These Statements become simultaneously effective January 1, 2009. Early adoption is not permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements. In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Including an Amendment of SFAS 115. This Statement permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. The 92 Table of Contents objective is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions. This Statement is effective as of the beginning of an entitys first fiscal year that begins after November 15, 2007. Early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of a fiscal year that begins on or before November 15, 2007, provided the entity also elects to apply the provisions of FASB Statement No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. We do not expect this guidance to have a significant impact on CONSOL Energy; however, management is currently assessing the impact of adopting SFAS No. 159. In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157), which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and requires additional disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 aims to improve the consistency and comparability of fair value measurements by creating a single definition of fair value. The Statement emphasizes that fair value is not entity specific, but instead is a market based measurement of an asset or liability. SFAS 157 upholds the requirements of previously issued pronouncements concerning fair value measurements and expands the required disclosures. This Statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007; however, earlier application is permitted provided the reporting entity has not yet issued financial statements for that fiscal year. The FASB deferred the effective date of SFAS 157 for one year for non financial assets and non financial liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis. We do not expect this guidance to have a significant impact on CONSOL Energy; however, management is currently assessing the impact of adopting SFAS No. 157. In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans (SFAS 158), which requires the recognition of the funded status of defined benefit postretirement plans and related disclosures. SFAS 158 was issued to address concerns that prior standards on employers accounting for defined benefit postretirement plans failed to communicate the funded status of those plans in a complete and understandable way and to require an employer to recognize completely in earnings or other comprehensive income the financial impact of certain events affecting the plans funded status when those events occurred. This Statement was effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2006. Additionally, SFAS 158 requires an employer to measure the funded status of each of its plans as of the date of its year end statement of financial position. This provision becomes effective for CONSOL Energy for its December 31, 2008 year end. The funded status of CONSOL Energys pension and other postretirement benefit plans are currently measured as of September 30. See Note 16, Note 17 and Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of SFAS 158. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. In addition to the risks inherent in operations, CONSOL Energy is exposed to financial, market, political and economic risks. The following discussion provides additional detail regarding CONSOL Energys exposure to the risks of changing natural gas prices, interest rates and foreign exchange rates. CONSOL Energy is exposed to market price risk in the normal course of selling natural gas production and to a lesser extent in the sale of coal. CONSOL sells coal under both short term and long term contracts with fixed price and or indexed price contracts that reflect market value. CONSOL Energy uses fixed price contracts and derivative commodity instruments that qualify as cash flow hedges under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities to minimize exposure to market price volatility in the sale of natural gas. Our risk management policy strictly prohibits the use of derivatives for speculative purposes. CONSOL Energy has established risk management policies and procedures to strengthen the internal control environment of the marketing of commodities produced from our asset base. All of the derivative instruments are held for purposes other than trading. They are used primarily to mitigate uncertainty and volatility and cover 93 Table of Contents underlying exposures. CONSOL Energys market risk strategy incorporates fundamental risk management tools to assess market price risk and establish a framework in which management can maintain a portfolio of transactions within pre defined risk parameters. CONSOL Energy believes that the use of derivative instruments along with the risk assessment procedures and internal controls does not expose CONSOL Energy to material risk. The use of derivative instruments could materially affect CONSOL Energys results of operations depending on market prices. However, we believe that use of these instruments will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or liquidity. For a summary of accounting policies related to derivative instruments, see Note 1 to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements. Sensitivity analyses of the incremental effects on pre tax earnings for the year ended December 31, 2007 of a hypothetical 10% and 25% change in natural gas prices for open derivative instruments as of December 31, 2007 are provided in the following table: Incremental Decreasein Pre tax EarningsAssuming aHypothetical PriceChange of: 10% 25% (in millions) Natural Gas $ 25.4 $ 64.1 CONSOL Energy remains at risk for possible changes in the market value of these derivative instruments; however, such risk should be mitigated by price changes in the underlying hedged item. The effect of this offset is not reflected in the sensitivity analyses. CONSOL Energy entered into derivative instruments to convert the market prices related to portions of the 2008 through 2009 anticipated sales of natural gas to fixed prices. The sensitivity analysis reflects an inverse relationship between increases in commodity prices and a benefit to earnings. When commodity prices increase, pretax income decreases. The fair value of these contracts was a net gain of $5.9 million (net of $3.7 million deferred tax). We continually evaluate the portfolio of derivative commodity instruments and adjust the strategy to anticipated market conditions and risks accordingly. CONSOL Energy is exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by counterparties. The credit worthiness of counterparties is subject to continuing review. CONSOL Energys interest expense is sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates in the United States. At December 31, 2007, CONSOL Energy had outstanding $496 million aggregate principal amount of debt under fixed rate instruments and $11 million aggregate principal amount of debt under variable rate instruments. CONSOL Energys primary exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our revolving credit facility, under which there was $248 million of borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2007. During the year ended December 31, 2007, a 100 basis point increase in the average rate for CONSOL Energys revolving credit facility would have decreased net income by approximately $0.8 million. The fair value of CONSOL Energys financial instruments is set forth in Note 24 and Note 25 of the Notes to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements. Almost all of CONSOL Energys transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars, and, as a result, we do not have material exposure to currency exchange rate risks. 94 Table of Contents
