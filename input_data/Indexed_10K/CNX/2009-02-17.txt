Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. General Although current forecasts regarding world wide demand for coal and natural gas are less robust than estimates a year ago because of the high degree of uncertainty regarding global economic growth, the company believes that the long term fundamentals of population growth, a desire for improved living standards, and the need to build or repair critical infrastructure in many countries will be the primary drivers for energy over the next several decades. In the short term, economic stimulus spending by the United States and other countries should result in improvements in demand for coal and gas as infrastructure projects are initiated and economic activity increases. In the short term, base loading of eastern U. S. power generation in the key markets will continue to create demand for CONSOLs high Btu coal. On the supply side, coal production challenges related to permitting, new safety regulations, and complex geology in Appalachia are expected to keep supplies tight. The company believes it is in a strong position in the near term for a number of reasons: The company has a significant amount of anticipated 2009 coal and gas production already committed for sale; The companys low volatile metallurgical coal and its high Btu (British thermal units) steam coal are premium products that should command premium prices even in a weaker demand environment; The company expects to generate strong cash flows during the next 15 months, reflecting both higher priced tons entering the sales mix and the relatively low cost position of both its coal and gas segments; The companys relatively low debt and strong liquidity position allows the company to maintain its reputation as a disciplined producer and to make adjustments to production should market conditions require it, in addition the company has no principal debt payments due in 2009 and the companys revolving line of credit is in place through 2012; and The company has the flexibility to defer or slow certain capital project outlays without undercutting the companys fundamental growth strategy. During the second and third quarters of 2008, a number of factors impacted coal production, but no single factor dominated. Factors included: events such as roof falls on main line belt haulage; regulatory issues, particularly related to safety that impacted productivity and costs; technological issues, particularly the challenge of completing development of new longwall coal panels as rapidly as required; and geologic issues such as roof conditions and intrusion of rock into coal seams. We have made a number of important changes that positively impacted productivity and production in the fourth quarter, resulting in a reduction in costs. We have taken various steps with respect to the development issue because it is key to maximizing efficiency from our longwall equipped mines. The company has added crews and changed work schedules to increase longwall panel development; has worked with equipment manufacturers to develop better haulage systems for continuous mining machines to increase rates of advance in development sections of the mine; and is modifying mine plans in a number of longwall equipped mines to increase the ratio of coal produced by the longwall equipment compared to that produced by the continuous miners. Some of the changes we have made, such as adding additional crews, have given us immediate benefits. Other activities, such as mine plan modifications, may take several quarters to fully execute. However, over the next year, we expect the aggregate result of these actions will positively impact productivity. Regulatory impacts on production are more difficult to manage. Most producers in the eastern U.S. are being impacted by government regulations and enforcement to a much greater extent than a few years ago. The 57 Table of Contents pace with which government issues permits needed for on going operations to continue mining has negatively impacted expected production, especially in Central Appalachia. Environmental groups in Southern West Virginia and Kentucky have challenged state and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers permits for mountaintop mining on various grounds. The most recent challenges have focused on the adequacy of the Corps of Engineers analysis of impacts to streams and the adequacy of mitigation plans to compensate for stream impacts. In 2007, the U.S. District Court of the Southern District of West Virginia found other operators permits for mining in these areas to be deficient. The ruling is currently in appeals. The legal issues around these previously issued permits have delayed or prevented the issuance of new permits by the Corps of Engineers. Currently, CONSOL Energys surface operations in these areas have been impacted to a limited extent, but the delay or denial of additional permits could impact some or all of the surface operations within the next twelve to twenty four months. In addition, over the past few years, the length of time needed to bring a new mine into production has increased by several years because of the increased time required to obtain necessary permits. New safety laws and regulations have impacted productivity at underground mines, although the company has not yet been able to ascertain the exact amount of the impact. On October 3, 2008 the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (the EESA Act) was signed into law. The EESA Act contains a section that authorizes certain coal producers and exporters who have filed a Black Lung Excise Tax (BLET) return on or after October 1, 1990, to request a refund of the BLET paid on export sales. The EESA Act requires that the U.S. Treasury refund a coal producer or exporter an amount equal to the BLET erroneously paid on export sales in prior years along with interest computed at the statutory rates applicable to overpayments. CONSOL Energy filed timely claims for refunds under the EESA Act of the BLET with the Internal Revenue Service in the amount of approximately $27 million. In addition, the estimated interest related to the BLET refunds expected to be received is approximately $32 million. In relation to this receivable, CONSOL Energy also recognized approximately $3 million of expense that will be owed to third parties upon collection of the refunds. CONSOL Energy believes that it will receive refunds of BLET erroneously paid on export sales in the amounts requested in its filing with the Internal Revenue Service plus interest as required by the Act prior to December 31, 2009. Our 83.3% subsidiary, CNX Gas completed the independent verification process for several Chicago Climate Exchange (CCX) approved projects relating to the capture of coalbed methane. Approximately 8.4 million metric tons of emissions offsets were verified and registered on the CCX in the year ended December 31, 2008. CCX is a rules based Greenhouse Gas (GhG) allowance trading system. CCX emitting members make a voluntary but legally binding commitment to meet annual GhG emission reduction targets. Those emitting members who exceed their targets have surplus allowances to sell or bank; those who fall short of their targets comply by purchasing offset which are called CCX Carbon Financial Instruments (CFI) contracts. As a CCX offset provider, CNX Gas is not bound to any emission reduction targets. An offset provider is an owner of an offset project that registers and sells offsets on its own behalf. Sales of these emission offsets will be reflected in income as they occur. CONSOL Energy also verified approximately 8.3 million metric tons of additional emission offsets. CONSOL Energy has engaged a broker through which we will evaluate emission credit opportunities on the over the counter market. Sales of these emission offsets will be reflected in income as they occur. To date, no offsets have been sold by either CONSOL Energy or CNX Gas. 58 Table of Contents Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2008 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2007 Net Income Net income changed primarily due to the following items (table in millions): 2008Period 2007Period DollarVariance PercentageChange Sales Outside $ 4,182 $ 3,324 $ 858 25.8 % Sales Purchased Gas 8 8 Sales Gas Royalty Interest 79 47 32 68.1 % Freight Outside 217 187 30 16.0 % Other Income 166 196 (30 ) (15.3 )% Total Revenue and Other Income 4,652 3,762 890 23.7 % Coal Cost of Goods Sold and Other and Purchased Charges 2,843 2,351 492 20.9 % Purchased Gas Costs 8 7 1 14.3 % Gas Royalty Interest Costs 74 40 34 85.0 % Total Cost of Goods Sold 2,925 2,398 527 22.0 % Freight Expense 217 187 30 16.0 % Selling, General and Administrative Expense 125 109 16 14.7 % Depreciation, Depletion and Amortizaton 390 325 65 20.0 % Interest Expense 36 31 5 16.1 % Black Lung Excise Tax Refund (56 ) 24 (80 ) (333.3 )% Taxes Other Than Income 290 259 31 12.0 % Total Costs 3,927 3,333 594 17.8 % Earnings Before Income Taxes and Minority Interest 725 429 296 69.0 % Income Tax Expense 240 136 104 76.5 % Earnings Before Minority Interest 485 293 192 65.5 % Minority Interest 43 25 18 72.0 % Net Income $ 442 $ 268 $ 174 64.9 % CONSOL Energy had net income of $442 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to $268 million in the year ended December 31, 2007. Net income for 2008 increased in comparison to 2007 due to: higher average prices received for both coal and gas; higher volumes of gas sold; 2007 included a total of approximately $94 million of pre tax expenses, net of insurance recoveries, related to the Buchanan Mine incident that occurred in July 2007 which idled the mine through March 2008; the 2008 period includes approximately $28.6 million of pre tax income related to this incident; Black Lung excise tax refund receivable recognized for taxes paid in 1991 1993 due to legislation passed in October 2008; and Receivable write off of $24 million in 2007 related to the Supreme Court decision which rendered the Black Lung Excise Tax receivable for 1991 1993 uncollectible. These increases in net income were offset, in part, by: an asset exchange and an asset sale in 2007 that resulted in pretax income of approximately $100 million and net income of approximately $59 million; increased unit cost of goods sold and other charges for both coal and gas. 59 Table of Contents See below for a more detailed description of variances noted. The cost per unit below is not necessarily indicative of unit costs in the future. Revenue Revenue and other income increased due to the following items: 2008 2007 DollarVariance PercentageChange Sales: Produced Coal $ 3,067 $ 2,640 $ 427 16.2 % Purchased Coal 118 38 80 210.5 % Produced Gas 681 410 271 66.1 % Industrial Supplies 196 147 49 33.3 % Other 120 89 31 34.8 % Total Sales Outside 4,182 3,324 858 25.8 % Gas Royalty Interest 79 47 32 68.1 % Purchased Gas 8 8 Freight Revenue 217 187 30 16.0 % Other Income 166 196 (30 ) (15.3 )% Total Revenue and Other Income $ 4,652 $ 3,762 $ 890 23.7 % The increase in company produced coal sales revenue during 2008 was due to higher average prices, offset, in part, by slightly lower volumes of produced coal sold. 2008 2007 Variance PercentageChange Produced Tons Sold (in millions) 64.3 64.8 (0.5 ) (0.8 )% Average Sales Price Per Ton $ 47.66 $ 40.74 $ 6.92 17.0 % The increase year to year in the average sales prices of coal was the result of global coal fundamentals being more favorable in the current year. Concerns regarding the adequacy of global supplies of coal have strengthened both the international and domestic coal prices and have increased the opportunity for U.S. producers to increase exports of coal. Sales tons were slightly lower in the year to year comparison. Purchased coal sales consist of revenues from processing third party coal in our preparation plants for blending purposes to meet customer coal specifications, coal purchased from third parties and sold directly to our customers and revenues from processing third party coal in our preparation plants. The increase of $80 million in company purchased coal sales revenue was primarily due to an increase in volumes of purchased coal sold in the year to year comparison. The increase in produced gas sales revenue in 2008 compared to 2007 was primarily due to higher average sales prices and higher volumes of gas sold. 2008 2007 Variance PercentageChange Produced Gas Sales Volumes (in billion cubic feet) 75.7 57.1 18.6 32.6 % Average Sales Price Per thousand cubic feet $ 9.00 $ 7.18 $ 1.82 25.3 % The increase in average sales price is the result of CNX Gas, an 83.3% subsidiary at December 31, 2008, realizing general market price increases in the year to year comparison. CNX Gas periodically enters into various gas swap transactions that qualify as financial cash flow hedges. These gas swap transactions exist 60 Table of Contents parallel to the underlying physical transactions. These financial hedges represented approximately 43.4 Bcf of our produced gas sales volumes for the year ended December 31, 2008 at an average price of $9.25 per Mcf. In the prior year, these financial hedges represented approximately 18.4 Bcf at an average price of $8.01 per Mcf. Sales volumes increased as a result of additional wells coming online from our on going drilling program. Also, prior year sales volumes were impacted by the deferral of production at the Buchanan Mine. The $49 million increase in revenues from the sale of industrial supplies was primarily due to the July 2007 acquisition of Piping & Equipment, Inc. in addition to an overall increase in sales volumes and higher sales prices. The $30 million increase in other sales was attributable to increased revenues from barge towing and terminal services. The increase was primarily related to revenue generated from the barge towing operations having higher average rates for services rendered compared to the prior year. The barge towing operations have also increased thru put tons and delivered tons in 2008. Increases in other sales revenues were also attributable to higher terminal services as a result of additional thru put tons in 2008. The higher terminal revenues were offset, in part, due to services being suspended for approximately one month due to maintenance needed on a pier in Baltimore. 2008 2007 Variance PercentageChange Gas Royalty Interest Sales Volumes (in billion cubic feet) 8.5 7.2 1.3 18.1 % Average Sales Price Per thousand cubic feet $ 9.32 $ 6.44 $ 2.88 44.7 % Included in gas royalty interest sales volumes are the revenues related to the portion of production belonging to royalty interest owners sold by CNX Gas on their behalf. The increase in market prices, contractual differences among leases and the mix of average and index prices used in calculating royalties contributed to the year to year change. 2008 2007 Variance PercentageChange Purchased Sales Volumes (in billion cubic feet) 1.0 1.1 (0.1 ) (9.1 )% Average Sales Price Per thousand cubic feet $ 8.76 $ 7.19 $ 1.57 21.8 % Purchased gas sales volumes represent volumes of gas that were sold at market prices that were purchased from third party producers, less gathering fees. Freight revenue is based on weight of coal shipped, negotiated freight rates and method of transportation (i.e., rail, barge, truck, etc.) used for the customers to which CONSOL Energy contractually provides transportation services. Freight revenue is the amount billed to customers for transportation costs incurred. Freight revenue has increased $30 million in 2008 due primarily to freight associated with AMVEST, which was acquired on July 31, 2007. Freight revenue has also increased due to higher freight rates being charged for exported tons. These increases in freight revenue were offset, in part, by lower export tons shipped in 2008 compared to 2007. There were 7.0 million tons and 7.6 million tons of coal exported by CONSOL Energy in 2008 and 2007, respectively. 61 Table of Contents Other income consists of interest income, gain or loss on the disposition of assets, equity in earnings of affiliates, service income, royalty income, derivative gains and losses, rental income and miscellaneous income. 2008 2007 DollarVariance PercentageChange Gain on sale of assets $ 23 $ 112 $ (89 ) (79.5 )% Interest income 2 13 (11 ) (84.6 )% Litigation settlement 1 5 (4 ) (80.0 )% Equity in earnings of affiliates 11 7 4 57.1 % Railroad spur income 4 1 3 300.0 % Proceeds from relinquishment of mining rights 6 6 100.0 % Royalty income 21 14 7 50.0 % Contract towing 11 3 8 266.7 % Business interruption proceeds 50 10 40 400.0 % Other miscellaneous 37 31 6 19.4 % Total other income $ 166 $ 196 $ (30 ) (15.3 )% Gain on sale of assets decreased $89 million in the year to year comparison primarily due to two transactions that occurred in 2007. In June 2007, CONSOL Energy, through our 83.3% owned subsidiary, CNX Gas, exchanged certain coal assets in Northern Appalachia to Peabody Energy for coalbed methane and gas rights, which resulted in a pretax gain of $50 million. Also, in June 2007, CONSOL Energy, through a subsidiary, sold the rights to certain western Kentucky coal in the Illinois Basin to Alliance Resource Partners, L.P. for $53 million. This transaction also resulted in a pretax gain of approximately $50 million. The 2008 period reflects a sale of an idled facility which included the transfer of the mine closing liabilities to the buyer. This transaction resulted in a pretax gain of approximately $8 million. There was also a $3 million increase in the year to year comparison due to various transactions that occurred throughout both periods, none of which were individually material. Interest income decreased $11 million in the year to year comparison due to lower cash balances throughout 2008 compared to 2007. Lower cash balances were primarily the result of the purchase price paid for the June 2008 acquisition of the remaining interest in Knox Energy, LLC, the July acquisition of several leases and gas wells from KIS Oil & Gas, Inc., the July 31, 2007 acquisition of AMVEST, the June 2007 purchase of certain coalbed methane and gas rights from Peabody Energy and the July 2007 Buchanan Mine incident. A litigation settlement with a coal customer in 2007 resulted in $5 million of income. A litigation settlement with a royalty holder resulted in $1 million of income in 2008. Equity in earnings of affiliates increased $4 million related to our interest in a specialty contracting company, our interest in a real estate development company and our interest in a coal mining company. These increases were offset, in part, by the June 2008 acquisition of our remaining interest in Knox Energy, LLC. Income related to a railroad spur acquired with the July 2007 acquisition of AMVEST increased $3 million. This income was due to reimbursements from the rail carrier for maintenance completed on the spur during the year. The income is offset in its entirety with the related expenses reflected in cost of goods sold and other charges. In 2008, approximately $6 million was received from a third party in order for CONSOL Energy to relinquish the mining of certain in place coal reserves. Royalty income increased $7 million in the year to year comparison due to production of CONSOL Energy coal by a third party commencing in August 2007. Royalties have also increased due to the higher sales price of coal sold throughout 2008 compared to 2007. 62 Table of Contents The $8 million increase in contract towing services represents river towing services for third parties which CONSOL Energy now provides. These services were minimal in 2007. In 2008, CONSOL Energy received $50 million as final settlement of the insurance claim related to the July 2007 Buchanan Mine incident, which idled the mine from July 2007 to mid March 2008. The $50 million represents business interruption coverage which was recognized in other income; the coal segment recognized $42 million and the gas segment recognized $8 million. CONSOL Energy had received $10 million of business interruption proceeds related to this incident in 2007; the coal segment recognized $8 million and the gas segment recognized $2 million. In 2007, $15 million was also received from the insurance carrier for reimbursement of fire brigade costs. This was recognized as a reduction of cost of goods sold and other charges as discussed below. The final settlement brought the total amount recovered from insurance carriers to $75 million, the maximum allowed per covered event. No additional amounts related to the Buchanan roof caving event will be recovered. All proceeds from this insurance claim have been received. Other miscellaneous income increased $6 million in the year to year comparison due to various miscellaneous transactions that occurred throughout both years, none of which were individually material. Costs Cost of goods sold and other charges increased due to the following: 2008 2007 DollarVariance PercentageChange Cost of Goods Sold and Other Charges Produced Coal $ 2,031 $ 1,685 $ 346 20.5 % Purchased Coal 124 52 72 138.5 % Produced Gas 189 129 60 46.5 % Industrial Supplies 186 141 45 31.9 % Closed and Idle Mines 78 105 (27 ) (25.7 )% Other 235 239 (4 ) (1.7 )% Total Sales Outside 2,843 2,351 492 20.9 % Gas Royalty Interest 74 40 34 85.0 % Purchased Gas 8 7 1 14.3 % Total Cost of Goods Sold $ 2,925 $ 2,398 $ 527 22.0 % Increased cost of goods sold and other charges for company produced coal was due mainly to a higher average unit cost per ton sold, offset slightly by lower sales volumes. 2008 2007 Variance PercentageChange Produced Tons Sold (in millions) 64.3 64.8 (0.5 ) (0.8 )% Average Cost of Goods Sold and Other Charges Per Ton $ 31.57 $ 25.99 5.58 21.5 % Average cost of goods sold and other charges increased in the year to year comparison primarily due to an increase in average unit costs related to the following items. Supply and maintenance costs have increased $2.77 per ton sold due to the following items: The increase in supply and maintenance costs reflects the change in the mix of sales tons in 2008 compared to 2007. Production tons from the Northern Appalachian underground mines decreased, while production from the Central Appalachian mines increased. This was primarily due to the July 31, 2007 acquisition of AMVEST and to the Buchanan Mine being idled for half of 2007. 63 Table of Contents The installation of higher grade seals and a higher number of seals being built in 2008 contributed to the increase in supply cost. The Mine Health and Safety Administration now requires higher strength seals to be constructed in order to isolate old, abandoned areas or previously sealed areas of the mine. At several locations, the installed seals are also required to be stronger. The increase in strength of seals was required to better protect the active sections of the underground mines from explosions, fires, or other situations that may occur within the sealed areas. The installation of higher strength seals and a higher number of seals being completed contributed to the increase in supply costs. Higher roof control costs are attributable to higher usage of products used in the mining process due to mining conditions and additional development work. Development work by continuous mining machines requires more roof support products than are used in the area of the mine where extraction is done using a longwall mining system. Roof control costs have also increased due to higher usage of pumpable cribs which are more expensive per unit than the standard wooden crib support. The pumpable crib is a canvas cylinder hung from the roof and extending to the floor into which concrete is pumped. Because the pumpable crib allows concrete to be pumped to the roof level, it eliminates the need to use wood shims to tighten the concrete to the roof. The pumpable crib is quicker to install, enhances safety due to the customized fit and minimizes the use of combustible products at underground locations. Also, roof control costs have increased due to approximately a 9% inflation rate related to roof control products. Gas well plugging/drilling costs related to the mining process have increased in 2008 compared to 2007. Gas well plugging expenses are related to plugging abandoned gas wells which CONSOL Energy does not own that are in front of the underground mining process. These wells have to be plugged in accordance with current safety regulations in order to mine through. CONSOL Energy has plugged more wells in 2008 than in 2007, which has contributed to increased supply costs. Gas well drilling ahead of mining, vents the gas from the coal seam which then allows for the longwall process to extract coal from a ventilated seam. CONSOL Energy drilled more wells ahead of mining in 2008 than in 2007 primarily due to Buchanan Mine being idled for half of 2007, as previously discussed. Higher fuel and explosive costs are due to the general increase of these commodities in the year to year comparison. The AMVEST surface locations were acquired on July 31, 2007. These surface locations are a large consumer of these products. Higher equipment maintenance costs are also attributable to the acquisition of AMVEST on July 31, 2007. These increases in supply costs were offset, in part, by expenses for self contained self rescuers which were purchased in 2007 in compliance with the Miner Act. There were fewer self contained self rescuers purchased in 2008. Labor costs have increased $1.14 per ton sold due to the effects of wage increases at the union and non union mines from labor contracts which began in 2007. These contracts call for specified hourly wage increases in each year of the contract. Labor also increased due to a higher number of employees in 2008 compared to 2007. This was somewhat due to the utilization of new work schedules requiring more manpower and operations trainees. Other post employment benefit costs have increased $0.49 per ton sold primarily due to a change in the discount rate used to calculate the net periodic benefit costs. The weighted average discount rate for 2008 was 6.63% and was 6.00% in 2007. Combined Fund costs have increased $0.33 per ton sold due to the 2007 settlement with the Fund. In March 2007, CONSOL Energy entered into a settlement agreement with the Combined Fund that resolved all previous issues relating to the calculation of the payments. The total income, including interest, as a result of this settlement was approximately $33.4 million, of which approximately $28.1 million impacted cost of goods sold and other charges for produced coal. 64 Table of Contents Health & Retirement costs have increased $0.25 per ton sold due to additional contributions required to be made into employee benefit funds in 2008 compared to 2007 as a result of the five year labor agreement with the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA) that commenced January 1, 2007. The contribution increase over 2007 was $1.27 per UMWA hour worked. In transit costs have increased $0.25 per ton sold. In transit costs are costs to move coal from the point of extraction to the preparation plant in order for the coal to be processed for sale. These costs have increased due primarily to increased trucking expenses related to higher fuel costs as well as several locations operating in the current year that did not operate in 2007. Various other costs have increased $0.35 per ton sold due to various items that have occurred throughout both periods, none of which individually increased or decreased costs per ton sold. Purchased coal cost of goods sold consists of costs from processing purchased coal in our preparation plants for blending purposes to meet customer coal specifications, coal purchased and sold directly to customers and costs for processing third party coal in our preparation plants. The increase of $72 million in purchased coal cost of goods sold and other charges in 2008 was primarily due to higher volumes purchased. Gas cost of goods sold and other charges increased due primarily to a 32.6% increase in volumes of produced gas sold and an 11.1% increase in unit costs of goods sold and other charges. 2008 2007 Variance PercentageChange Produced Gas Sales Volumes (in billion cubic feet) 75.7 57.1 18.6 32.6 % Average Cost Per thousand cubic feet $ 2.50 $ 2.25 0.25 11.1 % Average cost of goods sold and other charges per unit sold increased in the current year as a result of the following items: Fuel and power increased $0.08 per thousand cubic feet for both lifting and gathering combined. This increase was primarily due to additional compressors being placed in service along the existing gathering systems in order to flow gas more efficiently. Well closing costs were impaired $0.05 per thousand cubic feet in the year to year comparison. Well closing liabilities were adjusted in 2007 to reflect longer well lives than were previously estimated. This adjustment resulted in a reduction to expense. The adjustments to well closing liabilities were insignificant in 2008. Water disposal costs have increased $0.05 per thousand cubic feet due to additional volumes of water produced by CNX Gas wells in 2008 compared to 2007. Repairs and maintenance costs have increased $0.02 per thousand cubic feet due to higher material costs and higher contract labor costs. Compression expenses increased $0.03 per thousand cubic feet due to the additional compressors discussed above. Various other costs have also increased by $0.03 per thousand cubic feet for various items which occurred throughout both years, none of which were individually material. Industrial supplies cost of goods sold increased $45 million primarily due to the July 2007 acquisition of Piping & Equipment, Inc. The increase was also related to additional volumes of goods sold and higher costs of good sold throughout 2008. Closed and idle mine cost of goods sold decreased approximately $27 million in 2008 compared to 2007. The decrease was primarily due to $16 million of lower cost of goods sold and other charges at Shoemaker Mine. 65 Table of Contents Shoemaker resumed longwall production in May 2008, but was idled throughout all of 2007. The decrease was also related to updated engineering surveys related to mine closing, perpetual care water treatment and reclamation liabilities for closed and idled locations resulting in $23 million of expense in 2008 compared to $33 million of expense in 2007. The higher 2007 survey adjustments related primarily to perpetual water treatment changes in estimates of water flows and increased hydrated lime costs. Closed and idle mine cost of goods sold and other charges also increased $1 million due to various other charges which occurred throughout both periods, none of which were individually significant. Other cost of goods sold decreased due to the following items: 2008 2007 DollarVariance PercentageChange Buchanan roof collapse $ 17 $ 95 $ (78 ) (82.1 )% Contract settlement 6 (6 ) (100.0 )% Incentive compensation 33 35 (2 ) (5.7 )% Ward superfund site 7 5 2 40.0 % Accounts receivable securitization 6 3 3 100.0 % Railroad spur expenses 4 1 3 300.0 % Asset impairment 6 6 100.0 % Stock based compensation 34 24 10 41.7 % Profit splits 15 15 100.0 % Sales contract buy outs 19 19 100.0 % Terminal/River operations 81 58 23 39.7 % Miscellaneous 13 12 1 8.3 % Total of the Cost of Goods Sold and Other Charges $ 235 $ 239 $ (4 ) (1.7 )% In July 2007, production at the Buchanan Mine was suspended after several roof falls in previously mined areas damaged some of the ventilation controls inside the mine, requiring a general evacuation of the mine. In 2008, we have incurred approximately $17 million of cost of goods sold and other charges related to the Buchanan Mine event compared to $95 million in the prior year. The 2007 expense figure is net of $15 million related to insurance proceeds received as reimbursement for costs incurred under the policy. The mine resumed longwall production on March 17, 2008. In 2007, CONSOL Energy agreed to a $6 million settlement for a contract violation with a customer. The incentive compensation program is designed to increase compensation to eligible employees when CONSOL Energy reaches predetermined earnings targets and the employees reach predetermined performance targets. Incentive compensation expense decreased $2 million due to the level of earnings in comparison to the predetermined performance target in the year to year comparison. The year ended December 31, 2008 includes expense of $7 million related to the Ward Transformer superfund site. In 2008, revised estimates of total costs related to this site were received. The revised estimates indicate an increase in costs to remediate the site. The year ended December 31, 2007 includes $5 million of expense related to this site. See Note 25 Commitments and Contingencies of Item 8, of the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details. Accounts receivable securitization fees increased $3 million in the year to year comparison. Higher amounts have been drawn under this program throughout 2008 compared to 2007. Expenses increased $3 million in 2008 related to a railroad spur acquired with the July 2007 AMVEST. The increase was related to maintenance completed on the spur during the year. These expenses are offset with the related income reflected in other income. 66 Table of Contents Asset impairment expenses of $6 million were recognized in 2008 primarily related to loans made to, and options to purchase shares of common stock, with a start up company whose efforts are to commercialize technology to burn waste coal with near zero emissions to generate power. Due mainly to the downturn in the economy, it is not probable that the company can repay these loans, or that the company will complete a public offering. Therefore, the asset values have been written down. Stock based compensation expense increased $10 million primarily as a result of additional awards granted to CONSOL Energy and CNX Gas employees in 2008. In additional, stock based compensation expense increased due to changes in expected value of the cash payout related to the performance share units of CNX Gas. Cost of goods sold and other charges includes $15 million in 2008 related to contracts with certain customers which were unable to take delivery of previously contracted coal tonnage. These customers have agreed to allow CONSOL Energy to sell the released tonnage, but require CONSOL Energy to split the incremental sales price over the original contract sales price evenly with them. The $15 million represents the additional sales price received for the tonnage sold that is owed to the original customer. In 2008, CONSOL Energy agreed to buy out sales contracts with several customers in order to release tons committed under lower priced contracts for sale to other customers at higher prices which resulted in $19 million of expense. No such agreements were made in 2007. Terminal/River operation charges have increased $23 million in the year to year comparison due to increased fuel charges resulting from higher fuel prices and increased operating hours. Costs also have increased due to the acquisition of Tri River Fleeting on October 3, 2007, as well as higher thru put volumes in 2008. Miscellaneous cost of goods sold and other charges increased $1 million due to various transactions throughout both periods, none of which were individually material. 2008 2007 Variance PercentageChange Gas Royalty Interest Sales Volumes (in billion cubic feet) 8.5 7.2 1.3 18.1 % Average Cost Per thousand cubic feet $ 8.69 $ 5.52 $ 3.17 57.4 % Included in gas royalty interest costs are the expenses related to the portion of production belonging to royalty interest owners sold by CNX Gas on their behalf. The increase in volumes and price relates to the volatility and contractual differences among leases, as well as the mix of average and index prices used in calculating royalties. 2008 2007 Variance Change Purchased Sales Volumes (in billion cubic feet) 1.0 1.1 (0.1 ) (9.1 )% Average Cost Per thousand cubic feet $ 8.13 $ 6.66 $ 1.47 22.1 % Purchased gas costs represent volumes of gas purchased from third party producers, less our gathering and marketing fees, that we sell at market prices. Purchased gas volumes also include the impact of pipeline imbalances. The increase in cost of goods sold and other charges related to purchased gas represents overall price increases and contractual differences among customers in the year to year comparison. Freight expense is based on weight of coal shipped, negotiated freight rates and method of transportation (i.e., rail, barge, truck, etc.) used for the customers to which CONSOL Energy contractually provides transportation services. Freight expense is the amount billed to customers for transportation costs incurred. Freight expense has increased in 2008 due primarily to freight associated with AMVEST, which was acquired on July 31, 2007. Freight expense has also increased due to higher freight rates being charged for exported tons. 67 Table of Contents These increases in freight expense were offset, in part, by lower export tons shipped in 2008 compared to 2007. There were 7.0 million tons and 7.6 million tons of coal exported by CONSOL Energy in 2008 and 2007, respectively. 2008 2007 DollarVariance PercentageChange Freight expense $ 217 $ 187 $ 30 16.0 % Selling, general and administrative costs have increased due to the following items: 2008 2007 DollarVariance PercentageChange Wages, salaries and related benefits $ 61 $ 52 $ 9 17.3 % Association/charitable contributions 12 6 6 100.0 % Advertising and promotion 6 4 2 50.0 % Professional, consulting and other purchased services 27 29 (2 ) (6.9 )% Other 19 18 1 5.6 % Total Selling, General and Administrative $ 125 $ 109 $ 16 14.7 % Wages, salaries and related benefits increased $9 million in the year to year comparison due to additional staffing at our CNX Gas subsidiary, additional administrative staffing acquired in the July 2007 Piping & Equipment acquisition and various other increases in support staff throughout CONSOL Energy. Association assessments have increased $6 million in the year to year comparison due primarily to CONSOL Energys participation in an industry organization which has launched a program related to the promotion of coal as an energy solution. CONSOL Energy did not participate in this organization in 2007. Also, CONSOL Energy participates in various associations and contributes to various charities in an effort to support the professions and the communities in which we do business. The level of funding made to these organizations varies from year to year. Advertising and promotion expenses increased $2 million in 2008 due to various additional advertising and promotion agreements entered into throughout the current year. Costs of professional, consulting and other purchased services decreased $2 million due to various administrative projects throughout both years, none of which are individually material. Other selling, general and administrative costs increased $1 million due to various transactions that have occurred throughout both years, none of which are individually material. Depreciation, depletion and amortization increased due to the following items: 2008 2007 DollarVariance PercentageChange Coal $ 299 $ 258 $ 41 15.9 % Gas: Production 50 31 19 61.3 % Gathering 20 18 2 11.1 % Total Gas 70 49 21 42.9 % Other 21 18 3 16.7 % Total Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization $ 390 $ 325 $ 65 20.0 % 68 Table of Contents The increase in coal depreciation, depletion and amortization was primarily attributable to additional expense related to the assets purchased in the July 2007 acquisition of AMVEST. The increase was also attributable to assets placed in service after December 31, 2007. The increase in gas production related depreciation, depletion and amortization was primarily due to higher volumes combined with an increase in the units of production rates in the year to year comparison. These rates increased due to the higher proportion of capital assets placed in service versus the proportion of proved developed reserve additions. These rates are generally calculated using the net book value of assets at the end of the previous year divided by either proved or proved developed reserves. Gathering depreciation, depletion and amortization is recorded using the straight line method and increased due to additional assets placed in service after December 31, 2007. Other depreciation increased $3 million due to various items placed in service after December 31, 2007, none of which were individually material. Interest expense increased in 2008 compared to 2007 due to the following items: 2008 2007 DollarVariance PercentageChange Revolver $ 11 $ 5 $ 6 120.0 % Interest on unrecognized tax benefits 2 3 (1 ) (33.3 )% Capitalized lease 6 7 (1 ) (14.3 )% Long term secured notes 27 28 (1 ) (3.6 )% Other (10 ) (12 ) 2 (16.7 )% Total Interest Expense $ 36 $ 31 $ 5 16.1 % Revolver interest expense increased $6 million due to the amounts drawn by CONSOL Energy and CNX Gas on the credit facility throughout 2008. There were no amounts drawn until August 2007 on this facility by CONSOL Energy. CNX Gas had no amounts drawn throughout all of 2007. These increases were offset, in part, by lower interest rates in the year to year comparison. Interest on uncertain tax benefits decreased $1 million due primarily to the settlement of various uncertain tax positions due to receipt of the audit report related to the years 2004 2005. Interest on capital leases decreased $1 million due to the planned payments made on these leases after December 31, 2007. Interest on long term secured notes decreased $1 million due to the planned June 2007 principal payment on our $45 million secured note. Other interest increased $2 million due primarily to lower amounts of interest capitalized in 2008 compared to 2007. Capitalized interest was lower in 2008 because capital expenditures which qualify for interest capitalization were lower. These lower expenditures were primarily related to the Robinson Run overland belt which was placed in service in September 30, 2007. On October 3, 2008 the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (the EESA Act) was signed into law. The EESA Act contains a section that authorizes certain coal producers and exporters who have filed a Black Lung Excise Tax (BLET) return on or after October 1, 1990, to request a refund of the BLET paid on export sales. The EESA Act requires that the U.S. Treasury refund a coal producer or exporter an amount equal to the BLET erroneously paid on export sales in prior years along with interest computed at the statutory rates 69 Table of Contents applicable to overpayments. CONSOL Energy filed timely claims for refunds under the EESA Act of the BLET with the Internal Revenue Service in the amount of approximately $27 million. In addition, the estimated interest related to the BLET refunds expected to be received is approximately $32 million. In relation to this receivable, CONSOL Energy also recognized approximately $3 million of expense will be owed to third parties upon collection of the refunds. CONSOL Energy believes that it will receive refunds of BLET erroneously paid on export sales in the amounts requested in its filing with the Internal Revenue Service plus interest as required by the Act prior to December 31, 2009. The year ended December 31, 2007 included a $24 million charge related to the reversal of the receivable that had been recognized in previous quarters related to the BLET refund. The Federal Circuit court had ruled that the damage claim for BLET paid for the period 1991 1993 be repaid. The Government appealed a similar case to the U.S. Supreme Court. On December 3, 2007 the United States Supreme Court granted the Governments appeal to hear the case. The Supreme Courts appeal of the petition made collection of the refund no longer highly probable because of the adverse ruling by the Supreme Court during 2007 under the statute on which our claim for this period was based. Accordingly, CONSOL Energy reversed the BLET receivable it had previously recognized. Taxes other than income increased primarily due to the following items: 2008 2007 DollarVariance PercentageChange Production taxes: Coal $ 168 $ 150 $ 18 12.0 % Gas 20 13 7 53.8 % Total Production Taxes 188 163 25 15.3 % Other taxes: Coal 84 79 5 6.3 % Gas 7 5 2 40.0 % Other 11 12 (1 ) (8.3 )% Total Other Taxes 102 96 6 6.3 % Total Taxes Other Than Income $ 290 $ 259 $ 31 12.0 % Coal production taxes increased $18 million due to higher severance taxes and reclamation fee taxes attributable to the increase in average sales price for produced coal. Coal production taxes also increased due to higher tons produced in 2008 than 2007. Gas production taxes increased $7 million due to higher severance taxes attributable to higher average sales prices for gas and higher gas sales volumes. The $5 million increase in other coal taxes is primarily due to higher payroll related taxes and higher property taxes. Higher payroll related taxes were the result of additional employees in 2008 and higher wages paid as discussed in the cost of goods sold and other cost section. Higher property taxes were related to additional properties acquired in the July 31, 2007 AMVEST acquisition, as previously disclosed. Other gas taxes have increased $2 million primarily related to payroll taxes and capital stock & franchise taxes due to the on going growth of the company. Other taxes decreased $1 million due to various transactions that occurred throughout both years, none of which were individually material. 70 Table of Contents Income Taxes 2008 2007 Variance Change Earnings Before Income Taxes $ 725 $ 429 $ 296 $ 69.0 % Tax Expense $ 240 $ 136 $ 104 $ 76.5 % Effective Income Tax Rate 33.1 % 31.7 % 1.4 % CONSOL Energys effective tax rate is sensitive to changes in the relationship between pre tax earnings and percentage depletion. The proportion of coal pre tax earnings and gas pre tax earnings also impacts the benefit of percentage depletion on the effective tax rate. See Note 6 Income Taxes in Item 8, Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10 K. Minority Interest Minority interest represents 18.3% of CNX Gas net income which CONSOL Energy did not own through September 30, 2008, 18.0% for October 2008, 16.9% for November 2008 and 16.7% for December 2008. The minority interest in CNX Gas has been changing due to the share repurchase program that was approved by the CEI Board of Directors on October 21, 2008. Year Ended December 31, 2007 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2006 Net Income Net income changed primarily due to the following items (table in millions): 2007 2006 DollarVariance PercentageChange Coal Sales Produced and Purchased $ 2,678 $ 2,694 $ (16 ) (0.6 )% Produced Gas Sales 410 389 21 5.4 % Purchased Gas Sales 8 44 (36 ) (81.8 )% Other Sales and Other Income 666 588 78 13.3 % Total Revenue and Other Income 3,762 3,715 47 1.3 % Coal Cost of Goods Sold Produced and Purchased 1,737 1,785 (48 ) (2.7 )% Produced Gas Cost of Goods Sold 129 107 22 20.6 % Purchased Gas Cost of Goods Sold 7 45 (38 ) (84.4 )% Other Cost of Goods Sold 526 399 127 31.8 % Total Cost of Goods Sold 2,399 2,336 63 2.7 % Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization 325 296 29 9.8 % Other 585 532 53 10.0 % Export Excise Tax Adjustment 24 24 100.0 % Total Costs 3,333 3,164 169 5.3 % Earnings Before Income Taxes and Minority Interest 429 551 (122 ) (22.1 )% Income Tax Expense 136 112 24 21.4 % Earnings Before Minority Interest 293 439 (146 ) (33.3 )% Minority Interest 25 30 (5 ) (16.7 )% Net Income $ 268 $ 409 $ (141 ) (34.5 )% CONSOL Energy had net income of $268 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to $409 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. Net income for 2007 decreased in comparison to 2006 primarily due to several roof falls which suspended production at the Buchanan Mine in early July 2007. Production was 71 Table of Contents suspended after several roof falls in previously mined areas damaged some of the ventilation controls inside the mine, requiring a general evacuation of the mine. We drilled bore holes and injected nitrogen in order to stabilize and evaluate the mine atmosphere. In the year ended December 31, 2007, we incurred expenses of $119 million, primarily classified as cost of goods sold and depreciation, depletion and amortization, in relation to these activities. These costs were offset, in part, by a $15 million advance under CONSOL Energy insurance policies. We have also received notice from our insurance carriers that an advance of $10 million would be paid related to business interruption coverage; $8 million related to the coal segment and $2 million related to the gas segment. Net income was also adversely affected by reduced sales of coal from the Buchanan Mine. Customers who purchase coal from the mine were notified that a force majeure condition exists and deliveries under their sales agreements for coal from the mine were reduced during the year ended December 31, 2007. CNX Gas production was also adversely impacted by the idling of the Buchanan Mine. Also, 2006 included proceeds from the insurance company of $79 million; the coal segment recognized $69 million and the gas segment recognized $10 million, related to the 2005 fire and skip hoist incidents at the Buchanan Mine. Net income was also impacted by $24 million of expense related to the previously recognized Export Excise Tax receivable being reversed in 2007. The Federal Circuit court had ruled that the damage claim for export excise taxes paid for the period 1991 1993 be repaid. The Government appealed a similar case to the U.S. Supreme Court. On December 3, 2007 the United States Supreme Court granted the Governments new petition to hear that case. The Supreme Courts granting of the appeal makes collection of the refund and interest by CONSOL Energy no longer highly probable because of adverse rulings by the Supreme Court during 2007 under the statute of which our claim for this period is based. Accordingly, CONSOL Energy reversed the export excise tax receivable until the Supreme Court decides the appeal. Net income in 2007 was also impacted by a lower volume of produced coal sales, and higher cost per ton sold. Net income was also lower due to higher depreciation, depletion and amortization related to the additional assets received in the July 31, 2007 acquisition of AMVEST. Income tax expense also adversely impacted the period to period comparison. In 2006, income tax expense was reduced by the release of certain valuation allowances related to state income taxes in Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Reductions to net income were offset, in part, by two transactions which occurred in 2007; an asset exchange and an asset sale that resulted in pretax income of approximately $100 million and net income of approximately $59 million. Net income reductions were also offset, in part, by the March 2007 settlement agreement with the Combined Fund that resolved all previous issues relating to the calculation of payments to the Combined Fund. Total pre tax income, including interest, recognized related to the Combined Fund settlement was approximately $33 million. Reductions to net income were also offset, in part, by lower salary pension costs. Our defined benefit pension plan for salaried employees allows such employees to receive a lump sum distribution in lieu of annual payments when they retire from CONSOL Energy and its subsidiaries. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 88, Employers Accounting for Settlement & Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits, requires that when the lump sum distributions made for a plan year, which for CONSOL Energy was October 1 to September 30, exceed the total of the service cost and interest cost for the plan year, an adjustment equaling the unrecognized actuarial gain or loss resulting from each individual who received a lump sum in that year be recognized. The total 2007 accelerated actuarial amortization was approximately $3 million of expense. The total 2006 accelerated actuarial amortization was approximately $18 million of expense. 72 Table of Contents Revenue Revenue and other income increased due to the following items: 2007 2006 DollarVariance PercentageChange Sales Produced Coal $ 2,640 $ 2,620 $ 20 0.8 % Purchased Coal 38 74 (36 ) (48.6 )% Produced Gas 410 389 21 5.4 % Industrial Supplies 147 120 27 22.5 % Other 89 84 5 6.0 % Total Sales Outside 3,324 3,287 37 1.1 % Gas Royalty Interest 47 51 (4 ) (7.8 )% Purchased Gas 8 44 (36 ) (81.8 )% Freight Revenue 187 163 24 14.7 % Other Income 196 170 26 15.3 % Total Revenue and Other Income $ 3,762 $ 3,715 $ 47 1.3 % The increase in company produced coal sales revenue during 2007 was due to an increase in the average sales price per ton, partially offset by a decrease in sales volumes. 2007 2006 Variance PercentageChange Produced Tons Sold (in millions) 64.8 67.6 (2.8 ) (4.1 )% Average Sales Price Per Ton $ 40.74 $ 38.77 $ 1.97 5.1 % Sales of company produced coal decreased in the period to period comparison due to the idling of the Buchanan Mine as previously discussed, lower production at the McElroy Mine due to poor geological conditions and the idling of certain Central Appalachian mines due to market conditions. Lower sales tons were offset, in part, by coal sales from the AMVEST mines that were acquired on July 31, 2007. Company coal production, excluding equity affiliates, was 64.5 million tons in 2007 compared to 67.4 million tons in 2006. The increase in average sales price primarily reflects stronger term prices negotiated in 2006 and early 2007 resulting from an overall improvement in prices in the eastern coal market for domestic and foreign power generators and steel producers. There was also a surge in spot market prices in 2007. Purchased coal sales consist of revenues from processing third party coal in our preparation plants for blending purposes to meet customer coal specifications, coal purchased from a third party and sold directly to our customers and revenues from processing third party coal in our preparation plants. The decrease of $36 million in company purchased coal sales revenue was primarily due to lower sales volumes. The increase in produced gas sales revenue in 2007 compared to 2006 was primarily due to higher average sales price per thousand cubic feet sold and higher sales volumes. 2007 2006 Variance PercentageChange Produced Gas Sales Volumes (in billion cubic feet) 57.1 55.3 1.8 3.3 % Average Sales Price Per Thousand Cubic Feet $ 7.18 $ 7.04 $ 0.14 2.0 % The increase in average sales price is the result of realizing general price increases on higher hedging gains in the current year. We periodically enter into various gas swap transactions that qualify as financial cash flow hedges. These gas swap transactions exist parallel to the underlying physical transactions. These financial hedges 73 Table of Contents represented approximately 18.4 billion cubic feet of our produced gas sales volume for the year ended December 31, 2007 at an average price of $8.01 per thousand cubic feet. In the prior year, these hedges represented approximately 17.0 billion cubic feet at an average price of $7.42 per thousand cubic feet. Sales volumes increased as a result of additional wells coming online from our on going drilling program, offset, in part, by decreased active and sealed gob production as a result of the idled Buchanan Mine. Also included within 2007 are the non operating net revenue interest volumes and revenues associated with royalty and working interests. These volumes were not available in 2006. The associated revenues were included in other income in the prior period. The $27 million increase in revenues from the sale of industrial supplies was primarily due to increased sales volumes. Sales volumes have increased primarily due to the July acquisition of Piping & Equipment, Inc. See Note 2 in Item 8, Notes to the Audited Financial Statements in this Form 10 K. The $5 million increase in other sales was due to various transactions that occurred throughout both years, none of which were individually material. 2007 2006 Variance PercentageChange Gas Royalty Interest Sales Volumes (in billion cubic feet) 7.2 7.6 (0.4 ) (5.3 )% Average Sales Price Per Thousand Cubic Feet $ 6.44 $ 6.76 $ (0.32 ) (4.7 )% Included in royalty interest gas sales are the revenues related to the portion of production belonging to royalty interest owners sold by CNX Gas on their behalf. The decreased average sales price relates primarily to reductions in a provision for royalty settlements. The volatility in the monthly volumes, contractual differences among leases, as well as the mix of average and index prices used in calculating royalties also contributed to the variance. 2007 2006 Variance PercentageChange Purchased Gas Sales Volumes (in billion cubic feet) 1.1 6.1 (5.0 ) (82.0 )% Average Sales Price Per Thousand Cubic Feet $ 7.19 $ 7.20 $ (0.01 ) (0.1 )% Purchased gas sales volumes in the current year represent volumes of gas we sell at market prices that were purchased from third party producers, less our gathering and marketing fees. In 2006, purchased gas sales and volumes represented volumes of gas we simultaneously purchased from and sold to the same counterparties under contracts that were committed prior to January 1, 2006. Accordingly, Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 04 13 (EITF 04 13), which we adopted on January 1, 2006, did not apply to these transactions. All contracts entered into prior to January 1, 2006 expired in 2006, while all activity related to 2007 is reflected in transportation expense on a net basis. Freight revenue is based on weight of coal shipped, negotiated freight rates and method of transportation (i.e., rail, barge, truck, etc.) used for the customers to which CONSOL Energy contractually provides transportation services. Freight revenue is the amount billed to customers for transportation costs incurred. 74 Table of Contents Other income consists of interest income, gain or loss on the disposition of assets, equity in earnings of affiliates, service income, royalty income, derivative gains and losses, rental income and miscellaneous income. 2007 2006 DollarVariance PercentageChange Gain on Sales of Assets $ 112 $ 10 $ 102 1,020.0 % Equity in Earnings of Affiliates 7 1 6 600.0 % Litigation Settlement 5 5 100.0 % Business Interruption Insurance 10 79 (69 ) (87.3 )% Royalty Income 14 28 (14 ) (50.0 )% Interest Income 13 15 (2 ) (13.3 )% Other miscellaneous 35 37 (2 ) (5.4 )% Total Other Income $ 196 $ 170 $ 26 15.3 % Gain on sales of assets increased $102 million primarily due to two transactions that occurred in 2007. In June 2007, CONSOL Energy, through a subsidiary, exchanged certain coal assets in Northern Appalachia to Peabody Energy in exchange for coalbed methane and gas rights. This transaction was accounted for as a non monetary exchange under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 153 resulting in a pre tax gain of $50 million. Also, in June 2007, CONSOL Energy, through a subsidiary, sold the rights to certain western Kentucky coal in the Illinois Basin to Alliance Resource Partners, L.P. for $53 million. This transaction resulted in a pre tax gain of approximately $50 million. Gain on sales of assets also increased $2 million in the period to period comparison due to various miscellaneous transactions that occurred throughout both years, none of which were individually material. Equity in Earnings of Affiliates increased $6 million in the year to year comparison due to various activities of our joint ventures, none of which were individually material. A litigation settlement with a coal customer resulted in an additional $5 million of income in 2007. In 2007, CONSOL Energy received notice from its insurance carriers that $25 million would be advanced toward the insurance claim related to several roof falls which suspended production at the Buchanan Mine in early July. The $25 million represents $10 million of business interruption reimbursement which was recognized in other income; the coal segment recognized $8 million and the gas segment recognized $2 million. The remaining $15 million of the reimbursement relates to cost recovery for activities at the Mine since production was suspended. These activities included the cost of drilling bore holes to monitor the mine atmosphere, the cost of injecting nitrogen in order to stabilize the mine atmosphere as well as various other costs incurred related to these activities. In February 2005, Buchanan Mine experienced a fire that developed in the mine after a large rock fall behind the longwall mining section. The mine was temporarily sealed in order to extinguish the fire. Coal production resumed on June 16, 2005. During 2006, CONSOL Energy received proceeds from the insurance companies of $38 million. The $38 million was recognized as other income; the coal segment recognized $29 million and the gas segment recognized $9 million. Buchanan Mine also experienced a problem with the mines skip hoist mechanism on September 16, 2005 which caused the mine to be idled. Repairs to the skip hoist shaft and structures were completed and the mine resumed production on December 13, 2005. During 2006, CONSOL Energy recognized proceeds from the insurance companies of $41 million. The $41 million was recognized as other income; the coal segment recognized $40 million and the gas segment recognized $1 million. Royalty income decreased $14 million primarily due to royalties received from third party gas sales now being classified in outside gas sales versus royalty income. In the prior period, the volumes were not available nor were they considered in the prior period reserve report. 75 Table of Contents Interest income decreased $2 million in the year to year comparison due to lower cash balances throughout 2007 compared to 2006. Lower cash balances were primarily the result of the purchase price paid for the July 31, 2007 acquisition of AMVEST and the June 2007 purchase of certain coalbed methane and gas reserves from Peabody Energy. Other miscellaneous income decreased $2 million due to various transactions that occurred throughout both years, none of which were individually material.

Average cost of goods sold and other charges per ton increased in the year to year comparison primarily due to higher health and retirement costs, higher labor costs, higher supply costs and the lower volume impact on fixed unit costs. Higher health and retirement costs were attributable to additional contributions required to be made into employee benefit funds as a result of the five year labor agreement with the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA) that commenced January 1, 2007. The contribution increase over 2006 was $3.50 per UMWA hour worked. Higher labor costs were due to the effects of wage increases at the union and non union mines due to new labor contracts. Higher labor unit costs were also due to additional costs incurred to comply with health and safety standards. Supply costs increased due to additional costs incurred to comply with new federal and state safety regulations. These regulations require additional supplies of self contained self rescuer devices and other safety items as previously discussed. Supply cost increases were also the result of higher costs for products and chemicals, such as roof control products and magnetite, used in the mining and coal preparation process. These increases were offset, in part, by income recorded as a result of the Combined Fund settlement. In March 2007, CONSOL Energy entered into a settlement agreement with the Combined Fund that resolved all previous issues relating to the calculation of the payments. The total income, including interest, as a result of this settlement was approximately $33.4 million, of which approximately $28.1 million impacted cost of goods sold and other charges for produced coal. Decreased costs also reflect the prior year adjustment which accelerated previously unrecognized actuarial losses related to our salary pension plan. Our defined benefit pension plan for salaried employees allows such employees to receive a lump sum 76 Table of Contents distribution in lieu of annual payments when they retire from CONSOL Energy and its subsidiaries. Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 88, Employers Accounting for Settlements & Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits, requires that when the lump sum distributions made for a plan year, which for CONSOL Energy is October 1 to September 30, exceeds the total of the service costs and interest costs for the plan year, an adjustment equaling the unrecognized actuarial gain or loss resulting from each individual who received a lump sum in that year be recognized. The total 2007 accelerated actuarial amortization was $2.7 million of expenses, of which $2.1 million impacted cost of goods sold and other charges for produced coal. The total prior year accelerated actuarial amortization was $17.8 million, of which $13.8 million impacted cost of goods sold and other charges for produced coal. Increased costs were also offset, in part, by lower contract mining fees due to the idling of certain Central Appalachia contract mine locations. Royalty expenses were also lower in 2007 compared to 2006 due to a larger proportion of coal production coming from owned reserves versus leased reserves. Purchased coal cost of goods sold consists of costs from processing purchased coal in our preparation plants for blending purposes to meet customer coal specifications, coal purchased and sold directly to the customer and costs for processing third party coal in our preparation plants. The decrease of $28 million in purchased coal cost of goods sold and other charges in 2007 was primarily due to lower volumes purchased. Produced gas cost of goods sold and other charges increased due primarily to a 16.6% increase in unit cost of goods sold and other charges and a 3.3% increase in volumes of produced gas sold. 2007 2006 Variance PercentageChange Produced Gas Sales Volumes (in billion cubic feet) 57.1 55.3 1.8 3.3 % Average Cost Per Thousand Cubic Feet $ 2.25 $ 1.93 $ 0.32 16.6 % The increase in average cost per thousand cubic feet of gas sold was primarily attributable to increased salary labor and related employee costs, increased gas well maintenance costs, increased compressor rental costs, increased power costs and the deferral of gob gas production related to the idling of Buchanan Mine. Salary labor and related employee costs increased due to the hiring of additional employees in 2007. Gas well maintenance costs increased due to the increased number of wells in service compared to the prior year. Compressor rental costs increased due to more rentals in the current year. Power costs per unit were higher due to increased megawatt hour rates charged by the power companies in 2007, offset, in part, by credits received from the power company in 2007. These increases in unit costs were offset, in part, by lower firm transportation costs per unit and lower gas well closing costs. The firm transportation improvement was due to the in service of the Jewell Ridge Pipeline in October 2006. Also, gas well closing costs decreased due to a change in the lives for the wells to coincide with the reserve reports. Industrial supplies cost of goods sold increased $22 million primarily due to the July acquisition of Piping & Equipment, Inc. See Note 2 in Item 8, Notes to Audited Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10 K. Closed and idle mine cost of goods sold and other charges decreased approximately $4 million in 2007 compared to 2006. Closed and idle mine cost of goods sold and other charges were improved $6 million due to additional expenses in the 2006 period related to reclamation liability adjustments and associated accretion expenses that were the result of updated engineering surveys. Closed and idle mine cost of goods sold and other charges also decreased $3 million due to various transactions that occurred throughout both years, none of which were individually material. This improvement was offset, in part, by $5 million of additional expenses due to Shoemaker being idled throughout all of 2007 and only a portion of 2006. 77 Table of Contents Other cost of goods sold and other charges increased due to the following items: 2007 2006 DollarVariance PercentageChange Buchanan roof collapse $ 95 $ $ 95 100.0 % Incentive compensation 35 24 11 45.8 % Contract settlement 6 6 100.0 % Accounts Receivable Securitization 3 3 100.0 % Stock based compensation 24 23 1 4.3 % Miscellaneous transactions 77 82 (5 ) (6.1 )% Total Miscellaneous Cost of Goods Sold and Other Charges $ 240 $ 129 $ 111 86.0 % In July 2007, production at the Buchanan Mine was suspended after several roof falls in previously mined areas damaged some of the ventilation controls inside the mine, requiring a general evacuation of the mine. We drilled bore holes and injected nitrogen in order to stabilize and evaluate the mine atmosphere. In 2007, we have incurred cost of goods sold expenses of approximately $110 million in relation to these activities. Also, $15 million advance was paid to recover a portion of the cost incurred to date for this incident. Insurance coverage, after certain deductibles have been reached including a 90 day waiting period, includes property damage and cost recoveries as well as business interruption recoveries. Incentive compensation expense increased $11 million due to higher projected amounts expected to be paid to employees for 2007 compared to the projected amounts expected for 2006. The increase also relates to an actualization of the 2006 accrual which resulted in approximately $2 million of additional expense in 2007. The incentive compensation program is designed to increase compensation to eligible employees when CONSOL Energy reaches predetermined earnings targets and the employees reach predetermined performance targets. During 2007, CONSOL Energy agreed to a settlement for a contract violation with a customer. The amount owed to the customer has been accrued as of December 31, 2007. Accounts receivable securitization fees increased in the year to year comparison. Amounts have been drawn under this program since July 2007. No amounts were drawn under this program in 2006. Stock based compensation expense increased $1 million primarily as a result of additional awards granted in the 2007 period. Miscellaneous cost of goods sold and other charges decreased $5 million due to various transactions that occurred throughout both periods, none of which were individually material. 2007 2006 Variance PercentageChange Gas Royalty Interest Sales Volumes (in billion cubic feet) 7.2 7.6 (0.4 ) (5.3 )% Average Cost Per Thousand Cubic Feet $ 5.52 $ 5.54 $ (0.02 ) (0.4 )% Included in royalty interest gas costs are the expenses related to the portion of production belonging to royalty interest owners sold by CNX Gas on their behalf. The decrease in volumes and costs relate to the volatility and contractual differences among leases, as well as the mix of average and index prices used in calculating royalties. 2007 2006 Variance PercentageChange Purchased Gas Sales Volumes (in billion gross cubic feet) 1.1 6.1 (5.0 ) (82.0 )% Average Cost Per Thousand Cubic Feet $ 6.66 $ 7.34 $ (0.68 ) (9.3 )% 78 Table of Contents Purchased gas sales volumes in the current year represent volumes of gas we sell at market prices that were purchased from third party producers, less our gathering and marketing fees. In 2006, purchased gas costs and volumes represented volumes of gas we simultaneously purchased from and sold to the same counterparties under contracts that were committed prior to January 1, 2006. Accordingly, Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 04 13 (EITF 04 13), which we adopted on January 1, 2006, did not apply to these transactions. All contracts entered into prior to January 1, 2006 expired in 2006, while all activity related to 2007 is reflected in transportation expense on a net basis. Freight expense is based on weight of coal shipped, negotiated freight rates and method of transportation (i.e., rail, barge, truck, etc.) used for the customers to whom CONSOL Energy contractually provides transportation. Freight expense is billed to customers and the revenue from such billing equals the transportation expense. 2007 2006 Variance PercentageChange Freight Expense $ 187 $ 163 $ 24 14.7 % Selling, general and administrative costs have increased due to the following items: 2007 2006 DollarVariance PercentageChange Wages and salaries $ 40 $ 35 $ 5 14.3 % Professional, consulting and other purchased services 29 23 6 26.1 % Advertising and promotion 4 1 3 300.0 % Rentals 4 2 2 100.0 % Insurance 4 2 2 100.0 % Employee benefits 8 11 (3 ) (27.3 )% Other 20 17 3 17.6 % Total Selling, General and Administrative $ 109 $ 91 $ 18 19.8 % Wages and salaries have increased $5 million due to additional employees as a result of several acquisitions throughout 2007 and additional employees being hired after the 2006 period. Costs of professional, consulting and other purchased services were higher in 2007 compared to 2006 primarily due to $4 million of additional costs incurred by CNX Gas related to a new computer system and legal fees associated with outstanding legal cases. The remaining $2 million increase is due to various transactions that occurred throughout both periods, none of which are individually material. Advertising and promotion expenses were $3 million higher in 2007 compared to 2006 due to an advertising campaign launched in 2007 to raise corporate awareness and recruit the next generation of employees. Rentals of equipment, primarily computers, have increased $2 million in the year to year comparison due to additional employees that have been added related to growth of CNX Gas as well as several acquisitions that occurred throughout 2007. Insurance expense increase of $2 million was primarily related to increased premium costs for property, business interruption and excess general liability insurance. Employee benefits decreased due mainly to an acceleration in 2006 of previously unrecognized actuarial losses related to our salary pension plan. Our defined benefit pension plan for salaried employees allows such employees to receive a lump sum distribution in lieu of annual payments when they retire from CONSOL 79 Table of Contents Energy. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 88, Employers Accounting for Settlement & Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits, requires that when the lump sum distributions made for a plan year, which for CONSOL Energy is October 1 to September 30, exceed the total of the service cost and interest cost for the plan year, an adjustment equaling the unrecognized actuarial gain or loss resulting from each individual who received a lump sum in that year be recognized. The total accelerated actuarial amortization recognized in 2007 was $2.7 million, of which $0.2 million impacted selling, general and administrative expense. The total accelerated actuarial amortization recognized in 2006 was $17.8 million, of which $2.1 million impacted selling, general and administrative expense. Other selling, general and administrative costs increased $3 million due to miscellaneous costs related to various transactions that occurred throughout both years, none of which were individually material. Depreciation, depletion and amortization increased due to the following items: 2007 2006 DollarVariance PercentageChange Coal $ 258 $ 241 $ 17 7.1 % Gas: Production 31 25 6 24.0 % Gathering 18 13 5 38.5 % Total Gas 49 38 11 28.9 % Other 18 17 1 5.9 % Total Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization $ 325 $ 296 $ 29 9.8 % The increase in coal depreciation, depletion and amortization was primarily due to additional expense related to the assets received in the acquisition of AMVEST. The increase was also attributable to assets placed in service after December 31, 2006. Assets placed in service after December 31, 2006 include various airshafts, longwall assets, haulage assets and other projects completed at our mines. These increases were offset, in part, by a reduction in depletion expense due to depletion of economic reserves at VP#8 Mine and decreased amortization due to decreased production in 2007 compared to 2006. The increase in gas production related depreciation, depletion and amortization was primarily due to an increase in units of production rates and increased production volumes year to year. These rates, which are recalculated annually, increased due to the higher proportion of capital assets placed in service versus the proportion of proved developed reserve additions. Rates are generally calculated using the net book value of assets at the end of the year divided by either proved or proved developed reserves. Gathering depreciation, depletion and amortization is recorded on the straight line method and increased primarily as a result realizing a full year of the capital lease treatment of the Jewell Ridge lateral, which went into service in October 2006. Other depreciation, depletion and amortization increased $1 million primarily related to capitalized computer software being placed in service after December 31, 2006. Interest expense increased in 2007 compared to 2006 due to the following items: 2007 2006 DollarVariance PercentageChange Capitalized lease $ 7 $ 2 $ 5 250.0 % Revolver 5 5 100.0 % Interest on unrecognized tax benefits 3 3 100.0 % Long term secured notes 28 30 (2 ) (6.7 )% Other (12 ) (7 ) (5 ) 71.4 % Total Interest Expense $ 31 $ 25 $ 6 24.0 % 80 Table of Contents In conjunction with the completion of the Jewell Ridge lateral pipeline in October 2006, CNX Gas entered into a 15 year firm transportation agreement with ETNG, a subsidiary of Duke Energy. Also, in April 2006, CONSOL Energy entered into an agreement for the acquisition of longwall equipment. These agreements were required to be treated as capital leases under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 13, Accounting for Leases and accordingly incur interest expense each period. Revolver interest expense increased $5 million due to amounts being drawn on our revolving credit facility in 2007. The facility had $248 million outstanding at December 31, 2007. No amounts were drawn on the facility in 2006. CONSOL Energy began recording interest on unrecognized tax benefits as a result of the adoption of FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement 109 (FIN 48) in 2007. See Note 6 in Item 8, Notes to the Audited Financial Statements Data of this Form 10 K. Interest on long term debt decreased $2 million due to the planned June 2007 principal payment on our $45 million secured note. Other reductions in interest expense were related to higher amounts of interest capitalized in 2007 compared to 2006. Higher capitalized interest was attributable to the higher level of capital projects funded from operating cash flow in 2007 compared to 2006. Taxes other than income increased primarily due to the following items: 2007 2006 DollarVariance PercentageChange Production taxes: Coal $ 175 $ 157 $ 18 11.5 % Gas 13 12 1 8.3 % Total Production Taxes 188 169 19 11.2 % Other taxes: Coal 79 71 8 11.3 % Gas 5 4 1 25.0 % Other 12 9 3 33.3 % Other 96 84 12 14.3 % Total Taxes Other Than Income $ 284 $ 253 $ 31 12.3 % Increased coal production taxes are primarily due to $24 million of expense related to the Export Excise Tax receivable being reversed in the 2007 period. The Federal Circuit court had ruled that the damage claim for export excise taxes paid for the period 1991 1993 be repaid. The Government appealed a similar case to the U.S. Supreme Court. On December 3, 2007 the United States Supreme Court granted the Governments appeal to hear that case. The Supreme Courts appeal of the petition makes collection of the refund and interest by CONSOL Energy no longer highly probable because of adverse rulings by the Supreme Court during 2007 under the statute on which our claim for this period is based. Accordingly, CONSOL Energy reversed the export excise tax receivable until the Supreme Court decides the appeal. Coal production taxes also include a $6 million improvement related to lower coal production in 2007 compared to 2006. Lower production reduces severance taxes, reclamation fee taxes and black lung excise taxes, although these reductions were somewhat offset by higher average sales prices. Gas production taxes increased $1 million due to higher severance taxes attributable to higher average sales prices for gas and higher gas sales volumes. Other coal taxes have increased in 2007 due to property taxes which are based on current assessment values which have increased over the prior year primarily related to the acquisition of AMVEST, as previously 81 Table of Contents discussed. Other coal taxes are also higher due to lower Virginia employment enhancement tax credits. Virginia provides a tax credit based on employment figures attributable to operations in that state. Due to the previously discussed Buchanan Mine situation, our employment figures have been temporarily reduced. The employment figure reduction has correspondingly reduced the tax credit that we earn. Other gas taxes have increased in 2007 due to various transactions that occurred throughout both years, none of which were individually material. Other taxes have increased $3 million due to various transactions that occurred throughout both periods, none of which were individually material. 2007 2006 Variance PercentageChange Earnings Before Income Taxes $ 429 $ 551 $ (122 ) (22.1 )% Tax Expense $ 136 $ 112 $ 24 21.4 % Effective Income Tax Rate 31.7 % 20.4 % 11.3 % CONSOL Energys effective tax rate is sensitive to changes to the relationship between pre tax earnings and percentage depletion. See Note 6 in Item 8, Notes to the Audited Financial Statements of this Form 10 K. CONSOL Energys 2006 effective income tax rate includes the impact of state income tax benefits resulting from a change in a state tax statute. Minority Interest Minority interest represents 18.3% of CNX Gas net income for the five month period ended December 31, 2007 which CONSOL Energy did not own. It also represents 18.5% of Gass net income for the seven month period ended July 31, 2007 which CONSOL Energy did not own. During the period ended December 31, 2007, CONSOL Energy purchased $10 million of CNX Gas shares on the open market. The purchase of the additional shares changed CONSOL Energys ownership percentage in CNX Gas from 81.5% to 81.7%. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and at the date of the financial statements. Note 1 of the Notes to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10 K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. On an on going basis, we evaluate our estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making the judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from those estimates upon subsequent resolution of identified matters. Management believes that the estimates utilized are reasonable. The following critical accounting policies are materially impacted by judgments, assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Other Post Employment Benefits Certain subsidiaries of CONSOL Energy provide medical and life insurance benefits to retired employees not covered by the Coal Industry Retiree Health Benefit Act of 1992. The medical plans contain certain cost sharing and containment features, such as deductibles, coinsurance, health care networks and coordination with Medicare. Prior to August 1, 2003, substantially all employees become eligible for these benefits if they had ten 82 Table of Contents years of company service and attained age 55. Effective August 1, 2003, the base eligibility was changed to age 55 with 20 years of service for salaried employees. In addition, effective January 1, 2004, a medical plan cost sharing arrangement with all salaried employees and retirees was adopted. These participants will now contribute a minimum of 20% of medical plan operating costs. Contributions may be higher, dependent on either years of service or a combination of age and years of service at retirement. Prospective annual cost increases of up to 6% will be shared 80% by CONSOL Energy and 20% by the participants. Annual cost increases in excess of 6% will be the sole responsibility of the participant. Also, any salaried or non represented hourly employees that were hired or rehired effective January 1, 2007 or later will not become eligible for retiree health benefits. In lieu of traditional retiree health coverage, if certain eligibility requirements are met, these employees may be eligible to receive a retiree medical spending allowance for each year of service at retirement. Newly employed inexperienced employees represented by the UMWA, hired after January 1, 2007, will not be eligible to receive retiree benefits. In lieu of these benefits, these employees will receive a defined contribution benefit of $1 per each hour worked. After our review, various actuarial assumptions, including discount rate, expected trend in health care costs, average remaining service period, average remaining life expectancy, per capita costs and participation level in each future year are used by our independent actuary to estimate the cost and benefit obligations for our retiree health plans. Most assumptions used in 2008 have not differed materially from the prior year actual experience. Expected trend in health care cost assumptions have been changed since the prior year. The initial expected trend in health care costs at this years measurement date, which was December 31, 2008, was 9.6% compared to a prior year expected 2008 trend in health care cost of 8.0%. In addition, the year the ultimate trend rate is reached was extended from 2013 to 2015. A 1.0% decrease in the health care trend rate would decrease interest and service cost for 2008 by approximately $17.3 million. A 1.0% increase in the health care trend rate would increase the interest and service cost by approximately $20.7 million. The discount rate is also determined each year at the measurement date. The discount rate is estimated by utilizing a corporate yield curve model developed from corporate bond data using only bonds rated Aa by Moodys as of the measurement date. All future post employment benefit expected payments were discounted using a spot rate yield curve as of December 31, 2008. The appropriate discount rate was then selected from resulting discounted cash flows. For the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, the discount rate used to calculate the period end liability and the following years expense was 6.20% and 6.63%, respectively. A 0.25% increase in the discount rate would have decreased 2008 net periodic postretirement benefit costs by approximately $4.0 million. A 0.25% decrease in the discount rate would have increased 2008 net periodic postretirement benefit costs by approximately $4.1 million. Deferred gains and losses are primarily due to historical changes in the discount rate and medical cost inflation differing from expectations in prior years. Changes to interest rates for the rates of returns on instruments that could be used to settle the actuarially determined plan obligations introduce substantial volatility to our costs. Accumulated actuarial gains or losses in excess of a pre established corridor are amortized on a straight line basis over the expected future service of active salary employees to their assumed retirement age. At December 31, 2008 the average remaining service period for our salaried plans is approximately 10 years. Accumulated actuarial gains or losses in excess of a pre established corridor are amortized on a straight line basis over the expected remaining life of our retired United Mine Workers of America (UMWA) population. The average remaining service period of this population is not used for amortization purposes because the majority of the UMWA population of our plan is retired. At December 31, 2008, the average remaining life expectancy of our retired UMWA population used to calculate the following years expense is approximately 13 years. Per capita costs on a per annum basis for Other Postretirement Benefits were assumed to be $5,783 at December 31, 2008. This was approximately a 4.8% decrease from the per capita cost on a per annum basis at December 31, 2007. The decrease was due to more favorable experience than expected, healthcare cost trends and was within the range expected by our assumptions. If the actual change in per capita cost of medical services or other postretirement benefits are significantly greater or less than the projected trend rates, the per capita cost assumption would need to be adjusted, which could have a significant effect on the costs and liabilities recognized in the financial statements. 83 Table of Contents Significant increases in health and prescription drug costs for represented hourly retirees could have a material adverse effect on CONSOL Energys operating cash flow. However, the effect on CONSOL Energys cash flow from operations for salaried employees has been limited to approximately 6% of the previous years medical cost for salaried employees due to the cost sharing provision in the benefit plan. On September 29, 2006, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans (SFAS 158) was issued. SFAS 158 required, among other things, the recognition of the funded status of each defined pension benefit plan and other postretirement benefit plans on the balance sheet. Each overfunded plan is recognized as an asset and each underfunded plan is recognized as a liability. Additionally, SFAS 158 requires an employer to measure the funded status of its plans as of the date of its year end statement of financial position. This provision became effective for CONSOL Energy for the year ended December 31, 2008 and required a change in the measurement date from September 30 to December 31. As a result of the adoption, the company recognized an increase of $42.6 million in the other postretirement liability. This increase was accounted for as a reduction in the January 1, 2008 balance of retained earnings. The estimated liability recognized in the December 31, 2008 financial statements was $2.6 billion. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we paid approximately $143.0 million for Other Postretirement Benefits, all of which were paid from operating cash flow. Our obligations with respect to these liabilities are unfunded at December 31, 2008. CONSOL Energy does not expect to contribute to the other postretirement plan in 2009. We intend to pay benefit claims as they are due. Salaried Pensions CONSOL Energy has non contributory defined benefit retirement plans covering substantially all employees not covered by multiemployer plans. The benefits for these plans are based primarily on years of service and employees pay near retirement. Effective January 1, 2006, employees hired between August 1, 2004 and December 31, 2005 that were not previously eligible to participate in the plans began accruing service. The CONSOL Energy salaried plan allows for lump sum distributions of benefits earned up until December 31, 2005, at the employees election. The Restoration Plan was frozen effective December 31, 2006 and was replaced prospectively with the CONSOL Energy Supplemental Retirement Plan. In addition, the CONSOL Energys Restoration Plan allows only for lump sum distributions earned up until December 31, 2006. Effective January 1, 2007, employees hired by CNX Gas, an 83.3% owned subsidiary, will not be eligible to participate in CNX Gas non contributory defined benefit retirement plan. In lieu of participation in the non contributory defined benefit plan, these employees began receiving an additional 3% company contribution into their defined contribution plan. CNX Gas employees who were hired prior to December 31, 2005 or who were employees of CONSOL Energy prior to this date were given a one time opportunity to elect to remain in the defined benefit plan or opt to freeze their service accruals and participate in the additional 3% company contribution into their defined contribution plan. All employees hired on or after January 1, 2006, but on or before December 31, 2006 had their current non contributory defined benefit frozen and began receiving the additional 3% company contribution into their defined contribution plan, effective January 1, 2007. CNX Gas intends to freeze all defined benefit accruals as of December 31, 2016 for CNX Gas employees that elected to remain in the defined benefit plan. Our independent actuaries calculate the actuarial present value of the estimated retirement obligation based on assumptions including rates of compensation, mortality rates, retirement age and interest rates. For the year ended December 31, 2008, compensation increases are assumed to range from 3% to 8% depending on age and job classification. The discount rate is determined each year at the measurement date. The discount rate is estimated by utilizing a corporate yield curve model developed from corporate bond data using only bonds rated Aa by Moodys as of the measurement date. All expected benefit payments from the CONSOL Energy retirement plan were discounted using a spot rate yield curve as of December 31, 2008. The appropriate equivalent discount 84 Table of Contents rate was then selected for the resulting discounted pension cash flows. For the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, the discount rate used to calculate the period end liability and the following years expense was 6.28% and 6.57%, respectively. A 0.25% increase in the discount rate would have decreased the 2008 net periodic pension cost by $1.0 million. A 0.25% decrease in the discount rate would have increased the 2008 net periodic pension cost by $1.0 million. Deferred gains and losses are primarily due to historical changes in the discount rate and earnings on assets differing from expectations in prior years. At December 31, 2008 the average remaining service period is approximately 10 years. Changes to any of these assumptions introduce substantial volatility to our costs. On September 29, 2006, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans (SFAS 158) was issued. SFAS 158 required, among other things, the recognition of the funded status of each defined pension benefit plan and other postretirement benefit plans on the balance sheet. Each overfunded plan is recognized as an asset and each underfunded plan is recognized as a liability. Additionally, SFAS 158 requires an employer to measure the funded status of its plans as of the date of its year end statement of financial position. This provision became effective for CONSOL Energy for the year ended December 31, 2008 and required a change in the measurement date from September 30 to December 31. As a result of this adoption, the company recognized an increase of $2.3 million in the liability for salaried pension. This increase was accounted for as a reduction in the January 1, 2008 balance of retained earnings. The market related asset value is derived by taking the cost value of assets as of December 31, 2008 and multiplying it by the average 36 month ratio of the market value of assets to the cost value of assets. CONSOL Energys pension plan weighted average asset allocations at December 31, 2008 consisted of 63% equity securities and 37% debt securities. The current volatile economic environment and rapid deterioration in the equity markets have caused investment income and the value of investment assets held in our pension trust to decline and lose value. As a result, we may be required to increase the amount of cash contributions we make into the pension trust. According to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 88, Employers Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits, plans that pay lump sum distributions need to monitor the distributions for a plan year. If total payments, exceed the total of the service cost and interest cost for the plan year, settlement accounting is required. Lump sum payments exceeded this threshold in the Restoration Plan during 2007. CONSOL Energy recognized an additional expense of $2.7 million in 2007s results of operations. The adjustment equaled the previously unrecognized actuarial loss resulting from each individual who received a lump sum in that year. CONSOL regularly monitors this situation. If settlement accounting is triggered again in the future, the adjustment could materially impact operating results. The estimated liability recognized in the December 31, 2008 financial statements was $196.5 million. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we contributed approximately $42.1 million for defined benefit retirement plans other than multi employer plans. Our obligations with respect to these liabilities are partially funded at December 31, 2008. CONSOL Energy does expect to contribute to the defined benefit retirement plans during 2009. We intend to contribute an amount that will avoid benefit restrictions for the following plan year. Workers Compensation and Coal Workers Pneumoconiosis Workers compensation is a system by which individuals who sustain employment related physical injuries or some type of occupational diseases are compensated for their disabilities, medical costs, and on some occasions, for the costs of their rehabilitation. Workers compensation will also compensate the survivors of workers who suffer employment related deaths. The workers compensation laws are administered by state agencies with each state having its own set of rules and regulations regarding compensation that is owed to an employee that is injured in the course of employment. CONSOL Energy records an actuarially calculated liability, which is determined using various assumptions, including discount rate, future healthcare cost trends, 85 Table of Contents benefit duration and recurrence of injuries. The discount rate is determined each year at the measurement date. The discount rate is estimated by utilizing a corporate yield curve model developed from corporate bond data using only bonds rated Aa by Moodys as of the measurement date. All future workers compensation expected benefit payments were discounted using a spot rate yield curve as of December 31, 2008. The appropriate equivalent discount rate was then selected from the resulting discounted workers compensation cash flows. For the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, the discount rate used to calculate the period end liability and the following years expense was 5.90% and 5.94%, respectively. A 0.25% increase or decrease in the discount rate would not have materially decreased or increased the 2008 workers compensation expense. Deferred gains and losses are primarily due to historical changes in the discount rates, several years of favorable claims experience, various favorable claims experience, various favorable state legislation changes and an over all lower incident rate than our assumptions. Accumulated actuarial gains or losses are amortized on a straight line basis over the expected future benefit duration of current claimants. At December 31, 2008, the average expected benefit duration for this group is approximately 9 years. The estimated liability recognized in the financial statements at December 31, 2008 was approximately $159.8 million. CONSOL Energys policy has been to provide for workers compensation benefits from operating cash flow. No funding has been provided to cover these benefits. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we made payments for workers compensation benefits of approximately $38.8 million, all of which was paid from operating cash flow. CONSOL Energy is responsible under the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969, as amended, for medical and disability benefits to employees and their dependents resulting from occurrences of coal workers pneumoconiosis disease. CONSOL Energy is also responsible under various state statutes for pneumoconiosis benefits. After our review, our independent actuaries calculate the actuarial present value of the estimated pneumoconiosis obligation based on assumptions regarding disability incidence, medical costs, mortality, death benefits, dependents and discount rates. The discount rate is determined each year at the measurement date. The discount rate is estimated by utilizing a corporate yield curve model developed from corporate bond data using only bonds rated Aa by Moodys as of the measurement date. All future coal workers pneumoconiosis expected benefit payments were discounted using a spot rate yield curve at December 31, 2008. The appropriate equivalent discount rate was then selected from the resulting discounted coal workers pneumoconiosis cash flows. For the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, the discount rate used to calculate the period end liability and the following years expense was 6.23% and 6.62%, respectively. A 0.25% increase or decrease in the discount rate would not have materially decreased or increased the 2008 coal workers pneumoconiosis expense. Actuarial gains associated with coal workers pneumoconiosis have resulted from numerous legislative changes over many years which have resulted in lower approval rates for filed claims than our assumptions originally reflected. Actuarial gains have also resulted from lower incident rates and lower severity of claims filed than our assumption originally reflected. The estimated liability recognized in the financial statements at December 31, 2008 was $200.1 million. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we paid coal workers pneumoconiosis benefits of approximately $11.5 million. Our obligations with respect to these liabilities are unfunded at December 31, 2008. On September 29, 2006, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans (SFAS 158) was issued. SFAS 158 required, among other things, the recognition of the funded status of each defined pension benefit plan and other postretirement benefit plans on the balance sheet. Each overfunded plan is recognized as an asset and each underfunded plan is recognized as a liability. Additionally, SFAS 158 requires an employer to measure the funded status of its plans as of the date of its year end statement of financial position. This provision became effective for CONSOL Energy for the year ended December 31, 2008 and required a change in the measurement date from September 30 to December 31. As a result of this adoption, the company recognized an increase of $4.9 million and $11.5 million in the liabilities for coal workers pneumoconiosis and workers compensation, respectively. These increases were accounted for as a reduction in the January 1, 2008 balance of retained earnings. 86 Table of Contents Reclamation, Mine Closure and Gas Well Closing Obligations The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act established operational, reclamation and closure standards for all aspects of surface mining as well as most aspects of deep mining. CONSOL Energy accrues for the costs of current mine disturbance and final mine and gas well closure, including the cost of treating mine water discharge where necessary. Estimates of our total reclamation, mine closing liabilities, and gas well closing which are based upon permit requirements and CONSOL Energy engineering expertise related to these requirements, including the current portion, were approximately $544.3 million at December 31, 2008. This liability is reviewed annually by CONSOL Energy management and engineers. The estimated liability can significantly change if actual costs vary from assumptions or if governmental regulations change significantly. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations (SFAS No. 143) requires that the fair value of an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The present value of the estimated asset retirement costs is capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset. Asset retirement obligations primarily relate to the closure of mines and gas wells and the reclamation of land upon exhaustion of coal and gas reserves. Changes in the variables used to calculate the liabilities can have a significant effect on the mine closing, reclamation and gas well closing liabilities. The amounts of assets and liabilities recorded are dependent upon a number of variables, including the estimated future retirement costs, estimated proven reserves, assumptions involving profit margins, inflation rates, and the assumed credit adjusted risk free interest rate. SFAS No. 143 requires depreciation of the capitalized asset retirement cost and accretion of the asset retirement obligation over time. The depreciation will generally be determined on a units of production basis, whereas the accretion to be recognized will escalate over the life of the producing assets, typically as production declines. Income Taxes CONSOL Energy accounts for income taxes in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS No. 109) which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax basis of recorded assets and liabilities. SFAS No. 109 also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. All available evidence, both positive and negative, must be considered in determining the need for a valuation allowance. At December 31, 2008, CONSOL Energy has deferred tax assets in excess of deferred tax liabilities of approximately $394.1 million. The deferred tax assets are evaluated periodically to determine if a valuation allowance is necessary. There were no significant changes in the deferred tax valuation allowances in the year ended December 31, 2008. For 2008, CONSOL Energy continues to report a deferred tax asset of approximately $34.7 million relating to CONSOL Energys state net operating loss carry forwards with a full valuation allowance. A review of the positive and negative evidence regarding these benefits, primarily the history of book and tax losses on a separate company basis, concluded that a valuation allowance was warranted. A valuation allowance of $26.2 million has also been recorded against the deferred state tax asset attributable to future deductible differences for certain subsidiaries with histories of book and tax losses. These net operating losses expire at various times from 2009 to 2027. Management will continue to assess the realization of deferred tax assets based upon updated income forecast data and the feasibility of future tax planning strategies, and may record adjustments to valuation allowances against deferred tax assets in future periods as appropriate that could materially impact net income. CONSOL Energy adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement 109 (FIN 48) on January 1, 2007. CONSOL Energy evaluates all tax positions taken on the state and federal tax filings to determine if the position is more likely than 87 Table of Contents not to be sustained upon examination. For positions that meet the more likely than not to be sustained criteria, an evaluation to determine the largest amount of benefit, determined on a cumulative probability basis that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement is determined. A previously recognized tax position is derecognized when it is subsequently determined that a tax position no longer meets the more likely than not threshold to be sustained. The evaluation of the sustainability of a tax position and the probable amount that is more likely than not is based on judgment, historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these estimates, that are not readily apparent from other sources, form the basis for recognizing a FIN 48 liability. Actual results could differ from those estimates upon subsequent resolution of identified matters. Estimates of our uncertain tax liabilities, including interest and the current portion, were approximately $71.2 million at December 31, 2008. Stock Based Compensation CONSOL Energy uses the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R, Share Based Payments (SFAS No. 123R). As of December 31, 2008, we have issued three types of share based payment awards: options, restricted stock units, and performance stock units. The Black Scholes option pricing model is used to determine fair value of stock options at the grant date. Various inputs are utilized in the Black Scholes pricing model, such as: stock price on measurement date, exercise price defined in the award, expected dividend yield based on historical trend of dividend payouts, risk free interest rate based on a zero coupon treasury bond rate, expected term based on historical grant and exercise behavior, and expected volatility based on historic and implied stock price volatility of CONSOL Energy stock and public peer group stock. These factors can significantly impact the value of stock options expense recognized over the requisite service period of option holders. The fair value of each restricted stock unit awarded is equivalent to the closing market price of a share of our companys stock. The fair value of each performance share unit is determined by the underlying share price of our company stock on the date of the grant and managements estimate of the probability that the performance conditions required for vesting will be achieved. As of December 31, 2008, $15.7 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested awards is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.54 years. See Note 18 in the Notes to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 in this Form 10 K for more information. Contingencies CONSOL Energy is currently involved in certain legal proceedings. We have accrued our estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of these claims. This estimate has been developed in consultation with legal counsel involved in the defense of these matters and is based upon an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies. Future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the outcome of these proceedings. See Note 25 in the Notes to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 in this Form 10 K for more information. 88 Table of Contents Successful Efforts Accounting We use the successful efforts method to account for our gas exploration and production activities. Under this method, cost of property acquisitions, successful exploratory wells, development wells and related support equipment and facilities are capitalized. Costs of unsuccessful exploratory wells are expensed when such wells are determined to be non productive, or if the determination can not be made after finding sufficient quantities of reserves to continue evaluating the viability of the project. We use this accounting policy instead of the full cost method because it provides a more timely accounting of the success or failure of our gas exploration and production activities. Derivative Instruments CNX Gas enters into financial derivative instruments to manage our exposure to natural gas and oil price volatility. Our derivatives are accounted for under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (SFAS 133), as amended. We measure every derivative instrument at fair value and record them on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability. Changes in fair value of derivatives are recorded currently in earnings unless special hedge accounting criteria are met. For derivatives designated as fair value hedges, the changes in fair value of both the derivative instrument and the hedged item are recorded in earnings. For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portions of changes in fair value of the derivative are reported in other comprehensive income or loss and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods which the forecasted transaction affects earnings. The ineffective portions of hedges are recognized in earnings in the current year. CNX Gas currently utilizes only cash flow hedges that are considered highly effective. CNX Gas formally assesses, both at inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, whether each derivative is highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedge item. If it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective as a hedge or if a derivative ceases to be a highly effective hedge, CNX Gas will discontinue hedge accounting prospectively. Coal and Gas Reserve Values There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities and values of economically recoverable coal and gas reserves, including many factors beyond our control. As a result, estimates of economically recoverable coal and gas reserves are by their nature uncertain. Information about our reserves consists of estimates based on engineering, economic and geological data assembled and analyzed by our staff. Our gas reserves have been reviewed by independent experts. Our coal reserves are periodically reviewed by an independent third party consultant. Some of the factors and assumptions which impact economically recoverable reserve estimates include: geological conditions; historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas; the assumed effects of regulations and taxes by governmental agencies; assumptions governing future prices; and future operating costs. Each of these factors may in fact vary considerably from the assumptions used in estimating reserves. For these reasons, estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of coal and gas attributable to a particular group of properties, and classifications of these reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of future net cash flows, may vary substantially. Actual production, revenues and expenditures with respect to our reserves will likely vary from estimates, and these variances may be material. See Risk Factors in Item 1A of this report for a discussion of the uncertainties in estimating our reserves. 89 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources CONSOL Energy generally has satisfied our working capital requirements and funded our capital expenditures and debt service obligations with cash generated from operations and proceeds from borrowings. We utilize a $1 billion senior secured credit facility which expires in 2012. The facility is secured by substantially all of the assets of CONSOL Energy and certain of its subsidiaries and collateral is shared equally and ratably with the holders of CONSOL Energy Inc. 7.875% bonds maturing in 2012. The agreement provides for the release of collateral at the request of CONSOL Energy upon the achievement of certain credit ratings. Fees and interest rate spreads are based on a ratio of financial covenant debt to twelve month trailing earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization (EBITDA), measured quarterly. The facility includes a minimum interest coverage ratio covenant of no less than 4.50 to 1.00, measured quarterly. The interest coverage ratio was 16.78 to 1.00 at December 31, 2008. The facility also includes a maximum leverage ratio covenant of not more than 3.25 to 1.00, measured quarterly. The leverage ratio was 1.34 to 1.00 at December 31, 2008. Affirmative and negative covenants in the facility limit our ability to dispose of assets, make investments, purchase or redeem CONSOL Energy common stock, pay dividends and merge with another corporation. At December 31, 2008, the facility had approximately $485 million drawn and $271 million of letters of credit outstanding, leaving $244 million of unused capacity. From time to time, CONSOL Energy is required to post financial assurances to satisfy contractual and other requirements generated in the normal course of business. Some of these assurances are posted to comply with federal, state or other government agencies statutes and regulations. We sometimes use letters of credit to satisfy these requirements and these letters of credit reduce our borrowing facility capacity. Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PA DEP) and CONSOL Energy have been negotiating a Consent Order and Agreement (the Agreement) that addresses financial assurance required by the State for CONSOL Energys Pennsylvania mine water treatment facilities. The Agreement requires the company to post approximately $34 million of financial assurance over a 10 year time frame as follows; 25% of the total required by March 15, 2009, and 10% of balance by March 15 of each year from 2010 through 2019. CONSOL Energy plans to use its revolving credit facility to satisfy these requirements. CONSOL Energy and certain of our U.S. subsidiaries also participate in a receivables securitization facility for the sale on a continuous basis of eligible trade accounts receivable that will provide, on a revolving basis, up to $165 million of short term funding or letter of credit. CONSOL Energy formed CNX Funding Corporation, a wholly owned, special purpose, bankruptcy remote subsidiary, for the sole purpose of buying and selling eligible trade receivables generated by certain subsidiaries of CONSOL Energy. Under the receivables facility, CONSOL Energy and certain subsidiaries, irrevocably and without recourse, sell all of their eligible trade accounts receivable to CNX Funding Corporation. CNX Funding Corporation then sells, on a revolving basis, an undivided percentage interest in the pool of eligible trade accounts receivable to financial institutions and their affiliates, while maintaining a subordinated interest in a portion of the trade receivables. CONSOL Energy has agreed to continue servicing the sold receivables for the financial institutions for a fee based upon market rates for similar services. The cost of funds is consistent with commercial paper rates plus a charge for administrative services paid to the financial institution. At December 31, 2008, eligible accounts receivable totaled approximately $165 million. There was no subordinated retained interest at December 31, 2008. Accounts receivable totaling $165 million were removed from the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2008. There were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2008. CNX Gas, an 83.3% consolidated subsidiary of CONSOL Energy, utilizes a revolving credit facility providing an initial aggregate outstanding principal amount of up to $200 million, including borrowings and letters of credit, which expires in 2010. CNX Gas can request an increase in aggregate outstanding principal amount to $300 million. The agreement contains a negative pledge provision, whereas CNX Gas assets cannot be used to secure other obligations. Fees and interest rate spreads are based on the percentage of facility utilization, measured quarterly. Covenants in the facility limit CNX Gas ability to dispose of assets, make investments, purchase or redeem CNX Gas stock, pay dividends and merge with another corporation. This facility includes a 90 Table of Contents leverage ratio covenant of not more than 3.00 to 1.00, measured quarterly. This ratio was 0.32 to 1.00 at December 31, 2008. The facility also includes an interest coverage ratio covenant of no less than 3.00 to 1.00, measured quarterly. This ratio was 77.29 to 1.00 at December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008, this facility had approximately $15 million of letters of credit issued and had approximately $73 million of outstanding borrowings, leaving approximately $112 million of unused capacity. As a result of the credit agreement, CNX Gas and their subsidiaries executed a Supplemental Indenture on October 21, 2005, guaranteeing of CONSOL Energys 7.875% bonds. Currently, there is an unprecedented uncertainty in the financial markets. The uncertainty in the market brings additional potential risks to CONSOL Energy. The risks include additional declines in our stock value, less availability and higher costs of additional credit streams, potential counterparty defaults, and further commercial bank failures. Although the majority of the financial institutions in our bank group appear to be strong, there are some that have been and could be considered take over candidates. We have no indication that any such transactions would impact our current credit facility; however, the possibility does exist. Financial market disruptions may impact our collection of trade receivables. The credit worthiness of our customers is constantly monitored by CONSOL Energy. We believe that our current group of customers are sound and represent no abnormal business risk. CONSOL Energy believes that cash generated from operations and our borrowing capacity will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements, anticipated capital expenditures (other than major acquisitions), scheduled debt payments, anticipated dividend payments and to provide required letters of credit. Nevertheless, the ability of CONSOL Energy to satisfy our working capital requirements, debt service obligations, to fund planned capital expenditures or pay dividends will depend upon future operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions in the coal and gas industries and other financial and business factors, some of which are beyond CONSOL Energys control. In order to manage the market risk exposure of volatile natural gas prices in the future, CONSOL Energy enters into various physical gas supply transactions with both gas marketers and end users for terms varying in length. CONSOL Energy has also entered into various gas swap transactions that qualify as financial cash flow hedge, which exist parallel to the underlying physical transactions. The fair value of these contracts was an asset of $207 million at December 31, 2008. The ineffective portion of these contracts was insignificant to earnings in the year ended December 31, 2008. Hedge counterparties consists of commercial banks who participate in the revolving credit facility. No issues related to our hedge agreements have been encountered to date. CONSOL Energy frequently evaluates potential acquisitions. CONSOL Energy has funded acquisitions primarily with cash generated from operations and a variety of other sources, depending on the size of the transaction, including debt financing. There can be no assurance that additional capital resources, including debt financing, will be available to CONSOL Energy on terms which CONSOL Energy finds acceptable, or at all. Cash Flows (in millions) 2008 2007 Change Cash flows provided by operating activities $ 1,029 $ 684 $ 345 Cash used in investing activities $ (1,099 ) $ (972 ) $ (127 ) Cash provided by financing activities $ 166 $ 106 $ 60 Cash flows from operating activities changed primarily due to the following items: Operating cash flow increased in 2008 due to higher net income in the year to year comparison, as well as various other changes in operating assets, operating liabilities, other assets and other liabilities which occurred throughout both years. 91 Table of Contents Operating cash flow in 2008 included a $75 million cash receipt from insurance carriers related to the Buchanan incident, as previously disclosed. Operating cash flow in 2007 included a $5 million cash receipt from insurance carriers related to a previous Buchanan incident. Operating cash flows were lower in 2008 due to $85 million of reduced proceeds from the accounts receivable securitization program. Operating cash flows were lower in 2008 by approximately $67 million due to coal inventories. Coal inventories increased 462 thousand tons in 2008. Coal inventories decreased 147 thousand tons in 2007. Net cash used in investing activities changed primarily due to the following items: Total capital expenditures increased $22 million to $1,062 million in 2008 compared to $1,040 million in 2007. The increase was attributable to the $36 million cash proceeds paid for the acquisition of the remaining interest in Coalfield Pipeline and Knox Energy, LLC, which CNX Gas did not previously own. Increases in capital expenditures were also related to the expanded gas drilling program, as well as additional increases in capital spending throughout other segments. The increases in capital expenditures were offset, in part, by the $297 million of cash proceeds paid in 2007 for the acquisition of AMVEST. CONSOL Energy purchased $67 million of CNX Gas common stock on the open market during 2008. Cash proceeds of $10 million were paid in 2007 to acquire CNX Gas common stock on the open market. Proceeds from the sale of assets were $28 million in 2008 compared to $85 million in 2008. Proceeds in 2008 were primarily related to the sale of the Mill Creek Mine. Proceeds in 2007 were primarily due to the $53 million of proceeds from the sale of certain western Kentucky coal reserves to Alliance Resource Partners, L.P. Net cash provided by financing activities changed primarily due to the following items: In 2008, CONSOL Energy received approximately $237 million of proceeds from the revolving credit facility. In 2007, CONSOL Energy received approximately $248 million of proceeds from this facility. In 2008, CONSOL Energys 83.3% owned subsidiary, CNX Gas, received proceeds of approximately $73 million from its revolving credit facility. There was no activity under the CNX Gas revolving credit facility in 2007. In 2007, CONSOL Energy paid $45 million to redeem its medium term notes that were due in June 2007. There were no long term debt repayments in 2008. CONSOL Energy repurchased $98 million of its common stock on the open market under the share repurchase program in 2008 compared to $80 million of its common stock purchased in 2007. In 2008, CONSOL Energy paid approximately $73 million of dividends compared to approximately $56 million in 2007. 92 Table of Contents The following is a summary of our significant contractual obligations at December 31, 2008 (in thousands): Payments due by Year Less Than1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years More Than5 Years Total Short Term Notes Payable $ 557,700 $ $ $ $ 557,700 Purchase Order Firm Commitments 22,624 16,253 38,877 Gas Firm Transportation Obligation 19,449 36,494 32,235 239,196 327,374 Long Term Debt 10,036 125,063 255,094 14,870 405,063 Capital Lease Obligations 21,065 33,261 15,734 57,788 127,848 Operating Lease Obligations 55,720 96,440 58,175 168,757 379,092 Other Long Term Liabilities(a) 365,385 488,830 481,658 2,359,741 3,695,614 Total Contractual Obligations(b) $ 1,051,979 $ 796,341 $ 842,896 $ 2,840,352 $ 5,531,568 (a) Long term liabilities include other post employment benefits, work related injuries and illnesses, mine reclamation and closure and other long term liability costs. Estimated salaried retirement contributions required to meet minimum funding standards under ERISA are excluded from the pay out table due to the uncertainty regarding amounts to be contributed. Estimated 2009 contributions are expected to range from $47 million to $67 million. (b) The significant obligation table does not include obligations to taxing authorities due to the uncertainty surrounding the ultimate settlement of amounts and timing of these obligations. Debt At December 31, 2008, CONSOL Energy had total long term debt of $491 million outstanding, including the current portion of long term debt of $22 million. This long term debt consisted of: An aggregate principal amount of $249 million of 7.875% notes ($250 million of 7.875% notes due in 2012, net of $1 million unamortized debt discount). The notes were issued at 99.174% of the principal amount. Interest on the notes is payable March 1 and September 1 of each year. Payment of the principal and premium, if any, and interest on the notes are guaranteed by most of CONSOL Energys subsidiaries. The notes are senior secured obligations and rank equally with all other secured indebtedness of the guarantors; An aggregate principal amount of $103 million of two series of industrial revenue bonds which were issued to finance the Baltimore port facility and bear interest at 6.50% per annum and mature in 2010 and 2011; $30 million in advance royalty commitments with an average interest rate of 10.7% per annum; An aggregate principal amount of $20 million on a variable rate note that bears interest at 6.10% at December 31, 2008. This note was incurred by a variable interest entity that is fully consolidated in which CONSOL Energy holds no ownership interest; An aggregate principal amount of $89 million of capital leases with a weighted average interest rate of 7.31% per annum; At December 31, 2008, CONSOL Energy also had $485 million of aggregate principal amounts of outstanding borrowings and approximately $271 million of letters of credit outstanding under the $1 billion senior secured revolving credit facility. At December 31, 2008, CNX Gas, an 83.3% owned subsidiary, had $73 million of aggregate principal amounts of outstanding borrowings and approximately $15 million of letters of credit outstanding under its $200 million revolving credit facility. 93 Table of Contents On September 15, 2008, Standard and Poors raised our corporate credit rating to BB+ from BB and removed all ratings from CreditWatch. The rating BB+ is the 11th lowest out of 22 rating categories. Standard and Poors defines an obligation rated BB as less vulnerable to nonpayment than other speculative issues. However, the rating indicates that an obligor faces major ongoing uncertainties or exposure to adverse business, financial or economic conditions, which could lead to the obligors inadequate capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation. Stockholders Equity and Dividends CONSOL Energy had stockholders equity of $1,462 million at December 31, 2008 and $1,214 million at December 31, 2007. Stockholders equity increased primarily due to net income for the year ended December 31, 2008 and changes in the cash flow hedges. These increases were offset by changes in the actuarial long term liabilities, the declaration of dividends, and the retirement 2.1 million shares of common stock. See Consolidated Statements of Stockholders Equity in the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. In September 2008, CONSOL Energy announced a share repurchase program of up to $500 million of the companys common stock during a 24 month period beginning in September 2008. The share repurchase plan will be used from time to time depending on a number of factors including: current market conditions; the companys financial outlook; business conditions, including cash flows and internal capital requirements; as well as alternative investment options. As of December 31, 2008, we have purchased a total of 2,741,300 shares at an average price of $35.59 per share under this program. Recent dividend information is as follows: Declaration Date Amount Per Share Record Date Payment Date January 30, 2009 $0.10 February 9, 2009 February 20, 2009 October 24, 2008 $0.10 November 5, 2008 November 21, 2008 August 1, 2008 $0.10 August 7, 2008 August 25, 2008 April 25, 2008 $0.10 May 6, 2008 May 27, 2008 January 30, 2008 $0.10 February 7, 2008 February 22, 2008 The declaration and payment of dividends by CONSOL Energy is subject to the discretion of CONSOL Energys Board of Directors, and no assurance can be given that CONSOL Energy will pay dividends in the future. CONSOL Energys Board of Directors determines whether dividends will be paid quarterly. The determination to pay dividends will depend upon, among other things, general business conditions, CONSOL Energys financial results, contractual and legal restrictions regarding the payment of dividends by CONSOL Energy, planned investments by CONSOL Energy and such other factors as the Board of Directors deems relevant. Our credit facility limits our ability to pay dividends when our leverage ratio covenant is 2.50 to 1.00 or more or our availability is less than $100 million. The leverage ratio was 1.34 to 1.00 and our availability was approximately $244 million at December 31, 2008. The credit facility does not permit dividend payments in the event of default. There were no defaults in the year ended December 31, 2008. Off Balance Sheet Transactions CONSOL Energy does not maintain any off balance sheet transactions, arrangements, obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or others that are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on CONSOL Energys financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources which are not disclosed in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 94 Table of Contents Recent Accounting Pronouncements In May 2008, The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement No. 162, The Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. The new standard is intended to improve financial reporting by identifying a consistent framework, or hierarchy, for selecting accounting principles to be used in preparing financial statements that are presented in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for nongovernmental entities. Statement 162 establishes that the GAAP hierarchy should be directed to entities because it is the entity (not its auditor) that is responsible for selecting accounting principles for financial statements that are presented in conformity with GAAP. Statement 162 is effective 60 days following the SECs approval of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board Auditing Amendments to AU Section 411, The Meaning of Present Fairly in Conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. We do not expect this guidance to have a significant impact on CONSOL Energy. In March 2008, The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, an amendment of FASB Statement 133 (SFAS 161). The new standard is intended to improve financial reporting about derivative instruments and hedging activities by requiring enhanced disclosures to enable investors to better understand their effects on an entitys financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The new standard also improves transparency about how and why a company uses derivative instruments and how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under Statement 133. It is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008, with early application encouraged. CONSOL Energys management is currently assessing the new disclosure requirements required by SFAS 161. In December 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141(R), Business Combinations (SFAS 141R), and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 160, Accounting and Reporting of Noncontrolling Interest in Consolidated Financial Statements, an amendment of ARB No. 51 (SFAS 160). SFAS 141R and SFAS 160 will significantly change the accounting for and reporting of business combination transactions and noncontrolling (minority) interests in consolidated financial statements. SFAS 141R retains the fundamental requirements in Statement 141 Business Combinations while providing additional definitions, such as the definition of the acquirer in a purchase and improvements in the application of how the acquisition method is applied. SFAS 160 will change the accounting and reporting for minority interests, which will be recharacterized as noncontrolling interests, and classified as a component of equity. These Statements become simultaneously effective January 1, 2009. Early adoption is not permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. In addition to the risks inherent in operations, CONSOL Energy is exposed to financial, market, political and economic risks. The following discussion provides additional detail regarding CONSOL Energys exposure to the risks of changing natural gas prices, interest rates and foreign exchange rates. CONSOL Energy is exposed to market price risk in the normal course of selling natural gas production and to a lesser extent in the sale of coal. CONSOL Energy sells coal under both short term and long term contracts with fixed price and or indexed price contracts that reflect market value. CONSOL Energy uses fixed price contracts, collar price contracts and derivative commodity instruments that qualify as cash flow hedges under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 to minimize exposure to market price volatility in the sale of natural gas. Our risk management policy strictly prohibits the use of derivatives for speculative purposes. CONSOL Energy has established risk management policies and procedures to strengthen the internal control environment of the marketing of commodities produced from its asset base. All of the derivative instruments without other risk assessment procedures are held for purposes other than trading. They are used primarily to mitigate uncertainty and volatility and cover underlying exposures. CONSOL Energys market risk strategy incorporates fundamental risk management tools to assess market price risk and establish a framework in which management can maintain a portfolio of transactions within pre defined risk parameters. 95 Table of Contents CONSOL Energy believes that the use of derivative instruments, along with the risk assessment procedures and internal controls, mitigates our exposure to material risk. However, the use of derivative instruments without other risk assessment procedures could materially affect CONSOL Energy results of operations depending on interest rates or market prices. Nevertheless, we believe that use of these instruments will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or liquidity. For a summary of accounting policies related to derivative instruments, see Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Sensitivity analyses of the incremental effects on pre tax income for the year ended December 31, 2008 of a hypothetical 10 percent and 25 percent change in natural gas prices for open derivative instruments as of December 31, 2008 are provided in the following table: Incremental Decreasein Pre tax IncomeAssuming aHypothetical Price, Exchange Rate or InterestRate Change of: 10% 25% (in millions) Natural Gas(a) $ 40.3 $ 102.6 (a) CONSOL Energy remains at risk for possible changes in the market value of these derivative instruments; however, such risk should be offset by price changes in the underlying hedged item. CONSOL Energy entered into derivative instruments to convert the market prices related portions of the 2009 through 2010 anticipated sales of natural gas to fixed prices. The sensitivity analyses reflect an inverse relationship between increases in commodity prices and a benefit to earnings. The fair value of these contracts was a net gain of $119 million (net of $77 million of deferred tax) at December 31, 2008. We continually evaluate the portfolio of derivative commodity instruments and adjust the strategy to anticipated market conditions and risks accordingly. CONSOL Energy is exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by counterparties. The creditworthiness of counterparties is subject to continuing review. All of the counterparties to CONSOL Energys natural gas derivative instruments also participate in CONSOL Energys revolving credit facility. The Company has not experienced any issues of non performance by derivative counterparties. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for further discussion of current capital markets. CONSOL Energys interest expense is sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates in the United States. At December 31, 2008, CONSOL Energy had $491 million aggregate principal amount of debt outstanding under fixed rate instruments and $558 million aggregate principal amount of debt outstanding under variable rate instruments. CONSOL Energys primary exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our revolving credit facility, under which there were $485 million of borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2008. CONSOL Energys revolving credit facility bore interest at a weighted average rate of 3.52% per annum during the year ended December 31, 2008. A 100 basis point increase in the average rate for CONSOL Energys revolving credit facility would not have significantly decreased net income for the period. CONSOL Energys 83.3% subsidiary, CNX Gas, also had outstanding borrowings under their revolving credit facility which bears interest at a variable rate. CNX Gas facility had outstanding borrowings of $73 million at December 31, 2008 and bore interest at a weighted average rate of 3.51% per annum during the year ended December 31, 2008. Due to the level of borrowings against this facility and the low weighted average interest rate in the year ended December 31, 2008, a 100 basis point increase in the average rate for CNX Gas revolving credit facility would not have significantly decreased net income for the period. Almost all of CONSOL Energys transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars, and, as a result, it does not have material exposure to currency exchange rate risks. 96 Table of Contents
