Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. General The U.S. economy began growing in the third quarter of 2009 and continued growing in the fourth quarter. Due to the significant fiscal spending and relaxed monetary policy in the United States, a modest recovery appears likely to continue in the U.S. through 2010. This should lead to an increase in demand for energy products from industrial customers, power generators and steel producers. Depending on the pace and sustainability of the recovery, we believe substantial opportunities exist for our metallurgical coal, thermal coal, and gas businesses. Steel plant capacity utilization rates in the U.S. and globally continue to improve compared to last year. Domestic steel mills are using approximately 65% of their capacity, while Asian steel mills currently are using about 82% of their capacity. Chinese steel demand is again driving world demand and pricing for coking coal. Through its arrangement with Xcoal, CONSOL expects to increase its sales to Asian mills throughout 2010. Going into the fourth quarter, thermal coal inventories were at historic highs. Because of the colder than normal weather in December 2009 and early January 2010, inventories at coal fired power generators have been significantly drawn down, but are still somewhat higher than normal. Customers in our major market area (the PJM power pool) had an estimated 55 60 days of inventory on hand as of mid January. The Company believes that thermal coal inventories could return to normal by mid year. The outlook for a gradual economic recovery with strengthening demand and higher gas prices combined with the production declines over the past year are expected to tighten the thermal coal markets and support higher pricing. Higher gas prices in 2010 should result in power generators switching back from gas to coal based on dispatch economics. We anticipate up to 30 million tons of coal generation could displace natural gas generation in 2010. In addition, approximately 19 gigawatts of new coal fired electricity generation capacity is set to come online by the end of 2012. This new demand, coupled with permanent cuts in coal production as well as safety and regulatory issues, is setting the stage for coal supply shortages over the next few years. With the continued build out of scrubbers by generators, increased economic activity and its low cost position, CONSOL Energy is in a position to increase market share. At the onset of the winter heating season, natural gas in storage fields was at record high levels. Because of much colder than normal weather in much of the U.S. from mid December through mid January, gas in storage has been drawn down to normal levels. The economic recovery is expected to positively affect industrial and commercial demand. CONSOL Energy established an arrangement with Xcoal to market CONSOL Energy coal in Asia. In January 2010, we sold a vessel of high vol coking coal from Bailey Mine in Northern Appalachia to merchant coke plants in China. This re branding of Bailey Mine coal from a premium thermal coal to a high volatile coking coal has meaningful implications for CONSOL Energys 2010 earnings and beyond. Our goal in 2010 is to sell 500,000 tons of Northern Appalachia high volatile coking coal into Asian markets. In 2009, a fish kill occurred in Dunkard Creek, which is a creek with segments in both Pennsylvania and West Virginia. The fish kill was caused by the growth of golden brown algae in the creek, which appears to be an invasive species, not indigenous to the area. A CONSOL Energy subsidiary discharges water into Dunkard Creek, after treatment, from its Blacksville No. 2 Mine and from its Loveridge Mine. This water has levels of chlorides that are higher than West Virginia in stream limits. The subsidiary is subject to a state administrative order in West Virginia that requires compliance in 2013 with effluent limits for chlorides for discharges from four active and two closed underground coal mines in northern West Virginia. Given the volumes of water involved and the options that are available to timely meet the effluent limits, it is likely that it will be necessary to construct one or more treatment facilities using advanced water treatment technologies. These requirements may cause CONSOL Energy to incur additional costs that could adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and cash flows. 62 Table of Contents Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2009 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2008 Net Income Attributable to CONSOL Energy Shareholders Net income attributable to CONSOL Energy shareholders changed primarily due to the following items (table in millions): 2009 2008 DollarVariance PercentageChange Sales Outside $ 4,312 $ 4,182 $ 130 3.1 % Sales Purchased Gas 7 8 (1 ) (12.5 )% Sales Gas Royalty Interest 41 79 (38 ) (48.1 )% Freight Outside 148 217 (69 ) (31.8 )% Other Income 113 166 (53 ) (31.9 )% Total Revenue and Other Income 4,621 4,652 (31 ) (0.7 )% Coal Cost of Goods Sold and Other Charges 2,757 2,843 (86 ) (3.0 )% Purchased Gas Costs 6 8 (2 ) (25.0 )% Gas Royalty Interest Costs 32 74 (42 ) (56.8 )% Total Cost of Goods Sold 2,795 2,925 (130 ) (4.4 )% Freight Expense 148 217 (69 ) (31.8 )% Selling, General and Administrative Expense 132 125 7 5.6 % Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization 437 390 47 12.1 % Interest Expense 32 36 (4 ) (11.1 )% Taxes Other Than Income 290 290 Black Lung Excise Tax Refund (1 ) (56 ) 55 (98.2 )% Total Costs 3,833 3,927 (94 ) (2.4 )% Earnings Before Income Taxes and Noncontrolling Interest 788 725 63 8.7 % Income Tax Expense 221 240 (19 ) (7.9 )% Earnings Before Noncontrolling Interest 567 485 82 16.9 % Noncontrolling Interest 27 43 (16 ) (37.2 )% Net Income Attributable to CONSOL Energy Inc. Shareholders $ 540 $ 442 $ 98 22.2 % Net income attributable to CONSOL Energy shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $540 million compared to $442 million in the year ended December 31, 2008. Net income attributable to CONSOL Energy shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2009 increased in comparison to the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily due to: Higher average thermal coal sales prices; Higher gas sales volumes; and Lower average cost per unit of gas sold. Improvements in net income attributable to CONSOL Energy shareholders were offset, in part, by the following items: Lower volume of thermal and metallurgical coal sold; Lower average sales prices for gas volumes sold; Lower average sales prices for metallurgical tons sold; Higher average cost per ton of coal sold; 63 Table of Contents Business interruption insurance settlement of $50 million recognized in the year ended December 31, 2008 related to the Buchanan roof collapse incident; and Black lung excise tax refunds of $56 million recognized in the year ended December 31, 2008. See discussion below for additional details of the changes in net income in the year to year comparison. The cost per unit below is not necessarily indicative of unit costs in the future. Revenue Revenue and other income decreased due to the following items: 2009 2008 DollarVariance PercentageChange Sales: Produced Coal Thermal $ 3,148 $ 2,669 $ 479 17.9 % Produced Coal Metallurgical 223 398 (175 ) (44.0 )% Purchased Coal 39 118 (79 ) (66.9 )% Produced Gas 629 681 (52 ) (7.6 )% Industrial Supplies 195 196 (1 ) (0.5 )% Other 78 120 (42 ) (35.0 )% Total Sales Outside 4,312 4,182 130 3.1 % Gas Royalty Interest 41 79 (38 ) (48.1 )% Purchased Gas 7 8 (1 ) (12.5 )% Freight Revenue 148 217 (69 ) (31.8 )% Other Income 113 166 (53 ) (31.9 )% Total Revenue and Other Income $ 4,621 $ 4,652 $ (31 ) (0.7 )% The increase in company produced thermal coal sales revenue during the year ended December 31, 2009 was due to the higher average price per ton sold, offset, in part, by lower sales volumes of company produced thermal coal sold. 2009 2008 Variance PercentageChange Produced Thermal Tons Sold (in millions) 55.1 61.4 (6.3 ) (10.3 )% Average Sales Price Per Thermal Ton $ 57.11 $ 43.44 $ 13.67 31.5 % The increase in average sales price in the year to year comparison primarily reflects higher prices negotiated in previous periods when there was a significant increase in the global demand for coal. Sales of company produced coal shipments decreased in the current period due to delivery deferments of Central and Northern Appalachian coals. Coal consumption by the electric power sector continued to decline during the year. In the year to year comparison of the thermal coal changes, the increased pricing improved sales income by $753 million. This was partially offset by lower thermal tons sold which reduced sales income by approximately $274 million dollars. The decrease in company produced metallurgical coal sales revenue during the year ended December 31, 2009 was due to the lower average price per ton sold and lower sales volumes of company produced metallurgical coal sold. 2009 2008 Variance PercentageChange Produced Metallurgical Tons Sold (in millions) 2.3 2.9 (0.6 ) (20.7 )% Average Sales Price Per Metallurgical Ton $ 96.68 $ 136.92 $ (40.24 ) (29.4 )% 64 Table of Contents The decrease in average sales price for metallurgical coal in the year to year comparison reflects lower prices realized due to a downturn in the domestic and international steel business and the deferment of previously negotiated pricing into future periods. Sales of company produced metallurgical coal decreased in the current period due to a downturn in the domestic and international steel business resulting in reduced demand for metallurgical coal and the idling of the Buchanan Mine from March 1, 2009 to August 7, 2009. In the year to year comparison of metallurgical coal changes, the decreased pricing impaired sales income by $93 million. Also, lower metallurgical tons sold impaired sales income by approximately $82 million dollars. Purchased coal sales consist of revenues from processing third party coal in our preparation plants for blending purposes to meet customer coal specifications, coal purchased from third parties and sold directly to our customers and revenues from processing third party coal in our preparation plants. The decrease of $79 million in purchased coal sales revenue was primarily due to a decrease in demand in the year to year comparison, offset, in part, by higher sales prices. The decrease of $52 million in produced gas sales revenue in the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the year ended December 31, 2008 was due to lower average sales price per thousand cubic feet sold, offset, in part, by higher sales volumes. 2009 2008 Variance PercentageChange Produced Gas Sales Volume (in billion cubic feet) 93.6 75.3 18.3 24.3 % Average Sales Price Per thousand cubic feet $ 6.72 $ 9.04 $ (2.32 ) (25.7 )% Sales volumes increased as a result of additional wells coming online from our on going drilling program. The decrease in average sales price is the result of the general market price decreases in the year to year comparison. The general market price decline was offset, in part, by the various gas swap transactions entered into by CNX Gas. These gas swap transactions qualify as financial cash flow hedges that exist parallel to the underlying physical transactions. These financial hedges represented approximately 51.6 billion cubic feet of our produced gas sales volumes for the year ended December 31, 2009 at an average price of $8.76 per thousand cubic feet. In the year ended December 31, 2008, these financial hedges represented approximately 43.4 billion cubic feet at an average price of $9.25 per thousand cubic feet. The $1 million decrease in revenues from the sale of industrial supplies was primarily due to lower sales volumes. Economic conditions had a negative impact on major customers, particularly those serving the auto and housing markets. The $42 million decrease in other sales was attributable to decreased revenues from barge towing and terminal services. The decrease is related to lower tonnage moved by the barge towing and terminal services in the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the year ended December 31, 2008. Lower tonnage moved reflects the weak economic environment which has reduced the volume of products moved on the rivers in the year ended December 31, 2009. Royalty interest gas sales represent the revenues related to the portion of production belonging to royalty interest owners sold by CNX Gas on their behalf. The decrease in market prices, contractual differences among leases, and the mix of average and index prices used in calculating royalties contributed to the year to year change. 2009 2008 Variance PercentageChange Gas Royalty Interest Sales Volumes (in billion cubic feet) 9.8 8.5 1.3 15.3 % Average Sales Price Per thousand cubic feet $ 4.17 $ 9.32 $ (5.15 ) (55.3 )% 65 Table of Contents Purchased gas sales volumes represent volumes of gas, sold at market prices, that were purchased from third party producers. 2009 2008 Variance PercentageChange Purchased Gas Sales Volumes (in billion cubic feet) 1.6 1.0 0.6 60.0 % Average Sales Price Per thousand cubic feet $ 4.46 $ 8.76 $ (4.30 ) (49.1 )% Freight revenue is based on weight of coal shipped, negotiated freight rates and method of transportation (i.e., rail, barge, truck, etc.) used for the customers to which CONSOL Energy contractually provides transportation services. Freight revenue is the amount billed to customers for transportation costs incurred. Freight revenue has decreased $69 million in 2009 primarily due to lower domestic shipments to customers for whom CONSOL Energy pays the freight and then passes on the cost to the customer. Freight revenue also decreased due to fewer export sales made to customers whom CONSOL Energy pays the ocean going freight and then passes the cost to the customer. Other income consists of interest income, gain or loss on the disposition of assets, equity in earnings of affiliates, service income, royalty income and miscellaneous income. 2009 2008 DollarVariance PercentageChange Business interruption proceeds $ $ 50 $ (50 ) (100.0 )% Gain on sale of assets 15 23 (8 ) (34.8 )% Contract towing 5 11 (6 ) (54.5 )% Proceeds from relinquishment of mining rights 6 (6 ) (100.0 )% Royalty income 17 21 (4 ) (19.0 )% Recognition of unrealized gains on options 2 2 100.0 % Interest income 5 2 3 150.0 % Equity in earnings of affiliates 16 11 5 45.5 % Contract settlement 12 12 100.0 % Other miscellaneous 41 42 (1 ) (2.4 )% Total other income $ 113 $ 166 $ (53 ) (31.9 )% In March 2008, CONSOL Energy received notice from its insurance carriers that $50 million would be paid as final settlement of the insurance claim related to the July 2007 Buchanan Mine incident that idled the mine. The $50 million represented business interruption coverage which was recognized in other income; the coal segment recognized $42 million and the gas segment recognized $8 million. The final settlement brought the total amount recovered from insurance carriers to $75 million, the maximum allowed per covered event. Gain on sale of assets decreased $8 million in the year to year comparison due to 2008 including the sale of an idled facility which included the transfer of the mine closing liabilities to the buyer. This transaction resulted in $8 million pre tax gain in 2008. Both periods also include various miscellaneous transactions, none of which were individually material. Contract towing revenue has decreased approximately $6 million due primarily to the general slow down in the economy negatively impacting the volume of material being shipped via river transportation. The year ended December 31, 2008 includes $6 million of proceeds received from a third party in order for CONSOL Energy to relinquish the mining of certain in place coal reserves. Royalty income decreased $4 million primarily due to lower volumes of CONSOL Energy coal produced by third parties. 66 Table of Contents In 2009, mark to market adjustments for free standing coal sales options resulted in approximately a $2 million reversal of previously recognized unrealized losses. The reversal of losses was due to the options expiring during the year ended December 31, 2009. Interest income increased $3 million primarily due to higher average cash balances available to invest in the year to year comparison. Equity in earnings of affiliates increased $5 million in the year ended December 31, 2009 due to various transactions entered into by our equity affiliates throughout both periods, none of which were individually material. In 2009, $12 million of income was recognized related to contracts with certain customers that were unable to take delivery of previously contracted coal tonnage. These customers agreed to buy out their contracts in order to release them from the requirement of taking delivery of previously committed tons. Other miscellaneous income decreased $1 million in the year to year comparison due to various miscellaneous transactions that occurred throughout both periods, none of which were individually material. Costs Cost of goods sold and other charges decreased due to the following: 2009 2008 DollarVariance PercentageChange Cost of Goods Sold and Other Charges Produced Coal $ 1,968 2,031 $ (63 ) (3.1 )% Purchased Coal 46 124 (78 ) (62.9 )% Produced Gas 204 184 20 10.9 % Industrial Supplies 185 186 (1 ) (0.5 )% Closed and Idle Mines 114 78 36 46.2 % Other 240 240 Total Cost of Goods Sold and Other Charges Outside 2,757 2,843 (86 ) (3.0 )% Gas Royalty Interest 32 74 (42 ) (56.8 )% Purchased Gas 6 8 (2 ) (25.0 )% Total Cost of Goods Sold $ 2,795 2,925 $ (130 ) (4.4 )% Produced coal cost of goods sold and other charges decreased primarily due to lower sales volumes, offset, in part, by an 8.6% increase in average unit cost per ton sold. 2009 2008 Variance PercentageChange Produced Tons Sold (in millions) 57.4 64.3 (6.9 ) (10.7 )% Average Cost of Goods Sold and Other Charges per Ton $ 34.27 $ 31.57 $ 2.70 8.6 % Average cost of goods sold and other charges per unit increased in the year to year comparison primarily due to an increase in average unit costs related to the following items: In general, average cost of goods sold per unit has increased due to the reduced amount of tons sold from CONSOL Energy mines. The reduction in tons sold reflects the weak economic environment which has affected electricity generation and correspondingly the demand for coal. Fixed costs incurred at our mining operations are now spread over fewer tons sold, which has negatively impacted average unit costs. Supply costs have increased $1.39 per ton sold related to higher supply and maintenance costs at several locations. Additional supply and maintenance projects were related to additional preparation 67 Table of Contents plant maintenance, additional belt advancement costs, additional mining equipment maintenance, additional roof support, additional use of contract labor to complete belt projects and additional water handling costs. These increased supply and maintenance costs were offset, in part, by fewer seals being constructed in previously mined areas. Average unit costs of supplies were also impacted by lower sales tons in the year to year comparison. Labor costs have increased $0.91 per ton sold due to the effects of wage increases at the union and non union mines. These contracts call for specified hourly wage increases in each year of the contract. The average increase in unit cost for labor was also impacted by lower sales volumes due to the economic environment as discussed above. United Mine Workers of America (UMWA) health and retirement plan expenses have increased $0.30 per ton sold primarily due to the effects of the 2007 labor contract that require additional contributions to be made into employee benefit funds. The contribution increase over 2007 was $0.42 per United Mine Worker of America hour worked. The average increase in unit costs for health and retirement plans was also impacted by lower sales tons in the year to year comparison. Subsidence cost increased $0.30 per ton sold primarily due to the year ended December 31, 2009 including additional expenses related to work to be performed on streams that have been impacted by underground mining in Pennsylvania. The average increase in unit costs for subsidence was also impacted by lower sales tons in the year to year comparison. Other costs per unit on a net basis have increased $0.05 per ton sold due to various transactions that have occurred throughout both periods, none of which were individually material. These increases in costs were offset, in part, by the following decrease: Contract Mining Fees decreased $0.25 per ton sold due to lower contractor usage in the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the year ended December 31, 2008. Purchased coal cost of goods sold consists of costs from processing purchased coal in our preparation plants for blending purposes to meet customer coal specifications, coal purchased and sold directly to the customer and costs for processing third party coal in our preparation plants. The decrease of $78 million in purchased coal cost of goods sold and other charges in 2009 was primarily due to lower volumes purchased. Gas cost of goods sold and other charges increased primarily due to a 24.3% increase in volumes of produced gas sold, offset, in part, by lower average cost per unit sold. 2009 2008 Variance PercentageChange Produced Gas Sales Volumes (in billion cubic feet) 93.6 75.3 18.3 24.3 % Average Cost per thousand cubic feet $ 2.36 $ 2.51 $ (0.15 ) (6.0 )% Average costs per unit decreased in the year ended December 31, 2009 as a result of several factors: Well service costs have decreased by $0.07 per thousand cubic feet due to lower contract service rig hours needed as a result of less pump maintenance being required in 2009. Gob collection charges were $0.04 per thousand cubic feet lower in the year to year comparison. Lower gob collection charges per unit were primarily due to the Buchanan longwall being idled throughout some of 2009. Compression expenses decreased $0.03 per thousand cubic feet primarily due to a reduction in the number of compressors utilized in the Northern Appalachian production field. Due to the slow down in the drilling program in Northern Appalachia, rented compressors have been returned to more appropriately design the gathering fields for existing needs. 68 Table of Contents Other costs have decreased $0.22 per thousand cubic feet primarily due to the impact of additional volumes of gas sold during the year ended December 31, 2009. Dollars spent remained consistent in the year to year comparisons, therefore additional volumes decreased the unit costs. These decreases in unit costs were offset, in part, by the following: Idle drilling costs were $0.09 per thousand cubic feet related to idling various drilling rigs throughout the company. Some of CNX Gas drilling contracts require minimum payments be made to the contracting party when drilling rigs are not being used. The CNX Gas drilling program has been slowed down pending a change in the economic environment. These charges resulted in an increase to costs. Firm transportation costs increased $0.08 per thousand cubic feet primarily due to acquiring additional capacity in the Northern Appalachian region after December 31, 2008. Power and fuel costs increased $0.04 per thousand cubic feet due to a power rate increase which occurred after December 31, 2008. Also, the increase was due to additional compressors being placed in service after December 31, 2008 along the existing gathering system in the Central Appalachian production field in order to flow the increasing gas volumes more efficiently. Industrial supplies cost of goods sold decreased $1 million primarily due to decreased sales volumes. Closed and idle mine cost of goods sold increased approximately $36 million in 2009 compared to 2008. Approximately $38 million of increased expenses were incurred at Mine 84 to pull underground equipment out of the mine in preparation of idling and to construct seals to close sections of the underground mine works so that the mine can be maintained in a more efficient manner. Increases were also attributable to the idled Shoemaker Mine incurring approximately $11 million of additional expenses in the current period related to the continued maintenance of the mine in an idled status. Closed and idle mine cost of goods sold also increased $7 million primarily due to the periodic idling of various other locations throughout 2009 due to the economic environment. These increases were offset, in part, by reductions of $20 million related to mine closing, reclamation and water treatment liabilities. These decreases primarily related to adjustments in engineering estimates of water quality and flows, as well as changes in the credit adjusted risk free interest rates. Other cost of goods sold remained consistent due to the following items: 2009 2008 DollarVariance PercentageChange Incentive compensation $ 51 $ 33 $ 18 54.5 % Legal settlement 15 15 100.0 % Cease use expense 14 14 100.0 % Dry hole and other costs 9 1 8 800.0 % Stock based compensation 38 34 4 11.8 % Severance expense 4 4 100.0 % Ward superfund site 3 7 (4 ) (57.1 )% Sales contract buyout 13 19 (6 ) (31.6 )% Profit splits 15 (15 ) (100.0 )% Buchanan roof collapse 17 (17 ) (100.0 )% Terminal/River operations 59 81 (22 ) (27.2 )% Miscellaneous other 34 33 1 3.0 % Other cost of goods sold and other charges $ 240 $ 240 $ The incentive compensation program is designed to increase compensation to eligible employees when CONSOL Energy reaches predetermined production, safety and cost targets and the employees reach predetermined performance targets. Incentive compensation expense increased $18 million in 2009 due to exceeding the predetermined targets. 69 Table of Contents Legal settlement of $15 million represents the amount expensed for the settlement of the Levisa Action and the Pobst/Combs Action. Approximately $14 million of cease use expense relates to the relocation of the CONSOL Energy and CNX Gas corporate office and the cease use of the old facilities. Accordingly, a liability for the present value of the remaining lease payments for the previous corporate offices has been recognized in Cost of Goods Sold and Other Charges and resulted in $14 million of expense. Dry hole and other costs of $9 million were incurred by the gas segment in the year ended December 31, 2009. Dry hole and other costs were incurred in 2009 related to the determination that certain areas where an exploration well was drilled would not be economical to pursue. The costs for the exploration well, which were previously capitalized, were expensed. Other costs include costs associated with certain leased property that will no longer be held due to the determination that the area would not be economical to pursue. Also, costs related to particular permits for areas where management has determined that no drilling will take place have been expensed. Stock based compensation expense increased $4 million in the year to year comparison primarily due to $3 million of fair value adjustments associated with the exchange offer to convert CNX Gas performance share units into CONSOL restricted stock units. The year ended December 31, 2009 also includes additional expense due to expanding the stock based compensation program to include additional employees. The year ended December 31, 2008 included a reduction to expense related to the CNX Gas performance share units to reflect the lower market price of CNX Gas shares at December 31, 2008 compared to its peer group. The CNX Gas performance share units were replaced with a CONSOL Energy restricted stock units in 2009. Severance pay relates to the administrative staff reductions in force and resulted in $4 million of expense in 2009. Ward transformer superfund site expense was $4 million lower in the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the year ended December 31, 2008. The expense in each period represents CONSOL Energys portion of the latest estimate of cost to remediate the site. See Note 24 Commitments and Contingencies of Item 8 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail. The year ended December 31, 2008 includes adjustments related to CONSOL Energy agreements to buy out coal sales contracts with several customers in order to release tons committed under lower priced contracts for sale to other customers at higher prices. The year ended December 31, 2009 includes fewer customer buyouts. In the year ended December 31, 2008, cost of goods sold and other charges includes $15 million related to contracts with certain customers who were unable to take delivery of previously contracted coal tonnage. These customers agreed to allow CONSOL Energy to sell the released tonnage, but required CONSOL Energy to split the incremental sales price over the original contract sales price evenly with them. The $15 million represents the additional sales price received for the tonnage sold that is owed to the original customer. In July 2007, production at the Buchanan Mine was suspended after several roof falls in previously mined areas damaged some of the ventilation controls inside the mine, requiring a general evacuation of the mine. In 2008, $17 million of cost of goods sold and other charges related to the Buchanan Mine event were incurred. Terminal/River operation charges have decreased approximately $22 million in the year to year comparison due to lower tonnage moved and lower employee counts throughout the year ended December 31, 2009. Miscellaneous other cost of goods sold and other charges increased $1 million due to various transactions throughout both years, none of which were individually material. 70 Table of Contents Royalty interest gas sales represent the revenues related to the portion of production belonging to royalty interest owners sold by CNX Gas on their behalf. The decrease in market prices, contractual differences among leases, and the mix of average and index prices used in calculating royalties contributed to the year to year change. 2009 2008 Variance PercentageChange Gas Royalty Interest Sales Volumes (in billion cubic feet) 9.8 8.5 1.3 15.3 % Average Cost Per thousand cubic feet $ 3.30 $ 8.69 $ (5.39 ) (62.0 )% Purchased gas costs represent volumes of gas purchased from third party producers that we sell at market prices. Purchased gas cost volumes also reflect the impact of pipeline imbalances. The decrease in cost of goods sold and other charges related to purchased gas represents overall price changes and contractual differences among customers in the year to year comparison. 2009 2008 Variance PercentageChange Purchased Gas Cost Volumes (in billion cubic feet) 1.7 1.0 0.7 70.0 % Average Cost Per thousand cubic feet $ 3.75 $ 8.13 $ (4.38 ) (53.9 )% Freight expense is based on weight of coal shipped, negotiated freight rates and method of transportation (i.e., rail, barge, truck, etc.) used for the customers to which CONSOL Energy contractually provides transportation services. Freight expense is the amount billed to customers for transportation costs incurred. Freight expense has decreased $69 million in the year ended December 31, 2009 primarily due to lower domestic shipments to customers whom CONSOL Energy pays the freight and then passes on the cost to the customer. Freight revenue also decreased due to fewer export sales made to customers whom CONSOL Energy pays the ocean going freight and then passes the cost to the customer. Selling, general and administrative costs have increased due to the following items: 2009 2008 DollarVariance PercentageChange Rentals $ 9 $ 3 $ 6 200.0 % Wages, salaries and related benefits 63 61 2 3.3 % Association/charitable contributions 12 12 Advertising and promotion 5 6 (1 ) (16.7 )% Professional, consulting and other purchased services 26 27 (1 ) (3.7 )% Other 17 16 1 6.3 % Total Selling, General and Administrative $ 132 $ 125 $ 7 5.6 % Rentals have increased $6 million primarily due to rent expense related to the new CONSOL Energy headquarters, offset, in part, by reduced rent related to the previous CONSOL Energy and CNX Gas corporate office space that is no longer used. Wages, salaries and related benefits have increased approximately $2 million primarily due to annual salary increases and additional recruiting expenses. Association assessments and charitable contributions have remained consistent in the year to year comparison. Advertising and promotion expenses have decreased $1 million in the year to year comparison due to the timing of various campaigns. 71 Table of Contents Costs of professional, consulting and other purchased services have decreased $1 million related to various corporate initiatives, none of which are individually material. Other selling, general and administrative costs increased $1 million related to various transactions none of which are individually material. Depreciation, depletion and amortization increased due to the following items: 2009 2008 DollarVariance PercentageChange Coal $ 307 $ 299 $ 8 2.7 % Gas: Production 86 51 35 68.6 % Gathering 21 19 2 10.5 % Total Gas 107 70 37 52.9 % Other 23 21 2 9.5 % Total Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization $ 437 $ 390 $ 47 12.1 % The $8 million increase in coal depreciation, depletion and amortization was primarily attributable to assets placed in service during 2009. The increase in gas production depreciation, depletion and amortization was primarily due to increased volumes produced, combined with an increase in the units of production rates for the Northern Appalachian region in the year to year comparison. These rates increased due to the higher proportion of capital assets placed in service versus the proportion of proved developed reserve additions. These rates are generally calculated using the net book value of assets at the end of the previous year divided by either proved or proved developed reserves. Production asset depreciation also increased due to the recalculation of rates in 2009 related to the Marcellus Shale wells and various other assets being placed in service during 2009. Gas gathering depreciation, depletion and amortization is recorded using the straight line method and increased $2 million in the year to year comparison due to various assets being placed in service during 2009. Other depreciation increased $2 million in the year to year comparison due to various assets being placed in service during 2009, none of which were individually material. Interest expense decreased in the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the year ended December 31, 2008 due to the following items: 2009 2008 DollarVariance PercentageChange Revolver $ 6 $ 11 $ (5 ) (45.5 )% Interest on unrecognized tax benefits 2 2 Capitalized leases 6 6 Long term secured notes 27 27 Other (9 ) (10 ) 1 (10.0 )% Total Interest Expense $ 32 $ 36 $ (4 ) (11.1 )% Revolver interest expense is related to the amounts drawn on the credit facility. The decrease is related to lower interest rates on the facility in 2009 compared to 2008, offset, in part, by higher average amounts drawn in 2009. Interest on unrecognized tax benefits, capitalize leases and long term secured notes remained consistent in the year to year comparison. 72 Table of Contents Other interest expense increased $1 million in the year to year comparison due to various transactions that occurred throughout both periods, none of which were individually material. Taxes other than income remained consistent in the year to year comparison. 2009 2008 DollarVariance PercentageChange Production taxes: Coal $ 177 $ 169 $ 8 4.7 % Gas 6 20 (14 ) (70.0 )% Total Production Taxes 183 189 (6 ) (3.2 )% Other taxes: Coal 87 84 3 3.6 % Gas 7 6 1 16.7 % Other 13 11 2 18.2 % Total Other Taxes 107 101 6 5.9 % Total Taxes Other Than Income $ 290 $ 290 $ Increased coal production taxes are primarily due to higher severance taxes attributable to the increase in average sales price for produced coal. These improvements were offset, in part, by lower coal production volumes in the year to year comparison. Gas production taxes decreased $14 million due to lower severance taxes attributable to lower average sales prices for gas, offset, in part, by higher gas sales volumes. Lower severance taxes in the year to year comparison are also related to a revised estimate of a pending litigation settlement. Other coal taxes have increased approximately $3 million primarily due to higher property taxes related to reassessments on property primarily in West Virginia and Pennsylvania owned by CONSOL Energy. The increase was also due to a reduction in the tax credit generated by production in the state of Virginia as a result of the idling of the longwall at the Buchanan Mine which reduced production during a portion of 2009. Other gas taxes increased $1 million due to various transactions that occurred throughout both periods, none of which were individually material. Other taxes have increased $2 million in the year to year comparison due to various transactions that occurred throughout both periods, none of which were individually material. In 2008, $56 million of refunds related to black lung excise taxes were recognized. The refunds related to the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (the EESA Act) which was signed into law on October 3, 2008. The EESA Act contained a section that authorized certain coal producers and exporters who had filed a black lung excise tax (BLET) return on or after October 1, 1990, to request a refund of the BLET paid on export sales. The EESA Act required the U.S. Treasury to refund an amount equal to the BLET erroneously paid on export sales in prior years along with interest computed at the statutory rates applicable to overpayments. CONSOL Energy recognized, and subsequently received, approximately $56 million of BLET refunds. Approximately $1 million of additional interest income was recognized in 2009 to adjust estimated interest on these claims to the amount of interest received.

Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2008 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2007 Net Income Net income changed primarily due to the following items (table in millions): 2008 2007 DollarVariance PercentageChange Sales Outside $ 4,182 $ 3,324 $ 858 25.8 % Sales Purchased Gas 8 8 Sales Gas Royalty Interest 79 47 32 68.1 % Freight Outside 217 187 30 16.0 % Other Income 166 196 (30 ) (15.3 )% Total Revenue and Other Income 4,652 3,762 890 23.7 % Coal Cost of Goods Sold and Other and Purchased Charges 2,843 2,351 492 20.9 % Purchased Gas Costs 8 7 1 14.3 % Gas Royalty Interest Costs 74 40 34 85.0 % Total Cost of Goods Sold 2,925 2,398 527 22.0 % Freight Expense 217 187 30 16.0 % Selling, General and Administrative Expense 125 109 16 14.7 % Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization 390 325 65 20.0 % Interest Expense 36 31 5 16.1 % Black Lung Excise Tax Refund (56 ) 24 (80 ) (333.3 )% Taxes Other Than Income 290 259 31 12.0 % Total Costs 3,927 3,333 594 17.8 % Earnings Before Income Taxes and Minority Interest 725 429 296 69.0 % Income Tax Expense 240 136 104 76.5 % Earnings Before Minority Interest 485 293 192 65.5 % Minority Interest 43 25 18 72.0 % Net Income $ 442 $ 268 $ 174 64.9 % CONSOL Energy had net income of $442 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to $268 million in the year ended December 31, 2007. Net income for 2008 increased in comparison to 2007 due to: higher average prices received for both coal and gas; higher volumes of gas sold; 2007 included a total of approximately $94 million of pre tax expenses, net of insurance recoveries, related to the Buchanan Mine incident that occurred in July 2007 which idled the mine through March 2008; the 2008 period includes approximately $28.6 million of pre tax income related to this incident; Black Lung excise tax refund receivable recognized for taxes paid in 1991 1993 due to legislation passed in October 2008; and 74 Table of Contents Receivable write off of $24 million in 2007 related to the Supreme Court decision which rendered the Black Lung Excise Tax receivable for 1991 1993 uncollectible. These increases in net income were offset, in part, by: an asset exchange and an asset sale in 2007 that resulted in pretax income of approximately $100 million and net income of approximately $59 million; increased unit cost of goods sold and other charges for both coal and gas. See below for a more detailed description of variances noted. The cost per unit below is not necessarily indicative of unit costs in the future. Revenue Revenue and other income increased due to the following items: 2008 2007 DollarVariance PercentageChange Sales: Produced Coal $ 3,067 $ 2,640 $ 427 16.2 % Purchased Coal 118 38 80 210.5 % Produced Gas 681 410 271 66.1 % Industrial Supplies 196 147 49 33.3 % Other 120 89 31 34.8 % Total Sales Outside 4,182 3,324 858 25.8 % Gas Royalty Interest 79 47 32 68.1 % Purchased Gas 8 8 Freight Revenue 217 187 30 16.0 % Other Income 166 196 (30 ) (15.3 )% Total Revenue and Other Income $ 4,652 $ 3,762 $ 890 23.7 % The increase in company produced coal sales revenue during 2008 was due to higher average prices, offset, in part, by slightly lower volumes of produced coal sold. 2008 2007 Variance PercentageChange Produced Tons Sold (in millions) 64.3 64.8 (0.5 ) (0.8 )% Average Sales Price Per Ton $ 47.66 $ 40.74 $ 6.92 17.0 % The increase year to year in the average sales prices of coal was the result of global coal fundamentals being more favorable in 2008. Concerns regarding the adequacy of global supplies of coal had strengthened both the international and domestic coal prices and had increased the opportunity for U.S. producers to increase exports of coal. Sales tons were slightly lower in the year to year comparison. Purchased coal sales consist of revenues from processing third party coal in our preparation plants for blending purposes to meet customer coal specifications, coal purchased from third parties and sold directly to our customers and revenues from processing third party coal in our preparation plants. The increase of $80 million in company purchased coal sales revenue was primarily due to an increase in volumes of purchased coal sold in the year to year comparison. 75 Table of Contents The increase in produced gas sales revenue in 2008 compared to 2007 was primarily due to higher average sales prices and higher volumes of gas sold. 2008 2007 Variance PercentageChange Produced Gas Sales Volumes (in billion cubic feet) 75.7 57.1 18.6 32.6 % Average Sales Price Per thousand cubic feet $ 9.00 $ 7.18 $ 1.82 25.3 % The increase in average sales price is the result of CNX Gas, an 83.3% subsidiary at December 31, 2008, realizing general market price increases in the year to year comparison. CNX Gas periodically enters into various gas swap transactions that qualify as financial cash flow hedges. These gas swap transactions exist parallel to the underlying physical transactions. These financial hedges represented approximately 43.4 billion cubic feet of our produced gas sales volumes for the year ended December 31, 2008 at an average price of $9.25 per thousand cubic feet. In the prior year, these financial hedges represented approximately 18.4 billion cubic feet at an average price of $8.01 per thousand cubic feet. Sales volumes increased as a result of additional wells coming online from our on going drilling program. Also, prior year sales volumes were impacted by the deferral of production at the Buchanan Mine. The $49 million increase in revenues from the sale of industrial supplies was primarily due to the July 2007 acquisition of Piping & Equipment, Inc. in addition to an overall increase in sales volumes and higher sales prices. The $31 million increase in other sales was attributable to increased revenues from barge towing and terminal services. The increase was primarily related to revenue generated from the barge towing operations having higher average rates for services rendered compared to the prior year. The barge towing operations have also increased thru put tons and delivered tons in 2008. Increases in other sales revenues were also attributable to higher terminal services as a result of additional thru put tons in 2008. The higher terminal revenues were offset, in part, due to services being suspended for approximately one month due to maintenance needed on a pier in Baltimore. 2008 2007 Variance PercentageChange Gas Royalty Interest Sales Volumes (in billion cubic feet) 8.5 7.2 1.3 18.1 % Average Sales Price Per thousand cubic feet $ 9.32 $ 6.44 $ 2.88 44.7 % Gas royalty interest sales volumes represent the revenues related to the portion of production belonging to royalty interest owners sold by CNX Gas on their behalf. The increase in market prices, contractual differences among leases and the mix of average and index prices used in calculating royalties contributed to the year to year change. 2008 2007 Variance PercentageChange Purchased Sales Volumes (in billion cubic feet) 1.0 1.1 (0.1 ) (9.1 )% Average Sales Price Per thousand cubic feet $ 8.76 $ 7.19 $ 1.57 21.8 % Purchased gas sales volumes represent volumes of gas that were sold at market prices that were purchased from third party producers, less gathering fees. Freight revenue is based on weight of coal shipped, negotiated freight rates and method of transportation (i.e., rail, barge, truck, etc.) used for the customers to which CONSOL Energy contractually provides transportation services. Freight revenue is the amount billed to customers for transportation costs incurred. Freight revenue has increased $30 million in 2008 due primarily to freight associated with AMVEST, which was acquired on July 31, 2007. Freight revenue has also increased due to higher freight rates being charged for 76 Table of Contents exported tons. These increases in freight revenue were offset, in part, by lower export tons shipped in 2008 compared to 2007. There were 7.0 million tons and 7.6 million tons of coal exported by CONSOL Energy in 2008 and 2007, respectively. Other income consists of interest income, gain or loss on the disposition of assets, equity in earnings of affiliates, service income, royalty income, derivative gains and losses, rental income and miscellaneous income. 2008 2007 DollarVariance PercentageChange Gain on sale of assets $ 23 $ 112 $ (89 ) (79.5 )% Interest income 2 13 (11 ) (84.6 )% Litigation settlement 1 5 (4 ) (80.0 )% Equity in earnings of affiliates 11 7 4 57.1 % Railroad spur income 4 1 3 300.0 % Proceeds from relinquishment of mining rights 6 6 100.0 % Royalty income 21 14 7 50.0 % Contract towing 11 3 8 266.7 % Business interruption proceeds 50 10 40 400.0 % Other miscellaneous 37 31 6 19.4 % Total other income $ 166 $ 196 $ (30 ) (15.3 )% Gain on sale of assets decreased $89 million in the year to year comparison primarily due to two transactions that occurred in 2007. In June 2007, CONSOL Energy, through our 83.3% owned subsidiary, CNX Gas, exchanged certain coal assets in Northern Appalachia to Peabody Energy for coalbed methane and gas rights, which resulted in a pretax gain of $50 million. Also, in June 2007, CONSOL Energy, through a subsidiary, sold the rights to certain western Kentucky coal in the Illinois Basin to Alliance Resource Partners, L.P. for $53 million. This transaction also resulted in a pretax gain of approximately $50 million. The 2008 period reflects a sale of an idled facility which included the transfer of the mine closing liabilities to the buyer. This transaction resulted in a pretax gain of approximately $8 million. There was also a $3 million increase in the year to year comparison due to various transactions that occurred throughout both periods, none of which were individually material. Interest income decreased $11 million in the year to year comparison due to lower cash balances throughout 2008 compared to 2007. Lower cash balances were primarily the result of the purchase price paid for the June 2008 acquisition of the remaining interest in Knox Energy, LLC, the July acquisition of several leases and gas wells from KIS Oil & Gas, Inc., the July 31, 2007 acquisition of AMVEST, the June 2007 purchase of certain coalbed methane and gas rights from Peabody Energy and the July 2007 Buchanan Mine incident. A litigation settlement with a coal customer in 2007 resulted in $5 million of income. A litigation settlement with a royalty holder resulted in $1 million of income in 2008. Equity in earnings of affiliates increased $4 million related to our interest in a specialty contracting company, our interest in a real estate development company and our interest in a coal mining company. These increases were offset, in part, by the June 2008 acquisition of our remaining interest in Knox Energy, LLC. Income related to a railroad spur acquired with the July 2007 acquisition of AMVEST increased $3 million. This income was due to reimbursements from the rail carrier for maintenance completed on the spur during the year. The income is offset in its entirety with the related expenses reflected in cost of goods sold and other charges. In 2008, approximately $6 million was received from a third party in order for CONSOL Energy to relinquish the mining of certain in place coal reserves. 77 Table of Contents Royalty income increased $7 million in the year to year comparison due to production of CONSOL Energy coal by a third party commencing in August 2007. Royalties have also increased due to the higher sales price of coal sold throughout 2008 compared to 2007. The $8 million increase in contract towing services represents river towing services for third parties which CONSOL Energy now provides. These services were minimal in 2007. In 2008, CONSOL Energy received $50 million as final settlement of the insurance claim related to the July 2007 Buchanan Mine incident, which idled the mine from July 2007 to mid March 2008. The $50 million represents business interruption coverage which was recognized in other income; the coal segment recognized $42 million and the gas segment recognized $8 million. CONSOL Energy had received $10 million of business interruption proceeds related to this incident in 2007; the coal segment recognized $8 million and the gas segment recognized $2 million. In 2007, $15 million was also received from the insurance carrier for reimbursement of fire brigade costs. This was recognized as a reduction of cost of goods sold and other charges as discussed below. The final settlement brought the total amount recovered from insurance carriers to $75 million, the maximum allowed per covered event. All proceeds from this insurance claim have been received. Other miscellaneous income increased $6 million in the year to year comparison due to various miscellaneous transactions that occurred throughout both years, none of which were individually material. Costs Cost of goods sold and other charges increased due to the following: 2008 2007 DollarVariance PercentageChange Cost of Goods Sold and Other Charges Produced Coal $ 2,031 $ 1,685 $ 346 20.5 % Purchased Coal 124 52 72 138.5 % Produced Gas 189 129 60 46.5 % Industrial Supplies 186 141 45 31.9 % Closed and Idle Mines 78 105 (27 ) (25.7 )% Other 235 239 (4 ) (1.7 )% Total Sales Outside 2,843 2,351 492 20.9 % Gas Royalty Interest 74 40 34 85.0 % Purchased Gas 8 7 1 14.3 % Total Cost of Goods Sold $ 2,925 $ 2,398 $ 527 22.0 % Increased cost of goods sold and other charges for company produced coal was due mainly to a higher average unit cost per ton sold, offset slightly by lower sales volumes. 2008 2007 Variance PercentageChange Produced Tons Sold (in millions) 64.3 64.8 (0.5 ) (0.8 )% Average Cost of Goods Sold and Other Charges Per Ton $ 31.57 $ 25.99 $ 5.58 21.5 % Average cost of goods sold and other charges increased in the year to year comparison primarily due to an increase in average unit costs related to the following items. Supply and maintenance costs have increased $2.77 per ton sold due to the following items: The increase in supply and maintenance costs reflects the change in the mix of sales tons in 2008 compared to 2007. Production tons from the Northern Appalachian underground mines decreased, while production from the Central Appalachian mines increased. This was primarily due to the July 31, 2007 acquisition of AMVEST and to the Buchanan Mine being idled for half of 2007. 78 Table of Contents The installation of higher grade seals and a higher number of seals being built in 2008 contributed to the increase in supply cost. The Mine Health and Safety Administration now requires higher strength seals to be constructed in order to isolate old, abandoned areas or previously sealed areas of the mine. At several locations, the installed seals are also required to be stronger. The increase in strength of seals was required to better protect the active sections of the underground mines from explosions, fires, or other situations that may occur within the sealed areas. The installation of higher strength seals and a higher number of seals being completed contributed to the increase in supply costs. Higher roof control costs are attributable to higher usage of products used in the mining process due to mining conditions and additional development work. Development work by continuous mining machines requires more roof support products than are used in the area of the mine where extraction is done using a longwall mining system. Roof control costs have also increased due to higher usage of pumpable cribs which are more expensive per unit than the standard wooden crib support. The pumpable crib is a canvas cylinder hung from the roof and extending to the floor into which concrete is pumped. Because the pumpable crib allows concrete to be pumped to the roof level, it eliminates the need to use wood shims to tighten the concrete to the roof. The pumpable crib is quicker to install, enhances safety due to the customized fit and minimizes the use of combustible products at underground locations. Also, roof control costs have increased due to approximately a 9% inflation rate related to roof control products. Gas well plugging/drilling costs related to the mining process have increased in 2008 compared to 2007. Gas well plugging expenses are related to plugging abandoned gas wells which CONSOL Energy does not own that are in front of the underground mining process. These wells have to be plugged in accordance with current safety regulations in order to mine through. CONSOL Energy has plugged more wells in 2008 than in 2007, which has contributed to increased supply costs. Gas well drilling ahead of mining, vents the gas from the coal seam which then allows for the longwall process to extract coal from a ventilated seam. CONSOL Energy drilled more wells ahead of mining in 2008 than in 2007 primarily due to Buchanan Mine being idled for half of 2007, as previously discussed. Higher fuel and explosive costs are due to the general increase of these commodities in the year to year comparison. The AMVEST surface locations were acquired on July 31, 2007. These surface locations are a large consumer of these products. Higher equipment maintenance costs are also attributable to the acquisition of AMVEST on July 31, 2007. These increases in supply costs were offset, in part, by expenses for self contained self rescuers which were purchased in 2007 in compliance with the Miner Act. There were fewer self contained self rescuers purchased in 2008. Labor costs have increased $1.14 per ton sold due to the effects of wage increases at the union and non union mines from labor contracts which began in 2007. These contracts call for specified hourly wage increases in each year of the contract. Labor also increased due to a higher number of employees in 2008 compared to 2007. This was somewhat due to the utilization of new work schedules requiring more manpower and operations trainees. Other postemployment benefit costs have increased $0.49 per ton sold primarily due to a change in the discount rate used to calculate the net periodic benefit costs. The weighted average discount rate for 2008 was 6.63% and was 6.00% in 2007. Combined Fund costs have increased $0.33 per ton sold due to the 2007 settlement with the Fund. In March 2007, CONSOL Energy entered into a settlement agreement with the Combined Fund that resolved all previous issues relating to the calculation of the payments. The total income, including interest, as a result of this settlement was approximately $33.4 million, of which approximately $28.1 million impacted cost of goods sold and other charges for produced coal. 79 Table of Contents Health & Retirement costs have increased $0.25 per ton sold due to additional contributions required to be made into employee benefit funds in 2008 compared to 2007 as a result of the five year labor agreement with the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA) that commenced January 1, 2007. The contribution increase over 2007 was $1.27 per UMWA hour worked. In transit costs have increased $0.25 per ton sold. In transit costs are costs to move coal from the point of extraction to the preparation plant in order for the coal to be processed for sale. These costs have increased due primarily to increased trucking expenses related to higher fuel costs as well as several locations operating in the current year that did not operate in 2007. Various other costs have increased $0.35 per ton sold due to various items that have occurred throughout both periods, none of which individually increased or decreased costs per ton sold. Purchased coal cost of goods sold consists of costs from processing purchased coal in our preparation plants for blending purposes to meet customer coal specifications, coal purchased and sold directly to customers and costs for processing third party coal in our preparation plants. The increase of $72 million in purchased coal cost of goods sold and other charges in 2008 was primarily due to higher volumes purchased. Gas cost of goods sold and other charges increased due primarily to a 32.6% increase in volumes of produced gas sold and an 11.1% increase in unit costs of goods sold and other charges. 2008 2007 Variance PercentageChange Produced Gas Sales Volumes (in billion cubic feet) 75.7 57.1 18.6 32.6 % Average Cost Per thousand cubic feet $ 2.50 $ 2.25 $ 0.25 11.1 % Average cost of goods sold and other charges per unit sold increased in the current year as a result of the following items: Fuel and power increased $0.08 per thousand cubic feet for both lifting and gathering combined. This increase was primarily due to additional compressors being placed in service along the existing gathering systems in order to flow gas more efficiently. Well closing costs increased $0.05 per thousand cubic feet in the year to year comparison. Well closing liabilities were adjusted in 2007 to reflect longer well lives than were previously estimated. This adjustment resulted in a reduction to expense. The adjustments to well closing liabilities were insignificant in 2008. Water disposal costs have increased $0.05 per thousand cubic feet due to additional volumes of water produced by CNX Gas wells in 2008 compared to 2007. Repairs and maintenance costs have increased $0.02 per thousand cubic feet due to higher material costs and higher contract labor costs. Compression expenses increased $0.03 per thousand cubic feet due to the additional compressors discussed above. Various other costs have also increased by $0.02 per thousand cubic feet for various items which occurred throughout both years, none of which were individually material. Industrial supplies cost of goods sold increased $45 million primarily due to the July 2007 acquisition of Piping & Equipment, Inc. The increase was also related to additional volumes of goods sold and higher costs of good sold throughout 2008. Closed and idle mine cost of goods sold decreased approximately $27 million in 2008 compared to 2007. The decrease was primarily due to $16 million of lower cost of goods sold and other charges at Shoemaker Mine. Shoemaker resumed longwall production in May 2008, but was idled throughout all of 2007. The decrease was 80 Table of Contents also related to updated engineering surveys related to mine closing, perpetual care water treatment and reclamation liabilities for closed and idled locations resulting in $23 million of expense in 2008 compared to $33 million of expense in 2007. The higher 2007 survey adjustments related primarily to perpetual water treatment changes in estimates of water flows and increased hydrated lime costs. Closed and idle mine cost of goods sold and other charges also increased $1 million due to various other charges which occurred throughout both periods, none of which were individually significant. Other cost of goods sold decreased due to the following items: 2008 2007 DollarVariance PercentageChange Buchanan roof collapse $ 17 $ 95 $ (78 ) (82.1 )% Contract settlement 6 (6 ) (100.0 )% Incentive compensation 33 35 (2 ) (5.7 )% Ward superfund site 7 5 2 40.0 % Accounts receivable securitization 6 3 3 100.0 % Railroad spur expenses 4 1 3 300.0 % Asset impairment 6 6 100.0 % Stock based compensation 34 24 10 41.7 % Profit splits 15 15 100.0 % Sales contract buy outs 19 19 100.0 % Terminal/River operations 81 58 23 39.7 % Miscellaneous 13 12 1 8.3 % Total of the Cost of Goods Sold and Other Charges $ 235 $ 239 $ (4 ) (1.7 )% In July 2007, production at the Buchanan Mine was suspended after several roof falls in previously mined areas damaged some of the ventilation controls inside the mine, requiring a general evacuation of the mine. In 2008, we have incurred approximately $17 million of cost of goods sold and other charges related to the Buchanan Mine event compared to $95 million in the prior year. The 2007 expense figure is net of $15 million related to insurance proceeds received as reimbursement for costs incurred under the policy. The mine resumed longwall production on March 17, 2008. In 2007, CONSOL Energy agreed to a $6 million settlement for a contract violation with a customer. The incentive compensation program is designed to increase compensation to eligible employees when CONSOL Energy reaches predetermined earnings targets and the employees reach predetermined performance targets. Incentive compensation expense decreased $2 million due to the level of earnings in comparison to the predetermined performance target in the year to year comparison. The year ended December 31, 2008 includes expense of $7 million related to the Ward Transformer superfund site. In 2008, revised estimates of total costs related to this site were received. The revised estimates indicate an increase in costs to remediate the site. The year ended December 31, 2007 includes $5 million of expense related to this site. See Note 25 Commitments and Contingencies of Item 8, of the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details. Accounts receivable securitization fees increased $3 million in the year to year comparison. Higher amounts have been drawn under this program throughout 2008 compared to 2007. Expenses increased $3 million in 2008 related to a railroad spur acquired with the July 2007 acquisition of AMVEST. The increase was related to maintenance completed on the spur during the year. These expenses are offset with the related income reflected in other income. Asset impairment expenses of $6 million were recognized in 2008 primarily related to loans made to, and options to purchase shares of common stock, with a startup company whose efforts are to commercialize 81 Table of Contents technology to burn waste coal with near zero emissions to generate power. Due mainly to the downturn in the economy, it is not probable that the company can repay these loans, or that the company will complete a public offering. Therefore, the asset values have been written down. Stock based compensation expense increased $10 million primarily as a result of additional awards granted to CONSOL Energy and CNX Gas employees in 2008. In addition, stock based compensation expense increased due to changes in expected value of the cash payout related to the performance share units of CNX Gas. Cost of goods sold and other charges includes $15 million in 2008 related to contracts with certain customers which were unable to take delivery of previously contracted coal tonnage. These customers have agreed to allow CONSOL Energy to sell the released tonnage, but require CONSOL Energy to split the incremental sales price over the original contract sales price evenly with them. The $15 million represents the additional sales price received for the tonnage sold that is owed to the original customer. In 2008, CONSOL Energy agreed to buy out sales contracts with several customers in order to release tons committed under lower priced contracts for sale to other customers at higher prices which resulted in $19 million of expense. No such agreements were made in 2007. Terminal/River operation charges have increased $23 million in the year to year comparison due to increased fuel charges resulting from higher fuel prices and increased operating hours. Costs also have increased due to the acquisition of Tri River Fleeting on October 3, 2007, as well as higher thru put volumes in 2008. Miscellaneous cost of goods sold and other charges increased $1 million due to various transactions throughout both periods, none of which were individually material. 2008 2007 Variance PercentageChange Gas Royalty Interest Sales Volumes (in billion cubic feet) 8.5 7.2 1.3 18.1 % Average Cost Per thousand cubic feet $ 8.69 $ 5.52 $ 3.17 57.4 % Gas royalty interest costs represent the expenses related to the portion of production belonging to royalty interest owners sold by CNX Gas on their behalf. The increase in volumes and price relates to the volatility and contractual differences among leases, as well as the mix of average and index prices used in calculating royalties. 2008 2007 Variance PercentageChange Purchased Sales Volumes (in billion cubic feet) 1.0 1.1 (0.1 ) (9.1 )% Average Cost Per thousand cubic feet $ 8.13 $ 6.66 $ 1.47 22.1 % Purchased gas costs represent volumes of gas purchased from third party producers, less our gathering and marketing fees, that we sell at market prices. Purchased gas volumes also include the impact of pipeline imbalances. The increase in cost of goods sold and other charges related to purchased gas represents overall price increases and contractual differences among customers in the year to year comparison. Freight expense is based on weight of coal shipped, negotiated freight rates and method of transportation (i.e., rail, barge, truck, etc.) used for the customers to which CONSOL Energy contractually provides transportation services. Freight expense is the amount billed to customers for transportation costs incurred. Freight expense has increased in 2008 due primarily to freight associated with AMVEST, which was acquired on July 31, 2007. Freight expense has also increased due to higher freight rates being charged for exported tons. These increases in freight expense were offset, in part, by lower export tons shipped in 2008 compared to 2007. There were 7.0 million tons and 7.6 million tons of coal exported by CONSOL Energy in 2008 and 2007, respectively. 2008 2007 DollarVariance PercentageChange Freight expense $ 217 $ 187 $ 30 16.0 % 82 Table of Contents Selling, general and administrative costs have increased due to the following items: 2008 2007 DollarVariance PercentageChange Wages, salaries and related benefits $ 61 $ 52 $ 9 17.3 % Association/charitable contributions 12 6 6 100.0 % Advertising and promotion 6 4 2 50.0 % Professional, consulting and other purchased services 27 29 (2 ) (6.9 )% Other 19 18 1 5.6 % Total Selling, General and Administrative $ 125 $ 109 $ 16 14.7 % Wages, salaries and related benefits increased $9 million in the year to year comparison due to additional staffing at our CNX Gas subsidiary, additional administrative staffing acquired in the July 2007 Piping & Equipment acquisition and various other increases in support staff throughout CONSOL Energy. Association assessments have increased $6 million in the year to year comparison due primarily to CONSOL Energys participation in an industry organization which has launched a program related to the promotion of coal as an energy solution. CONSOL Energy did not participate in this organization in 2007. Also, CONSOL Energy participates in various associations and contributes to various charities in an effort to support the professions and the communities in which we do business. The level of funding made to these organizations varies from year to year. Advertising and promotion expenses increased $2 million in 2008 due to various additional advertising and promotion agreements entered into throughout the current year. Costs of professional, consulting and other purchased services decreased $2 million due to various administrative projects throughout both years, none of which are individually material. Other selling, general and administrative costs increased $1 million due to various transactions that have occurred throughout both years, none of which are individually material. Depreciation, depletion and amortization increased due to the following items: 2008 2007 DollarVariance PercentageChange Coal $ 299 $ 258 $ 41 15.9 % Gas: Production 50 31 19 61.3 % Gathering 20 18 2 11.1 % Total Gas 70 49 21 42.9 % Other 21 18 3 16.7 % Total Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization $ 390 $ 325 $ 65 20.0 % The increase in coal depreciation, depletion and amortization was primarily attributable to additional expense related to the assets purchased in the July 2007 acquisition of AMVEST. The increase was also attributable to assets placed in service after December 31, 2007. The increase in gas production related depreciation, depletion and amortization was primarily due to higher volumes combined with an increase in the units of production rates in the year to year comparison. These rates increased due to the higher proportion of capital assets placed in service versus the proportion of proved developed reserve additions. These rates are generally calculated using the net book value of assets at the end of the previous year divided by either proved or proved developed reserves. 83 Table of Contents Gathering depreciation, depletion and amortization is recorded using the straight line method and increased due to additional assets placed in service after December 31, 2007. Other depreciation increased $3 million due to various items placed in service after December 31, 2007, none of which were individually material. Interest expense increased in 2008 compared to 2007 due to the following items: 2008 2007 DollarVariance PercentageChange Revolver $ 11 $ 5 $ 6 120.0 % Interest on unrecognized tax benefits 2 3 (1 ) (33.3 )% Capitalized lease 6 7 (1 ) (14.3 )% Long term secured notes 27 28 (1 ) (3.6 )% Other (10 ) (12 ) 2 (16.7 )% Total Interest Expense $ 36 $ 31 $ 5 16.1 % Revolver interest expense increased $6 million due to the amounts drawn by CONSOL Energy and CNX Gas on the credit facility throughout 2008. There were no amounts drawn until August 2007 on this facility by CONSOL Energy. CNX Gas had no amounts drawn throughout all of 2007. These increases were offset, in part, by lower interest rates in the year to year comparison. Interest on uncertain tax benefits decreased $1 million due primarily to the settlement of various uncertain tax positions due to receipt of the audit report related to the years 2004 2005. Interest on capital leases decreased $1 million due to the planned payments made on these leases after December 31, 2007. Interest on long term secured notes decreased $1 million due to the planned June 2007 principal payment on our $45 million secured note. Other interest increased $2 million due primarily to lower amounts of interest capitalized in 2008 compared to 2007. Capitalized interest was lower in 2008 because capital expenditures which qualify for interest capitalization were lower. These lower expenditures were primarily related to the Robinson Run overland belt which was placed in service in September 30, 2007. On October 3, 2008 the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (the EESA Act) was signed into law. The EESA Act contains a section that authorizes certain coal producers and exporters who have filed a Black Lung Excise Tax (BLET) return on or after October 1, 1990, to request a refund of the BLET paid on export sales. The EESA Act requires that the U.S. Treasury refund a coal producer or exporter an amount equal to the BLET erroneously paid on export sales in prior years along with interest computed at the statutory rates applicable to overpayments. CONSOL Energy filed timely claims for refunds under the EESA Act of the BLET with the Internal Revenue Service in the amount of approximately $27 million. In addition, the estimated interest related to the BLET refunds expected to be received is approximately $32 million. In relation to this receivable, CONSOL Energy also recognized approximately $3 million of expense that will be owed to third parties upon collection of the refunds. The year ended December 31, 2007 included a $24 million charge related to the reversal of the receivable that had been recognized in previous quarters related to the BLET refund. The Federal Circuit court had ruled that the damage claim for BLET paid for the period 1991 1993 be repaid. The Government appealed a similar case to the U.S. Supreme Court. On December 3, 2007 the United States Supreme Court granted the Governments appeal to hear the case. The Supreme Courts appeal of the petition made collection of the refund no longer highly probable because of the adverse ruling by the Supreme Court during 2007 under the statute on which our claim for this period was based. Accordingly, CONSOL Energy reversed the BLET receivable it had previously recognized. 84 Table of Contents Taxes other than income increased primarily due to the following items: 2008 2007 DollarVariance PercentageChange Production taxes: Coal $ 168 $ 150 $ 18 12.0 % Gas 20 13 7 53.8 % Total Production Taxes 188 163 25 15.3 % Other taxes: Coal 84 79 5 6.3 % Gas 7 5 2 40.0 % Other 11 12 (1 ) (8.3 )% Total Other Taxes 102 96 6 6.3 % Total Taxes Other Than Income $ 290 $ 259 $ 31 12.0 % Coal production taxes increased $18 million due to higher severance taxes and reclamation fee taxes attributable to the increase in average sales price for produced coal. Coal production taxes also increased due to higher tons produced in 2008 than 2007. Gas production taxes increased $7 million due to higher severance taxes attributable to higher average sales prices for gas and higher gas sales volumes. The $5 million increase in other coal taxes is primarily due to higher payroll related taxes and higher property taxes. Higher payroll related taxes were the result of additional employees in 2008 and higher wages paid as discussed in the cost of goods sold and other cost section. Higher property taxes were related to additional properties acquired in the July 31, 2007 AMVEST acquisition, as previously disclosed. Other gas taxes have increased $2 million primarily related to payroll taxes and capital stock & franchise taxes due to the on going growth of the company. Other taxes decreased $1 million due to various transactions that occurred throughout both years, none of which were individually material. Income Taxes 2008 2007 Variance PercentageChange Earnings Before Income Taxes $ 725 $ 429 $ 296 69.0 % Tax Expense $ 240 $ 136 $ 104 76.5 % Effective Income Tax Rate 33.1 % 31.7 % 1.4 % CONSOL Energys effective tax rate is sensitive to changes in the relationship between pre tax earnings and percentage depletion. The proportion of coal pre tax earnings and gas pre tax earnings also impacts the benefit of percentage depletion on the effective tax rate. See Note 6 Income Taxes in Item 8, Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10 K. Noncontrolling Interest Noncontrolling interest represents 18.3% of CNX Gas net income which CONSOL Energy did not own through September 30, 2008, 18.0% for October 2008, 16.9% for November 2008 and 16.7% for December 2008. The noncontrolling interest in CNX Gas has been changing due to the share repurchase program that was approved by the CONSOL Energy Board of Directors on October 21, 2008. 85 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and at the date of the financial statements. Note 1 of the Notes to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10 K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. On an on going basis, we evaluate our estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making the judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from those estimates upon subsequent resolution of identified matters. Management believes that the estimates utilized are reasonable. The following critical accounting policies are materially impacted by judgments, assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Other Post Employment Benefits Certain subsidiaries of CONSOL Energy provide medical and life insurance benefits to retired employees not covered by the Coal Industry Retiree Health Benefit Act of 1992. The medical plans contain certain cost sharing and containment features, such as deductibles, coinsurance, health care networks and coordination with Medicare. For salaried employees hired before January 1, 2007, the eligibility requirement is either age 55 with 20 years of service or age 62 with 15 years of service. Also, salaried employees and retirees contribute a target of 20% of the medical plan operating costs. Contributions may be higher, dependent on either years of service or a combination of age and years of service at retirement. Prospective annual cost increases of up to 6% will be shared by CONSOL Energy and the participants based on their age and years of service at retirement. Annual cost increases in excess of 6% will be the responsibility of the participant. Any salaried or non represented hourly employees that were hired or rehired effective January 1, 2007 or later will not become eligible for retiree health benefits. In lieu of traditional retiree health coverage, if certain eligibility requirements are met, these employees will receive a retiree medical spending allowance of $2,250 per year for each year of service at retirement. Newly employed inexperienced employees represented by the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA), hired after January 1, 2007, will not be eligible to receive retiree benefits. In lieu of these benefits, these employees will receive a defined contribution benefit of $1 per each hour worked. After our review, various actuarial assumptions, including discount rate, expected trend in health care costs, average remaining service period, average remaining life expectancy, per capita costs and participation level in each future year are used by our independent actuary to estimate the cost and benefit obligations for our retiree health plans. Most assumptions used in 2009 have not differed materially from the prior year actual experience. Expected trend in health care cost assumptions have been changed since the prior year. The initial expected trend in health care costs at this years measurement date, which was December 31, 2009, was 8.74% compared to a prior year expected 2009 trend in health care cost of 9.6%. In addition, the year the ultimate trend rate is reached was extended from 5.0% in 2015 to 4.50% in 2023. A 1.0% decrease in the health care trend rate would decrease interest and service cost for 2009 by approximately $17.0 million. A 1.0% increase in the health care trend rate would increase the interest and service cost by approximately $19.9 million. The discount rate is also determined each year at the measurement date. The discount rate is estimated by utilizing a corporate yield curve model developed from corporate bond data using only bonds rated Aa by Moodys as of the measurement date. All future post employment benefit expected payments were discounted using a spot rate yield curve as of December 31, 2009. The appropriate discount rate was then selected from resulting discounted cash flows. For the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, the discount rate used to calculate the period end liability and the following years expense was 5.87% and 6.20%, respectively. A 0.25% increase in the discount rate would have decreased 2009 net periodic postretirement benefit costs by approximately $3.8 million. A 0.25% decrease in the discount rate would have increased 2009 net periodic postretirement benefit costs by approximately $3.8 million. Deferred gains and losses are primarily due to historical changes in the discount rate and medical cost inflation 86 Table of Contents differing from expectations in prior years. Changes to interest rates for the rates of returns on instruments that could be used to settle the actuarially determined plan obligations introduce substantial volatility to our costs. Accumulated actuarial gains or losses in excess of a pre established corridor are amortized on a straight line basis over the expected future service of active salary and non represented employees to their assumed retirement age. At December 31, 2009 the average remaining service period is approximately 11 years for our non represented plans. Accumulated actuarial gains or losses in excess of a pre established corridor are amortized on a straight line basis over the expected remaining life of our retired UMWA population. The average remaining service period of this population is not used for amortization purposes because the majority of the UMWA population of our plan is retired. At December 31, 2009, the average remaining life expectancy of our retired UMWA population used to calculate the following years expense is approximately 13 years. The weighted average per capita costs used to value the December 31, 2009 Other Postretirement Benefit liability was 4.84% less than expected based on our trend assumption. This was due to more favorable experience during the year. If the actual change in per capita cost of medical services or other postretirement benefits are significantly greater or less than the projected trend rates, the per capita cost assumption would need to be adjusted, which could have a significant effect on the costs and liabilities recognized in the financial statements. Significant increases in health and prescription drug costs for represented hourly retirees could have a material adverse effect on CONSOL Energys operating cash flow. However, the effect on CONSOL Energys cash flow from operations for salaried employees is limited to approximately 6% of the previous years medical cost for salaried employees due to the cost sharing provision in the benefit plan. The estimated liability recognized in the December 31, 2009 financial statements was $2.8 billion. For the year ended December 31, 2009, we paid approximately $155.9 million for Other Postretirement Benefits, all of which were paid from operating cash flow. Our obligations with respect to these liabilities are unfunded at December 31, 2009. CONSOL Energy does not expect to contribute to the other postretirement plan in 2010. We intend to pay benefit claims as they are due. Salaried Pensions CONSOL Energy has non contributory defined benefit retirement plans covering substantially all employees not covered by multiemployer plans. The benefits for these plans are based primarily on years of service and employees pay near retirement. CONSOL Energys salaried plan allows for lump sum distributions of benefits earned up until December 31, 2005, at the employees election. The Restoration Plan was frozen effective December 31, 2006 and was replaced prospectively with the CONSOL Energy Supplemental Retirement Plan. CONSOL Energys Restoration Plan allows only for lump sum distributions earned up until December 31, 2006. Effective September 8, 2009, the Supplemental Retirement Plan was amended to include employees of CNX Gas. In March of 2009 the CNX Gas defined benefit retirement plan was merged into the Consol Energys non contributory defined benefit retirement plan. This change did not impact the benefits for employees of CNX Gas, an 83.3% owned subsidiary. CNX Gas employees hired after January 1, 2007, are not eligible to participate in this non contributory defined benefit retirement plan. In lieu of participation in the non contributory defined benefit plan, these employees began receiving an additional 3% company contribution into their defined contribution plan. CNX Gas employees who were hired prior to December 31, 2005 or who were employees of CONSOL Energy prior to this date were given a one time opportunity to elect to remain in the defined benefit plan or opt to freeze their service accruals and participate in the additional 3% company contribution into their defined contribution plan. Our independent actuaries calculate the actuarial present value of the estimated retirement obligation based on assumptions including rates of compensation, mortality rates, retirement age and interest rates. For the year ended December 31, 2009, compensation increases are assumed to range from 3% to 8% depending on age and 87 Table of Contents job classification. The discount rate is determined each year at the measurement date. The discount rate is estimated by utilizing a corporate yield curve model developed from corporate bond data using only bonds rated Aa by Moodys as of the measurement date. All expected benefit payments from the CONSOL Energy retirement plan were discounted using a spot rate yield curve as of December 31, 2009. The appropriate equivalent discount rate was then selected for the resulting discounted pension cash flows. For the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, the discount rate used to calculate the period end liability and the following years expense was 5.79% and 6.28%, respectively. A 0.25% increase in the discount rate would have decreased the 2009 net periodic pension cost by $0.7 million. A 0.25% decrease in the discount rate would have increased the 2009 net periodic pension cost by $0.7 million. Deferred gains and losses are primarily due to historical changes in the discount rate and earnings on assets differing from expectations in prior years. At December 31, 2009 the average remaining service period is approximately 10 years. Changes to any of these assumptions introduce substantial volatility to our costs. The market related asset value is derived by taking the cost value of assets as of December 31, 2009 and multiplying it by the average 36 month ratio of the market value of assets to the cost value of assets. CONSOL Energys pension plan weighted average asset allocations at December 31, 2009 consisted of 61% equity securities and 39% debt securities. The volatile economic environment and rapid deterioration in the equity markets have caused investment income and the value of investment assets held in our pension trust to decline and lose value. As a result, we may be required to increase the amount of cash contributions we make into the pension trust. The estimated liability recognized in the December 31, 2009 financial statements was $192.0 million. For the year ended December 31, 2009, we contributed approximately $67.7 million for defined benefit retirement plans other than multi employer plans. Our obligations with respect to these liabilities are partially funded at December 31, 2009. CONSOL Energy does expect to contribute to the defined benefit retirement plans during 2010. We intend to contribute an amount that will avoid benefit restrictions for the following plan year. Workers Compensation and Coal Workers Pneumoconiosis Workers compensation is a system by which individuals who sustain employment related physical injuries or some type of occupational diseases are compensated for their disabilities, medical costs, and on some occasions, for the costs of their rehabilitation. Workers compensation will also compensate the survivors of workers who suffer employment related deaths. The workers compensation laws are administered by state agencies with each state having its own set of rules and regulations regarding compensation that is owed to an employee that is injured in the course of employment. CONSOL Energy records an actuarially calculated liability, which is determined using various assumptions, including discount rate, future healthcare cost trends, benefit duration and recurrence of injuries. The discount rate is determined each year at the measurement date. The discount rate is estimated by utilizing a corporate yield curve model developed from corporate bond data using only bonds rated Aa by Moodys as of the measurement date. All future workers compensation expected benefit payments were discounted using a spot rate yield curve as of December 31, 2009. The appropriate equivalent discount rate was then selected from the resulting discounted workers compensation cash flows. For the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, the discount rate used to calculate the period end liability and the following years expense was 5.55% and 5.90%, respectively. A 0.25% increase or decrease in the discount rate would not have materially changed the 2009 workers compensation expense. Deferred gains and losses are primarily due to historical changes in the discount rates, several years of favorable claims experience, various favorable claims experience, various favorable state legislation changes and an overall lower incident rate than our assumptions. Accumulated actuarial gains or losses are amortized on a straight line basis over the expected future benefit duration of current claimants. At December 31, 2009, the average expected benefit duration for this group is approximately 9 years. The estimated liability recognized in the financial statements at December 31, 2009 was approximately $179.3 million. CONSOL Energys policy has been to provide for workers compensation benefits from operating cash flow. For the year ended December 31, 2009, we made payments for workers compensation benefits and other related fees of approximately $37.6 million, all of which was paid from operating cash flow. Our obligations with respect to these liabilities are unfunded at December 31, 2009. 88 Table of Contents CONSOL Energy is responsible under the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969, as amended, for medical and disability benefits to employees and their dependents resulting from occurrences of coal workers pneumoconiosis disease. CONSOL Energy is also responsible under various state statutes for pneumoconiosis benefits. After our review, our independent actuaries calculate the actuarial present value of the estimated pneumoconiosis obligation based on assumptions regarding disability incidence, medical costs, mortality, death benefits, dependents and discount rates. The discount rate is determined each year at the measurement date. The discount rate is estimated by utilizing a corporate yield curve model developed from corporate bond data using only bonds rated Aa by Moodys as of the measurement date. All future coal workers pneumoconiosis expected benefit payments were discounted using a spot rate yield curve at December 31, 2009. The appropriate equivalent discount rate was then selected from the resulting discounted coal workers pneumoconiosis cash flows. For the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, the discount rate used to calculate the period end liability and the following years expense was 5.84% and 6.23%, respectively. A 0.25% increase in the discount rate would have decreased 2009 coal workers pneumoconiosis expense by $0.7 million. A 0.25% decrease in the discount rate would have increased 2009 coal workers pneumoconiosis by $0.7 million. Actuarial gains associated with coal workers pneumoconiosis have resulted from numerous legislative changes over many years which have resulted in lower approval rates for filed claims than our assumptions originally reflected. Actuarial gains have also resulted from lower incident rates and lower severity of claims filed than our assumption originally reflected. The estimated liability recognized in the financial statements at December 31, 2009 was $194.6 million. For the year ended December 31, 2009, we paid coal workers pneumoconiosis benefits of approximately $10.7 million, all of which was paid from operating cash flow. Our obligations with respect to these liabilities are unfunded at December 31, 2009. Reclamation, Mine Closure and Gas Well Closing Obligations The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act established operational, reclamation and closure standards for all aspects of surface mining as well as most aspects of deep mining. CONSOL Energy accrues for the costs of current mine disturbance and final mine and gas well closure, including the cost of treating mine water discharge where necessary. Estimates of our total reclamation, mine closing liabilities, and gas well closing which are based upon permit requirements and CONSOL Energy engineering expertise related to these requirements, including the current portion, were approximately $533.2 million at December 31, 2009. This liability is reviewed annually by CONSOL Energy management and engineers. The estimated liability can significantly change if actual costs vary from assumptions or if governmental regulations change significantly. Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations requires that the fair value of an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The present value of the estimated asset retirement costs is capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset. Asset retirement obligations primarily relate to the closure of mines and gas wells and the reclamation of land upon exhaustion of coal and gas reserves. Changes in the variables used to calculate the liabilities can have a significant effect on the mine closing, reclamation and gas well closing liabilities. The amounts of assets and liabilities recorded are dependent upon a number of variables, including the estimated future retirement costs, estimated proven reserves, assumptions involving profit margins, inflation rates, and the assumed credit adjusted risk free interest rate. Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations also requires depreciation of the capitalized asset retirement cost and accretion of the asset retirement obligation over time. The depreciation will generally be determined on a units of production basis, whereas the accretion to be recognized will escalate over the life of the producing assets, typically as production declines. Income Taxes Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax basis of recorded assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. 89 Table of Contents All available evidence, both positive and negative, must be considered in determining the need for a valuation allowance. At December 31, 2009, CONSOL Energy has deferred tax assets in excess of deferred tax liabilities of approximately $498.7 million. The deferred tax assets are evaluated periodically to determine if a valuation allowance is necessary. Deferred tax valuation allowances increased $0.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2009 due to various transactions that occurred throughout 2009, none of which were individually material. Valuation allowances on certain net operating loss carry forwards were not released during the year due to negative evidence outweighing positive evidence indicating that these benefits will not be utilized in future years. CONSOL Energy continues to report a deferred tax asset of approximately $37.1 million relating to its state net operating loss carry forwards subject to a full valuation allowance. A review of positive and negative evidence regarding these benefits, primarily the history of financial and tax losses on a separate company basis, concluded that a full valuation allowance was warranted. The net operating loss carry forwards expire at various times from 2010 to 2027. A valuation allowance of $24.5 million has also been recorded against the state deferred tax asset attributable to future tax deductible differences for certain subsidiaries with histories of financial and tax losses. Management will continue to assess the realization of deferred tax assets attributable to state net operating loss carry forwards and future tax deductible differences based upon updated income forecast data and the feasibility of future tax planning strategies, and may record adjustments to valuation allowances against these deferred tax assets in future periods as appropriate that could materially impact net income. CONSOL Energy evaluates all tax positions taken on the state and federal tax filings to determine if the position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination. For positions that meet the more likely than not to be sustained criteria, an evaluation to determine the largest amount of benefit, determined on a cumulative probability basis that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement is determined. A previously recognized tax position is derecognized when it is subsequently determined that a tax position no longer meets the more likely than not threshold to be sustained. The evaluation of the sustainability of a tax position and the probable amount that is more likely than not is based on judgment, historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these estimates, that are not readily apparent from other sources, form the basis for recognizing an uncertain tax liability. Actual results could differ from those estimates upon subsequent resolution of identified matters. Estimates of our uncertain tax liabilities, including interest and the current portion, were approximately $65.3 million at December 31, 2009. Stock Based Compensation As of December 31, 2009, we have issued three types of share based payment awards: options, restricted stock units, and performance share units. The Black Scholes option pricing model is used to determine fair value of stock options at the grant date. Various inputs are utilized in the Black Scholes pricing model, such as: stock price on measurement date, exercise price defined in the award, expected dividend yield based on historical trend of dividend payouts, risk free interest rate based on a zero coupon treasury bond rate, expected term based on historical grant and exercise behavior, and expected volatility based on historic and implied stock price volatility of CONSOL Energy stock and public peer group stock. These factors can significantly impact the value of stock options expense recognized over the requisite service period of option holders. 90 Table of Contents The fair value of each restricted stock unit awarded is equivalent to the closing market price of a share of our companys stock on the date of the grant. The fair value of each performance share unit is determined by the underlying share price of our company stock on the date of the grant and managements estimate of the probability that the performance conditions required for vesting will be achieved. As of December 31, 2009, $24.6 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested awards is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.57 years. See Note 18 in the Notes to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 in this Form 10 K for more information. Contingencies CONSOL Energy is currently involved in certain legal proceedings. We have accrued our estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of these claims. This estimate has been developed in consultation with legal counsel involved in the defense of these matters and is based upon an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies. Future results of operations for any particular quarter or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the outcome of these proceedings. See Note 24 in the Notes to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 in this Form 10 K for more information. Successful Efforts Accounting We use the successful efforts method to account for our gas exploration and production activities. Under this method, cost of property acquisitions, successful exploratory wells, development wells and related support equipment and facilities are capitalized. Costs of unsuccessful exploratory wells are expensed when such wells are determined to be non productive, or if the determination cannot be made after finding sufficient quantities of reserves to continue evaluating the viability of the project. We use this accounting policy instead of the full cost method because it provides a more timely accounting of the success or failure of our gas exploration and production activities. Derivative Instruments CNX Gas enters into financial derivative instruments to manage exposure to natural gas and oil price volatility. We measure every derivative instrument at fair value and record them on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability. Changes in fair value of derivatives are recorded currently in earnings unless special hedge accounting criteria are met. For derivatives designated as fair value hedges, the changes in fair value of both the derivative instrument and the hedged item are recorded in earnings. For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portions of changes in fair value of the derivative are reported in other comprehensive income or loss and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods which the forecasted transaction affects earnings. The ineffective portions of hedges are recognized in earnings in the current year. CNX Gas currently utilizes only cash flow hedges that are considered highly effective. CNX Gas formally assesses, both at inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, whether each derivative is highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedge item. If it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective as a hedge or if a derivative ceases to be a highly effective hedge, CNX Gas will discontinue hedge accounting prospectively. Coal and Gas Reserve Values There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities and values of economically recoverable coal and gas reserves, including many factors beyond our control. As a result, estimates of economically recoverable coal and gas reserves are by their nature uncertain. Information about our reserves consists of estimates based on engineering, economic and geological data assembled and analyzed by our staff. Our coal 91 Table of Contents reserves are periodically reviewed by an independent third party consultant. Our gas reserves have been reviewed by independent experts. Some of the factors and assumptions which impact economically recoverable reserve estimates include: geological conditions; historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas; the assumed effects of regulations and taxes by governmental agencies; assumptions governing future prices; and future operating costs. Each of these factors may in fact vary considerably from the assumptions used in estimating reserves. For these reasons, estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of coal and gas attributable to a particular group of properties, and classifications of these reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of future net cash flows, may vary substantially. Actual production, revenues and expenditures with respect to our reserves will likely vary from estimates, and these variances may be material. See Risk Factors in Item 1A of this report for a discussion of the uncertainties in estimating our reserves. Liquidity and Capital Resources CONSOL Energy generally has satisfied our working capital requirements and funded our capital expenditures and debt service obligations with cash generated from operations and proceeds from borrowings. We utilize a $1 billion senior secured credit facility which expires in 2012. The facility is secured by substantially all of the assets of CONSOL Energy and certain of its subsidiaries and collateral is shared equally and ratably with the holders of CONSOL Energy Inc. 7.875% bonds maturing in June 2012. The agreement provides for the release of collateral at the request of CONSOL Energy upon the achievement of certain credit ratings. Fees and interest rate spreads are based on a ratio of financial covenant debt to twelve month trailing earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization (EBITDA), measured quarterly. The facility includes a minimum interest coverage ratio covenant of no less than 4.50 to 1.00, measured quarterly. The interest coverage ratio was 24.78 to 1.00 at December 31, 2009. The facility also includes a maximum leverage ratio covenant of not more than 3.25 to 1.00, measured quarterly. The leverage ratio was 0.87 to 1.00 at December 31, 2009. Affirmative and negative covenants in the facility limit our ability to dispose of assets, make investments, purchase or redeem CONSOL Energy common stock, pay dividends and merge with another corporation. At December 31, 2009, the facility had approximately $415 million drawn and $268 million of letters of credit outstanding, leaving $317 million of unused capacity. From time to time, CONSOL Energy is required to post financial assurances to satisfy contractual and other requirements generated in the normal course of business. Some of these assurances are posted to comply with federal, state or other government agencies statutes and regulations. We sometimes use letters of credit to satisfy these requirements and these letters of credit reduce our borrowing facility capacity. The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PA DEP) and CONSOL Energy have executed a Consent Order and Agreement (the Agreement) that addresses financial assurance required by the State for CONSOL Energys Pennsylvania mine water treatment facilities for mines closed prior to August 1977. The Agreement requires the company to post approximately $34 million of financial assurance over a 10 year time frame. CONSOL Energy is evaluating use of the credit facility and other alternative sources to satisfy these requirements. CONSOL Energy and certain of our U.S. subsidiaries also participate in a receivables securitization facility for the sale on a continuous basis of eligible trade accounts receivable that will provide, on a revolving basis, up to $165 million of short term funding or letters of credit. CONSOL Energy formed CNX Funding Corporation, a wholly owned, special purpose, bankruptcy remote subsidiary, for the sole purpose of buying and selling eligible trade receivables generated by certain subsidiaries of CONSOL Energy. Under the receivables facility, CONSOL 92 Table of Contents Energy and certain subsidiaries, irrevocably and without recourse, sell all of their eligible trade accounts receivable to CNX Funding Corporation. CNX Funding Corporation then sells, on a revolving basis, an undivided percentage interest in the pool of eligible trade accounts receivable to financial institutions and their affiliates, while maintaining a subordinated interest in a portion of the trade receivables. CONSOL Energy has agreed to continue servicing the sold receivables for the financial institutions for a fee based upon market rates for similar services. The cost of funds is consistent with commercial paper rates plus a charge for administrative services paid to the financial institution. At December 31, 2009, eligible accounts receivable totaled approximately $151 million. There was $101 million of subordinate retained interest at December 31, 2009. Accounts receivable totaling $50 million were removed from the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2009. There were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2009. CNX Gas, an 83.3% consolidated subsidiary of CONSOL Energy, utilizes a revolving credit facility providing an initial aggregate outstanding principal amount of up to $200 million, including borrowings and letters of credit, which expires in October 2010. CNX Gas can request an additional $100 million increase in the aggregate outstanding principal amount. The agreement contains a negative pledge provision, pursuant to which CNX Gas assets cannot be used to secure other obligations. Fees and interest rate spreads are based on the percentage of facility utilization, measured quarterly. Covenants in the facility limit CNX Gas ability to dispose of assets, make investments, purchase or redeem CNX Gas stock, pay dividends and merge with another corporation. This facility includes a leverage ratio covenant of not more than 3.00 to 1.00, measured quarterly. This ratio was 0.38 to 1.00 at December 31, 2009. The facility also includes an interest coverage ratio covenant of no less than 3.00 to 1.00, measured quarterly. This ratio was 68.17 to 1.00 at December 31, 2009. At December 31, 2009, this facility had approximately $15 million of letters of credit issued and had approximately $58 million of outstanding borrowings, leaving approximately $127 million of unused capacity. As a result of the credit agreement, CNX Gas and their subsidiaries executed a Supplemental Indenture on October 21, 2005, guaranteeing CONSOL Energys 7.875% bonds. Uncertainty in the financial markets brings additional potential risks to CONSOL Energy. The risks include declines in our stock price, less availability and higher costs of additional credit streams, potential counterparty defaults, and further commercial bank failures. Although the majority of the financial institutions in our bank group appear to be strong, there are some that have been and could be considered take over candidates. We have no indication that any such transactions would impact our current credit facility; however, the possibility does exist. Financial market disruptions may impact our collection of trade receivables. CONSOL Energy constantly monitors the creditworthiness of our customers. We believe that our current group of customers are sound and represent no abnormal business risk. CONSOL Energy believes that cash generated from operations and our borrowing capacity will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements, anticipated capital expenditures (other than major acquisitions), scheduled debt payments, anticipated dividend payments and to provide required letters of credit. Nevertheless, the ability of CONSOL Energy to satisfy our working capital requirements, debt service obligations, to fund planned capital expenditures or pay dividends will depend upon future operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions in the coal and gas industries and other financial and business factors, some of which are beyond CONSOL Energys control. In order to manage the market risk exposure of volatile natural gas prices in the future, CONSOL Energy enters into various physical gas supply transactions with both gas marketers and end users for terms varying in length. CONSOL Energy has also entered into various gas swap transactions that qualify as financial cash flow hedge, which exist parallel to the underlying physical transactions. The fair value of these contracts was an asset of $117 million at December 31, 2009. The ineffective portion of these contracts was insignificant to earnings in the year ended December 31, 2009. Hedge counterparties consists of commercial banks who participate in the revolving credit facility. No issues related to our hedge agreements have been encountered to date. CONSOL Energy frequently evaluates potential acquisitions. CONSOL Energy has funded acquisitions primarily with cash generated from operations and a variety of other sources, depending on the size of the 93 Table of Contents transaction, including debt financing. There can be no assurance that additional capital resources, including debt financing, will be available to CONSOL Energy on terms which CONSOL Energy finds acceptable, or at all. Cash Flows (in millions) 2009 2008 Change Cash flows provided by operating activities $ 945 $ 1,029 $ (84 ) Cash used in investing activities $ (845 ) $ (1,099 ) $ 254 Cash (used in) provided by financing activities $ (173 ) $ 166 $ (339 ) Cash flows provided by operating activities changed primarily due to the following items: Operating cash flows were lower in 2009 due to $115 million of repayments on the accounts receivable securitization program compared to receipt of $40 million of proceeds in 2008. Operating cash flow in 2008 included a $75 million cash receipt from insurance carriers related to the Buchanan mine incident, as previously disclosed. Operating cash flows were lower in 2009 by approximately $26 million due to coal inventories. Coal inventories increased 1.5 million tons in 2009. Coal inventories increased 462 thousand tons in 2008. Operating cash flow increased in 2009 due to higher net income in the year to year comparison. Net income included higher amounts of depreciation, depletion and amortization in 2009 as discussed in the year to year operation analysis. Operating cash flows also increased due to various other changes in operating assets, operating liabilities, other assets and other liabilities which occurred throughout both years. Operating cash flow increased in 2009 as the result of CONSOL Energy receiving the total principal and related interest for the Black Lung Excise Tax Refund, a total of $55 million, net of amounts paid to third parties. Net cash used in investing activities changed primarily due to the following items: Total capital expenditures decreased $142 million to $920 million in 2009 compared to $1,062 million in 2008. Capital expenditures for gas decreased $240 million due to the slow down of the drilling program related to the weak economic environment and $36 million expended in 2008 for the acquisition of the remaining portion of Knox Energy, offset in part, by a $56 million increase due to Marcellus drilling activity in Northern Appalachia. Capital expenditures for coal and other activities increased $98 million due to various projects including the continued work at Shoemaker mine to replace the track haulage with belt haulage, the face extension work at Bailey mine, the purchase of longwall shields which were sold and leased back, and the Buchanan water handling system. CONSOL Energy purchased $67 million of CNX Gas common stock on the open market during 2008. No purchases of CNX Gas stock were made during 2009. Proceeds from the sale of assets were $70 million in 2009 compared to $28 million in 2008. Proceeds in 2009 were primarily related to the sale of longwall equipment that was subsequently leased back. Proceeds in 2008 were primarily related to the sale of the Mill Creek Mine. Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities changed primarily due to the following items: In 2009, CONSOL Energy paid outstanding borrowings of $70 million to the revolving credit facility. In 2008, CONSOL Energy received approximately $237 million of proceeds from the revolving credit facility. In 2009, CONSOL Energys 83.3% owned subsidiary, CNX Gas, repaid outstanding borrowings of $15 million to the revolving credit facility. In 2008, CNX Gas received proceeds of approximately $73 million from its revolving credit facility. 94 Table of Contents CONSOL Energy repurchased $98 million of its common stock on the open market under the share repurchase program in 2008. No repurchases of common stock were made in 2009. Tax benefits from stock based compensation resulted in approximately $3 million of cash inflows in 2009. These benefits resulted in a cash inflow of approximately $22 million in 2008. In 2009, $3 million of cash inflows were received related to the issuance of CONSOL Energy Treasury Stock compared to $15 million in 2008. The following is a summary of our significant contractual obligations at December 31, 2009 (in thousands): Payments due by Year Less Than1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years More Than5 Years Total Short term Notes Payable $ 472,850 $ $ $ $ 472,850 Purchase Order Firm Commitments 40,697 3,560 44,257 Gas Firm Transportation 28,531 52,120 49,934 303,347 433,932 Long term Debt 39,024 338,401 5,421 20,358 403,204 Interest on Long term Debt 27,204 35,192 1,589 24,549 88,534 Capital (Finance) Lease Obligations 6,370 10,953 8,717 39,512 65,552 Interest on Capital (Finance) Lease Obligations 4,627 7,665 6,470 10,867 29,629 Operating Lease Obligations 79,649 127,574 92,944 166,358 466,525 Other Long term Liabilities(a) 398,907 564,488 570,559 2,482,146 4,016,100 Total Contractual Obligations(b) $ 1,097,859 $ 1,139,953 $ 735,634 $ 3,047,137 $ 6,020,583 (a) Long term liabilities include other post employment benefits, work related injuries and illnesses, mine reclamation and closure and other long term liability costs. Estimated salaried retirement contributions required to meet minimum funding standards under ERISA are excluded from the pay out table due to the uncertainty regarding amounts to be contributed. Estimated 2010 contributions are expected to approximate $64 million. (b) The significant obligation table does not include obligations to taxing authorities due to the uncertainty surrounding the ultimate settlement of amounts and timing of these obligations. Debt At December 31, 2009, CONSOL Energy had total long term debt of $468 million outstanding, including the current portion of long term debt of $45 million. This long term debt consisted of: An aggregate principal amount of $249 million of 7.875% notes ($250 million of 7.875% notes due in March 2012, net of $1 million unamortized debt discount). The notes were issued at 99.174% of the principal amount. Interest on the notes is payable March 1 and September 1 of each year. Payment of the principal and premium, if any, and interest on the notes are guaranteed by most of CONSOL Energys subsidiaries. The notes are senior secured obligations and rank equally with all other secured indebtedness of the guarantors; An aggregate principal amount of $31 million and $72 million of industrial revenue bonds which were issued to finance the Baltimore Port facility and bear interest at 6.50% per annum and mature in December 2010 and October 2011; $36 million in advance royalty commitments with an average interest rate of 10.4% per annum; An aggregate principal amount of $15 million on a variable rate note that bears interest at 6.10% at December 31, 2009. This note was incurred by a variable interest entity that is fully consolidated in which CONSOL Energy holds no ownership interest; An aggregate principal amount of $65 million of capital leases with a weighted average interest rate of 6.82% per annum; 95 Table of Contents At December 31, 2009, CONSOL Energy also had $415 million of aggregate principal amounts of outstanding borrowings and approximately $268 million of letters of credit outstanding under the $1 billion senior secured revolving credit facility. At December 31, 2009, CNX Gas, an 83.3% owned subsidiary, had $58 million of aggregate principal amounts of outstanding borrowings and approximately $15 million of letters of credit outstanding under its $200 million revolving credit facility. Total Equity and Dividends CONSOL Energy had total equity of $2,024 million at December 31, 2009 and $1,674 million at December 31, 2008. Total equity increased primarily due to net income for the year ended December 31, 2009 and amortization of stock based compensation awards. These increases were offset by changes in the actuarial long term liabilities, changes in cash flow hedging, the declaration of dividends, and the issuance of treasury stock. See Consolidated Statements of Stockholders Equity in the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Total equity also changed due to the implementation of the Noncontrolling Interest Topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification. This topic required minority interest to be recharacterized as noncontrolling interests, and classified as a component of equity for all periods presented as of January 1, 2009. In September 2008, CONSOL Energy announced a share repurchase program of up to $500 million of the companys common stock during a 24 month period beginning in September 2008. The share repurchase plan will be used from time to time depending on a number of factors including: current market conditions; the companys financial outlook; business conditions, including cash flows and internal capital requirements; as well as alternative investment options. No shares have been purchased during 2009. As of December 31, 2008, we had purchased a total of 2,741,300 shares at an average price of $35.59 per share under this program. Dividend information for the current year is as follows: Declaration Date Amount Per Share Record Date Payment Date January 29, 2010 $0.10 February 9, 2010 February 19, 2010 October 23, 2009 $0.10 November 4, 2009 November 20, 2009 July 31, 2009 $0.10 August 6, 2009 August 24, 2009 April 24, 2009 $0.10 May 5, 2009 May 22, 2009 January 30, 2009 $0.10 February 9, 2009 February 20, 2009 The declaration and payment of dividends by CONSOL Energy is subject to the discretion of CONSOL Energys Board of Directors, and no assurance can be given that CONSOL Energy will pay dividends in the future. CONSOL Energys Board of Directors determines whether dividends will be paid quarterly. The determination to pay dividends will depend upon, among other things, general business conditions, CONSOL Energys financial results, contractual and legal restrictions regarding the payment of dividends by CONSOL Energy, planned investments by CONSOL Energy and such other factors as the Board of Directors deems relevant. Our credit facility limits our ability to pay dividends when our leverage ratio covenant is 2.50 to 1.00 or more or our availability is less than $100 million. The leverage ratio was 0.87 to 1.00 and our availability was approximately $317 million at December 31, 2009. The credit facility does not permit dividend payments in the event of default. There were no defaults in the year ended December 31, 2009. Off Balance Sheet Transactions CONSOL Energy does not maintain any off balance sheet transactions, arrangements, obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or others that are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on CONSOL Energys financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of 96 Table of Contents operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources which are not disclosed in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. CONSOL Energy participates in various multi employer benefit plans such as the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA) 1974 Pension Plan, the UMWA Combined Benefit Fund and the UMWA 1993 Benefit Plan which generally accepted accounting principles recognize on a pay as you go basis. These benefit arrangements may result in additional liabilities that are not recognized on the balance sheet at December 31, 2009. The various multi employer benefit plans are discussed in Note 17 Other Employee Benefit Plans in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. CONSOL Energy also uses a combination of surety bonds, corporate guarantees and letters of credit to secure our financial obligations for employee related, environmental, deliveries and various other items which are not reflected on the balance sheet at December 31, 2009. Management believes these items will expire without being funded. See Note 24 Commitments and Contingent Liabilities in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In June 2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance on the consolidation of variable interest entities, which is effective for CONSOL beginning July 1, 2010. The new guidance requires revised evaluations of whether entities represent variable interest entities, ongoing assessments of control over such entities, and additional disclosures for variable interests. We believe adoption of this new guidance will not have material impact on CONSOLs financial statements. In June 2009, the FASB issued accounting guidance regarding the accounting for transfers of financial assets that is designed to improve the relevance, representational faithfulness, and comparability of the information that a reporting entity provides in its financial statements about a transfer of financial assets; the effects of a transfer on its financial position, financial performance, and cash flows; and a transferors continuing involvement, if any, in transferred financial assets. The guidance enhances the information provided to financial statement users to provide greater transparency about transfers of financial assets and a transferors continuing involvement, if any, with transferred financial assets. The guidance requires enhanced disclosures about the risks that a transferor continues to be exposed to because of its continuing involvement in transferred financial assets. This guidance is effective for an entitys first annual reporting period after November 15, 2009 and is not eligible for early adoption. Management believes that this guidance will result in the securitization facility transactions being reclassified from sales transactions to secured borrowing transactions as of January 1, 2010. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk In addition to the risks inherent in operations, CONSOL Energy is exposed to financial, market, political and economic risks. The following discussion provides additional detail regarding CONSOL Energys exposure to the risks of changing natural gas prices, interest rates and foreign exchange rates. CONSOL Energy is exposed to market price risk in the normal course of selling natural gas production and to a lesser extent in the sale of coal. CONSOL Energy sells coal under both short term and long term contracts with fixed price and or indexed price contracts that reflect market value. CONSOL Energy uses fixed price contracts, collar price contracts and derivative commodity instruments that qualify as cash flow hedges under the Derivatives and Hedging Topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification to minimize exposure to market price volatility in the sale of natural gas. Our risk management policy prohibits the use of derivatives for speculative purposes. CONSOL Energy has established risk management policies and procedures to strengthen the internal control environment of the marketing of commodities produced from its asset base. All of the derivative instruments without other risk assessment procedures are held for purposes other than trading. They are used primarily to mitigate uncertainty and volatility and cover underlying exposures. CONSOL Energys market risk strategy incorporates fundamental risk management tools to assess market price risk and establish a framework in which management can maintain a portfolio of transactions within pre defined risk parameters. 97 Table of Contents CONSOL Energy believes that the use of derivative instruments, along with the risk assessment procedures and internal controls, mitigates our exposure to material risk. However, the use of derivative instruments without other risk assessment procedures could materially affect CONSOL Energy results of operations depending on interest rates or market prices. Nevertheless, we believe that use of these instruments will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or liquidity. For a summary of accounting policies related to derivative instruments, see Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Sensitivity analyses of the incremental effects on pre tax income for the year ended December 31, 2009 of a hypothetical 10 percent and 25 percent change in natural gas prices for open derivative instruments as of December 31, 2009 are provided in the following table: Incremental Decreasein Pre tax IncomeAssuming aHypothetical Price,Exchange Rate or InterestRate Change of: 10% 25% (in millions) Natural Gas(a) $ 22.4 $ 51.2 (a) CONSOL Energy remains at risk for possible changes in the market value of these derivative instruments; however, such risk should be offset by price changes in the underlying hedged item. CONSOL Energy entered into derivative instruments to convert the market prices related portions of the 2010 through 2012 anticipated sales of natural gas to fixed prices. The sensitivity analyses reflect an inverse relationship between increases in commodity prices and a benefit to earnings. We continually evaluate the portfolio of derivative commodity instruments and adjust the strategy to anticipated market conditions and risks accordingly. CONSOL Energy is exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by counterparties. The creditworthiness of counterparties is subject to continuing review. All of the counterparties to CONSOL Energys natural gas derivative instruments also participate in CONSOL Energys revolving credit facility. The Company has not experienced any issues of non performance by derivative counterparties. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for further discussion of current capital markets. CONSOL Energys interest expense is sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates in the United States. At December 31, 2009, CONSOL Energy had $468 million aggregate principal amount of debt outstanding under fixed rate instruments and $473 million aggregate principal amount of debt outstanding under variable rate instruments. CONSOL Energys primary exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our revolving credit facility, under which there were $415 million of borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2009. CONSOL Energys revolving credit facility bore interest at a weighted average rate of 1.05% per annum during the year ended December 31, 2009. A 100 basis point increase in the average rate for CONSOL Energys revolving credit facility would not have significantly decreased net income for the period. CONSOL Energys 83.3% subsidiary, CNX Gas, also had outstanding borrowings under their revolving credit facility which bears interest at a variable rate. CNX Gas facility had outstanding borrowings of $58 million at December 31, 2009 and bore interest at a weighted average rate of 1.47% per annum during the year ended December 31, 2009. Due to the level of borrowings against this facility and the low weighted average interest rate in the year ended December 31, 2009, a 100 basis point increase in the average rate for CNX Gas revolving credit facility would not have significantly decreased net income for the period. Almost all of CONSOL Energys transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars, and, as a result, it does not have material exposure to currency exchange rate risks. 98 Table of Contents
