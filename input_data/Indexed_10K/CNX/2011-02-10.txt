Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. General The global recovery for steel producers continued to gain strength in 2010. Global blast furnace iron production was 15% higher in 2010 than 2009. It is expected that global steel production rates will grow another 5 6% in 2011. The recent flooding in Australia has heightened steel producers concerns over security of supply of metallurgical coals. We believe that steel producers who have a large exposure to limited geographic supply sources will diversify their supply base to reduce the risk of supply disruptions. We believe this will increase the demand for U.S. metallurgical coals. Demand for U.S. metallurgical coal is expected to be very strong in 2011 due to global growth as well as improving domestic demand. U.S. steel mill utilization is currently at 72%, and there are increasingly optimistic signs for the domestic metallurgical coal markets. Prices for hot rolled coil steel (HRC) have been steadily increasing, buoyed by strong U.S. auto sales figures in December 2010. U.S. auto markets are expected to continue recovery in 2011, which will improve the outlook for the North American steel markets. Given the continued projected growth in the global markets as well as an accelerating North American recovery, we anticipate that metallurgical coal markets will gain strength through 2011. The steam coal outlook continues to improve, driven by declining inventories and increasing demand due to general economic recovery and favorable weather. Coal inventories at utilities were steadily drawn down in 2010. We believe that inventories at the end of December were 22 25 million tons below inventories at the same time last year. We believe that bituminous coal comprises half of this reduction in inventories and inventories in our major market areas (Mid Atlantic and South Atlantic markets) are lower than in other regions of the U.S. Demand for Northern Appalachian coal is not only influenced by domestic demand from utilities but also from European utilities and cross over demand from metallurgical markets. We expect European demand for U.S. coal to be very strong in 2011 as European coal prices have recently hit two year highs. South African and Colombian coals continue to be pulled to developing countries like, China, Brazil and India, allowing North America coal to fill the void. We expect 2011 demand for Northern Appalachian coal will be very strong from four sources: traditional markets, as a metallurgical crossover product, as a replacement for declining Central Appalachian production and from European utilities. A strong start to the 2010 winter season has helped improve natural gas demand; however, the natural gas industry continues to face concerns of oversupply. The supply of natural gas remains very strong due to the success of new shale plays and drilling in these plays to meet drilling commitments. Natural gas storage for 2010 is similar to 2009 levels and industrial demand for gas continues to grow as the economy recovers. In addition to small increases in demand, we are seeing more supply responses to the current price environment. Canadian gas imports have decreased and liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports have failed to materialize. We are also seeing more companies redirect capital away from lower return gas basins towards liquids rich targets. We expect these trends to help curb the growth in gas supply over the next one to two years. Several significant transactions occurred in the year ended December 31, 2010, including the following; On April 30, 2010, CONSOL Energy completed the acquisition of the Appalachian oil and gas exploration and production business of Dominion Resources, Inc., (Dominion Acquisition) for a cash payment of approximately $3.5 billion, which was principally allocated to oil and gas properties, wells and well related equipment. The acquisition included approximately 1 trillion cubic feet equivalents (Tcfe) of net proved reserves and 1.46 million acres of oil and gas rights within the Appalachian Basin. Included in the acquired acreage are approximately 500 thousand prospective net Marcellus Shale acres located predominantly in southwestern Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia. The acquisition enhances CONSOL Energys position in the strategic Marcellus Shale fairway by increasing its development assets. 65 Table of Contents On March 31, 2010, CONSOL Energy completed an offering of 44.3 million shares of common stock, which generated net proceeds of approximately $1.8 billion. On April 1, 2010, CONSOL Energy issued $1.5 billion of 8.00% senior unsecured notes due in 2017 and $1.25 billion of 8.25% senior unsecured notes due in 2020. The equity and senior note proceeds were used in part to complete the Dominion Acquisition. CONSOL Energy also amended and expanded its previous $1.0 billion revolving credit facility to $1.5 billion. CNX Gas also amended and expanded its previous $200 million revolving credit facility to $700 million. These revolving credit facilities were amended and expanded to provide liquidity for future cash needs of the company. On June 1, 2010, CONSOL Energy completed the acquisition of the outstanding shares of CNX Gas common stock that it did not previously own for a cash payment of approximately $967 million. The transaction was effected by means of a cash tender offer for CNX Gas shares at a price of $38.25 per share, followed by a short form merger at the same price, in which CNX Gas became a wholly owned subsidiary of CONSOL Energy. CONSOL Energy previously owned approximately 83.3% of the approximately 151 million shares of CNX Gas common stock outstanding. An additional $24 million cash payment was made to cancel previously vested CNX Gas stock options. CONSOL Energy financed the acquisition of CNX Gas shares by means of internally generated funds, borrowings under its credit facilities and proceeds from its March 31, 2010 offering of common stock. CONSOL Energy sold approximately 2.4 million tons of high volatile metallurgical coal overseas in 2010, to meet the growing global demand for steel and steel products. This coal was previously sold by CONSOL Energy on the domestic steam market at lower average sales prices. The new market for this coal has allowed expanded margins for coals we produce primarily from the Pittsburgh #8 seam. CONSOL Energy sold approximately 4.6 million tons of low volatile metallurgical coal produced at our Buchanan Mine, of which approximately 72% was sold into the overseas metallurgical market at higher average prices than CONSOL Energy has received in the recent past. CONSOL Energys gas operations, together with the producing wells purchased in the Dominion Acquisition, produced a record 127.9 billion cubic feet of gas. Although gas prices remain depressed, increased production has contributed to CONSOL Energys net income. Because of the rapidly changing regulatory environment in which CONSOL Energy operates and various other issues that impact our industries, costs of our coal and gas production in the future may be impacted. The impacts of these changes cannot be determined with certainty at this time. Situations that may impact our costs include the following items: As a result of mine disasters as well as a continuing effort to improve the safety of coal mining, state and federal mine regulators have recently adopted and proposed new mine safety requirements, which impact our operations. These regulations include, for example: new standards for the incombustible content of combined coal dust, rock dust and other dust in underground coal mines; new standards for the amount of respirable dust in underground coal mines; the requirement to equip underground mining equipment with proximity detection devices capable of shutting the equipment down if a person gets too close to the equipment; and the requirements to replace existing seals underground with stronger seals and to monitor and regulate the quality of the mine atmosphere in sealed areas to prevent explosions or reduce their impact. Further, it is likely that regulatory authorities will increase the number of inspections at coal mines and will more strictly enforce existing safety laws and regulations. New safety requirements and enhanced enforcement efforts typically increase the costs of our coal mining operations, which would impact our margins and results of operations. State and Federal environmental regulators have recently adopted and proposed new environmental regulations, and adopted new interpretations of existing regulations, which impact our operations. These include: mandatory reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from underground coal mines and gas operations; potential regulation of greenhouse gas emissions from coal fired electric generating facilities, a significant market for our coal; adoption of more stringent emission limits for currently 66 Table of Contents regulated pollutants from coal fired electric generating facilities; regulation of coal combustion residuals under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act; potential regulation of hydraulic fracturing of gas wells; more stringent interpretations of Clean Water Act requirements resulting in the need to remove constituents of mine drainage that cannot be removed with existing treatment facilities, and or limiting areas that can be mined; more involvement by the EPA in review of applications for new mines and renewals of applications for existing mines resulting in significant permit delays; and reconsideration of regulations relating to conducting surface mining operations near streams. Such new and enhanced environmental protection requirements are likely to increase the costs of our coal mining operations, which would impact our margins and results of operations. Enactment of laws or passage of regulations by the federal government, individual states or other countries regarding emissions from combustion of fossil fuels or establishing renewable energy standards could result in decreased consumption of coal and gas and lead to the switching to other energy technologies for electricity. While climate change legislation in the U.S. is unlikely in the next several years, it is likely that some form of legislation addressing global climate change or establishing renewable energy standards, or both, will be enacted in the future. At this time it is not possible to determine when such legislation will be enacted or the impact of potential legislation on our operations or financial condition. Whether or not climate change legislation is enacted, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has found that carbon dioxide may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare (an endangerment finding) under the Clean Air Act and is proposing regulations that would restrict carbon dioxide emissions from certain sources; however, the EPAs endangerment finding and its authority to adopt such regulations is being challenged in the courts. Although, efforts to enact greenhouse gas legislation have failed, the EPA is proceeding with greenhouse gas regulations. In September 2009, the EPA finalized the Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gas Rule. The current version of this rule requires reporting of emissions from coal mines and gas wells and associated facilities. In December 2010, the EPA announced a proposed schedule for establishing greenhouse gas emission limits for fossil fuel fired electric generating facilities (proposed regulations by July 2011 and final regulations by May 2012.) The level of impact will depend on numerous factors including the specific requirements imposed by legislation or rules, the timing of legislation or rules, time period for compliance, and the timing and commercial development of technologies associated with carbon capture and sequestration. Ultimately, the impact of possible legislation or rules on our business will depend on the degree to which electric power generators are forced to reduce their consumption of coal or gas, install expensive technologies for carbon capture and sequestration, or switch to alternative energy sources. CONSOL Energy believes that if climate change legislation or rules are passed, gas will be impacted to a lesser degree than coal and the company has made strategic investment decisions to change its portfolio of assets to increase the contribution of gas to the companys business. In fact, over the short term, CONSOL Energy expects gas to be the preferred fuel source for new power plants. Over the long term, CONSOL Energy believes that with the development of new technologies for carbon capture and sequestration, both coal and gas will continue to be used as clean and competitive fuel sources for electricity generation. As standards continue to become more stringent on water discharge quality, CONSOL Energy will incur additional costs to build and operate facilities to treat water. For example, CONSOL Energy completed construction of a new mine water treatment facility at its Buchanan Mine in Virginia in 2010 for a total cost of approximately $86 million. It is also in the process of designing and permitting another facility to process mine water from the active Blacksville #2, Loveridge and Robinson Run Mines and the closed Four States Mine in northern West Virginia. The existing facility and the one being permitted are designed to remove chlorides to insure compliance with state and Federal water discharge standards. These new facilities will also remove other dissolved constituents, such as sulfates. Construction of the West Virginia facility is scheduled to be completed in 2013 with a total estimated cost of approximately $110 million to $120 million. These facilities utilize state of the art equipment for water treatment including reverse osmosis, evaporation and crystallization technologies. In 2011, CONSOL Energy will also complete construction of pipelines with diffusers to convey high chloride mine water from the active 67 Table of Contents Shoemaker Mine and the closed Windsor Mine and discharge those waters into approved mixing zones in the Ohio River. Finally, at the Bailey Mine in Pennsylvania, CONSOL Energy will start construction in 2011 of a new water handling system that will prevent discharge of water containing high total dissolved solids into area streams. Although these items primarily impact CONSOL Energys coal business, management continues to believe our coal business will be successful in developing economic solutions to address these matters. Our coal business is also expected to continue to generate expanding margins due to: Our low volatile metallurgical coal business with our Buchanan Mine; Our high volatile metallurgical coal business, where we are selling Northern Appalachian coal to Asian and Brazilian steelmakers at expanded margins; and Lower thermal coal stockpiles. We believe that coal will continue to provide the base load of the nations energy needs. Through our efforts during the last 10 years to improve our operating efficiencies at our major coal production sites, we believe we are well positioned to continue to provide our customers with low cost, high British thermal units (btus) coal that we expect will generate returns to our shareholders. Finally, CONSOL Energy is managing several other significant matters that will affect our business in the future: The United Mine Workers of America (UMWA) collective bargaining agreement expires on December 31, 2011. Results of future agreements could have a significant effect on future cash flows and earnings of CONSOL Energy. If a new collective bargaining agreement is not reached, CONSOL Energy could be impacted by work stoppages, which would impact our future coal production. Consolidation of CONSOL Energys customer base continues to occur. These consolidations may impact the creditworthiness of our customers, the amount of coal or gas a customer buys in a given year, and the terms of new sales contracts. Health care reform legislation included a revision to coal workers pneumoconiosis (CWP) regulations which will enable claimants to more easily qualify for a benefit. The legislation also allows for a five year look back on claims to determine if a previously denied claim will now become eligible. The new legislation impacted CONSOL Energys CWP liability by approximately $46 million, as described more fully in Note 16 Coal Workers Pneumoconiosis (CWP) and Workers Compensation in the Notes to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. CONSOL Energy continues to evaluate the potential sale of certain Central Appalachia metallurgical coal properties as well as other non core assets. To date, there are no definitive agreements in place and evaluation of proposals continue. Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2010 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2009 Net Income Attributable to CONSOL Energy Shareholders CONSOL Energy reported net income attributable to CONSOL Energy shareholders of $347 million, or $1.60 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2010. Net income attributable to CONSOL Energy shareholders was $540 million, or $2.95 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2009. See below for a detailed explanation by segment of the variance incurred in the period to period comparison. 68 Table of Contents The total coal segment includes steam coal, high volatile metallurgical coal, low volatile metallurgical coal and other coal. The total coal segment contributed $536 million of earnings before income tax for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $546 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The total coal segment sold 63.0 million tons of coal produced from CONSOL Energy mines, excluding our portion of tons sold from equity affiliates, in the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 57.4 million tons in the year ended December 31, 2009. The average sales price and total costs per ton for all active coal operations were as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 Variance PercentChange Average Sales Price per ton sold $ 61.33 $ 58.70 $ 2.63 4.5 % Average Costs per ton sold 45.44 43.13 2.31 5.4 % Margin $ 15.89 $ 15.57 $ 0.32 2.1 % The higher average sales price per ton sold reflects an additional 2.3 million tons of low volatile metallurgical coal and 2.4 million tons of high volatile metallurgical coal sold in 2010 compared to 2009. The low volatile metallurgical coal segment also had a higher average sales price in 2010 compared to 2009 reflecting the strengthening of the global steel market and steel related products. The high volatile metallurgical coal global market has allowed approximately 2.4 million tons of coal to be sold as a metallurgical product at an average sales price of $72.89 per ton. This coal historically would have been sold on the steam market where our average price for 2010 was $53.76 per ton. Average costs per ton of coal sold have increased in the period to period comparison due primarily to additional labor, higher supply and maintenance costs, and increased other costs which are directly related to the higher sales prices received for tons sold. Additional labor costs per ton are related to the net addition of approximately 330 employees. The additional labor was attributed to the Shoemaker Mine resuming production in 2010 after being idled throughout 2009 to complete the replacement of the track haulage system to a more efficient belt haulage system. Additional labor was also added in order to run our mines more safely, to prepare for the expected retirement of a significant portion of our work force over the next five years, and to keep the development of the longwall panels ahead of longwall advancement. Additional supply costs were attributable to compliance with new safety regulations such as fire retardant belts, additional equipment maintenance and various changes in roof control measures. Costs directly related to the price received for coal sales have also increased. These costs include royalty expenses and various production taxes. The total gas segment includes coalbed methane (CBM), conventional, Marcellus and other gas. The total gas segment contributed $180 million of earnings before income tax for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $263 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Total gas production was 127.9 billion cubic feet for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 94.4 billion cubic feet for the year ended December 31, 2009. The average sales price and total costs for all active gas operations were as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 Variance PercentChange Average Sales Price per thousand cubic feet sold $ 5.83 $ 6.68 $ (0.85 ) (12.7 )% Average Costs per thousand cubic feet sold 3.90 3.44 0.46 13.4 % Margin $ 1.93 $ 3.24 $ (1.31 ) (40.4 )% Total gas segment outside sales revenues were $746 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $630 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase was primarily due to the 35.5% 69 Table of Contents increase in volumes sold, offset, in part, by the 12.7% reduction in average price per thousand cubic feet sold. The decrease in average sales price is the result of various gas swap transactions that occurred throughout both periods. These gas swap transactions qualify as financial cash flow hedges that exist parallel to the underlying physical transactions. These financial hedges represented approximately 52.1 billion cubic feet of our produced gas sales volumes for the year ended December 31, 2010 at an average price of $7.66 per thousand cubic feet. These financial hedges represented approximately 51.6 billion cubic feet of our produced gas sales volumes for the year ended December 31, 2009 at an average price of $8.76 per thousand cubic feet. Average gas sales prices excluding the impact of hedging were up slightly in the period to period comparison. Total gas unit costs increased for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the year ended December 31, 2009 primarily due to the impact of the higher cost structure of the producing wells purchased in the Dominion Acquisition. These wells increased total operating costs by $0.78 per thousand cubic feet due to the higher maintenance costs, higher gathering and transportation costs and lower volumes produced compared to the legacy CONSOL Energy wells. Excluding the impact of these purchased wells, unit costs improved $0.32 per thousand cubic feet primarily due to the additional volumes produced. Volumes increased in the period to period comparison due to the on going drilling program and the additional volumes from the wells purchased in the Dominion Acquisition. The other segment includes industrial supplies activity, terminal and river service activity, income taxes and other business activities not assigned to the coal or gas segment. 70 Table of Contents TOTAL COAL SEGMENT ANALYSIS for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the year ended December 31, 2009: The coal segment contributed $536 million of earnings before income tax in the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $546 million in the year ended December 31, 2009. Variances by the individual coal segments are discussed below.

The Steam coal revenue and cost components on a per unit basis are as follows: 2010 2009 Variance PercentChange Produced Steam Tons Sold (in millions) 55.8 55.1 0.7 1.3 % Average Sales Price Per Steam Ton Sold $ 53.76 $ 56.64 $ (2.88 ) (5.1 )% Average Operating Costs Per Steam Ton Sold $ 33.14 $ 31.57 $ 1.57 5.0 % Average Provision Costs Per Steam Ton Sold $ 3.55 $ 3.27 $ 0.28 8.6 % Average Selling, Administrative and Other Costs Per Steam Ton Sold $ 2.55 $ 2.60 $ (0.05 ) (1.9 )% Average Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization Costs Per Steam Ton Sold $ 4.90 $ 4.68 $ 0.22 4.7 % Total Costs Per Steam Ton Sold $ 44.14 $ 42.12 $ 2.02 4.8 % Margin $ 9.62 $ 14.52 $ (4.90 ) (33.7 )% 71 Table of Contents Steam coal revenue was $3,001 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $3,122 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The $121 million decrease was attributable to an average sales price reduction of $2.88 per ton partially offset by a 0.7 million increase in tons sold. Steam coal average sales price is lower in the 2010 period compared to the 2009 period as a result of higher average sales price mines, such as Bailey and Enlow Fork, selling coal in the high volatile metallurgical coal market instead of the steam coal market. This impacted the steam coal segment as a result of leaving more tons sold from lower sales price mines. This has negatively impacted the average sales price on the steam coal segment, although total company revenue has improved. Produced steam inventory was 1.9 million tons at December 31, 2010 compared to 2.9 million tons at December 31, 2009. Steam sales tons were higher in the period to period comparison primarily due to the Shoemaker Mine restarting production in early 2010 after being idled throughout 2009 to complete the replacement of the track haulage system. Steam sales tons were also higher as the result of the Blacksville #2 Mine being idled for several months in 2009 in order to manage inventory levels in response to the economic crisis experienced. Blacksville #2 Mine has operated throughout 2010. These increases were offset, in part, due to selling 2.4 million tons on the high volatile metallurgical coal market at approximately $19.13 per ton higher average sales price. Other income attributable to the steam coal segment represents earnings from our equity affiliate that operates a steam coal mine. The equity in earnings of affiliates is insignificant to the total segment activity. Operating costs are made up of labor, supplies, maintenance, subsidence, taxes other than income, royalties and preparation plant charges related to the extraction and sale of coal. These costs are reviewed regularly by management and are considered to be the direct responsibility of mine management. Operating costs related to the steam coal segment were $1,850 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $1,740 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Higher operating costs in the period to period comparison are due to the $1.57 per ton increase in average unit costs of tons sold and 0.7 million of additional tons sold. Higher average operating costs per unit for steam coal tons sold are primarily related to the following items: Steam coal unit costs were higher in 2010 as a result of lower cost mines, such as Bailey and Enlow Fork, selling coal in the high volatile metallurgical coal market. This impacted the steam coal segment due to increased tons sold from higher cost mines. Labor costs increased due to the effects of wage increases at the union mines from the current labor contracts. The contracts call for specified hourly wage increases in each year of the contract. Labor costs also increased due to the effects of wage increases at the non represented mines. Average employee counts also increased approximately 5% at our active mining operations. The additional employees were primarily due to the Shoemaker Mine resuming production in 2010 after being idled during 2009 to complete the replacement of the track haulage system to a more efficient belt haulage system. Additional employees were also added in order to run our mines more safely, to prepare for the expected retirement of a significant portion of our work force over the next five years, and to keep the development of the longwall panels ahead of longwall advancement. Health and retirement costs related to the active hourly work force increased due to higher contributions to the multiemployer 1974 pension trust that are required under the National Bituminous Coal Wage Agreement. The contribution rate increased from $4.25 per hour worked by members of the United Mine Workers Union of America (UMWA) in the year ended December 31, 2009 to $5.00 per hour worked in the year ended December 31, 2010. Contributions to the multiemployer plan are expensed as incurred. Health and Retirement costs have also increased in the period to period comparison due to higher medical costs for the active hourly work force. Power costs increased due to higher rates charged by utility companies and increased usage in the period to period comparison. Operating costs also increased as a result of the 1.0 million ton decrease in inventory levels. 72 Table of Contents The increases in average unit costs of steam coal sold were offset, in part, by the following: Reduced contract mining fees due to fewer contractors being retained to mine our reserves in the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the 2009 period. Average operating costs per steam ton sold decreased due to higher tons sold. Fixed costs are allocated over higher tons resulting in decreased unit costs. Total CONSOL Energy expenses related to our actuarial liabilities were $287 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $243 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase of $44 million was due primarily to changes in the discount rates used at the measurement date, which is December 31, and changes in assumptions which affect the amount of actuarial gains and losses amortized into earnings. See Note 15 Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits Plans and Note 16 Coal Workers Pneumoconiosis (CWP) and Workers Compensation in the Notes to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10 K for additional detail regarding total company expense. Total provisions are made up of the expenses related to the Companys long term liabilities, such as other post employment benefits (OPEB), the salary retirement plan, workers compensation, long term disability and accretion expense on mine closing and related liabilities. With the exception of accretion expense on mine closing and related liabilities, these expenses are actuarially calculated for the company as a whole. The expenses are then allocated to operational units based on active employee counts or active salary dollars. Accretion is calculated on a mine by mine basis. Provisions attributable to the steam coal segment were $198 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $180 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Provision costs per steam coal ton sold increased $0.28 per ton in the period to period comparison due primarily to higher actuarial expenses, such as OPEB, as discussed above. The overall increase in company costs has increased the total dollars allocated to the steam coal segment. This increase was offset, in part, by additional tons sold by the steam coal segment. Total Company Selling, General and Administrative Expenses were made up of the following items: 2010 2009 Variance PercentChange Employee wages and related expenses $ 72 $ 63 $ 9 14.3 % Commissions 12 7 5 71.4 % Miscellaneous 66 61 5 8.2 % Total Company Selling, General and Administrative Expenses $ 150 $ 131 $ 19 14.5 % Employee wages and related expenses have increased due to additional employees in the selling, general and administrative area primarily related to support staff retained in the Dominion Acquisition and additional hiring to support operations. Increased employee wages and related expenses are also related to additional actuarial expenses discussed above. Commission expenses increased $5 million due to additional tons for which a third party was owed a commission compared to the prior year period. Miscellaneous expenses have increased approximately $5 million. The increase was related to an additional $2 million for advertising and promotion fees, an additional $2 million for demurrage charges and an additional $1 million for various other items, none of which were individually material. Total administrative and other costs related to the steam coal segment were $142 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 and $144 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Selling, general and administrative costs, excluding selling expense, are allocated to all segments based on a combination of estimated time worked by various support groups and operating costs incurred by the individual segments. Commission expense, which is a component of selling, is charged directly to the mine incurring the cost. Direct 73 Table of Contents administrative costs are associated directly with the coal segment of the business and are allocated to various mines based on a combination of estimated time worked and production. Although the total company selling, general and administrative costs have increased, as discussed above, the amount allocated to the steam coal segment has decreased approximately $2 million. The decrease in the amount allocated to the steam coal segment is primarily related to the high volatile metallurgical coal segment. In 2009, these tons and the associated allocation were all included in the steam coal segment. Depreciation, depletion and amortization costs for the steam coal segment were $274 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 and $258 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase of $16 million, or $0.22 per ton, was due to additional equipment and infrastructure placed into service after 2009, offset, in part, by additional volumes sold. HIGH VOL METALLURGICAL COAL SEGMENT: The high volatile metallurgical coal segment contributed $87 million to total company earnings before income tax for the year ended December 31, 2010. There was no activity in this segment in the prior year. This is a new market that has developed in 2010 and is primarily related to selling our Pittsburgh #8 coal into overseas metallurgical coal markets. This coal had historically supplied the domestic steam coal market. The high volatile metallurgical coal revenue and cost components on a per unit basis are as follows: 2010 2009 Variance PercentChange Produced High Vol Met Tons Sold (in millions) 2.4 2.4 100.0 % Average Sales Price Per High Vol Met Ton Sold $ 72.89 $ $ 72.89 100.0 % Average Operating Costs Per High Vol Met Ton Sold $ 29.16 $ $ 29.16 100.0 % Average Provision Costs Per High Vol Met Ton Sold $ 3.08 $ $ 3.08 100.0 % Average Selling, Administrative and Other Costs Per High Vol Met Ton Sold $ 2.26 $ $ 2.26 100.0 % Average Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization Costs Per High Vol Met Ton Sold $ 4.61 $ $ 4.61 100.0 % Total Costs per High Vol Met Ton Sold $ 39.11 $ $ 39.11 100.0 % Margin $ 33.78 $ $ 33.78 100.0 % The high volatile metallurgical coal segment revenue was $172 million, or an average sales price per ton of $72.89, for the year ended December 31, 2010. Strength in the metallurgical coal market has allowed for the export of Northern Appalachian coal, historically sold domestically on the steam coal market, to crossover to the metallurgical coal markets in Brazil and Asia. Total costs per ton sold of this coal were $39.11 generating a margin of $33.78 per ton sold. This margin exceeds the $9.62 per ton average margin received on steam coal sold in 2010 which is where this coal would have been historically sold. Other income attributable to the high volatile metallurgical coal segment represents earnings from our equity affiliates that operate mines that sell coal on the high volatile metallurgical coal market. The equity in earnings of affiliates is insignificant to the total segment activity. 74 Table of Contents LOW VOL METALLURGICAL COAL SEGMENT: The low volatile metallurgical coal segment contributed $382 million to total company earnings before income tax for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $94 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase was due primarily to the Buchanan Mine being idled for approximately five months of 2009. The mine was idled in 2009 in response to the economic crisis which significantly lowered the demand for low volatile metallurgical coal, primarily due to the decrease in steel demand. The Buchanan Mine has operated throughout all of 2010. The low volatile metallurgical coal revenue and cost components on a per unit basis are as follows: 2010 2009 Variance PercentChange Produced Low Vol Met Tons Sold (in millions) 4.6 2.3 2.3 100.0 % Average Sales Price Per Low Vol Met Ton Sold $ 146.32 $ 107.72 $ 38.60 35.8 % Average Operating Costs Per Low Vol Met Ton Sold $ 49.82 $ 50.31 $ (0.49 ) (1.0 )% Average Provision Costs Per Low Vol Met Ton Sold $ 5.90 $ 6.76 $ (0.86 ) (12.7 )% Average Selling, Administrative and Other Costs Per Low Vol Met Ton Sold $ 3.95 $ 4.57 $ (0.62 ) (13.6 )% Average Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization Costs Per Low Vol Met Ton Sold $ 4.57 $ 5.46 $ (0.89 ) (16.3 )% Total Costs Per Low Vol Met Ton Sold $ 64.24 $ 67.10 $ (2.86 ) (4.3 )% Margin $ 82.08 $ 40.62 $ 41.46 102.1 % Average sales price for low volatile metallurgical coal has increased $38.60 per ton, from the prior year, to $146.32 for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase of 35.8% is mainly due to the strengthening of the global market for steel and steel related products when compared to 2009. Total costs per ton sold of low volatile metallurgical coal were $64.24 per ton for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $67.10 per ton for the year ended December 31, 2009. The $2.86 per ton improvement was related to operating the Buchanan Mine for all of 2010 versus seven months of 2009. The additional tonnage sold in 2010 has reduced the average per unit costs. OTHER COAL SEGMENT: The Other Coal segment had a loss before income tax of $478 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to a loss before income tax of $355 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The Other Coal segment includes purchased coal activities, idled mine activities as well as various other activities assigned to the coal segment but not allocated to each individual mine. Other Coal segment produced coal sales revenue was $12 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. This revenue includes the sale of incidental tonnage recovered during the reclamation process at idled facilities. The primary focus of activity at these locations is reclaiming disturbed land in accordance with permit requirements after final mining has occurred. The tons sold from these activities are incidental to total company production and sales. Purchased coal sales were $34 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $39 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Purchased coal sales consist of revenues from processing third party coal in our preparation plants for blending purposes to meet customer coal specifications, coal purchased from third parties and sold directly to our customers and revenues from processing third party coal in our preparation plants for a fee. Freight revenue is the amount billed to customers for transportation costs incurred. This revenue is based on weight of coal shipped, negotiated freight rates and method of transportation (i.e. rail, barge, truck, etc.) used by 75 Table of Contents the customers to which CONSOL Energy contractually provides transportation services. Freight revenue is offset in freight expense. Freight revenue was $126 million in the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $149 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The decrease of $23 million was primarily due to lower tons being shipped on CONSOL Energy freight contracts in the period to period comparison. Miscellaneous other income was $48 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $70 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The $22 million decrease was due to the following items: In the year ended December 31, 2009, $12 million of income was recognized related to contracts with certain customers that were unable to take delivery of previously contracted coal tonnage. These customers agreed to buy out their contracts in order to be released from the requirements of taking delivery of previously committed tons. No such transactions were entered into in the year ended December 31, 2010. Gain on sales of assets attributable to the Other Coal segment were $9 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $16 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The change was related to various transactions that occurred throughout both periods, none of which were individually material. Coal royalty income from third parties was $15 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $17 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The decrease was related to lower tons mined by third parties from our coal reserves in the period to period comparison. In the year ended December 31, 2009, mark to market adjustments for free standing coal sales options resulted in approximately a $2 million reversal of previously recognized unrealized losses. The reversal of the losses was primarily due to the decrease in market price of coal in 2009 compared to 2008. No such transactions existed in the year ended December 31, 2010. Other income increased $1 million due to various transactions that occurred throughout both periods, none of which were individually material. Other coal segment total costs were $698 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $613 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase of $85 million was due to the following items: Closed and idle mine costs increased approximately $77 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 to $215 million from $138 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase in closed and idle mine costs was primarily related to additional reclamation liabilities recognized at the Fola mining operation in West Virginia. As a result of market conditions, permitting issues, new regulatory requirements and resulting changes in mine plans, the reclamation liability associated with the Fola operation increased approximately $81 million. Additional closed and idle mine costs in 2010 were also related to a $14 million charge as a result of a change in the mine plan at Mine 84. As a result of the mine plan change, a portion of the previously developed area of the mine has been abandoned. These increases were offset, in part, by approximately $18 million for changes in the operational status of various other mines, between idled and operating, throughout both periods which resulted in lower idled mine costs in 2010. Shoemaker Mine was idled throughout 2009 while the track haulage system was converted to a belt haulage system. This mine was in production throughout 2010. Litigation expense of $25 million was recognized for the year ended December 31, 2010 related to a settlement that was reached in June 2010. The litigation was related to water discharge from our Buchanan Mine being stored in mine voids of adjacent properties which were leased by CONSOL Energy subsidiaries. Cost of goods sold and other charges have increased approximately $13 million related to excess purchase price over appraised values for various land purchases that have been made throughout the year. Accounting guidance requires assets purchased to be recognized at the appraised value; synergies 76 Table of Contents and related specific value to CONSOL Energy cannot be reflected as an asset. Various land deals in strategic areas for items such as refuse ponds, overland belts and various other key projects often require premiums over fair value, thus resulting in additional expense to CONSOL Energy at the time of the transaction. Litigation settlement expense of $11 million was recognized for the year ended December 31, 2010 related to the sale of the Jones Fork Mining Complex. Cost of goods sold and other charges have increased approximately $8 million due to various asset abandonments throughout the period, none of which were individually material. These abandonments primarily related to engineering work, permitting work and mapping work for miscellaneous projects that are no longer being pursued by the Company. Purchased coal consists of costs from processing purchased coal in our preparation plants for blending purposes to meet customer coal specifications, coal purchased and sold directly to the customer and costs for processing third party coal in our preparation plants. These costs were $40 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $46 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The decrease of $6 million was primarily due to reduced purchased coal volumes in the period to period comparison. Litigation expense of $17 million was recognized for the year ended December 31, 2009 related to amounts accrued for the settlement of the Levisa Action and the Pobst/Combs Action. This litigation related to depositing water in mine voids which a subsidiary of CONSOL Energy leased. Freight expense is based on weight of coal shipped, negotiated freight rates and method of transportation (i.e. rail, barge, truck, etc.) used by the customers to which CONSOL Energy contractually provides transportation services. Freight expense is offset in freight revenue. Freight expense was $126 million in the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $149 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The decrease of $23 million was primarily due to fewer tons shipped on CONSOL Energy freight contracts in the period to period comparison. Other costs have decreased $3 million primarily due to various contingent liabilities related to potential legal settlements as well as various other transactions that have occurred throughout both periods, none of which are individually material. 77 Table of Contents TOTAL GAS SEGMENT ANALYSIS for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the year ended December 31, 2009: The gas segment contributed $180 million to earnings before income tax for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $263 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Variances by the individual gas segments are discussed below.

The CBM segment revenue and cost components on a per unit basis are as follows: 2010 2009 Variance PercentChange Produced gas CBM sales volumes (in billion cubic feet) 91.4 86.9 4.5 5.2 % Average CBM sales price per thousand cubic feet sold $ 6.27 $ 6.87 $ (0.60 ) (8.7 )% Average CBM lifting costs per thousand cubic feet sold $ 0.54 $ 0.57 $ (0.03 ) (5.3 )% Average CBM gathering costs per thousand cubic feet sold $ 1.06 $ 1.01 $ 0.05 5.0 % Average CBM general & administrative costs per thousand cubic feet sold $ 0.70 $ 0.71 $ (0.01 ) (1.4 )% Average CBM depreciation, depletion and amortization costs per thousand cubic feet sold $ 1.24 $ 1.08 $ 0.16 14.8 % Total CBM costs per thousand cubic feet sold $ 3.54 $ 3.37 $ 0.17 5.0 % Margin $ 2.73 $ 3.50 $ (0.77 ) (22.0 )% 78 Table of Contents CBM sales revenues were $573 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $597 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The decrease was primarily due to the 8.7% reduction in average price per thousand cubic feet sold, offset, in part, by the 5.2% increase in volumes sold. The decrease in CBM average sales price is the result of various gas swap transactions at a lower average price as compared to the prior year. These gas swap transactions qualify as financial cash flow hedges that exist parallel to the underlying physical transactions. These financial hedges represented approximately 50.5 billion cubic feet of our produced CBM gas sales volumes for the year ended December 31, 2010 at an average price of $7.73 per thousand cubic feet. These financial hedges represented approximately 51.6 billion cubic feet of our produced CBM gas sales volumes for the year ended December 31, 2009 at an average price of $8.76 per thousand cubic feet. Average gas sales prices excluding the impact of hedging were $4.47 per thousand cubic feet in 2010 compared to $4.13 per thousand cubic feet in 2009. CBM sales volumes increased 4.5 billion cubic feet primarily due to additional wells coming online from our on going drilling program. We had 3,945 net CBM Wells at December 31, 2010 compared to 3,688 net CBM wells at December 31, 2009. Also, 2009 CBM volumes were lower by approximately 1.2 billion cubic feet of deferrals related to the idling of the Buchanan Mine for approximately five months during 2009. Total costs for the CBM gas segment were $325 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $293 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The $32 million increase in total costs in the period to period comparison reflects the 5.0% increase in average unit costs and the 5.2% increase in sales volumes. CBM lifting costs were $50 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $49 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Average CBM lifting costs per unit were $0.54 per thousand cubic feet for 2010 compared to $0.57 per thousand cubic feet for 2009. The improvement in average CBM lifting costs per unit was due to lower salt water disposal costs attributable to recycling the water produced from our wells to be used in hydraulic fracturing of new wells. Previously, fees were incurred to dispose of the salt water produced from our wells. Unit costs were also improved due to higher volumes of CBM gas sold in the period to period comparison resulting in fixed costs being spread over additional volumes, lowering the average per unit costs. These improvements were offset, in part, by higher severance taxes. Higher severance taxes were the result of average market price increases, excluding the impact of our hedging program. Severance taxes are also higher as a result of the Buchanan County, Virginia severance tax settlement which changed the deductions allowed in the calculation of severance tax due when the price of gas falls between certain ranges. See Note 24 Commitments and Contingent Liabilities in the Notes to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10 K for further discussion. CBM Gathering costs were $97 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $88 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Average CBM gathering cost were $1.06 per thousand cubic feet sold for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $1.01 per thousand cubic feet sold for the year ended December 31, 2009. Higher average unit costs were related to higher power costs attributable to utility rate increases in the period to period comparison as well as increased usage. Higher average unit costs were also attributable to additional in transit costs related to additional capacity of firm transportation being purchased after 2009 to assure delivery of additional volumes being produced. These cost increases were offset, in part, by the 5.2% increase in volumes sold. General and administrative costs attributable to the Total Gas segment have increased $26 million to $93 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $67 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase was attributable to additional staffing and additional corporate service charges from CONSOL Energy. With the Dominion Acquisition, which closed on April 30, 2010, the majority of the operational support personnel were retained. Total Company general and administrative costs have also increased, as explained previously, which resulted in additional charges being allocated to all segments. General and administrative costs attributable to the CBM gas segment were $65 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $62 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. General and administrative expenses attributable to the Total Gas segment are allocated to each individual gas segment based on a 79 Table of Contents combination of production and employee counts. Although Total Gas general and administrative costs have increased $26 million, as discussed above, the percentage allocated to the CBM segment is lower, on a unit basis, as the result of CBM production volumes to total gas volumes produced being lower primarily due to the Dominion Acquisition. Depreciation, depletion and amortization attributable to the CBM segment was $113 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $94 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. There was approximately $87 million, or $0.95 per unit of production, of depreciation, depletion and amortization related to CBM gas and related well equipment that was reflected on a units of production method of depreciation in the year ended December 31, 2010. The unit of production portion of depreciation, depletion and amortization was $71 million, or $0.82 per unit of production in the year ended December 31, 2009. The CBM unit of production rate used to calculate depreciation in the current year is generally calculated using the net book value of assets divided by either proved or proved developed reserves at the previous year end. The in field drilling program and certain assets acquired in the Dominion Acquisition caused the rate to increase. There was approximately $26 million, or $0.29 per thousand cubic feet of depreciation, depletion and amortization related to gathering and other equipment that is reflected on a straight line basis for the year ended December 31, 2010. The straight line component was $23 million, or $0.26 per thousand cubic feet for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase was related to additional gathering assets placed in service after 2009, offset, in part, by the increase in volumes in the period to period comparison. CONVENTIONAL SEGMENT: The conventional segment had a loss before income tax of $4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to a loss before income tax of $2 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The conventional segment revenue and cost components on a per unit basis are as follows: 2010 2009 Variance PercentChange Produced gas Conventional sales volumes (in billion cubic feet) 24.6 1.7 22.9 1,347.1 % Average Conventional sales price per thousand cubic feet sold $ 4.73 $ 4.33 $ 0.40 9.2 % Average Conventional lifting costs per thousand cubic feet sold $ 1.24 $ 2.76 $ (1.52 ) (55.1 )% Average Conventional gathering costs per thousand cubic feet sold $ 0.75 $ 0.59 $ 0.16 27.1 % Average Conventional general & administrative costs per thousand cubic feet sold $ 0.88 $ 0.46 $ 0.42 91.3 % Average Conventional depreciation, depletion and amortization costs per thousand cubic feet sold $ 2.05 $ 2.30 $ (0.25 ) (10.9 )% Total Conventional costs per thousand cubic feet sold $ 4.92 $ 6.11 $ (1.19 ) (19.5 )% Margin $ (0.19 ) $ (1.78 ) $ 1.59 (89.3 )% Conventional segment sales revenues were $116 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Conventional sales volumes increased 22.9 billion cubic feet for the year ended December 31, 2010 primarily due to the Dominion Acquisition. Approximately 95% of the acquired producing wells were conventional type wells. There were 8,517 net conventional wells at December 2010 compared to 195 net conventional wells at December 31, 2009. No conventional gas volumes were hedged in 2010 or 2009. Total costs for the conventional segment were $120 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $10 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase of $110 million is attributable to additional volumes sold in the period to period comparison, offset, in part, by lower average unit costs sold. Conventional average unit costs have decreased due to the significant increase in volumes related to production from wells acquired in the Dominion Acquisition. A detailed analysis of cost categories is not meaningful due to the significant change in this segment related to the Dominion Acquisition and will therefore not be presented. 80 Table of Contents General and administrative costs attributable to the Total Gas segment are allocated to each individual gas segment based on a combination of production and employee counts. Conventional volumes are higher as a percent of total gas produced volumes in the period to period comparison and therefore, additional general and administrative costs have been allocated to the conventional gas segment in 2010. MARCELLUS SEGMENT: The Marcellus segment contributed $5 million to the total company earnings before income tax for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $4 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The Marcellus segment revenue and cost components on a per unit basis are as follows: 2010 2009 Variance PercentChange Produced gas Marcellus sales volumes (in billion cubic feet) 10.2 5.0 5.2 104.0 % Average Marcellus sales price per thousand cubic feet sold $ 4.68 $ 4.24 $ 0.44 10.4 % Average Marcellus lifting costs per thousand cubic feet sold $ 0.48 $ 0.12 $ 0.36 300.0 % Average Marcellus gathering costs per thousand cubic feet sold $ 1.01 $ 1.12 $ (0.11 ) (9.8 )% Average Marcellus general & administrative costs per thousand cubic feet sold $ 0.75 $ 0.74 $ 0.01 1.4 % Average Marcellus depreciation, depletion and amortization costs per thousand cubic feet sold $ 1.93 $ 1.47 $ 0.46 31.3 % Total Marcellus costs per thousand cubic feet sold $ 4.17 $ 3.45 $ 0.72 20.9 % Margin $ 0.51 $ 0.79 $ (0.28 ) (35.4 )% The increase in Marcellus average sales price was the result of an improvement in general market prices and various gas swap transactions that occurred in the year ended December 31, 2010. These gas swap transactions qualify as financial cash flow hedges that exist parallel to the underlying physical transactions. These financial hedges represented approximately 1.6 billion cubic feet of our produced Marcellus gas sales volumes for the year ended December 31, 2010 at an average price of $5.05 per thousand cubic feet. There were no gas swap transactions for the Marcellus segment that occurred for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase in sales volumes was primarily due to additional wells coming online from our on going drilling program. At December 31, 2010 there were 52 Marcellus Shale wells in production including 17 wells acquired in the Dominion Acquisition. At December 31, 2009 there were 22 Marcellus Shale wells in production. Total costs for the Marcellus segment were $43 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $17 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase was primarily due to the additional sales volumes and higher average unit costs. Marcellus lifting costs were $5 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $1 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Average Marcellus lifting costs were $0.48 per thousand cubic feet in 2010 compared to $0.12 per thousand cubic feet in 2009. The increase in average lifting costs per unit sold was due to increased road repairs and other maintenance expense primarily related to the additional number of wells drilled in the current period. Salt water disposal fees were also higher in the period to period comparison due to the higher volume of water produced from additional wells. These increases in costs were offset, in part, by the additional volume of Marcellus gas sold in the period to period comparison. Marcellus gathering costs were $10 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $5 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Average gathering cost per unit sold was $1.01 per thousand cubic feet for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $1.12 per thousand cubic feet for the year ended December 31, 2009. Lower average gathering cost per unit was primarily attributable to the 104.0% increase in volumes sold. This improvement was offset, in part, by higher power and security costs. Higher power costs were related to higher rates being charged by utility companies in the period to period comparison. Higher security costs were related to additional security needs at various Marcellus gathering stations. 81 Table of Contents General and administrative costs attributable to the Marcellus gas segment were $8 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $4 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Average general and administrative costs on a per unit sold basis were $0.75 per thousand cubic feet for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $0.74 per thousand cubic feet for the year ended December 31, 2009. General and administrative costs attributable to the Total Gas segment are allocated to each individual gas segment based on a combination of production and employee counts. The total general and administrative cost increases, as discussed previously, were offset, in part, by higher volumes of gas produced from Marcellus wells. Depreciation, depletion and amortization attributable to the Marcellus segment was $20 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $7 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. There was approximately $18 million, or $1.73 per unit of production, of depreciation, depletion and amortization related to Marcellus gas and related well equipment that was reflected on a units of production method of depreciation in the year ended December 31, 2010. The unit of production portion of depreciation, depletion and amortization was $6 million, or $1.27 per unit of production in the year ended December 31, 2009. The Marcellus unit of production rate used to calculate depreciation in the current year is generally calculated using the net book value of assets divided by either proved or proved developed reserves at the previous year end. The investment in drilling activities increased in higher proportion than the related gas reserves in the current period, which resulted in a higher per unit rate. There was approximately $2 million, or $0.20 per thousand cubic feet of depreciation, depletion and amortization related to gathering and other equipment that is reflected on a straight line basis for the year ended December 31, 2010. The straight line component was $1 million, or $0.20 per thousand cubic feet for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase was related to additional gathering assets placed in service after 2009, offset, in part, by the increase in volumes in the period to period comparison. OTHER GAS SEGMENT: The Other gas segment includes activity not assigned to CBM, Conventional or Marcellus gas segments. This segment includes purchased gas activity, gas royalty interest activity, exploration and other costs, other corporate expenses, and miscellaneous operational activity not assigned to a specific gas segment. The other gas segment had a loss before income tax of $69 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to a loss before income tax of $43 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Other gas sales volumes are primarily related to production from the Chattanooga Shale in Tennessee. Revenue from this operation was approximately $9 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $4 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. There was 1.7 billion cubic feet sold from this area for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 0.8 billion cubic feet for the year ended December 31, 2009. Total costs related to these other sales were $10 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $5 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase in costs in the period to period comparison was primarily due to higher depreciation, depletion and amortization attributable to the additional 0.9 billion cubic feet of gas produced and higher unit of production rates. The higher units of production rates were related to a higher proportion of capital assets placed in service versus the proportion of proved developed reserve additions. A per unit analysis of the other operating costs in Chattanooga is not meaningful due to the low volumes produced in the period to period analysis. Royalty interest gas sales represent the revenues related to the portion of production belonging to royalty interest owners sold by the CONSOL Energy gas segment. The changes in market prices, contractual differences among leases, and the mix of average and index prices used in calculating royalties contributed to the period to period change. Royalty interest gas sales revenues were $63 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $41 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. 2010 2009 Variance PercentChange Gas Royalty Interest Sales Volumes (in billion cubic feet) 14.2 9.8 4.4 44.9 % Average Sales Price Per thousand cubic feet sold $ 4.41 $ 4.17 $ 0.24 5.8 % 82 Table of Contents Purchased gas sales volumes represent volumes of gas we sold at market prices that were purchased from third party producers.

Royalty interest gas costs represent the costs related to the portion of production belonging to royalty interest owners sold by the CONSOL Energy gas segment. The changes in market prices, contractual differences among leases, and the mix of average and index prices used in calculating royalties contributed to the period to period change.

Purchased gas volumes also reflect the impact of pipeline imbalances. The higher average cost per thousand cubic feet is due to overall price changes, contractual differences among customers and the pipeline imbalance. Purchased gas costs were $10 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $6 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. 2010 2009 Variance PercentChange Purchased Gas Volumes (in billion cubic feet) 1.9 1.7 0.2 11.8 % Average Cost per thousand cubic feet sold $ 5.14 $ 3.75 $ 1.39 37.1 % Exploration and other costs were $25 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $17 million for the year ended December 31, 2009.

Land and delay rentals, as well as Exploration, both increased $1 million in the period to period comparison due to various transactions that occurred throughout both periods, none of which were individually material. 83 Table of Contents Other corporate expenses were $56 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $33 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The $23 million increase was due to the following items: 2010 2009 Variance PercentChange Short term incentive compensation $ 24 $ 16 $ 8 50.0 % Stock based compensation 16 11 5 45.5 % Variable interest earnings 4 4 100.0 % Bank fees 4 4 100.0 % Financing and acquisition fees 3 3 100.0 % Contract settlement 3 (3 ) (100.0 )% Other 5 3 2 66.7 % Total Other Corporate Expenses $ 56 $ 33 $ 23 69.7 % The short term incentive compensation program is designed to increase compensation to eligible employees when the gas segment reaches predetermined targets for safety, production and unit cost goals. Short term incentive compensation expense is higher in 2010 due to a 13% increase in employee counts, as well as an increase in the short term incentive compensation allocation to the gas segment. Additional employees in the total company general and administrative area were primarily related to support staff retained in the Dominion Acquisition and additional hiring to support operations. Stock based compensation is higher in the period to period comparison primarily due to the conversion of the CNX Gas performance share units to CONSOL Energy restricted stock units in the year ended December 31, 2009. The conversion resulted in a reduction of approximately $4 million of expense in 2009. Additional expense was also related to stock based compensation allocated from CONSOL Energy to the gas segment in 2010. These increases were offset, in part, by the non vested CNX Gas stock options being terminated in relation to the CNX Gas take in transaction. The expense previously recognized for these options was reversed on the gas segment. All stock based compensation is now allocated from CONSOL Energy. Variable interest earnings are related to various adjustments a third party entity has reflected in its financial statements. CONSOL Energy holds no ownership interest, but guarantees bank loans the entity holds related to its purchases of drilling rigs. CONSOL Energy is also the main customer of the third party, and based on analysis is the primary beneficiary. Therefore, the entity is fully consolidated and then the impact is fully reversed in the noncontrolling interest line discussed below. Banks fees are higher in the period to period comparison due to amending and extending the revolving credit facility related to the gas segment. Financing and acquisition fees are related to legal expenses for the special committee, formed during the CNX Gas take in transaction, and are primarily related to the shareholder litigation. The year ended December 31, 2009 includes $3 million of expense related to a contract buyout with a driller in order to mitigate idle rig charges in certain areas where drilling was not expected to increase in the near term. Other corporate expense increased $2 million in the year to year comparison primarily due to unused firm transportation charges not being allocated to the operating gas segments and various other transactions that occurred throughout both periods, none of which were individually material. Interest expense was $7 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Interest is incurred by the gas segment on the gas segment revolving credit facility, a capital lease and debt held by a variable interest entity. No significant changes in these components occurred in the period to period comparison. 84 Table of Contents Noncontrolling interest represents 100% of the earnings impact of a third party which has been determined to be a variable interest entity, in which the CONSOL Energy gas segment holds no ownership interest, but is the primary beneficiary. The CONSOL Energy gas segment has been determined to be the primary beneficiary due to guarantees of the third partys bank debt related to their purchase of drilling rigs. The third party entity provides drilling services primarily to the CONSOL Energy gas segment. CONSOL Energy consolidates the entity and then reflects 100% of the impact as noncontrolling interest. The consolidation does not significantly impact any amounts reflected in the gas segment income statement. The variance in the noncontrolling interest amounts reflects the third partys variance in earnings in the period to period comparison. OTHER SEGMENT ANALYSIS for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the year ended December 31, 2009: The other segment includes activity from sales of industrial supplies, transportation operations and various other corporate activities that are not allocated to the coal or gas segment. The other segment had a loss before income tax of $249 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to a loss of $22 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The other segment also includes total company income tax expense of $109 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 and $221 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. 2010 2009 Variance PercentChange Sales Outside $ 297 $ 273 $ 24 8.8 % Other Income 29 29 Total Revenue 326 302 24 7.9 % Cost of Goods Sold and Other Charges 349 267 82 30.7 % Depreciation, Depletion & Amortization 18 20 (2 ) (10.0 )% Taxes Other Than Income Tax 10 13 (3 ) (23.1 )% Interest Expense 198 24 174 725.0 % Total Costs 575 324 251 77.5 % Loss Before Income Tax (249 ) (22 ) (227 ) (1,031.8 )% Income Tax 109 221 (112 ) (50.7 )% Net Loss $ (358 ) $ (243 ) $ (115 ) (47.3 )% Industrial Supplies: Total revenues from industrial supply operations were $195 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $196 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Total costs related to industrial supply sales were $197 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $190 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The $7 million increase in expense is primarily due to changes in last in first out valuations. Transportation operations: Total revenue from transportation operations was $114 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $84 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The $30 million increase was primarily attributable to additional through put tons at the Baltimore terminal in the period to period comparison. Total costs related to transportation operations were $81 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $70 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The $11 million increase was primarily related to the additional through put tons at the Baltimore terminal in the period to period comparison. 85 Table of Contents Miscellaneous Other: Other income was $17 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $22 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The $5 million decrease was attributable to $6 million of Other Income for the acceleration of a deferred gain associated with the initial sale leaseback of the Companys previous headquarters in 2009. This was offset by $1 million related to various transactions that occurred throughout both periods, none of which were individually material. Other corporate costs include interest cost, acquisition and financing costs and various other miscellaneous corporate charges. Total other costs were $297 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 and $64 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Other corporate costs increased $233 million due to the following: Interest expense of $198 million was incurred in the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $24 million in the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase of $174 million was primarily attributable to the additional interest expense on the long term bonds that were issued in conjunction with the Dominion Acquisition. Financing and acquisition fees of $62 million were incurred in the year ended December 31, 2010 primarily related to the equity and debt issuance that raised approximately $4.6 billion dollars. These fees also include costs related to extending and refinancing the CONSOL Energy revolving credit facility, the Dominion Acquisition and the purchase of the CNX Gas noncontrolling interest. Bank fees of $16 million were incurred in the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $5 million in the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase of $11 million was primarily related to the refinanced revolving credit facility. Fees related to the disposition of non core assets of $3 million were incurred in the year ended December 31, 2010. Various other corporate expenses were $21 million in the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $18 million in the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase of $3 million was due to various transactions that occurred throughout both periods, none of which were individually material. In the year ended December 31, 2010, there was $3 million of reduced expense related to an adjustment to assumptions used in the 2009 cease use of the Companys previous headquarter liability. The year ended December 31, 2009 included $13 million of expense related to the cease use of the facility. These transactions resulted in a $16 million improvement in the period to period comparison. Severance payments of $4 million were incurred in the year ended December 31, 2009 related to various layoffs that were necessary due to the economic downturn that occurred. Income Taxes: The effective income tax rate was 23.4% for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 28.1% for the year ended December 31, 2009. The effective tax rate is sensitive to the relationship between pre tax earnings and percentage depletion. The proportion of coal pre tax earnings and gas pre tax earnings also impacts the benefit of percentage depletion on the effective tax rate. The mix of pre tax income by state may also impact the overall effective tax rate. The pre tax income mix by state has changed in the period to period comparison due to the Dominion Acquisition. See Note 6 Income Taxes in the Notes to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10 K for additional explanation of the effective tax rate change in the period to period comparison. 2010 2009 Variance PercentChange Total Company Earnings Before Income Taxes $ 468 $ 788 $ (320 ) (40.6 )% Income Tax Expense $ 109 $ 221 $ (112 ) (50.7 )% Effective Income Tax Rate 23.4 % 28.1 % (4.7 )% 86 Table of Contents Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2009 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2008 Net Income Attributable to CONSOL Energy Shareholders CONSOL Energy reported net income attributable to CONSOL Energy shareholders of $540 million, or $2.95 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2009. Net income attributable to CONSOL Energy shareholders was $442 million, or $2.40 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2008. See below for a detailed explanation by segment of the variance incurred in the period to period comparison. The average sales price and total costs for all active coal operations was as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 Variance PercentChange Average Sales Price per ton sold $ 58.70 $ 47.61 $ 11.09 23.3 % Average Costs per ton sold 43.13 39.36 3.77 9.6 % Margin $ 15.57 $ 8.25 $ 7.32 88.7 % The gas segment includes coalbed methane (CBM), conventional, Marcellus and other gas. The segments are determined based on activities from target strata. The other gas segment includes royalty interest activities, purchased gas activities and other activities assigned to the gas segment, but not allocated to each individual component. Prior to 2009, the gas segment was primarily made up of the CBM segment. Less than one percent of sales volumes were attributable to the conventional and Marcellus operations. Due to the insignificant amounts attributable to the conventional and Marcellus activities, a comparison of these operations will not be discussed. The average sales price and total costs for all active gas operations was as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 Variance PercentChange Average Sales Price per thousand cubic feet sold $ 6.68 $ 8.99 $ (2.31 ) (25.7 )% Average Costs per thousand cubic feet sold 3.44 3.66 (0.22 ) (6.0 )% Margin $ 3.24 $ 5.33 $ (2.09 ) (39.2 )% The other segment includes industrial supplies activity, terminal and river service activity, income taxes and other business activities not assigned to the coal or gas segment. 87 Table of Contents TOTAL COAL SEGMENT ANALYSIS for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the year ended December 31, 2008: The Total Coal segment contributed $546 million to earnings before income tax for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $344 million for the year ended December 31, 2008.

Steam coal revenue was $3,122 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $2,723 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase of $399 million was attributable to the higher average price per ton sold, offset, in part, by lower sales volumes of company produced steam coal sold. 2009 2008 Variance PercentChange Produced Steam Tons Sold (in millions) 55.1 61.4 (6.3 ) (10.3 )% Average Sales Price Per Steam Ton Sold $ 56.64 $ 44.31 $ 12.33 27.8 % Average Operating Costs Per Steam Ton Sold $ 31.57 $ 28.70 $ 2.87 10.0 % Average Provision Costs Per Steam Ton Sold $ 3.27 $ 3.01 $ 0.26 8.6 % Average Selling, Administrative and Other Costs Per Steam Ton Sold $ 2.60 $ 2.38 $ 0.22 9.2 % Average Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization Costs Per Steam Ton Sold $ 4.68 $ 4.20 $ 0.48 11.4 % Total Costs Per Steam Ton Sold $ 42.12 $ 38.29 $ 3.83 10.0 % Margin $ 14.52 $ 6.02 $ 8.50 141.2 % 88 Table of Contents The increase in average sales price in the year to year comparison primarily reflects higher prices negotiated in previous periods when there was a significant increase in the global demand for coal. Sales of company produced steam coal shipments decreased in 2009 due to delivery deferments of Central and Northern Appalachian coals. Coal consumption by the electric power sector continued to decline during 2009. Operating costs are made up of labor, supplies, maintenance, subsidence, taxes other than income, royalties and preparation plant charges related to the extraction and sale of coal. These costs are reviewed regularly by management and are considered to be the direct responsibility of mine management. Operating costs related to the steam coal segment were $1,740 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $1,765 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. Higher average operating costs per unit for steam coal tons sold is primarily related to the following items: In general, average operating costs per unit increased due to the reduced amount of tons sold from CONSOL Energy mines. The reduction in tons sold reflected the weak economic environment which affected electricity generation and correspondingly the demand for coal. Fixed costs incurred at our mining operations were spread over fewer tons sold, which negatively impacted average unit costs. Supply costs per unit are higher in 2009 due to higher supply and maintenance costs at several locations. Additional supply and maintenance projects were related to additional preparation plant maintenance, additional belt advancement costs, additional mining equipment maintenance, additional roof support, additional use of contract labor to complete belt projects and additional water handling costs. These increased supply and maintenance costs were offset, in part, by fewer seals being constructed in previously mined areas. Average unit costs of supplies were also impacted by lower sales tons in the year to year comparison. Labor costs have increased due to the effects of wage increases at the union and non represented mines. These contracts call for specified hourly wage increases in each year of the contract. The average increase in unit cost for labor was also impacted by lower sales volumes due to the economic environment as discussed above. Production taxes per steam ton sold increased due to higher average sales prices received for this coal. United Mine Workers of America (UMWA) health and retirement plan expenses increased over 2008 primarily due to the effects of the 2007 labor contract that requires additional contributions to be made into employee benefit funds. The contribution increase over 2008 was $0.42 per United Mine Worker of America hour worked. The average increase in unit costs for health and retirement plans was also impacted by lower sales tons in the year to year comparison. Subsidence costs increased primarily due to the year ended December 31, 2009 including additional expenses related to work to be performed on streams that have been impacted by underground mining in Pennsylvania. The average increase in unit costs for subsidence was also impacted by lower sales tons in the year to year comparison. Total provisions are made up of the expenses related to the companys long term liabilities such as other post employment benefits (OPEB), the salary retirement plan, workers compensation, long term disability and mine closing and related liabilities. With the exception of mine closing and related liabilities accretion expense, these liabilities are actuarially calculated for the company as a whole. The expenses associated with these costs are allocated to operational units based on active employee counts or active salary labor dollars. Mine closing and related liabilities accretion is calculated on a mine by mine basis. The provision expense attributable to the steam coal segment was $180 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $185 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. Total CONSOL Energy expenses related to our actuarial liabilities were $243 million for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008. Provision costs per unit of steam tons sold increased in the period to period comparison due primarily to lower tons sold. 89 Table of Contents Total Company Selling, General and Administrative Expenses: 2009 2008 Variance PercentChange Rentals $ 9 $ 3 $ 6 200.0 % Employee wages and related expenses 63 61 2 3.3 % Miscellaneous 59 61 (2 ) (3.3 )% Total Company Selling, General and Administrative Expenses $ 131 $ 125 $ 6 4.8 % Total company selling, general and administrative costs were $131 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $125 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The $6 million increase was due to the following items: Rentals have increased $6 million primarily due to rent expense related to the new CONSOL Energy headquarters, offset, in part, by reduced rent related to the previous CONSOL Energy and CNX Gas corporate office space that is no longer used. Wages, salaries and related benefits have increased approximately $2 million primarily due to annual salary increases and additional recruiting expenses. Other selling, general and administrative costs decreased $2 million due to various transactions throughout both periods, none of which are individually material. Total administrative and other costs include selling expenses, general and administrative expenses and direct administrative costs. Selling, general and administrative costs, excluding commission expense, are allocated to the mines on a combination of estimated time worked by various support groups and operating costs incurred at the mine. Commission expense, which is a component of selling expense, is charged directly to the mine incurring the cost. Direct administrative costs are associated directly with the coal segment of the business and are allocated to various mines based on a combination of estimated time worked and production. Total administrative and other costs related to the steam coal segment were $144 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $146 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. Average selling, general and administrative costs per unit have increased due to lower steam tons sold in the period to period comparison and higher total company expense as discussed below. Depreciation, depletion and amortization for the steam coal segment was $258 million for both of the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008. Average depreciation, depletion and amortization unit costs increased $0.48 per ton due to lower tons sold in the period to period comparison. LOW VOLATILE METALLURGICAL COAL SEGMENT: The low volatile metallurgical coal segment contributed $94 million to total company earnings before income tax for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $161 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. 90 Table of Contents Low volatile metallurgical coal revenue was $249 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $341 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The decrease of $92 million was due to the lower average price per ton sold and lower sales volumes of company produced low volatile metallurgical coal sold. 2009 2008 Variance PercentChange Produced Low Vol Met Tons Sold (in millions) 2.3 2.9 (0.6 ) (20.7 )% Average Sales Price Per Low Vol Met Ton Sold $ 107.72 $ 117.48 $ (9.76 ) (8.3 )% Average Operating Costs Per Low Vol Met Ton Sold $ 50.31 $ 47.17 $ 3.14 6.7 % Average Provision Costs Per Low Vol Met Ton Sold $ 6.76 $ 5.31 $ 1.45 27.3 % Average Selling, Administrative and Other Costs Per Low Vol Met Ton Sold $ 4.57 $ 4.71 $ (0.14 ) (3.0 )% Average Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization Costs Per Low Vol Met Ton Sold $ 5.46 $ 4.75 $ 0.71 14.9 % Total Costs Per Low Vol Met Ton Sold $ 67.10 $ 61.94 $ 5.16 8.3 % Margin $ 40.62 $ 55.54 $ (14.92 ) (26.9 )% The decrease in average sales price for low volatile metallurgical coal in the year to year comparison reflects lower prices realized due to a downturn in the domestic and international steel business and the deferment of previously negotiated pricing into future periods. Sales of company produced low volatile metallurgical coal decreased in 2009 due to a downturn in the domestic and international steel business resulting in reduced demand for low volatile metallurgical coal and the idling of the Buchanan mine from March 1, 2009 to August 7, 2009. Total costs for the low volatile metallurgical coal segment were $155 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $180 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. A meaningful comparison of unit costs cannot be made because of the low volume of coal produced and sold from the low volatile metallurgical coal segment in 2009, as discussed above. The impairments in unit costs were related to idling the Buchanan mine from March 1, 2009 to August 7, 2009. The 2009 unit costs are not representative of the operating mine due to fixed costs being spread over significantly fewer tons. OTHER COAL SEGMENT: The Other Coal segment had a loss before tax of $355 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to a loss before income tax $186 for the year ended December 31, 2008. The Other Coal segment includes purchased coal activities, closed and idle mine costs, and miscellaneous transactions that are directly related to the coal segment. Purchased coal sales consist of revenues from processing third party coal in our preparation plants for blending purposes to meet customer coal specification, coal purchased from third parties and sold directly to our customers and revenues from processing third party coal in our preparation plants. The revenues were $39 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 and $118 million in the year ended December 31, 2008. The decrease of $79 million in purchased coal revenue was primarily due to a decrease in demand in the year to year comparisons. Freight revenue is the amount billed to customers for transportation costs incurred. This revenue is based on weight of coal shipped, negotiated freight rates and method of transportation (i.e., rail, barge, truck, etc.) used for the customers to which CONSOL Energy contractually provides transportation services. Freight revenue has decreased $68 million in 2009 primarily due to lower domestic shipments to customers for whom CONSOL Energy pays the freight and then passes on the cost to the customer. Freight revenue also decreased due to fewer export sales made to customers whom CONSOL Energy pays the ocean going freight and then passes on the cost to the customer. 91 Table of Contents Miscellaneous other income was $70 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $121 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The $51 million decrease consisted of the following items: In March 2008, CONSOL Energy received notice from its insurance carriers that $50 million would be paid as final settlement of the insurance claim related to the July 2007 Buchanan Mine incident that idled the mine. The $50 million represented business interruption coverage which was recognized in other income; the coal segment recognized $42 million and the gas segment recognized $8 million. The final settlement brought the total amount recovered from insurance carriers to $75 million, the maximum allowed per covered event. Gain on sale of assets decreased $8 million in the year to year comparison due to 2008 including the sale of an idled facility which included the transfer of the mine closing liabilities to the buyer. This transaction resulted in $8 million pre tax gain in 2008. Other miscellaneous income decreased $13 million in the year to year comparison due to various miscellaneous transactions that occurred throughout both periods, none of which were individually material. These decreases were partially offset by the following item: In 2009, $12 million of income was recognized related to contracts with certain customers that were unable to take delivery of previously contracted coal tonnage. These customers agreed to buy out their contracts in order to release them from the requirement of taking delivery of previously committed tons. No such transactions occurred in 2008. Other coal segment total costs were $613 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $642 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The decrease of $29 million was due to the following items: Purchased coal costs decreased $79 million in the year to year comparison. Purchased coal costs consist of expenses from processing third party coal in our preparation plants for blending purposes to meet customer coal specification, cost of coal purchased from third parties and sold directly to our customers and costs related to processing third party coal in our preparation plants. Freight expense decreased $68 million in the year to year comparison. Freight expense is based on weight of coal shipped, negotiated freight rates and method of transportation (i.e., rail, barge, truck, etc.) used for the customers to which CONSOL Energy contractually provides transportation services. Freight expense has decreased primarily due to lower domestic shipments to customers for whom CONSOL Energy pays the freight and then passes on the cost to the customer. Freight expense also decreased due to fewer export sales made to customers whom CONSOL Energy pays the ocean going freight and then passes on the cost to the customer. In July 2007, production at the Buchanan Mine was suspended after several roof falls in previously mined areas damaged some of the ventilation controls inside the mine, requiring a general evacuation of the mine. In 2008, $21 million of costs related to the Buchanan Mine event were incurred. The year ended December 31, 2008 included adjustments related to CONSOL Energy agreements to buy out coal sales contracts with several customers in order to release tons committed under lower priced contracts for sale to other customers at higher prices. The year ended December 31, 2009 included fewer customer buyouts. The costs for these transactions were $2 million in 2009 compared to $19 million in 2008. In the year ended December 31, 2008, $15 million of expense was recognized related to contracts with certain customers who were unable to take delivery of previously contracted coal tonnage. These customers agreed to allow CONSOL Energy to sell the released tonnage, but required CONSOL Energy to split the incremental sales price over the original contract sales price evenly with them. The $15 million represents the additional sales price received for the tonnage sold that is owed to the original customer. 92 Table of Contents Incentive compensation and stock based compensation expense increased $14 million as a result of the Company reaching pre determined targets for production, safety and unit costs and additional awards granted. Royalty expense increased $16 million in the year to year comparison as a result of increased average sales prices and increased volumes mined on leased tracts. Other coal segment costs increased $17 million in 2009 related to litigation expense recognized in conjunction with the Levisa Action and the Pobst/Combs Action. This litigation related to depositing water in mine voids of adjacent properties which were leased by CONSOL Energy subsidiaries. Other miscellaneous costs increased $21 million in the year to year comparison due to various miscellaneous transactions that occurred throughout both periods, none of which were individually material. Closed and idle mine total costs increased $48 million in the year to year comparison. Approximately $38 million of increased expenses were incurred at Mine 84 to remove underground equipment from the mine in preparation of idling and to construct seals to close sections of the underground mine works so that the mine can be maintained in a more efficient manner. Increases were also attributable to the idled Shoemaker Mine incurring approximately $12 million of additional expenses in 2009 related to the continued maintenance of the mine in an idled status. Closed and idle mine total costs also increased $17 million primarily due to changes in the operational status of various other mines between idled and operating, throughout both periods which resulted in higher idled mine costs 2009. These increases were offset, in part, by reductions of $19 million related to mine closing, reclamation and water treatment liabilities. These decreases primarily related to adjustments in engineering estimates of water quality and flows, as well as changes in the credit adjusted risk free interest rates. In 2008, $56 million of refunds related to black lung excise taxes were recognized. The refunds related to the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (the ESSA Act) which was signed into law on October 3, 2008. The EESA Act contained a section that authorized certain coal producers and exporters who had filed a black lung excise tax (BLET) return on or after October 1, 1990, to request a refund of the BLET paid on export sales. The EESA Act required the U.S. Treasury to refund an amount equal to the BLET erroneously paid on export sales in prior years along with interest computed at the statutory rates applicable to overpayments. CONSOL Energy subsequently received approximately $56 million of BLET refunds. Approximately $1 million of additional interest income was recognized in 2009 to adjust estimated interest on these claims to the amount of interest received. 93 Table of Contents TOTAL GAS SEGMENT ANALYSIS for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the year ended December 31, 2008: The Total Gas segment contributed $263 million to earnings before income tax for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $386 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. In the year ended December 31, 2008, approximately 99% of our gas sales volumes were attributable to coalbed methane (CBM). The revenues and costs associated with Conventional and Marcellus production were insignificant, thus a comparison has not been presented. All comparisons and explanations are related to the CBM and Other gas segment.

The decrease is due to the following items. 94 Table of Contents CBM sales revenues decreased $84 million in the year to year comparison. The decrease in outside sales was primarily due to lower average sales prices received, offset, in part, by higher volumes of gas sold. 2009 2008 Variance PercentChange Produced gas CBM sales volumes (in billion cubic feet) 86.9 75.7 11.2 14.8 % Average CBM sales price per thousand cubic feet sold $ 6.87 $ 9.00 $ (2.13 ) (23.7 )% Average CBM lifting costs per thousand cubic feet sold $ 0.57 $ 0.89 $ (0.32 ) (36.0 )% Average CBM gathering costs per thousand cubic feet sold $ 1.01 $ 1.11 $ (0.10 ) (9.0 )% Average CBM general & administrative costs per thousand cubic feet sold $ 0.71 $ 0.78 $ (0.07 ) (9.0 )% Average CBM depreciation, depletion and amortization costs per thousand cubic feet sold $ 1.08 $ 0.92 $ 0.16 17.4 % Total CBM costs per thousand cubic feet sold $ 3.37 $ 3.70 $ (0.33 ) (8.9 )% Margin $ 3.50 $ 5.30 $ (1.80 ) (34.0 )% Sales volumes increased as a result of additional wells coming online from our ongoing drilling program. The decrease in average sales price is the result of the general market price decreases in the year to year comparison. The general market price decline was offset, in part, by the various gas swap transactions entered into by CONSOL Energy. These gas swap transactions qualify as financial cash flow hedges that exist parallel to the underlying physical transactions. These financial hedges represented approximately 51.6 billion cubic feet of our produced gas sales volumes for the year ended December 31, 2009 at an average price of $8.76 per thousand cubic feet. In the year ended December 31, 2008, these financial hedges represented approximately 43.4 billion cubic feet at an average price of $9.25 per thousand cubic feet. CBM lifting costs were $49 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $68 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. Average CBM lifting costs per unit were $0.57 per thousand cubic feet in 2009 compared to $0.89 per thousand cubic feet in 2008. The decrease in average lifting costs was due to reduced severances taxes primarily due to the reduction in average sales prices in the year ended December 31, 2009. The severance tax decrease also includes an expense reduction attributable to a revised estimate of a pending litigation settlement. Well service costs have also decreased due to lower contract service rig hours needed as a result of less pump maintenance being required in the year ended December 31, 2009. These decreases in unit costs were offset, in part, by an increase related to idling various drilling rigs throughout the Company. Some of CONSOL Energys drilling contracts require minimum payments be made to the contracting party when drilling rigs are not being used. The CONSOL Energy drilling program has slowed down pending a change in the economic environment. These charges resulted in an increase to costs. CBM gathering costs were $88 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $84 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase of $4 million was attributable to higher volumes produced during the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the year ended December 31, 2008, offset, in part, by lower average unit costs. Average gathering and compression unit costs were $1.01 per thousand cubic feet in 2009 compared to $1.11 per thousand cubic feet in 2008. The decrease in average gathering and compression costs was attributable to lower gob collection charges primarily due to the Buchanan longwall being idled throughout a portion of 2009. Compression expenses decreased primarily due to a reduction in the number of compressors utilized in the Southwest Pennsylvania operation production field. Due to the slow down in the drilling program in Southwest Pennsylvania, rented compressors have been returned to more appropriately design the gathering fields to meet existing needs. These decreases in unit costs were offset by increases in firm transportation costs primarily due to acquiring additional capacity in the Southwest Pennsylvania operation after December 31, 2008. Power and fuel costs also increased due to a power rate increase which occurred after December 31, 2008. Also, the increase was due to additional compressors being placed in service after December 31, 2008 along the existing gathering system in the Virginia production field in order to flow the increasing gas volumes more efficiently. 95 Table of Contents General and administrative costs for the CBM gas segment were $62 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $58 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. General and administrative expenses increased $4 million in the year to year comparison. The increased general and administrative expense is attributable to the reassignment of certain CNX Gas personnel in the fourth quarter of 2008 from operational roles to general and administrative oversight functions. The impact of the increased general and administrative costs was offset, in part, by higher volumes produced in 2009. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense was $94 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $70 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. Production related depreciation, depletion and amortization related to the CBM segment was $71 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $51 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase in production related depreciation, depletion and amortization was primarily due to increased volumes produced, combined with an increase in the units of production rates for the year to year comparison. These rates increased due to the higher proportion of capital assets placed in service versus the proportion of proved developed reserve additions. These rates are generally calculated using the net book value of assets at the end of the previous year divided by either proved or proved developed reserves. Gathering depreciation, depletion and amortization was $23 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $19 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. Gathering depreciation, depletion and amortization is recorded using the straight line method and increased $4 million in 2009 due to assets placed in service after December 31, 2008. CONVENTIONAL SEGMENT: The Conventional segment had a loss before income tax of $2 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The revenues and costs associated with the Conventional gas segment for the year ended December 31, 2008 were insignificant, thus a comparison has not been presented. 2009 2008 Variance PercentChange Produced gas Conventional sales volumes (in billion cubic feet) 1.7 1.7 100.0 % Average Conventional sales price per thousand cubic feet sold $ 4.33 $ $ 4.33 100.0 % Average Conventional lifting costs per thousand cubic feet sold $ 2.76 $ $ 2.76 100.0 % Average Conventional gathering costs per thousand cubic feet sold $ 0.59 $ $ 0.59 100.0 % Average Conventional general & administrative costs per thousand cubic feet sold $ 0.46 $ $ 0.46 100.0 % Average Conventional depreciation, depletion and amortization costs per thousand cubic feet sold $ 2.30 $ $ 2.30 100.0 % Total Conventional costs per thousand cubic feet sold $ 6.11 $ $ 6.11 100.0 % Margin $ (1.78 ) $ $ (1.78 ) 100.0 % 96 Table of Contents MARCELLUS SEGMENT: The Marcellus segment contributed $4 million to the total company earnings before income tax for the year ended December 31, 2009.

This segment includes purchased gas activity, gas royalty interest activity, exploration and other costs, other corporate expenses, and miscellaneous operational activity outside of the specific gas segments. Other gas sales volumes are primarily related to production from the Chattanooga Shale in Tennessee. Revenue from this operation was approximately $4 million in 2009. Total costs related to these other sales were $5 million in 2009. The revenues and costs associated with this production for the year ended December 31, 2008 were insignificant. Royalty interest gas sales represent the revenues for the portion of production belonging to royalty interest owners sold by CNX Gas on their behalf. Royalty interest gas sales were $41 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $79 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The decrease in market prices, contractual differences among leases, and the mix of average and index prices used in calculating royalties, contributed to the year to year change. 2009 2008 Variance PercentChange Gas Royalty Interest Sales Volumes (in billion cubic feet) 9.8 8.5 1.3 15.3 % Average Sales Price Per thousand cubic feet sold $ 4.17 $ 9.32 $ (5.15 ) (55.3 )% Purchased gas sales volumes represent volumes of gas we sold at market prices that were purchased from third party producers. Purchased gas sales were $7 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $9 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The decrease in sales on a unit basis was primarily due to the decrease in market prices. 2009 2008 Variance PercentChange Purchased Gas Sales Volumes (in billion cubic feet) 1.6 1.0 0.6 60.0 % Average Sales Price Per thousand cubic feet sold $ 4.46 $ 8.76 $ (4.30 ) (49.1 )% 97 Table of Contents Other income decreased $8 million due to the 2008 receipt of proceeds from our insurance carrier as final settlement of the insurance claim related to the July 2007 Buchanan mine event which idled the mine. The $8 million represented business interruption coverage. Royalty interest gas costs represent the expenses related to the portion of production belonging to royalty interest owners sold by CNX Gas on their behalf. Royalty interest gas costs were $32 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $75 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The decrease in market prices, contractual differences among leases, and the mix of average and index prices used in calculating royalties contributed to the year to year change. 2009 2008 Variance PercentChange Gas Royalty Interest Sales Volumes (in billion cubic feet) 9.8 8.5 1.3 15.3 % Average Cost Per thousand cubic feet sold $ 3.30 $ 8.69 $ (5.39 ) (62.0 )% Purchased gas costs represent volumes of gas purchased from third party producers, less our gathering and marketing fees, which we then sell at market price. Purchased gas volumes sold also reflect the impact of pipeline imbalances. Purchased gas costs were $6 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $8 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The lower average cost per thousand cubic feet is due to overall price decreases and contractual differences among customers in the year to year comparison. 2009 2008 Variance PercentChange Purchased Gas Volumes (in billion cubic feet) 1.7 1.0 0.7 70.0 % Average Cost Price Per thousand cubic feet sold $ 3.75 $ 8.13 $ (4.38 ) (53.9 )% Exploration and Other Costs increased $13 million due to the following items: 2009 2008 Variance PercentChange Dry hole and lease expiration costs $ 10 $ 1 $ 9 900.0 % Land and delay rentals 4 1 3 300.0 % Exploration 3 2 1 50.0 % Total Exploration and Other Costs $ 17 $ 4 $ 13 325.0 % Dry hole and other costs were incurred related to the determination that certain areas where an exploration well was drilled would not be economical to pursue. The costs for the exploration wells, which were previously capitalized, were expensed. In 2009, other costs include costs which were previously capitalized related to a lease. The lease was surrendered due to the properties being widely scattered and not adjacent to any of our existing operating units. Also, costs related to particular permits where management has determined that no drilling will take place have been expensed. Exploration expense increased primarily due to additional land rental expenses and higher geological and geophysical charges in the year to year comparison. Other corporate expenses have increased $12 million due to the following items: 2009 2008 Variance PercentChange Short term incentive compensation $ 16 $ 8 $ 8 100.0 % Contract settlement 3 3 100.0 % Stock based compensation 11 12 (1 ) (8.3 )% Other 3 1 2 200.0 % Total Other Corporate Expenses $ 33 $ 21 $ 12 57.1 % 98 Table of Contents The short term incentive compensation program is designed to increase compensation to eligible employees when CNX Gas reaches predetermined targets for production, unit cost and safety goals. Approximately $12 million of short term incentive compensation was allocated from CONSOL Energy. The allocation is attributable to the April 2009 management consolidation which resulted in employees being transferred from CNX Gas to CONSOL Energy. The CONSOL Energy employees provide substantially all of the management and administrative functions of CNX Gas, therefore a representative portion of CONSOL Energys short term incentive compensation is now allocated to CNX Gas. This increase was offset, in part, by lower short term incentive compensation due to fewer CNX Gas employees, resulting in a decrease of $4 million, excluding the CONSOL Energy allocation. The year ended December 31, 2009 includes $3 million related to a contract buyout with a driller in order to mitigate idle rig charges in certain areas where drilling is not expected to ramp up in the near term. No such transactions occurred during 2008. Stock based compensation expense decreased $1 million in the year to year comparison. The improvement was related to the CNX Gas performance share units being converted to CONSOL Energy restricted stock units in 2009. The year ended December 31, 2009 contains $4 million of fair value adjustments associated with the exchange offer to convert CNX Gas performance share units into CONSOL Energy restricted stock units. Miscellaneous other corporate expenses increased $2 million in the year to year comparison primarily due to cease use expenses incurred related to the relocation of CNX Gas corporate office and various other transactions that occurred throughout both years, none of which were individually material. Interest expense remained consistent at $8 million in the year to year comparison. Noncontrolling Interest Noncontrolling interest represents 100% of the earnings impact of a third party which has been determined to be a variable interest entity, in which the CONSOL Energy gas segment holds no ownership interest, but is the primary beneficiary. The CONSOL Energy gas segment has been determined to be the primary beneficiary due to guarantees of the third partys bank debt related to their purchase of drilling rigs. The third party entity provides drilling services primarily to the CONSOL Energy gas segment. CONSOL Energy consolidates the entity and then reflects 100% of the impact as noncontrolling interest. The consolidation does not significantly impact any amounts reflected in the gas segment income statement. The variance in the noncontrolling interest amounts reflects the third partys variance in earnings in the period to period comparison.

The other segment had a loss before income tax of $22 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to a loss before income tax of $7 for the year ended December 31, 2008. The other segment also includes total company income tax expense of $221 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $240 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. Industrial supplies: Total revenue from industrial supplies was $196 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $197 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The $1 million decrease in revenues was primarily due to lower sales volumes. Total costs related to industrial supplies were $190 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $191 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The $1 million decrease in costs was primarily due to lower sales volumes. Transportation operations: Total revenue related to the transportation operations was $84 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $133 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The $49 million decrease in other sales was attributable to decreased revenues from barge towing and terminal services. The decrease is related to lower tonnage moved by the barge towing and terminal services in the year to year comparison. Lower tonnage moved reflects the weak economic environment which has reduced the volume of products moved on the rivers in the year ended December 31, 2009. Total costs related to the transportation operations were $70 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $101 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The decrease of $31 million was related to lower tonnage moved and lower employee counts throughout the year ended December 31, 2009. Miscellaneous Other: Other income was $22 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $18 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase relates to a $6 million deferred gain that was recognized in conjunction with the cease use of the previous headquarters. Interest income increased $3 million due to higher average cash balances available to invest in the year to year comparison. These increases were offset, in part, by $5 million of various transactions that occurred throughout both periods, none of which were individually material. Other corporate costs in the other segment include interest cost and various other miscellaneous corporate charges. Total other costs were $64 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $63 million in the year ended December 31, 2008. Other corporate costs changed due to the following: Other corporate items increased $13 million primarily due to expenses recognized in conjunction with the 2009 cease use of the previous headquarters. Asset impairment expenses of $6 million were recognized in 2008 primarily related to loans made to, and options to purchase shares of common stock, with a startup company whose efforts to commercialize technology to burn waste coal with near zero emissions to generate power fell through. As a result of the downturn in the economy, it is not probable that the company can repay these loans, or that the company will complete a public offering. Therefore, the asset values have been written down. Other costs decreased $6 million due to various transactions that occurred throughout both periods, none of which were individually material. 100 Table of Contents Income Taxes The effective income tax rate was 28.1% for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 33.1% for the year ended December 31, 2008. The decrease in the effective tax rate was attributable to the relationship between pre tax earnings and percentage depletion. The proportion of coal pre tax earnings and gas pre tax earnings also impact the benefit of percentage depletion on the effective tax rate. See Note 6 Income Taxes in the Consolidated Financial Statements Item 8 of this Form 10 K for additional explanation of the effective tax rate change in the period to period comparison. 2009 2008 Variance PercentChange Total Company Earnings Before Income Taxes $ 788 $ 725 $ 63 8.7 % Income Tax Expense $ 221 $ 240 $ (19 ) (7.9 )% Effective Income Tax Rate 28.1 % 33.1 % (5.0 )% Noncontrolling Interest Noncontrolling interest represents 16.7% of CNX Gas net income which CONSOL Energy did not own at December 31, 2009. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and at the date of the financial statements. See Note 1 Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10 K for further discussion. On an on going basis, we evaluate our estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making the judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from those estimates upon subsequent resolution of identified matters. Management believes that the estimates utilized are reasonable. The following critical accounting policies are materially impacted by judgments, assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Business Combinations At acquisition, CONSOL Energy allocates the cost of a business acquisition to the specific tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their relative fair values. Significant judgments and estimates are often made to determine these allocated values, and may include the use of appraisals, consider market quotes for similar transactions, employ discounted cash flow techniques or consider other information CONSOL Energy believes relevant. The finalization of the purchase price allocation will typically take a number of months to complete, and if final values are materially different from initially recorded amounts, adjustments are recorded. Any excess of the cost of a business acquisition over the fair values of the net assets and liabilities acquired is recorded as goodwill which is not amortized to expense. Recorded goodwill of a reporting unit is required to be tested for impairment on an annual basis, and between annual testing dates if events or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its net book value. Subsequent to the finalization of the purchase price allocation, any adjustments to the recorded values of acquired assets and liabilities would be reflected in consolidated statement of operations. Once final, it is not permitted to revise the allocation of the original purchase price, even if subsequent events or circumstances prove 101 Table of Contents the original judgments and estimates to be incorrect. In addition, long lived assets like property and equipment, amortizable intangibles and goodwill may be deemed to be impaired in the future resulting in the recognition of an impairment loss. The assumptions and judgments made when recording business combinations will have an impact on reported results of operations for many years into the future. Purchase price allocations for all recent acquisitions including the Dominion Acquisition have been finalized. Other Post Employment Benefits (OPEB) Certain subsidiaries of CONSOL Energy provide medical and life insurance benefits to retired employees not covered by the Coal Industry Retiree Health Benefit Act of 1992. The medical plans contain certain cost sharing and containment features, such as deductibles, coinsurance, health care networks and coordination with Medicare. For salaried employees hired before January 1, 2007, the eligibility requirement is either age 55 with 20 years of service or age 62 with 15 years of service. Also, salaried employees and retirees contribute a target of 20% of the medical plan operating costs. Contributions may be higher, dependent on either years of service or a combination of age and years of service at retirement. Prospective annual cost increases of up to 6% will be shared by CONSOL Energy and the participants based on their age and years of service at retirement. Annual cost increases in excess of 6% will be the responsibility of the participants. Any salaried or non represented hourly employees that were hired or rehired effective January 1, 2007 or later will not become eligible for retiree health benefits. In lieu of traditional retiree health coverage, if certain eligibility requirements are met, these employees will receive a retiree medical spending allowance of $2,250 per year for each year of service at retirement. Newly employed inexperienced employees represented by the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA), hired after January 1, 2007, will not be eligible to receive retiree benefits. In lieu of these benefits, these employees will receive a defined contribution benefit of $1 per each hour worked. After our review, various actuarial assumptions, including discount rate, expected trend in health care costs, average remaining service period, average remaining life expectancy, per capita costs and participation level in each future year are used by our independent actuary to estimate the cost and benefit obligations for our retiree health plans. Most assumptions used in 2010 have not differed materially from the prior year. Mortality tables have been updated for salary employees to project future mortality improvements for plan participants and spouses. Mortality tables for hourly workers will continue to use the generational experience mortality table based upon the 1974 United Mine Workers of America trust study. Expected trends in future health care cost assumptions have not changed since the prior year. The initial expected trend in health care costs at this years measurement date is 8.47% with an ultimate trend rate of 4.50% reached in 2023. A 1.0% decrease in the health care trend rate would decrease interest and service cost for 2010 by approximately $17.5 million. A 1.0% increase in the health care trend rate would increase the interest and service cost by approximately $20.7 million. The discount rate is determined each year at the measurement date. The discount rate is determined by utilizing a corporate yield curve model developed from corporate bond data using only bonds rated Aa by Moodys as of the measurement date. All future post employment benefit expected payments were discounted using a spot rate yield curve as of December 31, 2010. The appropriate discount rate was then selected from resulting discounted cash flows. For the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, the discount rate used to calculate the period end liability and the following years expense was 5.33% and 5.87%, respectively. A 0.25% increase in the discount rate would have decreased 2010 net periodic postretirement benefit costs by approximately $4.1 million. A 0.25% decrease in the discount rate would have increased 2010 net periodic postretirement benefit costs by approximately $4.8 million. Deferred gains and losses are primarily due to historical changes in the discount rate and medical cost inflation differing from expectations in prior years. Changes to interest rates for the rates of returns on instruments that could be used to settle the actuarially determined plan obligations introduce substantial volatility to our costs. Accumulated actuarial gains or losses in excess of a pre established corridor are amortized on a straight line basis over the expected future service of active salary and non represented employees to their assumed retirement age. At December 31, 2010 the average remaining service period is approximately 12 years for our non represented plans. Accumulated actuarial gains or losses in excess of a pre established corridor are amortized on a straight line basis over the expected remaining life of our retired UMWA population. The average remaining service period of this population is not used for amortization 102 Table of Contents purposes because the majority of the UMWA population of our plan is retired. At December 31, 2010, the average remaining life expectancy of our retired UMWA population used to calculate the following years expense is approximately 13 years. The weighted average per capita costs used to value the December 31, 2010 Other Postretirement Benefit liability was 0.20% less than expected based on our trend assumption. If the actual change in per capita cost of medical services or other postretirement benefits are significantly greater or less than the projected trend rates, the per capita cost assumption would need to be adjusted, which could have a significant effect on the costs and liabilities recorded in the financial statements. Significant increases in health and prescription drug costs for represented hourly retirees could have a material adverse effect on CONSOL Energys operating cash flow. However, the effect on CONSOL Energys cash flow from operations for salaried employees is limited to approximately 6% of the previous years medical cost for salaried employees due to the cost sharing provision in the benefit plan. The OPEB liability at December 31, 2010 reflects an increase of approximately $12.3 million due to the Patient Protection and Affordable care Act (PPACA) reform legislation; in particular, the estimated impact of the potential excise tax beginning in 2018. A corresponding increase in Other Comprehensive Loss was also recognized. The estimated increase in the liability was calculated using the following assumptions: testing pre Medicare and Medicare covered retirees on a combined basis; assuming individual participates have an average 2010 claim cost and future healthcare trend assumptions equal to those used in the year end valuation; assuming the 2018 tax threshold amount to increase for inflation in later years. These assumptions may change once additional guidance becomes available. The estimated liability recognized in the December 31, 2010 financial statements was $3.3 billion. This amount includes a liability of $2.8 million related to the past service earned by the employees that were retained in the Dominion Acquisition. For the year ended December 31, 2010, we paid approximately $166.0 million for other postretirement benefits, all of which were paid from operating cash flow. Our obligations with respect to these liabilities are unfunded at December 31, 2010. CONSOL Energy does not expect to contribute to the other postretirement plan in 2011. We intend to pay benefit claims as they are due. Salaried Pensions CONSOL Energy has non contributory defined benefit retirement plans covering substantially all employees not covered by multiemployer plans. The benefits for these plans are based primarily on years of service and employees pay near retirement. CONSOL Energys salaried plan allows for lump sum distributions of benefits earned up until December 31, 2005, at the employees election. The Restoration Plan was frozen effective December 31, 2006 and was replaced prospectively with the CONSOL Energy Supplemental Retirement Plan. CONSOL Energys Restoration Plan allows only for lump sum distributions earned up until December 31, 2006. Effective September 8, 2009, the Supplemental Retirement Plan was amended to include employees of CNX Gas. In March of 2009, the CNX Gas defined benefit retirement plan was merged into the CONSOL Energys non contributory defined benefit retirement plan. At the time, the change did not impact the benefits for employees of CNX Gas. However, during 2010 an amendment was adopted to recognize past service at CNX Gas to current employees of CNX Gas who opted out of the plan for additional company contributions into their defined contribution plan and extend coverage to employees previously not eligible to participate in this plan. Our independent actuaries calculate the actuarial present value of the estimated retirement obligation based on assumptions including rates of compensation, mortality rates, retirement age and interest rates. For the year ended December 31, 2010, compensation increases are assumed to range from 3% to 6% depending on age and job classification. The discount rate is determined each year at the measurement date. The discount rate is 103 Table of Contents determined by utilizing a corporate yield curve model developed from corporate bond data using only bonds rated Aa by Moodys as of the measurement date. All expected benefit payments from the CONSOL Energy retirement plan were discounted using a spot rate yield curve as of December 31, 2010. The appropriate equivalent discount rate was then selected for the resulting discounted pension cash flows. For the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, the discount rate used to calculate the period end liability and the following years expense was 5.30% and 5.79%, respectively. A 0.25% increase in the discount rate would have decreased the 2010 net periodic pension cost by $1.6 million. A 0.25% decrease in the discount rate would have increased the 2010 net periodic pension cost by $1.6 million. Deferred gains and losses are primarily due to historical changes in the discount rate and earnings on assets differing from expectations. At December 31, 2010 the average remaining service period is approximately 10 years. Changes to any of these assumptions introduce substantial volatility to our costs. The market related asset value is derived by taking the cost value of assets as of December 31, 2010 and multiplying it by the average 36 month ratio of the market value of assets to the cost value of assets. CONSOL Energys pension plan weighted average asset allocations at December 31, 2010 consisted of 61% equity securities and 39% debt securities. The estimated liability recognized in the December 31, 2010 financial statements was $163.4 million. For the year ended December 31, 2010, we contributed approximately $72.4 million to defined benefit retirement plans other than multi employer plans trust and to other pension benefits. Our obligations with respect to these liabilities are partially funded at December 31, 2010. CONSOL Energy intends to contribute an amount that will avoid benefit restrictions for the following plan year. Workers Compensation and Coal Workers Pneumoconiosis Workers compensation is a system by which individuals who sustain employment related physical injuries or some type of occupational diseases are compensated for their disabilities, medical costs, and on some occasions, for the costs of their rehabilitation. Workers compensation will also compensate the survivors of workers who suffer employment related deaths. The workers compensation laws are administered by state agencies with each state having its own set of rules and regulations regarding compensation that is owed to an employee that is injured in the course of employment. CONSOL Energy records an actuarially calculated liability, which is determined using various assumptions, including discount rate, future healthcare cost trends, benefit duration and recurrence of injuries. The discount rate is determined each year at the measurement date. The discount rate is determined by utilizing a corporate yield curve model developed from corporate bond data using only bonds rated Aa by Moodys as of the measurement date. All future workers compensation expected benefit payments were discounted using a spot rate yield curve as of December 31, 2010. The appropriate equivalent discount rate was then selected from the resulting discounted workers compensation cash flows. For the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, the discount rate used to calculate the period end liability and the following years expense was 5.13% and 5.55%, respectively. A 0.25% increase in the discount rate would have decreased the 2010 workers compensation expense cost by $0.7 million. A 0.25% decrease in the discount rate would have increased the 2010 workers compensation expense by $0.8 million. Deferred gains and losses are primarily due to historical changes in the discount rates, several years of favorable claims experience, various favorable state legislation changes and an overall lower incident rate than our assumptions. Accumulated actuarial gains or losses are amortized on a straight line basis over the expected future service of active employees that are eligible to file a future workers compensation claim. At December 31, 2010, the average remaining service period is approximately 10 years. The estimated liability recognized in the financial statements at December 31, 2010 was approximately $174.5 million. CONSOL Energys policy has been to provide for workers compensation benefits from operating cash flow. For the year ended December 31, 2010, we made payments for workers compensation benefits and other related fees of approximately $37.6 million, all of which was paid from operating cash flow. Our obligations with respect to these liabilities are unfunded at December 31, 2010. 104 Table of Contents CONSOL Energy is responsible under the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969, as amended, for medical and disability benefits to employees and their dependents resulting from occurrences of coal workers pneumoconiosis disease. CONSOL Energy is also responsible under various state statutes for pneumoconiosis benefits. After our review, our independent actuaries calculate the actuarial present value of the estimated pneumoconiosis obligation based on assumptions regarding disability incidence, medical costs, mortality, death benefits, dependents and discount rates. The discount rate is determined each year at the measurement date. The discount rate is determined by utilizing a corporate yield curve model developed from corporate bond data using only bonds rated Aa by Moodys as of the measurement date. All future coal workers pneumoconiosis expected benefit payments were discounted using a spot rate yield curve at December 31, 2010. The appropriate equivalent discount rate was then selected from the resulting discounted coal workers pneumoconiosis cash flows. For the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, the discount rate used to calculate the period end liability and the following years expense was 5.21% and 5.84%, respectively. A 0.25% increase in the discount rate would have decreased 2010 coal workers pneumoconiosis expense by $0.6 million. A 0.25% decrease in the discount rate would have increased 2010 coal workers pneumoconiosis by $0.6 million. Actuarial gains associated with coal workers pneumoconiosis have resulted from numerous legislative changes over many years which have resulted in lower approval rates for filed claims than our assumptions originally reflected. Actuarial gains have also resulted from lower incident rates and lower severity of claims filed than our assumptions originally reflected. The estimated liability recognized in the financial statements at December 31, 2010 was $184.5 million. For the year ended December 31, 2010, we paid coal workers pneumoconiosis benefits of approximately $11.6 million, all of which was paid from operating cash flow. Our obligations with respect to these liabilities are unfunded at December 31, 2010. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) impacts CONSOL Energy pneumoconiosis liabilities in that future claims will qualify for payment at a greater rate than has occurred in the past. All CONSOL Energy historical claim data and data from the Department of Labor database was gathered and analyzed to determine the impact of the PPACA. The analysis resulted in an adjustment to the pre PPACA assumptions which resulted in a $47.7 million reduction to the liability. The impact of the PPACA, including the changes to the legal criteria used to assess and award claims and changes to the law that grant death benefits, regardless of the cause of death, to surviving dependants of miners who have been receiving pneumoconiosis benefits, resulted in an increase of $45.7 million to the liability. These adjustments were treated as adjustments to the actuarial loss and are included in the December 31, 2010 liabilities. Reclamation, Mine Closure and Gas Well Closing Obligations The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act established operational, reclamation and closure standards for all aspects of surface mining as well as most aspects of deep mining. CONSOL Energy accrues for the costs of current mine disturbance and final mine and gas well closure, including the cost of treating mine water discharge where necessary. Estimates of our total reclamation, mine closing liabilities, and gas well closing which are based upon permit requirements and CONSOL Energy engineering expertise related to these requirements, including the current portion, were approximately $670.9 million at December 31, 2010. This liability is reviewed annually, or when events and circumstances indicate an adjustment is necessary, by CONSOL Energy management and engineers. The estimated liability can significantly change if actual costs vary from assumptions or if governmental regulations change significantly. Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations requires that the fair value of an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The present value of the estimated asset retirement costs is capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset. Asset retirement obligations primarily relate to the closure of mines and gas wells and the reclamation of land upon exhaustion of coal and gas reserves. Changes in the variables used to calculate the liabilities can have a significant effect on the mine closing, reclamation and gas well closing liabilities. The amounts of assets and liabilities recorded are dependent upon a number of variables, including the estimated future retirement costs, estimated proven reserves, assumptions involving profit margins, inflation rates, and the assumed credit adjusted risk free interest rate. 105 Table of Contents Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations also requires depreciation of the capitalized asset retirement cost and accretion of the asset retirement obligation over time. The depreciation will generally be determined on a units of production basis, whereas the accretion to be recognized will escalate over the life of the producing assets, typically as production declines. Income Taxes Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax basis of recorded assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. All available evidence, both positive and negative, must be considered in determining the need for a valuation allowance. At December 31, 2010, CONSOL Energy has deferred tax assets in excess of deferred tax liabilities of approximately $659.0 million. The deferred tax assets are evaluated periodically to determine if a valuation allowance is necessary. Deferred tax valuation allowances increased $1.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2010 due to various transactions that occurred throughout 2010, none of which were individually material. Valuation allowances on certain net operating loss carry forwards were not released during the year due to negative evidence outweighing positive evidence indicating that these benefits will not be utilized in future years. CONSOL Energy continues to report a deferred tax asset of approximately $39.7 million relating to its state net operating loss carry forwards subject to a full valuation allowance. A review of positive and negative evidence regarding these benefits, primarily the history of financial and tax losses on a separate company basis, concluded that a full valuation allowance was warranted. The net operating loss carry forwards expire at various times from 2018 to 2029. A valuation allowance of $22.9 million has also been recorded against the state deferred tax asset attributable to future tax deductible differences for certain subsidiaries with histories of financial and tax losses. Management will continue to assess the realization of deferred tax assets attributable to state net operating loss carry forwards and future tax deductible differences based upon updated income forecast data and the feasibility of future tax planning strategies, and may record adjustments to valuation allowances against these deferred tax assets in future periods that could materially impact net income. CONSOL Energy evaluates all tax positions taken on the state and federal tax filings to determine if the position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination. For positions that meet the more likely than not to be sustained criteria, an evaluation to determine the largest amount of benefit, determined on a cumulative probability basis that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement is determined. A previously recognized tax position is derecognized when it is subsequently determined that a tax position no longer meets the more likely than not threshold to be sustained. The evaluation of the sustainability of a tax position and the probable amount that is more likely than not is based on judgment, historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these estimates, that are not readily apparent from other sources, form the basis for recognizing an uncertain tax liability. Actual results could differ from those estimates upon subsequent resolution of identified matters. Estimates of our uncertain tax liabilities, including interest and the current portion, were approximately $76.3 million at December 31, 2010. Stock Based Compensation As of December 31, 2010, we have issued four types of share based payment awards: options, restricted stock units, performance stock options and performance share units. The Black Scholes option pricing model is used to determine fair value of stock options at the grant date. Various inputs are utilized in the Black Scholes pricing model, such as: stock price on measurement date, exercise price defined in the award, expected dividend yield based on historical trend of dividend payouts, risk free interest rate based on a zero coupon treasury bond rate, 106 Table of Contents expected term based on historical grant and exercise behavior, and expected volatility based on historic and implied stock price volatility of CONSOL Energy stock and public peer group stock. These factors can significantly impact the value of stock options expense recognized over the requisite service period of option holders. The fair value of each restricted stock unit awarded is equivalent to the closing market price of a share of our companys stock on the date of the grant. The fair value of each performance share unit is determined by the underlying share price of our company stock on the date of the grant and managements estimate of the probability that the performance conditions required for vesting will be achieved. As of December 31, 2010, $36.0 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested awards is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.78 years. See Note 18 Stock based Compensation in the Notes to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 in this Form 10 K for more information. Contingencies CONSOL Energy is currently involved in certain legal proceedings. We have accrued our estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of these claims. This estimate has been developed in consultation with legal counsel involved in the defense of these matters and is based upon an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies. Future results of operations for any particular quarter or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the outcome of these proceedings. See Note 24 Commitments and Contingent Liabilities in the Notes to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 in this Form 10 K for further discussion. Successful Efforts Accounting We use the successful efforts method to account for our gas exploration and production activities. Under this method, cost of property acquisitions, successful exploratory wells, development wells and related support equipment and facilities are capitalized. Costs of unsuccessful exploratory or development wells are expensed when such wells are determined to be non productive, or if the determination cannot be made after finding sufficient quantities of reserves to continue evaluating the viability of the project. We use this accounting policy instead of the full cost method because it provides a more timely accounting of the success or failure of our gas exploration and production activities. Derivative Instruments CONSOL Energy enters into financial derivative instruments to manage exposure to natural gas and oil price volatility. We measure every derivative instrument at fair value and record them on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability. Changes in fair value of derivatives are recorded currently in earnings unless special hedge accounting criteria are met. For derivatives designated as fair value hedges, the changes in fair value of both the derivative instrument and the hedged item are recorded in earnings. For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portions of changes in fair value of the derivative are reported in other comprehensive income or loss and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods which the forecasted transaction affects earnings. The ineffective portions of hedges are recognized in earnings in the current year. CONSOL Energy currently utilizes only cash flow hedges that are considered highly effective. CONSOL Energy formally assesses, both at inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, whether each derivative is highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedge item. If it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective as a hedge or if a derivative ceases to be a highly effective hedge, CONSOL Energy will discontinue hedge accounting prospectively. 107 Table of Contents Coal and Gas Reserve Values There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities and values of economically recoverable coal and gas reserves, including many factors beyond our control. As a result, estimates of economically recoverable coal and gas reserves are by their nature uncertain. Information about our reserves consists of estimates based on engineering, economic and geological data assembled and analyzed by our staff. Our coal reserves are periodically reviewed by an independent third party consultant. Our gas reserves have been reviewed by independent experts each year. Some of the factors and assumptions which impact economically recoverable reserve estimates include: geological conditions; historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas; the assumed effects of regulations and taxes by governmental agencies; assumptions governing future prices; and future operating costs. Each of these factors may in fact vary considerably from the assumptions used in estimating reserves. For these reasons, estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of coal and gas attributable to a particular group of properties, and classifications of these reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of future net cash flows, may vary substantially. Actual production, revenues and expenditures with respect to our reserves will likely vary from estimates, and these variances may be material. See Risk Factors in Item 1A of this report for a discussion of the uncertainties in estimating our reserves. Liquidity and Capital Resources CONSOL Energy generally has satisfied our working capital requirements and funded our capital expenditures and debt service obligations with cash generated from operations and proceeds from borrowings. On May 7, 2010, CONSOL Energy refinanced and extended the previous $1.0 billion credit facility to $1.5 billion, including borrowings and letters of credit, for a term of four years. CONSOL Energy can request an additional $250 million increase in the aggregate borrowing limit amount. The facility was expanded to meet the asset development needs of the company. The obligations under the credit agreement continue to be secured by substantially all of the assets of CONSOL Energy and certain of its subsidiaries and collateral is shared equally and ratably with the holders of CONSOL Energy Inc. 7.875% bonds due March 2012. Fees and interest rate spreads are based on a ratio of financial covenant debt to twelve month trailing earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization (EBITDA), measured quarterly. The facility includes a minimum interest coverage ratio covenant of no less than 2.00 to 1.00 through 2010, and no less than 2.50 to 1.00 thereafter, measured quarterly. The minimum interest coverage ratio covenant is calculated as the ratio of EBITDA to cash interest expense for CONSOL Energy and certain of its subsidiaries. The interest coverage ratio was 4.54 to 1.00 at December 31, 2010. The facility includes a maximum leverage ratio covenant of no more than 4.75 to 1.00 through March 2013, and no more than 4.50 to 1.00 thereafter, measured quarterly. The maximum leverage ratio covenant is calculated as the ratio of financial covenant debt to twelve month trailing EBITDA for CONSOL Energy and certain of its subsidiaries. Financial covenant debt is comprised of the outstanding indebtedness and specific letters of credit, less cash on hand, of CONSOL Energy and certain of its subsidiaries. EBITDA, as used in the covenant calculation, excludes non cash compensation expenses, non recurring transaction expenses, uncommon gains and losses, gains and losses on discontinued operations and includes cash distributions received from affiliates plus pro rata earnings from material acquisitions. The leverage ratio was 3.48 to 1.00 at December 31, 2010. The facility also includes a senior secured leverage ratio covenant of no more than 2.50 to 1.00 through 2010, and no more than 2.00 to 1.00 thereafter, measured quarterly. The senior secured leverage ratio covenant is calculated as the ratio of secured debt to EBITDA. Secured debt is defined as the outstanding borrowings and letters of credit on the revolving credit facility plus the CONSOL Energy Inc. 7.875% bonds due in March 2012. The senior secured leverage ratio was 0.72 to 1.00 at 108 Table of Contents December 31, 2010. Covenants in the facility limit our ability to dispose of assets, make investments, purchase or redeem CONSOL Energy common stock, pay dividends and merge with another company. At December 31, 2010, the facility had approximately $155 million drawn and $267 million of letters of credit outstanding, leaving $1.1 billion of unused capacity. From time to time, CONSOL Energy is required to post financial assurances to satisfy contractual and other requirements generated in the normal course of business. Some of these assurances are posted to comply with federal, state or other government agency statutes and regulations. We sometimes use letters of credit to satisfy these requirements and these letters of credit reduce our borrowing facility capacity. CONSOL Energy completed an equity offering on March 31, 2010 of 44.3 million shares of common stock, which generated net proceeds of approximately $1.83 billion. On April 1, 2010, CONSOL Energy issued $1.5 billion of 8.00% senior unsecured notes due in 2017 and $1.25 billion of 8.25% senior unsecured notes due in 2020. Covenants in the Notes Indenture limit CONSOL Energys ability to incur debt, make investments, sell assets, pay dividends and merge with another company. The equity and bond proceeds were used to complete the Dominion Acquisition for total consideration of approximately $3.47 billion. The acquisition closed on April 30, 2010. The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PA DEP) and CONSOL Energy have executed a Consent Order and Agreement (the Agreement) that addresses financial assurance required by the State for CONSOL Energys Pennsylvania mine water treatment facilities for mines closed prior to August 1977. The Agreement requires the company to post approximately $34 million of financial assurance over a 10 year time frame. CONSOL Energy obtained surety bonds to satisfy the initial obligation related to the Agreement. On April 23, 2010, CONSOL Energy amended the accounts receivable securitization facility to allow the Company to receive, on a revolving basis, up to $200 million of short term funding and letters of credit. Previously, the facility provided up to $165 million. The accounts receivable facility supports sales, on a continuous basis to financial institutions, of eligible trade accounts receivables. The facility was expanded to meet the future cash needs of the Company. CONSOL Energy has agreed to continue servicing the sold receivables for the financial institutions for a fee based upon market rates for similar services. The cost of funds is based on commercial paper rates plus a charge for administrative services paid to the financial institutions. At December 31, 2010, eligible accounts receivable totaled approximately $200 million. There was no subordinated retained interest at December 31, 2010. Accounts receivable totaling $200 million were reflected as Accounts Receivable Securitized in Current Assets and Borrowings Under Securitization Facility in Current Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2010. There were no letters of credit outstanding against the facility at December 31, 2010. On May 7, 2010, CNX Gas, a fully consolidated subsidiary of CONSOL Energy, refinanced and extended the existing $200 million credit facility to $700 million, including borrowings and letters of credit, for a term of four years. The facility was expanded to meet the asset development needs of the company. The obligations under the credit agreement are secured by substantially all of the assets of CNX Gas and its subsidiaries and collateral is shared equally and ratably with the holders of CONSOL Energy Inc. 7.875% bonds due March 2012. Fees and interest rate spreads are based on the percentage of facility utilization, measured quarterly. The facility includes a minimum interest coverage ratio covenant of no less than 3.00 to 1.00, measured quarterly. The minimum interest coverage ratio covenant is calculated as the ratio of EBITDA to cash interest expense for CNX Gas Corporation and certain of its subsidiaries. The interest coverage ratio was 69.60 to 1.00 at December 31, 2010. The facility also includes a maximum leverage ratio covenant of no more than 3.50 to 1.00, measured quarterly. The maximum leverage ratio covenant is calculated as the ratio of financial covenant debt to twelve month trailing EBITDA for CNX Gas Corporation and certain of its subsidiaries. Financial covenant debt is comprised of the outstanding indebtedness and letters of credit, less cash on hand, of CNX Gas Corporation and certain of its subsidiaries. EBITDA, as used in the covenant calculation, excludes non cash compensation expenses, non recurring transaction expenses, gains and losses on the sale of assets, uncommon gains and losses, gains and losses on discontinued operations and includes cash distributions received from affiliates plus pro rata earnings from material acquisitions. The leverage ratio was 0.52 to 1.00 at December 31, 2010. Covenants in the 109 Table of Contents facility limit our ability to dispose of assets, make investments, pay dividends and merge with another company. At December 31, 2010, the facility had approximately $129 million drawn and $70 million of letters of credit outstanding, leaving $501 million of unused capacity. On June 1, 2010, CONSOL Energy completed a tender offer to acquire the 25.3 million shares of CNX Gas common stock and vested stock options that it did not previously own for $38.25 per share. The aggregate purchase price was $991 million. CNX Gas is now a wholly owned subsidiary of CONSOL Energy. CNX Gas was designated a subsidiary guarantor under the 2017 and 2020 CONSOL Energy Notes Indenture. CNX Gas has to comply with the covenants in the Notes Indenture, which limit the companys ability to incur debt, make investments, sell assets, pay dividends and merge with another company. In September 2010, CONSOL Energy refinanced approximately $103 million of industrial development bonds associated with its wholly owned CNX Marine Terminal in the Port of Baltimore, Maryland. The municipal bonds issued by the Maryland Economic Development Corporation mature on September 1, 2025 and carry an interest rate of 5.75%. The previous bonds carried an interest rate of 6.50% and were due to mature in December 2010 and October 2011. Uncertainty in the financial markets brings additional potential risks to CONSOL Energy. The risks include declines in our stock price, less availability and higher costs of additional credit, potential counterparty defaults, and further commercial bank failures. Financial market disruptions may impact our collection of trade receivables. CONSOL Energy constantly monitors the creditworthiness of our customers. We believe that our current group of customers are sound and represent no abnormal business risk. CONSOL Energy believes that cash generated from operations and our borrowing capacity will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements, anticipated capital expenditures (other than major acquisitions), scheduled debt payments, anticipated dividend payments and to provide required letters of credit. Nevertheless, the ability of CONSOL Energy to satisfy our working capital requirements, debt service obligations, to fund planned capital expenditures or pay dividends will depend upon future operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions in the coal and gas industries and other financial and business factors, some of which are beyond CONSOL Energys control. In order to manage the market risk exposure of volatile natural gas prices in the future, CONSOL Energy enters into various physical gas supply transactions with both gas marketers and end users for terms varying in length. CONSOL Energy has also entered into various gas swap transactions that qualify as financial cash flow hedges, which exist parallel to the underlying physical transactions. The fair value of these contracts was a net asset of $76 million at December 31, 2010. The ineffective portion of these contracts was insignificant to earnings in the year ended December 31, 2010. Hedge counterparties consist of commercial banks that participate or have been past participants in the revolving credit facility. No issues related to our hedge agreements have been encountered to date. CONSOL Energy frequently evaluates potential acquisitions. CONSOL Energy has funded acquisitions primarily with cash generated from operations and a variety of other sources, depending on the size of the transaction, including debt financing. There can be no assurance that additional capital resources, including debt financing, will be available to CONSOL Energy on terms which CONSOL Energy finds acceptable, or at all. Cash Flows (in millions) For the Years EndedDecember 31, 2010 2009 Change Cash flows provided by operating activities $ 1,131 $ 1,060 $ 71 Cash used in investing activities $ (5,544 ) $ (845 ) $ (4,699 ) Cash provided by (used in) financing activities $ 4,380 $ (288 ) $ 4,668 110 Table of Contents Cash flows provided by operating activities changed primarily due to the following items: Operating cash flows increased $129 million due to coal inventories. Coal inventories decreased 1.2 million tons in the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to increasing 1.5 million tons in the year ended December 31, 2009. Operating cash flow increased due to various changes in operating assets, operating liabilities, other assets and other liabilities which occurred throughout both years. Operating cash flow decreased in 2010 due to lower net income attributable to CONSOL Energy shareholders in the period to period comparison. Net cash used in investing activities changed primarily due to the following items: On April 30, 2010, CONSOL Energy paid $3.47 billion to acquire the Dominion Appalachian E&P business. See Note 2 Acquisitions and Dispositions in the Notes to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10K for additional details. On May 28, 2010, CONSOL Energy paid $991 million to acquire the shares and vested stock options of CNX Gas common stock which it did not previously own. Total capital expenditures increased $234 million to $1.15 billion in 2010 compared to $920 million in 2009. Capital expenditures for coal and other activities increased $134 million due to various projects including the purchase of various coal lands, additional equipment at various mining locations, continued work on longwall face extensions at various locations, and the Buchanan water handling system. Capital expenditures for the gas segment increased $100 million due to the additional drilling in the period to period comparison. Proceeds from the sale of assets were $60 million in the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $70 million in the year ended December 31, 2009. Proceeds in both periods were primarily related to the sale leaseback of various mining equipment. Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities changed primarily due to the following items: Proceeds of $2.75 billion were received on April 1, 2010 in connection with the issuance of $1.5 billion of 8.00% senior unsecured notes due in 2017 and $1.25 billion of 8.25% senior unsecured notes due in 2020. Proceeds of $1.83 billion were received in connection with the issuance of 44.3 million shares of common stock which was completed on March 31, 2010. In 2010, CONSOL Energy received $150 million of proceeds from the accounts receivable securitization facility. This facility, which has been increased to $200 million, was fully drawn at December 31, 2010. There was $115 million paid under this facility in the year ended December 31, 2009. In 2010, CONSOL Energy paid outstanding borrowings of $260 million under the revolving credit facility. In the year ended December 31, 2009, CONSOL Energy paid outstanding borrowings of $70 million under the revolving credit facility. In 2010, CNX Gas, a 100% owned subsidiary, received $71 million of proceeds from its revolving credit facility. In the year ended December 31, 2009, CNX Gas paid outstanding borrowings of $15 million under its revolving credit facility. In 2010, approximately $84 million was paid for various acquisition and financing fees related to the Dominion Acquisition, the buy back of the shares and vested stock options of CNX Gas that CONSOL Energy did not previously own, and the various financing activities related to these transactions. Dividends of $86 million were paid in 2010 compared to $72 million in 2009. The increase was due to the 44.3 million additional shares issued on March 31, 2010. 111 Table of Contents The following is a summary of our significant contractual obligations at December 31, 2010 (in thousands): Payments due by Year Less Than1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years More Than5 Years Total Short term Notes Payable $ 284,000 $ $ $ $ 284,000 Borrowings Under Securitization Facility 200,000 200,000 Purchase Order Firm Commitments 127,624 197,981 25,695 351,300 Gas Firm Transportation 41,289 68,215 62,454 312,085 484,043 Long term Debt 16,579 262,110 5,173 2,861,745 3,145,607 Interest on Long term Debt 249,311 469,534 459,856 824,648 2,003,349 Capital (Finance) Lease Obligations 8,154 12,699 9,819 34,884 65,556 Interest on Capital (Finance) Lease Obligations 4,478 7,400 5,919 8,113 25,910 Operating Lease Obligations 77,414 120,018 83,217 125,829 406,478 Other Long term Liabilities(a) 537,797 588,023 582,853 2,886,292 4,594,965 Total Contractual Obligations(b) $ 1,546,646 $ 1,725,980 $ 1,234,986 $ 7,053,596 $ 11,561,208 a) Long term liabilities include other post employment benefits, work related injuries and illnesses, mine reclamation and closure and other long term liability costs. Estimated salaried retirement contributions required to meet minimum funding standards under ERISA are excluded from the pay out table due to the uncertainty regarding amounts to be contributed. Estimated 2011 contributions are expected to be approximately $63.6 million. b) The significant obligation table does not include obligations to taxing authorities due to the uncertainty surrounding the ultimate settlement of amounts and timing of these obligations. Debt At December 31, 2010, CONSOL Energy had total long term debt of $3.211 billion outstanding, including the current portion of long term debt of $25 million. This long term debt consisted of: An aggregate principal amount of $1.5 billion of 8.00% senior unsecured notes due in April 2017. Interest on the notes is payable April 1 and October 1 of each year. Payment of the principal and interest on the notes is guaranteed by most of CONSOL Energys subsidiaries. An aggregate principal amount of $1.25 billion of 8.25% senior unsecured notes due in April 2020. Interest on the notes is payable April 1 and October 1 of each year. Payment of the principal and interest on the notes is guaranteed by most of CONSOL Energys subsidiaries. An aggregate principal amount of $250 million of 7.875% notes due in March 2012. Interest on the notes is payable March 1 and September 1 of each year. Payment of the principal and premium, if any, and interest on the notes is guaranteed by most of CONSOL Energys subsidiaries. The notes are senior secured obligations and rank equally with all other secured indebtedness of the guarantors. An aggregate principal amount of $103 million of industrial revenue bonds which were issued to finance the Baltimore port facility and bear interest at 5.75% per annum and mature in September 2025. $32 million in advance royalty commitments with an average interest rate of 7.56% per annum. An aggregate principal amount of $10 million on a variable rate note due in December 2012 that bears interest at 6.10% at December 31, 2010. This note was incurred by a variable interest entity that is fully consolidated in which CONSOL Energy holds no ownership interest. 112 Table of Contents An aggregate principal amount of $66 million of capital leases with a weighted average interest rate of 7.36% per annum. At December 31, 2010, CONSOL Energy also had $155 million of aggregate principal amounts of outstanding borrowings and approximately $267 million of letters of credit outstanding under the $1.5 billion senior secured revolving credit facility. At December 31, 2010, CONSOL Energy had $200 million of borrowings under the securitization facility. At December 31, 2010, CNX Gas, a wholly owned subsidiary, had $129 million of aggregate principal amounts of outstanding borrowings and approximately $70 million of letters of credit outstanding under its $700 million secured revolving credit facility. Total Equity and Dividends CONSOL Energy had total equity of $2.9 billion at December 31, 2010 and $2.0 billion at December 31, 2009. Total equity increased primarily due to the sale of approximately 44.3 million shares of common stock which resulted in net proceeds of approximately $1.83 billion. Total equity also increased due to net income attributable to CONSOL Energy shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2010 and amortization of stock based compensation awards. These increases were offset, in part, by the acquisition of the noncontrolling interest in CNX Gas, changes in the actuarial long term liabilities, changes in cash flow hedging and the declaration of dividends. See the Consolidated Statements of Stockholders Equity in Item 8 of this Form 10K for additional details. Dividend information for the current year to date is as follows: Declaration Date Amount Per Share Record Date Payment Date January 28, 2011 $0.10 February 8, 2011 February 18, 2011 November 1, 2010 $0.10 November 12, 2010 November 26, 2010 July 30, 2010 $0.10 August 13, 2010 August 23, 2010 April 30, 2010 $0.10 May 10, 2010 May 20, 2010 January 29, 2010 $0.10 February 9, 2010 February 19, 2010 The declaration and payment of dividends by CONSOL Energy is subject to the discretion of CONSOL Energys Board of Directors, and no assurance can be given that CONSOL Energy will pay dividends in the future. CONSOL Energys Board of Directors determines whether dividends will be paid quarterly. The determination to pay dividends will depend upon, among other things, general business conditions, CONSOL Energys financial results, contractual and legal restrictions regarding the payment of dividends by CONSOL Energy, planned investments by CONSOL Energy and such other factors as the Board of Directors deems relevant. Our credit facility limits our ability to pay dividends in excess of an annual rate of $0.40 per share when our leverage ratio exceeds 4.50 to 1.00 or our availability is less than or equal to $100 million. The leverage ratio was 3.48 to 1.00 and our availability was approximately $1.1 billion at December 31, 2010. The credit facility does not permit dividend payments in the event of default. The indenture to the 2017 and 2020 notes limits dividends to $0.40 per share annually unless several conditions are met. Conditions include no defaults, ability to incur additional debt and other payment limitations under the indentures. There were no defaults under the credit facility or the indentures in the year ended December 31, 2010. Off Balance Sheet Transactions CONSOL Energy does not maintain off balance sheet transactions, arrangements, obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or others that are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on CONSOL Energys condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources which are not disclosed in the Notes to the 113 Table of Contents Audited Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. CONSOL Energy participates in various multi employer benefit plans such as the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA) 1974 Pension Plan, the UMWA Combined Benefit Fund and the UMWA 1993 Benefit Plan which generally accepted accounting principles recognize on a pay as you go basis. These benefit arrangements may result in additional liabilities that are not recognized on the balance sheet at December 31, 2010. See Note 17 Other Employee Benefit Plans in the Notes to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10 K for further discussion. CONSOL Energy also uses a combination of surety bonds, corporate guarantees and letters of credit to secure our financial obligations for employee related, environmental, performance and various other items which are not reflected on the balance sheet at December 31, 2010. Management believes these items will expire without being funded. See Note 24 Commitments and Contingent Liabilities of this Form 10 K for additional details of the various financial guarantees that have been issued by CONSOL Energy. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. In addition to the risks inherent in operations, CONSOL Energy is exposed to financial, market, political and economic risks. The following discussion provides additional detail regarding CONSOL Energys exposure to the risks of changing natural gas prices, interest rates and foreign exchange rates. CONSOL Energy is exposed to market price risk in the normal course of selling natural gas production and to a lesser extent in the sale of coal. CONSOL Energy sells coal under both short term and long term contracts with fixed price and or indexed price contracts that reflect market value. CONSOL Energy uses fixed price contracts, collar price contracts and derivative commodity instruments that qualify as cash flow hedges under the Derivatives and Hedging Topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification to minimize exposure to market price volatility in the sale of natural gas. Our risk management policy prohibits the use of derivatives for speculative purposes. CONSOL Energy has established risk management policies and procedures to strengthen the internal control environment of the marketing of commodities produced from its asset base. All of the derivative instruments without other risk assessment procedures are held for purposes other than trading. They are used primarily to mitigate uncertainty and volatility and cover underlying exposures. CONSOL Energys market risk strategy incorporates fundamental risk management tools to assess market price risk and establish a framework in which management can maintain a portfolio of transactions within pre defined risk parameters. CONSOL Energy believes that the use of derivative instruments, along with the risk assessment procedures and internal controls, mitigates our exposure to material risk. However, the use of derivative instruments without other risk assessment procedures could materially affect CONSOL Energy results of operations depending on market prices. Nevertheless, we believe that use of these instruments will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or liquidity. For a summary of accounting policies related to derivative instruments, see Note 1 Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. A sensitivity analysis has been performed to determine the incremental effect on future earnings, related to open derivative at December 31, 2010. A hypothetical 10 percent decrease in future natural gas prices would increase future earnings related to derivatives by $36.8 million. Similarly, a hypothetical increase in future natural gas prices would decrease future earnings related to derivatives by $36.8 million. 114 Table of Contents Hedging Volumes Our hedged volumes as of January 24, 2011 are as follows: For the Three Months Ended March 31, June 30, September 30, December 31, Total Year 2011 Fixed Price Volumes Hedged Mcf 13,107,483 18,539,961 18,743,698 18,793,509 69,184,651 Weighted Average Hedge Price/Mcf $ 5.53 $ 5.21 $ 5.21 $ 5.27 $ 5.29 2012 Fixed Price Volumes Hedged Mcf 6,567,010 6,567,010 6,639,175 6,639,175 26,412,370 Weighted Average Hedge Price/Mcf $ 6.02 $ 6.02 $ 6.02 $ 6.02 $ 6.02 2013 Fixed Price Volumes Hedged Mcf 1,855,670 1,876,289 1,896,907 1,896,907 7,525,773 Weighted Average Hedge Price/Mcf $ 5.08 $ 5.08 $ 5.08 $ 5.08 $ 5.08 2014 Fixed Price Volumes Hedged Mcf 1,855,670 1,876,289 1,896,907 1,896,907 7,525,773 Weighted Average Hedge Price/Mcf $ 5.30 $ 5.30 $ 5.30 $ 5.30 $ 5.30 CONSOL Energy is exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by counterparties. The creditworthiness of counterparties is subject to continuing review. The Company has not experienced any issues of non performance by derivative counterparties. CONSOL Energys interest expense is sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates in the United States. At December 31, 2010, CONSOL Energy had $3,211 million aggregate principal amount of debt outstanding under fixed rate instruments and $484 million aggregate principal amount of debt outstanding under variable rate instruments. CONSOL Energys primary exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our revolving credit facility, under which there were $155 million of borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2010. CONSOL Energys revolving credit facility bore interest at a weighted average rate of 3.94% per annum during the year ended December 31, 2010. A 100 basis point increase in the average rate for CONSOL Energys revolving credit facility would not have significantly decreased net income for the period. CONSOL Energys subsidiary, CNX Gas, also had outstanding borrowings under their revolving credit facility which bears interest at a variable rate. CNX Gas facility had outstanding borrowings of $129 million at December 31, 2010 and bore interest at a weighted average rate of 2.18% per annum during the year ended December 31, 2010. A 100 basis point increase in the average rate for CNX Gas revolving credit facility would not have significantly decreased net income for the period. Almost all of CONSOL Energys transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars, and, as a result, it does not have material exposure to currency exchange rate risks. 115 Table of Contents
