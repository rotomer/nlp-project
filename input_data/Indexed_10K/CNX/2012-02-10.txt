ITEM 7.Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsGeneralFourth quarter demand for U.S. thermal and metallurgical coal continued to keep pace with the first three quarters of 2011. Demand for thermal coal from domestic electric generators decreased slightly from the previous year due to decreases in electricity demand and relatively low natural gas prices that have taken some market share from coal generation. International demand for U.S. coals, however, has exceeded any reduction in demand from domestic electric generators. Total U.S. coal exports are likely to exceed 100 million tons for 2011 which is at least 20 million tons higher than 2010 levels. International demand for U.S. thermal coal slowed in the fourth quarter, but total 2011 thermal coal exports were almost double 2010 levels. Prices for spot coal delivered into Europe declined in the fourth quarter due to weak demand related to the economic slowdown and by weather conditions. Prices for export thermal coal remain competitive relative to U.S. thermal coal customers. Longer term fundamentals for thermal coal exports to Europe remain favorable as subsidized mining in Europe is phased out, nuclear growth plans are curtailed and South African coals are pulled into Asian markets. Domestically, coal inventories at electric generators began to grow towards the end of the fourth quarter due to warmer than normal December weather and relatively low natural gas prices. U.S. electric demand during the fourth quarter of 2011 was estimated to be slightly lower than 2010 levels due to a relatively mild start to the winter season. Coal inventories at electric utilities in CONSOL Energy s traditional markets grew slightly during the fourth quarter but remain below recent years. Metallurgical coal demand for 2011 continued the strong pace set earlier this year as world blast furnace output grew an estimated 4.7% over 2010. Steel produced from the blast furnace method uses metallurgical coal and drives metallurgical coal demand. China continues to provide the bulk of the worlds blast furnace iron production with almost 59% of world production, an increase of 6.3% compared to 2010. Although European steelmakers have shown signs of a slowdown, global production remains strong. In particular, production in the United States was up almost 13% compared to 2010, supported by a modest rebound in the North American auto sector. 58Global supply of metallurgical coal began to normalize in the fourth quarter after conditions improved at Australian mines impacted by the Spring 2011 flooding. International settlement prices have declined since the temporary supply and demand imbalance was resolved, but currently reflect the tight global supply and demand balance for metallurgical coal. CONSOL Energy is well positioned to take advantage of this market with its low cost Buchanan low volatile operation, low cost high volatile operations in Northern Appalachia and mid vol operations set to open in early 2012.Natural gas markets enjoyed record demand in 2011 primarily driven by gas fired electric generation and an increase in industrial consumption. Some of this increase in demand came from electric generators taking advantage of relatively low prices and utilized more natural gas generation. Supply however, has continued to grow at very strong rates due to the abundance of new shale resources. This supply and demand imbalance is tempered by decreased imports of liquefied natural gas (LNG) and Western Canadian pipeline gas, as well as increased exports to Eastern Canada and Mexico. This supply response may not be sufficient to bring the markets into balance and additional downward price pressures could be experienced in 2012.Longer term rebalancing will be aided by declining conventional production and the shift in drilling towards oil and liquids rich gas plays. The widespread perception that shale gas production will yield lower and less volatile natural gas prices could spur additional demand as electric generators choose to build additional high efficiency baseload gas power plants. Additional demand will come from the petrochemical industry and developing sources of demand such as more wide scale use of natural gas vehicles. CONSOL Energy continues to believe that natural gas will bring balance to CONSOL Energys portfolio of long lived energy resources.A failure to return to normal weather patterns could have a negative short term impact on CONSOL Energys natural gas and domestic thermal coal demand. Additionally, uncertainty in the short term economic outlook could lead to a slowing of global economic expansion. Economic uncertainty is currently driven by the European sovereign debt crisis, lingering high U.S. unemployment rates and instability in the Middle East oil producing region. The fundamental long term drivers of CONSOL Energys business remain unchanged as the global demand for low cost, reliable sources of energy and metallurgical coal remain strong in both the developed and developing world.CONSOL Energy engaged in several business and financing transactions in the year ended December 31, 2011. These transactions include the following:On October 27, 2011, CONSOL Energys Board of Directors increased the regular annual dividend by 25%, or $0.10 per share, to $0.50 per share.On October 21, 2011, CNX Gas Company LLC (CNX Gas Company) completed a sale to a subsidiary of Hess Corporation (Hess) of 50% of its nearly 200 thousand net Utica Shale acres in Ohio. Cash proceeds related to this transaction were $54 million, which is net of $5 million of transaction fees. Additionally, CONSOL Energy and Hess entered into a joint development agreement pursuant to which Hess agreed to pay approximately $534 million in the form of a 50% drilling carry of certain CONSOL Energy working interest obligations as the acreage is developed. The net gain on the transaction was $53 million and was recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income as Other Income.On September 30, 2011, CNX Gas Company completed a sale to Noble Energy, Inc. (Noble) of 50% of the Companys undivided interest in certain Marcellus Shale oil and gas properties in West Virginia and Pennsylvania covering approximately 628 thousand net acres and 50% of the Companys undivided interest in certain of its existing Marcellus Shale wells and related leases. Cash proceeds of $485 million were received related to this transaction, which are net of $35 million transaction fees. Additionally, a note receivable has been recognized related to the two additional cash payments to be received on the first and a second anniversary of the transaction closing date. The discounted notes receivable of $312 million and $296 million have been recorded in Accounts and Notes Receivables Notes Receivable and Other Assets Notes Receivable, respectively. Subsequent to the transaction, an additional receivable of $17 million and a payable of approximately $980 thousand were recorded for closing adjustments and have been included in Accounts and Notes Receivable Other and Accounts Payable, respectively. The net loss on the transaction was $64 million and was recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income as Other Income. As part of the transaction, CNX Gas Company also received a commitment from Noble to pay one third of the Companys working interest share of certain drilling and completion costs, up to approximately $2.1 billion with certain restrictions. These restrictions include the suspension of carry if average natural gas Henry Hub prices are below $4.00 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) for three consecutive months. The carry will remain suspended until average natural gas prices are above $4.00/MMBtu for three consecutive months. Restrictions also include a $400 million annual maximum on Nobles carried cost obligation.59 On September 30 2011, CNX Gas Company and Noble formed CONE Gathering LLC (CONE), a joint venture established to develop and operate each companys gas gathering system needs in the Marcellus Shale play. CNX Gas Companys 50% ownership interest in CONE is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. CNX Gas contributed its existing Marcellus Shale gathering infrastructure which had a net book value of $120 million and Noble contributed cash of approximately $68 million. CONE made a cash distribution to CNX Gas in the amount of $68 million. The cash proceeds have been recorded as cash inflows of $60 million and $8 million in Distributions from Equity Affiliates and Proceeds from the Sale of Assets, respectively, on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow. The gain on the transaction was $7 million and was recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income as Other Income.On September 21, 2011 CONSOL Energy entered into an agreement with Antero Resources Appalachian Corp. (Antero), pursuant to which CONSOL Energy assigned to Antero overriding royalty interests (ORRI) of approximately 7% in approximately 116 thousand net acres of Marcellus Shale located in nine counties in southwestern Pennsylvania and north central West Virginia, in exchange for $193 million. The net gain of $41 million is included in Other Income in the Consolidated Statements of Income.CONSOL Energy incurred costs of approximately $15 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 related to the solicitation of consents from the holders of CONSOL Energys outstanding 8.00% Senior Notes due 2017, 8.25% Senior Notes due 2020 and 6.375% Senior Notes due 2021. The consents allowed an amendment to the indentures for each of those notes, clarifying that the transactions such as those contemplated by the August 2011 Asset Acquisition Agreements with Noble and Hess were permissible under those indentures.In June 2011, the Bituminous Coal Operators Association (BCOA) and the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA) reached a new collective bargaining agreement which will run from July 1, 2011 to December 31, 2016. That agreement, the National Bituminous Coal Wage Agreement of 2011 (2011 NBCWA), covers approximately 2,900 employees of CONSOL Energy subsidiaries. The 2011 NBCWA is the successor agreement to the 2007 NBCWA that was set to expire on December 31, 2011. Key elements of the new agreement include the following items:a.A wage increase of $1.00 per hour effective July 1, 2011, and an additional $1.00 per hour increase each January 1st throughout the contract term.b.Contributions to the 1974 Pension Plan, a multi employer plan, will continue at the current rate of $5.50 per hour throughout the contract term. New inexperienced miners hired after December 31, 2011 will not participate in the 1974 Pension Plan, but will receive a $1.00 per hour contribution (increasing to $1.50 per hour in 2014 2016) to the UMWA Cash Deferred Savings Plan (CDSP), which is a 401(k) Plan. UMWA represented employees with over 20 years of credited service under the 1974 Pension Plan will receive a $1.00 per hour contribution (increasing to $1.50 per hour in 2014 2016) to the CDSP beginning January 1, 2012. Also beginning January 1, 2012, UMWA represented employees will have the right to elect to opt out of future participation in the 1974 Pension Plan and upon such election, will receive a $1.00 per hour contribution (increasing to $1.50 per hour in 2014 2016) to the CDSP.c.A $1.50 per hour contribution starting January 1, 2012 to a new defined contribution plan to provide retiree bonus payments to eligible retirees in 2014, 2015 and 2016.d.An increased contribution from $0.50 per hour to $1.10 per hour effective January 1, 2012 to the 1993 Benefit Plan, which is a defined contribution plan providing health benefits to certain retirees. e.Various other changes related to absenteeism, contributions to various UMWA benefit funds, eligibility for various vacation days and sick days.In June 2011, CONSOL Energy management decided to permanently idle its Mine 84 underground facility. This facility had been on idle status since March 2009. Various options for the facility were explored, such as selling and operating with continuous miners, but management decided it was in the best interest of the Company to abandon the underground workings of this facility and reallocate resources into more profitable coal operations and Marcellus Shale drilling operations. The Company redeployed all of the movable equipment from the mine that could be used at other locations. The abandonment of this underground facility resulted in a $116 million charge to pre tax earnings. See Note 10Property, Plant and Equipment in the Notes to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K for additional disclosure. The Company expects the closure of Mine 84 to result in pre tax cash savings of $18 million per year.In April 2011, CNX Gas entered into an amendment to its senior secured credit agreement which increases the 60availability under the agreement from $700 million to $1.0 billion, decreases the interest rate and extends the term from May 6, 2014 to April 12, 2016. The amended credit agreement continues to be secured by substantially all of the assets of CNX Gas and its subsidiaries.In April 2011, CONSOL Energy amended and extended its existing $1.5 billion senior secured credit agreement, which decreases the interest rate and extends the term from May 7, 2014 to April 12, 2016. The amended agreement continues to be secured by substantially all of the assets of CONSOL Energy and certain of its subsidiaries.On March 9, 2011, CONSOL Energy issued $250 million of 6.375% senior notes due March 2021. The Notes are guaranteed by substantially all of the Companys existing and future wholly owned domestic restricted subsidiaries. The Company issued the Notes with the intention of using the net proceeds to repay its outstanding 7.875% senior secured notes due March 1, 2012, on or before their maturity. On April 11, 2011, CONSOL Energy redeemed all of its outstanding $250 million, 7.875% senior secured notes due March 1, 2012 in accordance with the terms of the indenture governing the notes. By using the proceeds of the $250 million, 6.375% senior notes due March 2021 to effect this redemption, the Company effectively extended the maturity of the $250 million of long term indebtedness by nine years at a lower interest rate. The redemption price included principal of $250 million, a make whole premium of $16 million and accrued interest of $2 million, for a total redemption cost of approximately $268 million. The loss on extinguishment of debt was approximately $16 million, which primarily represents the interest that would have been paid on these notes if they had been held to maturity.CONSOL Energy is managing several significant matters that may affect our business and impact our financial results in the future including the following:Challenges in the overall environment in which we operate create increased risks that we must continuously monitor and manage. These risks include (i) increased prices for commodities such as diesel fuel, synthetic rubber and steel that we use in our operations and (ii) increased scrutiny of existing safety regulations and the development of new safety regulations.Federal and state environmental regulators are reviewing our operations more closely and more strictly interpreting and enforcing existing environmental laws and regulations, resulting in increased costs and delays. For example, we entered into a consent decree with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection pursuant to which we agreed to construct an advanced technology mine water treatment plant and related facilities to reduce high levels of total dissolved solids in water discharges from certain of our mines in Northern West Virginia, at a total estimated cost of approximately $200 million.Federal and state regulators have proposed regulations which, if adopted, would adversely impact our business. These proposed regulations could require significant changes in the manner in which we operate and or would increase the cost of our operations. For example, the Department of Interior, Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSM) is currently preparing an environmental impact statement relating to OSMs consideration of five alternatives for amending its coal mining stream protection rules. All of the alternatives, except the no action alternative, could make it more costly to mine our coal and or could eliminate the ability to mine some of our coal. Further, other regulations would make it more expensive for our customers to operate their businesses, possibly inducing them to move to alternative fuel sources. For example, the EPA has issued a proposed rule that would regulate coal combustion residuals from coal fired electric generating facilities under the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) as either a hazardous waste under Subtitle C of RCRA or as a non hazardous waste under Subtitle D of RCRA. If final rules are adopted consistent with either of the proposed alternatives, the cost of handling and disposal of coal combustion residuals could increase making it more expensive to generate electricity from coal. Another example is the Cross State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR) that was finalized by the EPA on July 6, 2011, although the effective date of the rule has been stayed by a court. CSAPR replaces the Clean Air Interstate Rule and regulates the amount of SO2 and NOx that power plants in 23 eastern states can emit in order to meet clean air requirements in downwind states. Another example is the Mercury and Air Toxic Standards issued by the EPA on December 16, 2011. The new regulations, which will be published in February 2012, set mercury and air toxic standards for new and existing coal and oil fired electric utility steam generating units and include more stringent new source performance standards (NSPS) for particulate matter (PM), SO2 and NOX. Some older coal fired power plants may be retired or have operation time reduced rather than install additional expensive emission controls which could reduce the amount of coal consumed.On April 19, 2011, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection announced its intent to not renew permits for publicly owned treatment works (POTW) that treat municipal wastewater to accept wastewater from 61Marcellus Shale operators. They called on operators to cease delivering wastewater to the POTWs by May 19, 2011. CONSOL Energy has implemented a re cycle and re use process of its Marcellus derived water for hydraulic fracturing operations, and will only safely dispose of Marcellus wastewater in regulated, underground injection control wells.CONSOL Energy continues to explore potential sales of non core assets.Results of OperationsYear Ended December 31, 2011 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2010 Net Income Attributable to CONSOL Energy ShareholdersCONSOL Energy reported net income attributable to CONSOL Energy shareholders of $632 million, or $2.76 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2011. Net income attributable to CONSOL Energy shareholders was $347 million, or $1.60 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2010. The coal division includes thermal coal, high volatile metallurgical coal, low volatile metallurgical coal and other coal. The total coal division contributed $933 million of earnings before income tax for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $536 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The total coal division sold 62.7 million tons of coal produced from CONSOL Energy mines, excluding our portion of tons sold from equity affiliates, for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 63.0 million tons for the year ended December 31, 2010. The average sales price and average costs per ton for all active coal operations were as follows: For the Years Ended December 31, 2011 2010 Variance PercentChangeAverage Sales Price per ton sold$72.25 $61.33 $10.92 17.8%Average Costs per ton sold52.08 46.78 5.30 11.3%Margin$20.17 $14.55 $5.62 38.6%The higher average sales price per ton sold reflects successful re negotiation of several domestic thermal contracts whose pricing took effect January 1, 2011, another strong quarter of high volatile metallurgical coal sales and demand for our premium low volatile metallurgical coal. Also, 11.7 million tons were priced on the export market at an average sales price of $121.29 per ton for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 8.1 million tons at an average price of $97.10 per ton for the year ended December 31, 2010.Average costs per ton sold increased $5.30 per ton in the period to period comparison due primarily to the following:Operating supplies and maintenance costs per ton sold were higher due to increased equipment overhauls, additional roof control and additional equipment maintenance.Depreciation, depletion and amortization increased due to additional assets placed into service after the 2010 period.Labor and labor related charges increased as a result of additional employees, increased overtime hours worked and the impact of the $1.50 per hour worked UMWA contract wage increases, $0.50 per hour worked related to the prior UMWA contract and $1.00 per hour worked related to the July 2011 UMWA contract.Other post employment benefits and pension expenses increased primarily due to changes in discount rates, employees retiring sooner than originally anticipated and higher average claim costs.Royalties and production related taxes increased due to higher sales price of coal sold.The total gas division includes coalbed methane (CBM), shallow oil and gas, Marcellus and other gas. The total gas division contributed $130 million of earnings before income tax for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $180 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. Total gas production was 153.5 billion net cubic feet for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 127.9 billion net cubic feet for the year ended December 31, 2010. Total gas production increased primarily due to the on going drilling program partially offset by 6.6 billion net cubic feet of production related to the Noble joint venture.62The average sales price and average costs for all active gas operations were as follows: For the Years Ended December 31, 2011 2010 Variance PercentChangeAverage Sales Price per thousand cubic feet sold$4.90 $5.83 $(0.93) (16.0)%Average Costs per thousand cubic feet sold3.86 3.90 (0.04) (1.0)%Margin$1.04 $1.93 $(0.89) (46.1)%Total gas division outside sales revenues were $752 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $746 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase was primarily due to 20.0% increase in volumes sold partially offset by the 16.0% reduction in average price per thousand cubic feet sold. The volume increase was primarily due to additional wells drilled under the on going drilling program, and additional volumes from the wells purchased in the Dominion Acquisition, which occurred on April 30, 2010 offset, in part, by the impact of the Noble joint venture which reduced 2011 volumes by approximately 6.6 billion net cubic feet. The decrease in average sales price is the result of various gas swap transactions that occurred throughout both periods and lower average market prices. The gas swap transactions qualify as financial cash flow hedges that exist parallel to the underlying physical transactions. These financial hedges represented approximately 84.0 billion cubic feet of our produced gas sales volumes for the year ended December 31, 2011 at an average price of $5.21 per thousand cubic feet. These financial hedges represented 52.1 billion cubic feet of our produced gas sales volumes for the year ended December 31, 2010 at an average price of $7.66 per thousand cubic feet.Total gas unit costs decreased slightly for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the year ended December 31, 2010 primarily due to lower depreciation, depletion and amortization and lower gathering costs partially offset by increased lifting costs. The wells purchased in the Dominion Acquisition increased total operating costs by $0.32 per thousand cubic feet due to higher costs and lower volumes produced related to the age of these wells compared to the legacy CONSOL Energy wells. Excluding the impact of these purchased wells, unit costs improved $0.36 per thousand cubic feet primarily due to the additional volumes produced, improved depreciation, depletion and amortization and lower gathering charges. Volumes increased in the period to period comparison due to the on going drilling program and the additional volumes from the wells purchased in the Dominion Acquisition partially offset by the impact of the Noble joint venture. Lower depreciation, depletion and amortization rates were the result of additional gas reserves recognized at December 31, 2010. Gathering and compression charges were improved primarily due to a fuel surcharge reduction by a utility provider. Lifting costs increased in the period to period comparison due to additional well services to maintain production levels.The other segment includes industrial supplies activity, terminal, river and dock service activity, income taxes and other business activities not assigned to the coal or gas segment.Included in both coal and gas unit costs are Selling, General and Administrative Expenses and total Company long term liabilities, such as other post employment benefits (OPEB), the salary retirement plan, workers compensation and long term disability. Total Company Selling, General and Administrative Expenses are allocated to various segments primarily based on revenue and capital expenditure projections between coal and gas as a percent of total. Total Company Selling, General and Administrative Expenses were made up of the following items: For the Years Ended December 31, 2011 2010 Variance PercentChangeEmployee wages and related expenses$80 $72 $8 11.1%Demurrage6 2 4 200.0%Advertising and promotion10 7 3 42.9%Contributions7 4 3 75.0%Commissions14 12 2 16.7%Consulting and professional services28 26 2 7.7%Miscellaneous31 27 4 14.8%Total Company Selling, General and Administrative Expenses$176 $150 $26 17.3%63Total Company Selling, General and Administrative Expenses increased due to the following:Employee wages and related expenses increased $8 million which was primarily attributable to the support staff retained in the Dominion Acquisition and additional hiring of support staff in the period to period comparison.Demurrage charges were higher in the 2011 period due to increased export traffic at the Baltimore terminal.Advertising and promotion expense increased $3 million in the period to period comparison due to additional campaigns initiated in the 2011 period.Contributions expense increased $3 million due to various transactions that occurred throughout both periods, none of which were individually material.Commission expense increased $2 million due to the increase in average sales price and additional tons sold for which a third party was owed a commission in the period to period comparison.Consulting and professional services increased $2 million due to various transactions that occurred throughout both periods, none of which were individually material.Miscellaneous selling, general and administrative expenses increased $4 million due to various transactions that occurred throughout both periods, none of which were individually material.Total Company long term liabilities, such as other post employment benefits (OPEB), the salary retirement plan, workers compensation and long term disability are actuarially calculated for the Company as a whole. The expenses are then allocated to operational units based on active employee counts or active salary dollars. Total CONSOL Energy expense related to our actuarial calculated liabilities was $332 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $287 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase of $45 million was due primarily to OPEB and salary pension expense. The additional OPEB and salary pension expense related to changes in discount rates, employees retiring sooner than originally anticipated and higher average claim costs. See Note 15Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans and Note 16Coal Workers Pneumoconiosis (CWP) and Workers Compensation in the Notes to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10 k for additional details related to total Company expense increases.64TOTAL COAL SEGMENT ANALYSIS for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the year ended December 31, 2010:The coal segment contributed $933 million of earnings before income tax in the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $536 million in the year ended December 31, 2010.

The thermal coal revenue and cost components on a per unit basis for these periods are as follows: For the Years Ended December 31, 2011 2010 Variance PercentChangeProduced Thermal Tons Sold (in millions)52.0 55.8 (3.8) (6.8)%Average Sales Price Per Thermal Ton Sold$58.87 $53.76 $5.11 9.5 %Average Operating Costs Per Thermal Ton Sold$36.93 $34.64 $2.29 6.6 %Average Provision Costs Per Thermal Ton Sold$4.24 $3.55 $0.69 19.4 %Average Selling, Administrative and Other Costs Per Thermal Ton Sold$3.21 $2.55 $0.66 25.9 %Average Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization Costs Per Thermal Ton Sold$5.81 $4.90 $0.91 18.6 % Total Average Costs Per Thermal Ton Sold$50.19 $45.64 $4.55 10.0 % Margin Per Thermal Ton Sold$8.68 $8.12 $0.56 6.9 %Thermal coal revenue was $3,058 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $3,001 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The $57 million increase was attributable to a $5.11 per ton higher average sales price partially offset by 3.8 million fewer tons sold in 2011. The higher average thermal coal sales price in the 2011 period was the result of the successful re negotiation of several domestic thermal contracts whose pricing took effect on January 1, 2011. Also, 2.8 million tons of thermal coal was priced on the export market at an average sales price of $66.45 per ton for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 2.4 million tons at an average price of $54.68 per ton for year ended December 31, 2010. The thermal coal segment was also impacted by 4.7 million tons of thermal coal sold on the high volatile metallurgical coal market for the year ended December 31, 2011, which was 2.3 million tons more than the tons sold in the year ended December 31, 2010. Other income attributable to the thermal coal segment represents earnings from our equity affiliates that operate thermal coal mines. The equity in earnings of affiliates is insignificant to the total segment activity.Operating costs are comprised of labor, supplies, maintenance, subsidence, taxes other than income and preparation plant charges related to the extraction and sale of coal. These costs are reviewed regularly by management and are considered to be the direct responsibility of mine management. Operating costs related to the thermal coal segment were $1,919 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $1,934 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. Operating costs related to the thermal coal segment decreased primarily due to lower volumes sold partially offset by higher average costs per ton sold. Changes in the average operating costs per ton for thermal coal sold were also related to the following items:Average operating supplies and maintenance costs per thermal ton sold increased due to additional maintenance and equipment overhaul costs, additional roof control costs, and increased fuel and lubricants. Additional maintenance and equipment overhaul costs are related to additional equipment being serviced in the current period. Additional roof control costs resulted from changes in roof support strategy, such as using longer roof bolts and additional types of roof support, in order to improve the safety of our mines and to provide a more reliable source of production for our customers. Increased fuel and lubricant costs are related to higher fuel prices in the current period. Labor and related benefits were impaired on a cost per thermal ton sold basis due to higher costs and lower volumes sold. Higher benefit costs were due primarily to contributions made to the 1974 Pension Trust (the Trust), which is a multiemployer pension plan. Contributions to the Trust were negotiated under the National Bituminous Coal Wage Agreement and are based on a rate per hour worked by members of the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA). The contribution rate increased $0.50 per hour worked in the 2011 period compared to the 2010 period. Non represented benefit rates for active employees also increased as a result of continued increases in healthcare costs. Labor and related benefits also increased due to additional employees and the impact of the wage increases of $1.50 per hour worked, $0.50 per hour worked effective January 1, 2011 under the previous collective bargaining agreement and $1.00 per hour worked effective July 1, 2011 related to the July 2011 collective bargaining agreement. These increases were offset, in part, as a result of the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 authorizing general fund revenues and expanding transfers of interest from the Abandoned Mine Land trust fund to cover orphan retirees which remain in the Combined Fund, the 1992 Benefit Plan and the 1993 Plan. The additional federal funding eliminated the 2011 funding of orphan retirees by participating active employers of the plans, resulting in lower expense in the 66period to period comparison. The additional federal funding does not impact the amount of contributions required to be paid for our assigned retirees. Also, we may be required to make additional payments in the future to these plans in the event the federal contributions are not sufficient to cover the benefits. Production taxes average cost per thermal ton sold increased primarily due to the $5.11 per ton higher average sales price. Average operating costs per thermal ton sold increased due to lower tons sold resulting in fixed costs being allocated over less tons resulting in higher unit costs.Provision costs are made up of the expenses related to the Companys long term liabilities, such as other post employment benefits (OPEB), the salary retirement plan, workers compensation, long term disability and accretion on mine closing and related liabilities. With the exception of accretion expense on mine closing and related liabilities, these liabilities are actuarially calculated for the Company as a whole. The expenses are then allocated to operational units based on active employee counts or active salary dollars. Accretion is calculated on a mine by mine basis. Provision costs attributable to the thermal coal segment were $220 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $198 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increased thermal coal provision expense was attributable to the total Company increase in long term liability expense discussed in the total Company results of operations section. Thermal coal accretion expense related to mine closing and related liabilities remained consistent in the period to period comparison.Selling, administrative and other costs attributable to the thermal coal segment include selling, general and administrative expenses and direct administrative costs. Selling, general and administrative costs, excluding commission expense, are allocated to various segments based on a combination of estimated time worked by various support groups and operating costs incurred at the mine. Commission expense, which is a component of selling, is charged directly to the mine incurring the cost. Direct administrative costs are associated directly with the coal division of the business and are allocated to various mines based on a combination of estimated time worked and production. Selling, administrative and other costs related to the thermal coal segment were $167 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $142 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The cost increases attributable to the thermal coal segment were attributable to higher selling, general and administrative expenses as discussed in the total Company results of operations section and higher direct administrative costs. Higher direct administrative costs were primarily due to higher employee related expenses due to additional support staff requirements, increased safety reward expense and increased coal sampling charges in the period to period comparison. These higher costs and lower sales volumes resulted in a $0.66 per ton increase in average cost per ton sold.Depreciation, depletion and amortization for the thermal coal segment was $302 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $274 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase was primarily due to additional equipment and infrastructure placed into service after the 2010 period that was depreciated on a straight line basis. The increase was also due to higher units of production rates for thermal coal mines due to additional air shafts being placed into service after the 2010 period which had higher unit rates than historical shafts put into service. These higher expenses and lower sales tons, resulted in a $0.91 increase in average costs per ton sold. 67HIGH VOL METALLURGICAL COAL SEGMENTThe high volatile metallurgical coal segment contributed $135 million to total Company earnings before income tax for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $87 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The high volatile metallurgical coal revenue and cost components on a per unit basis for these periods are as follows: For the Years Ended December 31, 2011 2010 Variance PercentChangeProduced High Vol Met Tons Sold (in millions)4.7 2.4 2.3 95.8%Average Sales Price Per High Vol Met Ton Sold$78.06 $72.89 $5.17 7.1%Average Operating Costs Per High Vol Met Ton Sold$37.18 $29.16 $8.02 27.5%Average Provision Costs Per High Vol Met Ton Sold$4.17 $3.08 $1.09 35.4%Average Selling, Administrative and Other Costs Per High Vol Met Ton Sold$3.79 $2.26 $1.53 67.7%Average Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization Costs Per High Vol Met Ton Sold$6.50 $4.61 $1.89 41.0% Total Average Costs Per High Vol Met Ton Sold$51.64 $39.11 $12.53 32.0% Margin Per High Vol Met Ton Sold$26.42 $33.78 $(7.36) (21.8%)High volatile metallurgical coal revenue was $368 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $172 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. Strength in the metallurgical coal market has continued to allow the export of Northern Appalachian coal, historically sold domestically on the thermal coal market, to crossover to the Brazilian and Asian metallurgical coal markets. Also, 4.3 million tons of thermal coal was priced on the export market at an average sales price of $77.48 per ton for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 2.3 million tons at an average price of $73.51 per ton for year ended December 31, 2010. As a result, average sales prices for high volatile metallurgical coal have increased due to growing the base of end user customers.Other income attributed to the high volatile metallurgical coal segment represents earnings from our equity affiliates that operate high volatile metallurgical coal mines. The equity in earnings of affiliates is insignificant to the total segment activity.Operating costs related to the high volatile metallurgical coal segment were $175 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $69 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. Operating costs related to the high volatile metallurgical coal segment increased primarily due to higher volumes sold and higher average costs per ton sold.Changes in average operating costs per ton for high volatile metallurgical coal sold were primarily related to the following items:Average operating costs per high volatile metallurgical ton sold increased due to the mix of mines selling coal on the high volatile metallurgical coal market. As higher cost structure mines sell coal in the high volatile metallurgical market, average operating costs per ton sold increase. Previously, this segment only included lower cost structure mines.Labor and related benefits increased due to higher employee counts, higher non represented benefit rates and higher contributions per hour worked to the 1974 Pension Trust (Trust). Labor and related benefits increased due to additional employees in the period to period comparison. Higher labor and related costs were also due to higher non represented benefit rates for active employees related to the continued increase in healthcare costs. Higher contributions made to the Trust were discussed in the thermal coal segment. Labor and related benefits also increased due to the impact of the wage increases of $1.50 per hour worked, $0.50 per hour worked effective January 1, 2011 under the previous collective bargaining agreement and $1.00 per hour worked effective July 1, 2011 related to the July 2011 collective bargaining agreement, in the period to period comparison. These increases were offset by lower overall contributions to certain multiemployer benefit plans such as the 1992 Fund, the 1993 Fund and the Combined Fund, which were also discussed in the thermal coal segment. Increased labor and related benefit costs per unit sold were also offset, in part, by additional volumes of high volatile metallurgical tons sold in the period to period comparison.Average operating supplies and maintenance costs per high volatile metallurgical ton sold increased due to additional maintenance and equipment overhaul costs, additional roof control costs, and increased fuel and lubricants. Additional maintenance and equipment overhaul costs are related to additional equipment being serviced in the current period. Additional roof control costs resulted from changes in roof support strategy, such as using longer roof bolts and additional types of roof support, in order to improve the safety of our mines and to provide a more reliable source of production for our customers.68Average coal preparation costs per high vol ton sold increased due to additional maintenance projects that have been completed at our preparation plants in the period to period comparison.Production taxes average cost per high volatile metallurgical ton sold increased due to the $5.17 per ton higher average sales price. In transit charges average cost per high volatile metallurgical ton sold increased primarily due to the increased cost of moving coal from the mine to the preparation plant for processing. This increase is primarily related to the mix of mines now shipping high volatile metallurgical coal.The provision expense attributable to the high volatile metallurgical coal segment was $20 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $7 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase in the high volatile metallurgical coal provision expense was attributable to the total Company increased long term liability expense discussed in the total Company results of operations section. The per unit impairment was offset, in part, by additional tons sold in the period to period comparison. Also, high volatile metallurgical coal accretion expense related to mine closing and related liabilities remained consistent in the period to period comparison which offset some increases in costs per ton sold. Selling, administrative and other costs attributable to the high volatile metallurgical coal segment include selling, general and administrative expenses and direct administrative costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses, excluding commission expense, are allocated to various segments based on a combination of estimated time worked by various support groups and operating costs incurred at the mine. Commission expense, which is a component of selling, is charged directly to the mine incurring the cost. Direct administrative costs are associated directly with the coal division of the business and are allocated to various mines based on a combination of estimated time worked and production. Selling, administrative and other costs related to the high volatile metallurgical coal segment were $18 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $5 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The cost increase attributable to the high volatile metallurgical coal segment is attributable to higher total Company selling, general and administrative expenses as discussed in the total Company results of operations section and higher direct administrative costs. Higher direct administrative costs were primarily due to higher employee related expenses due to additional support staff requirements, increased safety reward expense and increased coal sampling charges in the period to period comparison. These additional expenses increased unit costs per ton sold and were offset, in part, by higher volumes of high volatile metallurgical coal sold.Depreciation, depletion and amortization for the high volatile metallurgical coal segment was $31 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $11 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase was primarily due to additional equipment and infrastructure placed into service after the 2010 period that is depreciated on a straight line basis. The increase was also due to higher units of production rates for high volatile metallurgical coal mines related to additional air shafts being placed into service after the 2010 period which had higher unit rates than historical shafts put into service. These increases in unit costs per ton sold were offset, in part, by additional high volatile metallurgical tons sold which lowered the unit cost per ton impact. The high volatile metallurgical coal segment increased the margin on our coal production that would have otherwise been sold in the domestic thermal coal market. 69LOW VOL METALLURGICAL COAL SEGMENTThe low volatile metallurgical coal segment contributed $681 million to total Company earnings before income tax in the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $382 million in the year ended December 31, 2010. The low volatile metallurgical coal revenue and cost components on a per ton basis for these periods are as follows: For the Years Ended December 31, 2011 2010 Variance PercentChangeProduced Low Vol Met Tons Sold (in millions)5.6 4.6 1.0 21.7%Average Sales Price Per Low Vol Met Ton Sold$191.81 $146.32 $45.49 31.1%Average Operating Costs Per Low Vol Met Ton Sold$51.57 $49.82 $1.75 3.5%Average Provision Costs Per Low Vol Met Ton Sold$6.84 $5.90 $0.94 15.9%Average Selling, Administrative and Other Costs Per Low Vol Met Ton Sold$4.97 $3.95 $1.02 25.8%Average Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization Costs Per Low Vol Met Ton Sold$6.62 $4.57 $2.05 44.9% Total Average Costs Per Low Vol Met Ton Sold$70.00 $64.24 $5.76 9.0% Margin Per Low Vol Met Ton Sold$121.81 $82.08 $39.73 48.4%Low volatile metallurgical coal revenue was $1,072 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $680 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The $392 million increase was attributable to a $45.49 per ton higher average sales price due to the strength of the low volatile metallurgical market, both domestic and foreign. The strength of these markets is related to continued worldwide demand for premium low volatile metallurgical coal. For the 2011 period, 4.6 million tons of low volatile metallurgical coal was priced on the export market at an average price of $196.46 per ton compared to 3.3 million tons at an average price of $144.23 per ton for the 2010 period.Operating costs are made up of labor, supplies, maintenance, subsidence, taxes other than income and preparation plant charges related to the extraction and sale of coal. These costs are reviewed regularly by management and are considered to be the direct responsibility of mine management. Operating costs related to the low volatile metallurgical coal segment were $288 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $232 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. Operating costs related to the low volatile metallurgical coal segment increased primarily due to higher volumes sold. Changes in the average operating costs per ton for low volatile metallurgical coal sold were primarily related to the following items:Production taxes average cost per low volatile metallurgical ton sold increased due to the $45.49 per ton higher average sales price. Average operating supplies and maintenance costs per low volatile metallurgical ton sold increased due to additional roof control costs, additional ventilation costs of coalbed methane gas, additional equipment overhaul costs and increased rock dusting. Additional roof control costs resulted from changes in roof support strategy, such as types of roof support used and quantity of supports put into place. The roof control strategy was changed to improve the safety of the mine and to provide a more reliable source of production for our customers. Roof control costs also increased due to higher steel prices in the period to period comparison. In addition, costs were incurred in the 2011 period to increase the number of bore holes that were placed ahead of mining to ventilate the coalbed methane gas from the mine. Additional maintenance and equipment overhaul costs are related to additional equipment being serviced in the current period. Increased rock dusting was primarily due to changes in regulations.These increases in costs were partially offset by the following items:Coal inventory volumes increased slightly at December 31, 2011 compared to December 31, 2010 and carrying value increased $5.09 per ton in the corresponding period. Coal inventory decreased 0.2 million tons at December 31, 2010 compared to December 31, 2009 and the carrying value of the inventory during the corresponding period increased $7.29 per ton. These changes in inventory caused a reduction in average operating cost per ton sold in the period to period comparison.Power costs per low volatile metallurgical ton sold were improved due to utility rate reductions that became effective in the 2011 period. The provision expense attributable to the low volatile metallurgical coal segment was $38 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $27 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increased low volatile metallurgical 70coal provision expense per ton sold was attributable to the total Companys increased long term liability expense discussed in the total Company results of operations section, offset, in part, by higher volumes of low volatile metallurgical coal sold. Low volatile metallurgical coal accretion expense related to mine closing and related liabilities decreased approximately $1 million in the period to period comparison as a result of the annual engineering surveys which contributed to lower average costs per ton sold. Selling, administrative and other costs attributable to the low volatile metallurgical coal segment include selling, general and administrative expenses, direct administrative costs and water treatment expenses generated from the reverse osmosis plant. Selling, general and administrative costs, excluding commission expense and water treatment expense, are allocated to various segments on a combination of estimated time worked by various support groups and operating costs incurred at the mine. Commission expense, which is a component of selling, is charged directly to the mine incurring the cost. Direct administrative costs are associated directly with the coal division of the business and are allocated to various mines based on a combination of estimated time worked and production. Selling, administrative and other costs related to the low volatile metallurgical coal segment were $28 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $18 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The cost increase related to the low volatile metallurgical coal segment was attributable to higher selling, general and administrative expenses as discussed in the total Company results of operations section. Also, a reverse osmosis plant was completed and placed into service near the Buchanan Mine. Active mine water discharge is being treated by this facility and the costs of these services are charged to the mine based on gallons of water treated. Currently, the Buchanan Mine is the only facility using the plant. Construction of the plant was completed and the plant was placed into service in January 2011. These increases in expense were offset, in part, by higher volumes of low volatile metallurgical coal sold. Depreciation, depletion and amortization for the low volatile metallurgical coal segment was $37 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $21 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase was primarily due to additional equipment, infrastructure and the reverse osmosis plant placed into service after the 2010 period that is depreciated on a straight line basis. These increases in average costs per ton sold were offset, in part, by higher low volatile metallurgical tons sold which lowered the unit cost per ton impact. OTHER COAL SEGMENTThe other coal segment had a loss before income tax of $339 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to a loss before income tax of $394 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The other coal segment includes purchased coal activities, idle mine activities, as well as various activities assigned to the coal segment but not allocated to each individual mine.Other coal segment produced coal sales includes revenue from the sale of 0.4 million tons of coal which was recovered during the reclamation process at idled facilities for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 0.2 million tons for the year ended December 31, 2010. The primary focus of the activity at these locations is reclaiming disturbed land in accordance with the mining permit requirements after final mining has occurred. The tons sold are incidental to total Company production or sales.Purchased coal sales consist of revenues from processing third party coal in our preparation plants for blending purposes to meet customer coal specifications, coal purchased from third parties and sold directly to our customers and revenues from processing third party coal in our preparation plants. The revenues were $42 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $34 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase was primarily due to increased volumes sold partially offset by a decrease in the average sales price. Freight revenue is the amount billed to customers for transportation costs incurred. This revenue is based on weight of coal shipped, negotiated freight rates and method of transportation (i.e. rail, barge, truck, etc.) used by the customers to which CONSOL Energy contractually provides transportation services. Freight revenue is almost completely offset in freight expense. Freight revenue was $232 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $126 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase in freight revenue was primarily due to the 3.6 million ton increase in export tons in the period to period comparison.Miscellaneous other income was $62 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $48 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase of $14 million was primarily related to issuing pipeline right of ways to third parties which resulted in a gain of $12 million and various other transactions that occurred throughout both periods, none of which were individually material.71Other coal segment total costs were $702 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $614 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase of $88 million was due to the following items: For the Years Ended December 31, 2011 2010 VarianceAbandonment of long lived assets $116 $ $116Freight expense 231 126 105Purchased Coal 71 40 31Coal contract buyout 5 5Closed and idle mines 107 222 (115)Litigation expense 8 55 (47)Other 164 171 (7) Total other coal segment costs $702 $614 $88Abandonment of long lived assets was $116 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 as a result of permanently idling Mine 84. Freight expense is based on weight of coal shipped, negotiated freight rates and method of transportation (i.e. rail, barge, truck, etc.) used by the customers to which CONSOL Energy contractually provides transportation services. Freight revenue is the amount billed to customers for transportation costs incurred. Freight expense is almost completely offset in freight revenue. The increase was primarily due to the 3.6 million ton increase in export tons in the period to period comparison.Purchased coal costs increased approximately $31 million in the period to period comparison primarily due to differences in the quality of coal purchased, increases in the market price of coal purchased, and an increase in the volumes of coal purchased in the period to period comparison.Coal contract buyout costs increased $5 million as a result of a lower priced coal sales contract being bought out in order to sell the tons at a higher price in a future period.Closed and idle mine costs decreased approximately $115 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the year ended December 31, 2010. In the 2010 period, as a result of market conditions, permitting issues, new regulatory requirements and the resulting changes in mining plans, the reclamation liability associated with the Fola mining operations in West Virginia increased $82 million. Also in the 2010 period, closed and idle mine costs increased approximately $14 million as the result of the change in mine plan at Mine 84. As a result of the mine plan change, a portion of the previously developed area of the mine was abandoned. Closed and idle mine costs decreased $9 million as a result of the decision to permanently abandon Mine 84. Closed and idle mine costs for the 2010 period also included $6 million related to various asset abandonments that occurred, none of which were individually material. In addition, $9 million of reduced expenses were recognized in closed and idle mine costs for various changes in the operational status of other mines, between idled and operating, throughout both periods, none of which were individually material. Closed and idle mine costs increased $5 million in the 2011 period due to a charge for an additional liability due to Pennsylvania stream remediation.Litigation expense of $25 million was recognized in the year ended December 31, 2010 related to a legal settlement related to water discharge from our Buchanan Mine being stored in mine voids of adjacent properties which were leased by CONSOL Energy subsidiaries. Litigation expense was also recognized in the year ended December 31, 2010 related to a settlement that included the sale of Jones Fork which resulted in a loss of $10 million. Litigation expense related to various other potential legal settlements decreased $12 million in the period to period comparison. None of these items were individually material.Other costs related to the coal segment decreased $7 million due to various other transactions that occurred throughout both periods, none of which are individually material. 72TOTAL GAS SEGMENT ANALYSIS for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the year ended December 31, 2010:The gas segment contributed $130 million to earnings before income tax for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $180 million for the year ended December 31, 2010.

For the Years Ended December 31, 2011 2010 Variance PercentChangeProduced gas CBM sales volumes (in billion cubic feet)92.4 91.4 1.0 1.1 %Average CBM sales price per thousand cubic feet sold$5.05 $6.27 $(1.22) (19.5)%Average CBM lifting costs per thousand cubic feet sold$0.56 $0.54 $0.02 3.7 %Average CBM gathering costs per thousand cubic feet sold$1.06 $1.06 $ %Average CBM general & direct administrative costs per thousand cubic feet sold$0.66 $0.70 $(0.04) (5.7)%Average CBM depreciation, depletion and amortization costs per thousand cubic feet sold$1.10 $1.25 $(0.15) (12.0)% Total Average CBM costs per thousand cubic feet sold$3.38 $3.55 $(0.17) (4.8)% Average Margin for CBM$1.67 $2.72 $(1.05) (38.6)%CBM sales revenues were $466 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $573 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The $107 million decrease was primarily due to a 19.5% decrease in average sales price per thousand cubic feet sold, offset, in part, by a 1.1% increase in average volumes sold. The decrease in CBM average sales price is the result of various gas swap transactions that matured in each period and lower average market prices. The gas swap transactions qualify as financial cash flow hedges that exist parallel to the underlying physical transactions. These financial hedges represented approximately 61.8 billion cubic feet of our produced CBM gas sales volumes for the year ended December 31, 2011 at an average price of $5.36 per thousand cubic feet. For the year ended December 31, 2010, these financial hedges represented 50.5 billion cubic feet at an average price of $7.73 per thousand cubic feet. CBM sales volumes increased 1.0 billion cubic feet primarily due to additional wells coming on line from our on going drilling program. At December 31, 2011 and 2010 there were 4,262 and 4,020 CBM wells in production, respectively. Total costs for the CBM segment were $312 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $325 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. Lower costs in the period to period comparison are primarily related to lower unit costs. CBM lifting costs were $52 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $50 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. Lifting costs increased primarily due to increased road maintenance, additional tank repairs, and additional maintenance on older wells.CBM gathering costs were $98 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $97 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. CBM gathering unit costs remained consistent in the period to period comparison.General and direct administrative costs attributable to the total gas division were $112 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $93 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The $19 million increase was attributable to additional corporate service charges from CONSOL Energy and additional staffing. Corporate service charge allocations are primarily based on revenue and capital expenditure projections between coal and gas as a percent of total. The additional staffing is primarily due to the majority of the operational support staff being retained from the Dominion Acquisition which closed on April 30, 2010. General and direct administrative costs for the CBM segment were $61 million for year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $65 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. General and direct administrative costs attributable to the total gas segment are allocated to the individual gas segments based on a combination of production and employee counts. Lower general and direct administrative costs attributable to the CBM segment was attributable to the increase in other gas segment volumes.Depreciation, depletion and amortization attributable to the CBM segment was $101 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $113 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. There was approximately $72 million, or $0.78 per unit of production, of depreciation, depletion and amortization related to CBM gas and related well equipment that was reflected on a units of production method of depreciation in the year ended December 31, 2011. The production portion of depreciation, depletion and amortization was $87 million, or $0.98 per unit of production in the year ended December 31, 2010. The CBM unit of production rate decreased due to revised rates which are generally calculated using the net book 74value of assets divided by either proved or proved developed reserve additions. There was approximately $29 million, or $0.32 average per unit cost of depreciation, depletion and amortization relating to gathering and other equipment reflected on a straight line basis for the year ended December 31, 2011. The non production related depreciation, depletion and amortization was $26 million, or $0.27 per thousand cubic feet for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase was related to additional gathering assets placed in service after the 2010 period.SHALLOW OIL AND GAS SEGMENTThe shallow oil and gas segment had a loss before income tax of $23 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to a loss before income tax of $4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010.

The $39 million increase was primarily due to the 30.4% increase in volumes sold as well as the 2.1% increase in average sales price. Shallow Oil and Gas sales volumes increased 7.5 billion cubic feet in the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the 2010 period primarily due to the Dominion Acquisition, which closed on April 30, 2010. Approximately 95% of the acquired producing wells were Shallow Oil and Gas type wells. Average sales price increased primarily as the result of various gas swap transactions that matured in the year ended December 31 2011, offset, in part by lower average market prices. These gas swap transactions qualify as financial cash flow hedges that exist parallel to the underlying physical transactions. These financial hedges represented approximately 11.5 billion cubic feet of our produced Shallow Oil and Gas gas sales volumes for the year ended December 31, 2011 at an average price of $4.97 per thousand cubic feet. There were no Shallow Oil and Gas gas swap transactions that occurred in the year ended December 31, 2010. There were 8,041 and 8,016 shallow oil and gas wells in production at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.Shallow Oil and Gas lifting costs were $60 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $30 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. Lifting costs per unit increased $0.62 per thousand cubic feet sold primarily due to increased road maintenance, increased well site maintenance, increased salt water disposal and additional well services performed to maintain production levels.Shallow Oil and Gas gathering costs were $27 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $18 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. Average gathering costs increased $0.08 per unit primarily due to additional compressor maintenance.General and direct administrative costs for the Shallow Oil and Gas gas segment were $30 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $22 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. General and direct administrative costs attributable to the total gas segment are allocated to the individual gas segments based on a combination of production and employee counts. The total general and direct administrative costs increases which were discussed in the CBM segment and higher volumes of Shallow Oil and Gas gas sold contributed to the increase in the Shallow Oil and Gas gas segment. General and direct administrative costs were $0.94 per thousand cubic feet sold for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $0.88 per thousand cubic feet sold for the year ended December 31, 2010. Depreciation, depletion and amortization costs were $61 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $50 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. There was approximately $54 million, or $1.69 per unit of production, of depreciation, depletion and amortization related to Shallow Oil and Gas gas and related well equipment that was reflected on a units of production method of depreciation in the year ended December 31, 2011. There was approximately $45 million, or 75$1.84 per unit of production, of depreciation, depletion and amortization related to Shallow Oil and Gas gas and related well equipment that was reflected on a units of production method of depreciation for the year ended December 31, 2010. The rate was calculated by taking the net book value of the related assets divided by either proved or proved developed reserves, generally at the previous year end. There was approximately $7 million, or $0.23 per thousand cubic feet, of depreciation, depletion and amortization related to gathering and other equipment that was reflected on a straight line basis for the year ended December 31, 2011. There was $5 million, or $0.19 per thousand cubic feet, of depreciation, depletion and amortization related to gathering and other equipment reflected on a straight line basis for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase was related to additional infrastructure and equipment placed in service after the 2010 period.MARCELLUS GAS SEGMENTThe Marcellus segment contributed $36 million to the total Company earnings before income tax for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $6 million for the year ended December 31, 2010.

The $70 million increase was primarily due to a 158.7% increase in average volumes sold, offset, in part, by a 5.5% decrease in average sales price per thousand cubic feet sold. The increase in sales volumes is primarily due to additional wells coming on line from our on going drilling program, partially offset by 6.6 billion cubic feet related to the Noble joint venture and 1.0 billion cubic feet related to the Antero sale. The decrease in Marcellus average sales price was the result of the decline in general market prices. These decreases were offset, in part, by various gas swap transactions that matured in the year ended December 31, 2011. These gas swap transactions qualify as financial cash flow hedges that exist parallel to the underlying physical transactions. These hedges represented approximately 10.6 billion cubic feet of our produced Marcellus gas sales volumes for the year ended December 31, 2011 at an average price of $4.64 per thousand cubic feet. For the year ended December 31, 2010, these financial hedges represented 1.6 billion cubic feet at an average price of $5.05 per thousand cubic feet. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, there were 110 and 52 gross Marcellus Shale wells in production, respectively.Marcellus lifting costs were $16 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $5 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. Lifting costs per unit increased $0.10 per thousand cubic feet sold primarily due to increased expenses for well clean out and tubing replacement services performed to improve production.Marcellus gathering costs were $15 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $10 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. Average gathering costs decreased $0.45 per unit primarily due to the 16.5 billion cubic feet of additional volumes sold. General and direct administrative costs for the Marcellus gas segment were $17 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $8 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. General and direct administrative costs attributable to the total gas segment are allocated to the individual gas segments based on a combination of production and employee counts. The total general and direct administrative costs increases which were discussed in the CBM segment and higher volumes of Marcellus gas sold contributed to the increase in the Marcellus gas segment. General and direct administrative costs were $0.64 per thousand cubic feet sold for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $0.73 per thousand cubic feet sold for the year ended December 31, 2010. 76Depreciation, depletion and amortization costs were $35 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $20 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. There was approximately $27 million, or $1.04 per unit of production, of depreciation, depletion and amortization related to Marcellus gas and related well equipment that was reflected on a units of production method of depreciation in the year ended December 31, 2011. There was approximately $18 million, or $1.72 per unit of production, of depreciation, depletion and amortization related to Marcellus gas and related well equipment that was reflected on a units of production method of depreciation for the year ended December 31, 2010. The rate was calculated by taking the net book value of the related assets divided by either proved or proved developed reserves, generally at the previous year end. There was approximately $8 million, or $0.28 per thousand cubic feet, of depreciation, depletion and amortization related to gathering and other equipment that was reflected on a straight line basis for the year ended December 31, 2011. There was $2 million, or $0.18 per thousand cubic feet, of depreciation, depletion and amortization related to gathering and other equipment reflected on a straight line basis for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase was related to additional infrastructure and equipment placed in service after the 2010 period.OTHER GAS SEGMENTThe other gas segment includes activity not assigned to the CBM, conventional or Marcellus gas segments. This segment includes purchased gas activity, gas royalty interest activity, exploration and other costs, other corporate expenses, and miscellaneous operational activity not assigned to a specific gas segment.Other gas sales volumes are primarily related to production from the Chattanooga Shale in Tennessee. Revenue from this operation was approximately $12 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 and $8 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. Total costs related to these other sales were $19 million for the 2011 period and were $10 million for the 2010 period. The increase in costs in the period to period comparison were primarily attributable to increased general and direct administrative costs allocated to the other gas segment and increased depreciation, depletion and amortization. Higher general and direct administrative costs were attributable to the total gas increase as discussed in the CBM segment coupled with increased sales volumes. Higher depreciation, depletion and amortization was due to higher volumes produced and higher unit of production rates. A per unit analysis of the other operating costs in the Chattanooga shale is not meaningful due to the low volumes produced in the period to period analysis.Royalty interest gas sales represent the revenues related to the portion of production belonging to royalty interest owners sold by the CONSOL Energy gas division. Royalty interest gas sales revenue was $67 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $63 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The changes in market prices, contractual differences among leases, and the mix of average and index prices used in calculating royalties contributed to the period to period change.

The $54 million increase was primarily due to a gain on the Hess transaction of $53 million, a gain on the sale of the Antero overriding royalty interest of $41 million, $8 million of additional interest income related to the notes receivable related to the Noble joint venture transaction, $5 million due to various transactions that occurred throughout both periods, none of which were individually material and $4 million due to increased earnings from equity affiliates. These improvements were partially offset by a loss on the Noble transaction of $57 million. 77Royalty interest gas costs represent the costs related to the portion of production belonging to royalty interest owners sold by the CONSOL Energy gas segment. Royalty interest gas costs were $59 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $54 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The changes in market prices, contractual differences among leases, and the mix of average and index prices used in calculating royalties contributed to the period to period change.

Purchased gas volumes also reflect the impact of pipeline imbalances. The lower average cost per thousand cubic feet is due to overall price changes and contractual differences among customers in the period to period comparison. Purchased gas costs were $4 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $10 million for the year ended December 31, 2010.

The $7 million decrease in costs is primarily related to a favorable settlement involving defective pipe which reduced expense in the 2011 period and lower dry hole and lease surrender costs in the 2011 period. Costs included in the exploration and other cost line are detailed as follows: For the Years Ended December 31, 2011 2010 Variance PercentChangeDry hole and lease expiration costs$14 $21 $(7) (33.3)%Exploration4 4 %Total Exploration and Other Costs$18 $25 $(7) (28.0)%Other corporate expenses were $65 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $56 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The $9 million increase in the period to period comparison was made up of the following items: For the Years Ended December 31, 2011 2010 Variance PercentChangeUnutilized firm transportation$14 $3 $11 366.7 %Contract buyout3 3 100.0 %Bank fees7 4 3 75.0 %Stock based compensation18 16 2 12.5 %Short term incentive compensation25 24 1 4.2 %Variable interest earnings(4) 4 (8) (200.0)%Legal fees 3 (3) (100.0)%Other2 2 %Total Other Corporate Expenses$65 $56 $9 16.1 %Unutilized firm transportation represents pipeline transportation capacity that the gas segment has obtained to enable gas production to flow uninterrupted as the gas operations continue to increase sales volumes.Contract buyout represents the cancellation of a drilling arrangement with a third party well driller. Bank fees were higher in the period to period comparison due to amending and extending the revolving credit facility 78related to the gas segment. In April 2011, the facility was amended to allow $1 billion of borrowings and was extended to April 12, 2016. Stock based compensation was higher in the period to period comparison primarily due to the increased allocation from CONSOL Energy as a result of the Dominion Acquisition as well as an increase in total CONSOL Energy stock based compensation expense. Stock based compensation costs are allocated to the gas segment based on revenue and capital expenditure projections between coal and gas.The short term incentive compensation program is designed to increase compensation to eligible employees when CNX Gas reaches predetermined targets for safety, production and unit costs. Short term incentive compensation increased in the period to period comparison as the result of exceeding the targets in the 2011 period, increased number of employees, and an increased allocation of expense from CONSOL Energy as the result of exceeding corporate targets. Variable interest earnings are related to various adjustments a third party entity has reflected in its financial statements. CONSOL Energy holds no ownership interest and during the 2011 period de consolidated the impact of this third party due to the cancellation of the drilling arrangement. Based on analysis, during the time CONSOL Energy guaranteed the bank loans the entity held, it was determined that CONOL Energy was the primary beneficiary. Therefore, the entity was fully consolidated and the earnings impact was fully reversed in the non controlling interest line discussed below.Legal fees for the 2010 period were related to the special committee formed during the CNX Gas take in transaction and also represent legal fees related to the shareholder litigation related to this transaction.Other corporate related expense remained consistent in the period to period comparison.Interest expense related to the other gas segment was $10 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $7 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. Interest was incurred by the other gas segment on the CNX Gas revolving credit facility, a capital lease and debt held by a variable interest entity. The $3 million increase was primarily due to higher levels of borrowings on the revolving credit facility in the period to period comparison. Noncontrolling interest represents 100% of the earnings impact of a third party which has been determined to be a variable interest entity, in which CONSOL Energy held no ownership interest, but was the primary beneficiary. The CONSOL Energy gas division was determined to be the primary beneficiary due to guarantees of the third partys bank debt related to their purchase of drilling rigs. The third party entity provides drilling services primarily to the CONSOL Energy gas division. CONSOL Energy consolidates the entity and then reflects 100% of the impact as noncontrolling interest. The consolidation did not significantly impact any amounts reflected in the gas division income statement. The variance in the noncontrolling amounts reflects the third partys variance in earnings in the period to period comparison. In the year ended December 31, 2011, the drilling services contract was bought out. Subsequent to this transaction, the noncontrolling interest was de consolidated.79OTHER SEGMENT ANALYSIS for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the year ended December 31, 2010:The other segment includes activity from the sales of industrial supplies, the transportation operations and various other corporate activities that are not allocated to the coal or gas segment. The other segment had a loss before income tax of $275 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to a loss before income tax of $249 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The other segment also includes total company income tax expense of $155 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $109 million for the year ended December 31, 2010.

The increase was related to higher sales volumes.Total costs related to industrial supply sales were $235 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $197 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase of $38 million was primarily related to higher sales volumes and changes in last in, first out inventory valuations.Transportation operations:Total revenue from transportation operations was $120 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $114 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase of $6 million was primarily attributable to additional through put tons at the Baltimore terminal in the period to period comparison.Total costs related to the transportation operations were $89 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $81 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase of $8 million was related to the additional through put tons handled by the operations and additional repairs and maintenance costs to maintain the Baltimore terminal facilities.Miscellaneous other:Additional other income of $6 million was recognized for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $17 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The $11 million decrease was primarily due to $5 million related to the 2010 successful resolution of an outstanding tax issue with the Canadian Revenue Authority for the years 1997 through 2003 in which CONSOL Energy was entitled to interest on a tax refund, $2 million lower equity in earnings of affiliates in the current period compared to the prior year period and $4 million related to various transactions that have occurred throughout both periods, none of which were individually material.Other corporate costs in the other segment include interest expense, transaction and financing fees and various other miscellaneous corporate charges. Total other costs were $313 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $297 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. Other corporate costs increased due to the following items:80 For the Years Ended December 31, 2011 2010 VarianceInterest expense $239 $198 $41Loss on extinguishment of debt 16 16Evaluation fees for non core asset dispositions 6 2 4Bank fees 18 16 2Transaction and financing fees 15 61 (46)Other 19 20 (1) $313 $297 $16Interest expense increased $41 million primarily due to interest expense on the long term bonds that were issued in conjunction with the Dominion Acquisition in April 2010.On April 11, 2011, CONSOL Energy redeemed all of its outstanding $250 million, 7.875% senior secured notes due March 1, 2012 in accordance with the terms of the indenture governing these notes. The redemption price included principal of $250 million, a make whole premium of $16 million and accrued interest of $2 million for a total redemption cost of $268 million. The loss on extinguishment of debt was $16 million, which primarily represented the interest that would have been paid on these notes if held to maturity.Evaluation fees for non core asset dispositions increased $4 million in the period to period comparison due to various corporate initiatives that began in the 2010 period.Bank fees increased $2 million in the period to period comparison due to the refinancing and extension of the previous $1.0 billion credit facility to $1.5 billion on April 12, 2011.Transaction and financing fees of $15 million were incurred in the year ended December 31, 2011 related to the solicitation of consents of the long term bonds needed in order to clarify the indentures that relate to joint arrangements with respect to CONSOL Energys oil and gas properties. Transaction and financing fees of $61 million were incurred in the year ended December 31, 2010 primarily related to the Dominion Acquisition, as well as the equity and debt issuance that raised approximately $4.6 billion. Various other corporate expenses were $19 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $20 million in the year ended December 31, 2010. The decrease of $1 million was due to various transactions that occurred throughout both periods, none of which were individually material.Income Taxes:The effective income tax rate was 19.7% for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 23.4% for the year ended December 31, 2010. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2010 was primarily attributable to various discrete transactions that occurred in both periods. The discrete transactions included an Internal Revenue Service audit settlement for years 2006 and 2007 and the corresponding impacts to the previously accrued tax positions which resulted in higher percentage depletion deductions. Discrete transactions also included the reversal of a valuation allowance for certain state net operating loss carryforwards and future temporary deductions as well as the reversal of certain uncertain tax positions.

Net income attributable to CONSOL Energy shareholders was $540 million, or $2.95 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2009. See below for a detailed explanation by segment of the variance incurred in the period to period comparison. The total coal segment includes thermal coal, high volatile metallurgical coal, low volatile metallurgical coal and other coal. The total coal segment contributed $536 million of earnings before income tax for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $546 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The total coal segment sold 63.0 million tons of coal produced from CONSOL Energy mines, excluding our portion of tons sold from equity affiliates, in the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 57.4 million tons in the year ended December 31, 2009. The average sales price and total costs per ton for all active coal operations were as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 Variance PercentChangeAverage Sales Price per ton sold$61.33 $58.70 $2.63 4.5%Average Costs per ton sold46.78 44.66 2.12 4.7%Margin$14.55 $14.04 $0.51 3.6%The higher average sales price per ton sold reflects an additional 2.3 million tons of low volatile metallurgical coal and 2.4 million tons of high volatile metallurgical coal sold in 2010 compared to 2009. The low volatile metallurgical coal segment also had a higher average sales price in 2010 compared to 2009 reflecting the strengthening of the global steel market and steel related products. The high volatile metallurgical coal global market allowed approximately 2.4 million tons of coal to be sold as a metallurgical product at an average sales price of $72.89 per ton. This coal historically would have been sold on the thermal market where our average price for 2010 was $53.76 per ton. Average costs per ton of coal sold have increased in the period to period comparison due primarily to additional labor, higher supply and maintenance costs, and increased other costs which are directly related to the higher sales prices received for tons sold. Additional labor costs per ton are related to the net addition of approximately 330 employees. The additional labor was attributed to the Shoemaker Mine resuming production in 2010 after being idled throughout 2009 to complete the replacement of the track haulage system to a more efficient belt haulage system. Additional labor was also added in order to run our mines more safely, to prepare for the expected retirement of a significant portion of our work force over the next five years, and to keep the development of the longwall panels ahead of longwall advancement. Additional supply costs were attributable to compliance with new safety regulations such as fire retardant belts, additional equipment maintenance and various changes in roof control measures. Costs directly related to the price received for coal sales have also increased. These costs include royalty expenses and various production taxes. The total gas segment includes coalbed methane (CBM), conventional, Marcellus and other gas. The total gas segment contributed $180 million of earnings before income tax for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $263 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Total gas production was 127.9 billion cubic feet for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 94.4 billion cubic feet for the year ended December 31, 2009. The average sales price and total costs for all active gas operations were as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 Variance PercentChangeAverage Sales Price per thousand cubic feet sold$5.83 $6.68 $(0.85) (12.7)%Average Costs per thousand cubic feet sold3.90 3.44 0.46 13.4 %Margin$1.93 $3.24 $(1.31) (40.4)%Total gas segment outside sales revenues were $746 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $630 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase was primarily due to the 35.5% increase in volumes sold, offset, in part, by 82the 12.7% reduction in average price per thousand cubic feet sold. The decrease in average sales price is the result of various gas swap transactions that occurred throughout both periods. These gas swap transactions qualify as financial cash flow hedges that exist parallel to the underlying physical transactions. These financial hedges represented approximately 52.1 billion cubic feet of our produced gas sales volumes for the year ended December 31, 2010 at an average price of $7.66 per thousand cubic feet. These financial hedges represented approximately 51.6 billion cubic feet of our produced gas sales volumes for the year ended December 31, 2009 at an average price of $8.76 per thousand cubic feet. Average gas sales prices excluding the impact of hedging were up slightly in the period to period comparison. Total gas unit costs increased for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the year ended December 31, 2009 primarily due to the impact of the higher cost structure of the producing wells purchased in the Dominion Acquisition. These wells increased total operating costs by $0.78 per thousand cubic feet due to the higher maintenance costs, higher gathering and transportation costs and lower volumes produced compared to the legacy CONSOL Energy wells. Excluding the impact of these purchased wells, unit costs improved $0.32 per thousand cubic feet primarily due to the additional volumes produced. Volumes increased in the period to period comparison due to the on going drilling program and the additional volumes from the wells purchased in the Dominion Acquisition. The other segment includes industrial supplies activity, terminal and river service activity, income taxes and other business activities not assigned to the coal or gas segment. TOTAL COAL SEGMENT ANALYSIS for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the year ended December 31, 2009: The coal segment contributed $536 million of earnings before income tax in the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $546 million in the year ended December 31, 2009. Variances by the individual coal segments are discussed below.

The thermal coal revenue and cost components on a per unit basis are as follows: For the Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 Variance PercentChangeProduced Thermal Tons Sold (in millions)55.8 55.1 0.7 1.3 %Average Sales Price Per Thermal Ton Sold$53.76 $56.64 $(2.88) (5.1)%Average Operating Costs Per Thermal Ton Sold$34.64 $33.16 $1.48 4.5 %Average Provision Costs Per Thermal Ton Sold$3.55 $3.27 $0.28 8.6 %Average Selling, Administrative and Other Costs Per Thermal Ton Sold$2.55 $2.60 $(0.05) (1.9)%Average Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization Costs Per Thermal Ton Sold$4.90 $4.68 $0.22 4.7 % Total Average Costs Per Thermal Ton Sold$45.64 $43.71 $1.93 4.4 % Margin Per Thermal Ton Sold$8.12 $12.93 $(4.81) (37.2)%Thermal coal revenue was $3,001 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $3,122 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The $121 million decrease was attributable to an average sales price reduction of $2.88 per ton partially offset by a 0.7 million increase in tons sold. Thermal coal average sales price is lower in the 2010 period compared to the 2009 period as a result of higher average sales price mines, such as Bailey and Enlow Fork, selling coal in the high volatile metallurgical coal market instead of the thermal coal market. This impacted the thermal coal segment as a result of leaving more tons sold from lower sales price mines. This has negatively impacted the average sales price on the thermal coal segment, although total company revenue has improved. Produced thermal inventory was 1.9 million tons at December 31, 2010 compared to 2.9 million tons at December 31, 2009. Thermal sales tons were higher in the period to period comparison primarily due to the Shoemaker Mine restarting production in early 2010 after being idled throughout 2009 to complete the replacement of the track haulage system. Thermal sales tons were also higher as the result of the Blacksville #2 Mine being idled for several months in 2009 in order to manage inventory levels in response to the economic crisis experienced. Blacksville #2 Mine has operated throughout 2010. These increases were offset, in part, due to selling 2.4 million tons on the high volatile metallurgical coal market at approximately $19.13 per ton higher average sales price. Other income attributable to the thermal coal segment represents earnings from our equity affiliate that operates a thermal coal mine. The equity in earnings of affiliates is insignificant to the total segment activity. Operating costs are made up of labor, supplies, maintenance, subsidence, taxes other than income, royalties and preparation plant charges related to the extraction and sale of coal. These costs are reviewed regularly by management and are considered to be the direct responsibility of mine management. Operating costs related to the thermal coal segment were $1,934 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $1,828 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Higher operating costs in the period to period comparison are due to the $1.48 per ton increase in average unit costs of tons sold and 0.7 million of additional tons sold. Higher average operating costs per unit for thermal coal tons sold are primarily related to the following items: Thermal coal unit costs were higher in 2010 as a result of lower cost mines, such as Bailey and Enlow Fork, selling coal in the high volatile metallurgical coal market. This impacted the thermal coal segment due to increased tons sold from higher cost mines. Labor costs increased due to the effects of wage increases at the union mines from the current labor contracts. The contracts call for specified hourly wage increases in each year of the contract. Labor costs also increased due to the effects of wage increases at the non represented mines. Average employee counts also increased approximately 5% at our active mining operations. The additional employees were primarily due to the Shoemaker Mine resuming production in 2010 after being idled during 2009 to complete the replacement of the track haulage system to a more efficient belt haulage system. Additional employees were also added in order to run our mines more safely, to prepare for the expected retirement of a significant portion of our work force over the next five years, and to keep the development of the longwall panels ahead of longwall advancement. Health and retirement costs related to the active hourly work force increased due to higher contributions to the multiemployer 1974 pension trust that are required under the National Bituminous Coal Wage Agreement. The contribution rate increased from $4.25 per hour worked by members of the United Mine Workers Union of America 84(UMWA) in the year ended December 31, 2009 to $5.00 per hour worked in the year ended December 31, 2010. Contributions to the multiemployer plan are expensed as incurred. Health and Retirement costs have also increased in the period to period comparison due to higher medical costs for the active hourly work force. Power costs increased due to higher rates charged by utility companies and increased usage in the period to period comparison. Operating costs also increased as a result of the 1.0 million ton decrease in inventory levels. The increases in average unit costs of thermal coal sold were offset, in part, by the following: Reduced contract mining fees due to fewer contractors being retained to mine our reserves in the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the 2009 period. Average operating costs per thermal ton sold decreased due to higher tons sold. Fixed costs are allocated over higher tons resulting in decreased unit costs. Total CONSOL Energy expenses related to our actuarial liabilities were $287 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $243 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase of $44 million was due primarily to changes in the discount rates used at the measurement date, which is December 31, and changes in assumptions which affect the amount of actuarial gains and losses amortized into earnings. See Note 15 Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits Plans and Note 16 Coal Workers Pneumoconiosis (CWP) and Workers Compensation in the Notes to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10 K for additional detail regarding total company expense. Total provisions are made up of the expenses related to the Companys long term liabilities, such as other post employment benefits (OPEB), the salary retirement plan, workers compensation, long term disability and accretion expense on mine closing and related liabilities. With the exception of accretion expense on mine closing and related liabilities, these expenses are actuarially calculated for the company as a whole. The expenses are then allocated to operational units based on active employee counts or active salary dollars. Accretion is calculated on a mine by mine basis. Provisions attributable to the thermal coal segment were $198 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $180 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Provision costs per thermal coal ton sold increased $0.28 per ton in the period to period comparison due primarily to higher actuarial expenses, such as OPEB, as discussed above. The overall increase in company costs has increased the total dollars allocated to the thermal coal segment. This increase was offset, in part, by additional tons sold by the thermal coal segment. Total Company Selling, General and Administrative Expenses were made up of the following items: For the Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 Variance PercentChangeEmployee wages and related expenses$72 $63 $9 14.3%Commissions12 7 5 71.4%Miscellaneous66 61 5 8.2%Total Company Selling, General and Administrative Expenses$150 $131 $19 14.5%Employee wages and related expenses have increased due to additional employees in the selling, general and administrative area primarily related to support staff retained in the Dominion Acquisition which occurred on April 30, 2010 and additional hiring to support operations. Increased employee wages and related expenses are also related to additional actuarial expenses discussed above. Commission expenses increased $5 million due to additional tons for which a third party was owed a commission compared to the prior year period. Miscellaneous expenses have increased approximately $5 million. The increase was related to an additional $2 million for advertising and promotion fees, an additional $2 million for demurrage charges and an additional $1 million for various other items, none of which were individually material. Total administrative and other costs related to the thermal coal segment were $142 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 and $144 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Selling, general and administrative costs, excluding selling expense, are allocated to all segments based on a combination of estimated time worked by various support groups and operating costs incurred by the individual segments. Commission expense, which is a component of selling, is charged directly to the mine incurring 85the cost. Direct administrative costs are associated directly with the coal division of the business and are allocated to various mines based on a combination of estimated time worked and production. Although the total company selling, general and administrative costs have increased, as discussed above, the amount allocated to the thermal coal segment has decreased approximately $2 million. The decrease in the amount allocated to the thermal coal segment is primarily related to the high volatile metallurgical coal segment. In 2009, these tons and the associated allocation were all included in the thermal coal segment. Depreciation, depletion and amortization costs for the thermal coal segment were $274 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 and $258 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase of $16 million, or $0.22 per ton, was due to additional equipment and infrastructure placed into service after 2009, offset, in part, by additional volumes sold. HIGH VOL METALLURGICAL COAL SEGMENT: The high volatile metallurgical coal segment contributed $87 million to total company earnings before income tax for the year ended December 31, 2010. There was no activity in this segment in the prior year. This is a new market that was developed in 2010 and is primarily related to selling our Pittsburgh #8 coal into overseas metallurgical coal markets. This coal had historically supplied the domestic thermal coal market. The high volatile metallurgical coal revenue and cost components on a per unit basis are as follows: For the Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 Variance PercentChangeProduced High Vol Met Tons Sold (in millions)2.4 2.4 100.0%Average Sales Price Per High Vol Met Ton Sold$72.89 $ $72.89 100.0%Average Operating Costs Per High Vol Met Ton Sold$29.16 $ $29.16 100.0%Average Provision Costs Per High Vol Met Ton Sold$3.08 $ $3.08 100.0%Average Selling, Administrative and Other Costs Per High Vol Met Ton Sold$2.26 $ $2.26 100.0%Average Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization Costs Per High Vol Met Ton Sold$4.61 $ $4.61 100.0% Total Average Costs Per High Vol Met Ton Sold$39.11 $ $39.11 100.0% Margin Per High Vol Met Ton Sold$33.78 $ $33.78 100.0%The high volatile metallurgical coal segment revenue was $172 million, or an average sales price per ton of $72.89, for the year ended December 31, 2010. Strength in the metallurgical coal market allowed for the export of Northern Appalachian coal, historically sold domestically on the thermal coal market, to crossover to the metallurgical coal markets in Brazil and Asia. Total costs per ton sold of this coal were $39.11 generating a margin of $33.78 per ton sold. This margin exceeds the $8.12 per ton average margin received on thermal coal sold in 2010 which is where this coal would have been historically sold. Other income attributable to the high volatile metallurgical coal segment represents earnings from our equity affiliates that operate mines that sell coal on the high volatile metallurgical coal market. The equity in earnings of affiliates is insignificant to the total segment activity. 86LOW VOL METALLURGICAL COAL SEGMENT: The low volatile metallurgical coal segment contributed $382 million to total company earnings before income tax for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $94 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase was due primarily to the Buchanan Mine being idled for approximately five months of 2009. The mine was idled in 2009 in response to the economic crisis which significantly lowered the demand for low volatile metallurgical coal, primarily due to the decrease in steel demand. The Buchanan Mine has operated throughout all of 2010. The low volatile metallurgical coal revenue and cost components on a per unit basis are as follows: For the Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 Variance PercentChangeProduced Low Vol Met Tons Sold (in millions)4.6 2.3 2.3 100.0 %Average Sales Price Per Low Vol Met Ton Sold$146.32 $107.72 $38.60 35.8 %Average Operating Costs Per Low Vol Met Ton Sold$49.82 $50.33 $(0.51) (1.0%)Average Provision Costs Per Low Vol Met Ton Sold$5.90 $6.76 $(0.86) (12.7)%Average Selling, Administrative and Other Costs Per Low Vol Met Ton Sold$3.95 $4.57 $(0.62) (13.6)%Average Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization Costs Per Low Vol Met Ton Sold$4.57 $5.46 $(0.89) (16.3)% Total Average Costs Per Low Vol Met Ton Sold$64.24 $67.12 $(2.88) (4.3)% Margin Per Low Vol Met Ton Sold$82.08 $40.60 $41.48 102.2 %Average sales price for low volatile metallurgical coal has increased $38.60 per ton, from the prior year, to $146.32 for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase of 35.8% was mainly due to the strengthening of the global market for steel and steel related products when compared to 2009. Total costs per ton sold of low volatile metallurgical coal were $64.24 per ton for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $67.12 per ton for the year ended December 31, 2009. The $2.88 per ton improvement was related to operating the Buchanan Mine for all of 2010 versus seven months of 2009. The additional tonnage sold in 2010 has reduced the average per unit costs. OTHER COAL SEGMENT: The Other Coal segment had a loss before income tax of $394 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to a loss before income tax of $267 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The Other Coal segment includes purchased coal activities, idled mine activities as well as various other activities assigned to the coal segment but not allocated to each individual mine. Other Coal segment produced coal sales revenue was $12 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. This revenue includes the sale of incidental tonnage recovered during the reclamation process at idled facilities. The primary focus of activity at these locations is reclaiming disturbed land in accordance with permit requirements after final mining has occurred. The tons sold from these activities are incidental to total company production and sales. Purchased coal sales were $34 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $39 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Purchased coal sales consist of revenues from processing third party coal in our preparation plants for blending purposes to meet customer coal specifications, coal purchased from third parties and sold directly to our customers and revenues from processing third party coal in our preparation plants for a fee. Freight revenue is the amount billed to customers for transportation costs incurred. This revenue is based on weight of coal shipped, negotiated freight rates and method of transportation (i.e. rail, barge, truck, etc.) used by the customers to which CONSOL Energy contractually provides transportation services. Freight revenue is offset in freight expense. Freight revenue was $126 million in the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $149 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The decrease of $23 million was primarily due to lower tons being shipped on CONSOL Energy freight contracts in the period to period comparison. 87Miscellaneous other income was $48 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $70 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The $22 million decrease was due to the following items: In the year ended December 31, 2009, $12 million of income was recognized related to contracts with certain customers that were unable to take delivery of previously contracted coal tonnage. These customers agreed to buy out their contracts in order to be released from the requirements of taking delivery of previously committed tons. No such transactions were entered into in the year ended December 31, 2010. Gain on sales of assets attributable to the Other Coal segment were $9 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $16 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The change was related to various transactions that occurred throughout both periods, none of which were individually material. Coal royalty income from third parties was $15 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $17 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The decrease was related to lower tons mined by third parties from our coal reserves in the period to period comparison. In the year ended December 31, 2009, mark to market adjustments for free standing coal sales options resulted in approximately a $2 million reversal of previously recognized unrealized losses. The reversal of the losses was primarily due to the decrease in market price of coal in 2009 compared to 2008. No such transactions existed in the year ended December 31, 2010. Other income increased $1 million due to various transactions that occurred throughout both periods, none of which were individually material. Other coal segment total costs were $614 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $525 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase of $89 million was due to the following items: Closed and idle mine costs were $215 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $138 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase of $77 million in closed and idle mine costs was primarily related to additional reclamation liabilities recognized at the Fola mining operation in West Virginia. As a result of market conditions, permitting issues, new regulatory requirements and resulting changes in mine plans, the reclamation liability associated with the Fola operation increased approximately $81 million. Additional closed and idle mine costs in 2010 were also related to a $14 million charge as a result of a change in the mine plan at Mine 84. As a result of the mine plan change, a portion of the previously developed area of the mine has been abandoned. These increases were offset, in part, by approximately $18 million for changes in the operational status of various other mines, between idled and operating, throughout both periods which resulted in lower idled mine costs in 2010. Shoemaker Mine was idled throughout 2009 while the track haulage system was converted to a belt haulage system. This mine was in production throughout 2010. Litigation expense of $25 million was recognized for the year ended December 31, 2010 related to a settlement that was reached in June 2010. The litigation was related to water discharge from our Buchanan Mine being stored in mine voids of adjacent properties which were leased by CONSOL Energy subsidiaries. Cost of goods sold and other charges have increased approximately $13 million related to excess purchase price over appraised values for various land purchases that have been made throughout the year. Accounting guidance requires assets purchased to be recognized at the appraised value; synergies and related specific value to CONSOL Energy cannot be reflected as an asset. Various land deals in strategic areas for items such as refuse ponds, overland belts and various other key projects often require premiums over fair value, thus resulting in additional expense to CONSOL Energy at the time of the transaction. Litigation settlement expense of $11 million was recognized for the year ended December 31, 2010 related to the sale of the Jones Fork Mining Complex. Cost of goods sold and other charges have increased approximately $8 million due to various asset abandonments throughout the period, none of which were individually material. These abandonments primarily related to engineering work, permitting work and mapping work for miscellaneous projects that are no longer being pursued by the Company. Purchased coal consists of costs from processing purchased coal in our preparation plants for blending purposes to meet customer coal specifications, coal purchased and sold directly to the customer and costs for processing third party coal in our preparation plants. These costs were $40 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $46 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The decrease of $6 million was primarily due to reduced purchased coal volumes in the period to period comparison. Litigation expense of $17 million was recognized for the year ended December 31, 2009 related to amounts accrued for the settlement of the Levisa Action and the Pobst/Combs Action. This litigation related to depositing water in mine voids which a subsidiary of CONSOL Energy leased. 88Freight expense is based on weight of coal shipped, negotiated freight rates and method of transportation (i.e. rail, barge, truck, etc.) used by the customers to which CONSOL Energy contractually provides transportation services. Freight expense is offset in freight revenue. Freight expense was $126 million in the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $149 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The decrease of $23 million was primarily due to fewer tons shipped on CONSOL Energy freight contracts in the period to period comparison. Other costs have increased $1 million primarily due to various contingent liabilities related to potential legal settlements as well as various other transactions that have occurred throughout both periods, none of which are individually material. TOTAL GAS SEGMENT ANALYSIS for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the year ended December 31, 2009: The gas segment contributed $180 million to earnings before income tax for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $263 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Variances by the individual gas segments are discussed below.

The CBM segment revenue and cost components on a per unit basis were as follows: For the Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 Variance PercentChangeProduced gas CBM sales volumes (in billion cubic feet)91.4 86.9 4.5 5.2 %Average CBM sales price per thousand cubic feet sold$6.27 $6.87 $(0.60) (8.7)%Average CBM lifting costs per thousand cubic feet sold$0.54 $0.57 $(0.03) (5.3)%Average CBM gathering costs per thousand cubic feet sold$1.06 $1.01 $0.05 5.0 %Average CBM general & direct administrative costs per thousand cubic feet sold$0.70 $0.71 $(0.01) (1.4)%Average CBM depreciation, depletion and amortization costs per thousand cubic feet sold$1.25 $1.08 $0.17 15.7 % Total Average CBM costs per thousand cubic feet sold$3.55 $3.37 $0.18 5.3 % Average Margin for CBM$2.72 $3.50 $(0.78) (22.3)%CBM sales revenues were $573 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $597 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The decrease was primarily due to the 8.7% reduction in average price per thousand cubic feet sold, offset, in part, by the 5.2% increase in volumes sold. The decrease in CBM average sales price was the result of various gas swap transactions at a lower average price as compared to the prior year. These gas swap transactions qualify as financial cash flow hedges that exist parallel to the underlying physical transactions. These financial hedges represented approximately 50.5 billion cubic feet of our produced CBM gas sales volumes for the year ended December 31, 2010 at an average price of $7.73 per thousand cubic feet. These financial hedges represented approximately 51.6 billion cubic feet of our produced CBM gas sales volumes for the year ended December 31, 2009 at an average price of $8.76 per thousand cubic feet. Average gas sales prices excluding the impact of hedging were $4.47 per thousand cubic feet in 2010 compared to $4.13 per thousand cubic feet in 2009. CBM sales volumes increased 4.5 billion cubic feet primarily due to additional wells coming online from our on going drilling program. We had 3,945 net CBM Wells at December 31, 2010 compared to 3,688 net CBM wells at December 31, 2009. Also, 2009 CBM volumes were lower by approximately 1.2 billion cubic feet of deferrals related to the idling of the Buchanan Mine for approximately five months during 2009. Total costs for the CBM gas segment were $325 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $293 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The $32 million increase in total costs in the period to period comparison reflects the 5.0% increase in average unit costs and the 5.2% increase in sales volumes. CBM lifting costs were $50 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $49 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Average CBM lifting costs per unit were $0.54 per thousand cubic feet for 2010 compared to $0.57 per thousand cubic feet for 2009. The improvement in average CBM lifting costs per unit was due to lower salt water disposal costs attributable to recycling the water produced from our wells to be used in hydraulic fracturing of new wells. Previously, fees were incurred to dispose of the salt water produced from our wells. Unit costs were also improved due to higher volumes of CBM gas sold in the period to period comparison resulting in fixed costs being spread over additional volumes, lowering the average per unit costs. These improvements were offset, in part, by higher severance taxes. Higher severance taxes were the result of average market price increases, excluding the impact of our hedging program. Severance taxes were also higher as a result of the Buchanan County, Virginia severance tax settlement which changed the deductions allowed in the calculation of severance tax due when the price of gas falls between certain ranges. CBM Gathering costs were $97 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $88 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Average CBM gathering cost were $1.06 per thousand cubic feet sold for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $1.01 per thousand cubic feet sold for the year ended December 31, 2009. Higher average unit costs were related to higher power costs attributable to utility rate increases in the period to period comparison as well as increased usage. Higher average unit costs were also attributable to additional in transit costs related to additional capacity of firm transportation being purchased after 2009 to assure delivery of additional volumes being produced. These cost increases were offset, in part, by the 5.2% increase in volumes sold. 90General and direct administrative costs attributable to the Total Gas segment have increased $26 million to $93 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $67 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase was attributable to additional staffing and additional corporate service charges from CONSOL Energy. With the Dominion Acquisition, which closed on April 30, 2010, the majority of the operational support personnel were retained. Total Company general administrative costs have also increased, as explained previously, which resulted in additional charges being allocated to all segments. General and direct administrative costs attributable to the CBM gas segment were $65 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $62 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. General and direct administrative expenses attributable to the Total Gas segment are allocated to each individual gas segment based on a combination of production and employee counts. Although Total Gas general and direct administrative costs have increased $26 million, as discussed above, the percentage allocated to the CBM segment is lower, on a unit basis, as the result of CBM production volumes to total gas volumes produced being lower primarily due to the Dominion Acquisition, which closed on April 30, 2010. Depreciation, depletion and amortization attributable to the CBM segment was $113 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $94 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. There was approximately $87 million, or $0.98 per unit of production, of depreciation, depletion and amortization related to CBM gas and related well equipment that was reflected on a units of production method of depreciation in the year ended December 31, 2010. The unit of production portion of depreciation, depletion and amortization was $71 million, or $0.82 per unit of production in the year ended December 31, 2009. The CBM unit of production rate used to calculate depreciation in the current year is generally calculated using the net book value of assets divided by either proved or proved developed reserves at the previous year end. The in field drilling program and certain assets acquired in the Dominion Acquisition caused the rate to increase. There was approximately $26 million, or $0.27 per thousand cubic feet of depreciation, depletion and amortization related to gathering and other equipment that is reflected on a straight line basis for the year ended December 31, 2010. The straight line component was $23 million, or $0.26 per thousand cubic feet for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase was related to additional gathering assets placed in service after 2009, offset, in part, by the increase in volumes in the period to period comparison. SHALLOW OIL AND GAS SEGMENT: The shallow oil and gas segment had a loss before income tax of $4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to a loss before income tax of $2 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The shallow oil and gas segment revenue and cost components on a per unit basis are as follows: For the Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 Variance PercentChangeProduced gas Shallow Oil and Gas sales volumes (in billion cubic feet)24.7 1.7 23.0 1,352.9 %Average Shallow Oil and Gas sales price per thousand cubic feet sold$4.73 $4.33 $0.40 9.2 %Average Shallow Oil and Gas lifting costs per thousand cubic feet sold$1.24 $2.76 $(1.52) (55.1)%Average Shallow Oil and Gas gathering costs per thousand cubic feet sold$0.75 $0.59 $0.16 27.1 %Average Shallow Oil and Gas general & direct administrative costs per thousand cubic feet sold$0.88 $0.46 $0.42 91.3 %Average Shallow Oil and Gas depreciation, depletion and amortization costs per thousand cubic feet sold$2.03 $2.30 $(0.27) (11.7)% Total Average Shallow Oil and Gas costs per thousand cubic feet sold$4.90 $6.11 $(1.21) (19.8)% Average Margin for Shallow Oil and Gas$(0.17) $(1.78) $1.61 (90.4)%Shallow Oil and Gas segment sales revenues were $116 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Shallow Oil and Gas sales volumes increased 23.0 billion cubic feet for the year ended December 31, 2010 primarily due to the Dominion Acquisition, which closed on April 30, 2010. Approximately 95% of the acquired producing wells were shallow oil and gas type wells. There were 8,016 net Shallow Oil and Gas wells at December 2010 compared to 195 net Shallow Oil and Gas wells at December 31, 2009. No Shallow Oil and Gas gas volumes were hedged in 2010 or 2009. Total costs for the Shallow Oil and Gas segment were $120 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $10 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase of $110 million is attributable to additional volumes sold in the period to period comparison, offset, in part, by lower average unit costs sold. Shallow Oil and Gas average unit costs have decreased due to the significant increase in volumes related to production from wells acquired in the Dominion Acquisition, which closed on 91April 30, 2010. A detailed analysis of cost categories is not meaningful due to the significant change in this segment related to the Dominion Acquisition and will therefore not be presented. General and direct administrative costs attributable to the Total Gas segment are allocated to each individual gas segment based on a combination of production and employee counts. Shallow Oil and Gas volumes are higher as a percent of total gas produced volumes in the period to period comparison and therefore, additional general and direct administrative costs have been allocated to the Shallow Oil and Gas gas segment in 2010. MARCELLUS SEGMENT: The Marcellus segment contributed $6 million to the total company earnings before income tax for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $4 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The Marcellus segment revenue and cost components on a per unit basis are as follows: For the Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 Variance PercentChangeProduced gas Marcellus sales volumes (in billion cubic feet)10.4 5.0 5.4 108.0 %Average Marcellus sales price per thousand cubic feet sold$4.69 $4.24 $0.45 10.6 %Average Marcellus lifting costs per thousand cubic feet sold$0.50 $0.12 $0.38 316.7 %Average Marcellus gathering costs per thousand cubic feet sold$0.99 $1.12 $(0.13) (11.6)%Average Marcellus general & direct administrative costs per thousand cubic feet sold$0.73 $0.74 $(0.01) (1.4)%Average Marcellus depreciation, depletion and amortization costs per thousand cubic feet sold$1.90 $1.47 $0.43 29.3 % Total Average Marcellus costs per thousand cubic feet sold$4.12 $3.45 $0.67 19.4 % Average Margin for Marcellus$0.57 $0.79 $(0.22) (27.8)%The increase in Marcellus average sales price was the result of an improvement in general market prices and various gas swap transactions that occurred in the year ended December 31, 2010. These gas swap transactions qualify as financial cash flow hedges that exist parallel to the underlying physical transactions. These financial hedges represented approximately 1.6 billion cubic feet of our produced Marcellus gas sales volumes for the year ended December 31, 2010 at an average price of $5.05 per thousand cubic feet. There were no gas swap transactions for the Marcellus segment that occurred for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase in sales volumes was primarily due to additional wells coming on line from our on going drilling program. At December 31, 2010 there were 52 Marcellus Shale wells in production including 17 wells acquired in the Dominion Acquisition, which closed on April 30, 2010. At December 31, 2009 there were 22 Marcellus Shale wells in production. Total costs for the Marcellus segment were $43 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $17 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase was primarily due to the additional sales volumes and higher average unit costs. Marcellus lifting costs were $5 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $1 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Average Marcellus lifting costs were $0.50 per thousand cubic feet in 2010 compared to $0.12 per thousand cubic feet in 2009. The increase in average lifting costs per unit sold was due to increased road repairs and other maintenance expense primarily related to the additional number of wells drilled in the current period. Salt water disposal fees were also higher in the period to period comparison due to the higher volume of water produced from additional wells. These increases in costs were offset, in part, by the additional volume of Marcellus gas sold in the period to period comparison. Marcellus gathering costs were $10 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $5 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Average gathering cost per unit sold was $0.99 per thousand cubic feet for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $1.12 per thousand cubic feet for the year ended December 31, 2009. Lower average gathering cost per unit was primarily attributable to the 108.0% increase in volumes sold. This improvement was offset, in part, by higher power and security costs. Higher power costs were related to higher rates being charged by utility companies in the period to period comparison. Higher security costs were related to additional security needs at various Marcellus gathering stations. General and direct administrative costs attributable to the Marcellus gas segment were $8 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $4 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Average general and direct administrative costs on a per unit sold basis were $0.73 per thousand cubic feet for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $0.74 per thousand cubic feet for the year ended December 31, 2009. General and direct administrative costs attributable to the Total Gas segment are allocated to each individual gas segment based on a combination of production and employee counts. The total general and direct administrative cost increases, as discussed previously, were offset, in part, by higher volumes of gas produced from 92Marcellus wells. Depreciation, depletion and amortization attributable to the Marcellus segment was $20 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $7 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. There was approximately $18 million, or $1.72 per unit of production, of depreciation, depletion and amortization related to Marcellus gas and related well equipment that was reflected on a units of production method of depreciation in the year ended December 31, 2010. The unit of production portion of depreciation, depletion and amortization was $6 million, or $1.27 per unit of production in the year ended December 31, 2009. The Marcellus unit of production rate used to calculate depreciation in the current year is generally calculated using the net book value of assets divided by either proved or proved developed reserves at the previous year end. The investment in drilling activities increased in higher proportion than the related gas reserves in the current period, which resulted in a higher per unit rate. There was approximately $2 million, or $0.18 per thousand cubic feet of depreciation, depletion and amortization related to gathering and other equipment that is reflected on a straight line basis for the year ended December 31, 2010. The straight line component was $1 million, or $0.20 per thousand cubic feet for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase was related to additional gathering assets placed in service after 2009, offset, in part, by the increase in volumes in the period to period comparison. OTHER GAS SEGMENT: The Other gas segment includes activity not assigned to CBM, Conventional or Marcellus gas segments. This segment includes purchased gas activity, gas royalty interest activity, exploration and other costs, other corporate expenses, and miscellaneous operational activity not assigned to a specific gas segment. The other gas segment had a loss before income tax of $70 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to a loss before income tax of $43 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Other gas sales volumes are primarily related to production from the Chattanooga Shale in Tennessee. Revenue from this operation was approximately $8 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $4 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. There was 1.4 billion cubic feet sold from this area for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 0.8 billion cubic feet for the year ended December 31, 2009. Total costs related to these other sales were $10 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $5 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase in costs in the period to period comparison was primarily due to higher depreciation, depletion and amortization attributable to the additional 0.6 billion cubic feet of gas produced and higher unit of production rates. The higher units of production rates were related to a higher proportion of capital assets placed in service versus the proportion of proved developed reserve additions. A per unit analysis of the other operating costs in Chattanooga is not meaningful due to the low volumes produced in the period to period analysis. Royalty interest gas sales represent the revenues related to the portion of production belonging to royalty interest owners sold by the CONSOL Energy gas segment. The changes in market prices, contractual differences among leases, and the mix of average and index prices used in calculating royalties contributed to the period to period change. Royalty interest gas sales revenues were $63 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $41 million for the year ended December 31, 2009.

Royalty interest gas costs represent the costs related to the portion of production belonging to royalty interest owners sold by the CONSOL Energy gas segment. The changes in market prices, contractual differences among leases, and the mix of average 93and index prices used in calculating royalties contributed to the period to period change. Royalty interest gas sales costs were $54 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $32 million for the year ended December 31, 2009.

Purchased gas volumes also reflect the impact of pipeline imbalances. The higher average cost per thousand cubic feet is due to overall price changes, contractual differences among customers and the pipeline imbalance. Purchased gas costs were $10 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $6 million for the year ended December 31, 2009.

Exploration costs increased $1 million in the period to period comparison due to various transactions that occurred throughout both periods, none of which were individually material. Other corporate expenses were $56 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $33 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The $23 million increase was due to the following items: For the Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 Variance PercentChangeShort term incentive compensation$24 $16 $8 50.0 %Stock based compensation16 11 5 45.5 %Variable interest earnings4 4 100.0 %Bank fees4 4 100.0 %Financing and acquisition fees3 3 100.0 %Contract settlement 3 (3) (100.0)%Other5 3 2 66.7 %Total Other Corporate Expenses$56 $33 $23 69.7 %The short term incentive compensation program is designed to increase compensation to eligible employees when the gas segment reaches predetermined targets for safety, production and unit cost goals. Short term incentive compensation expense is higher in 2010 due to a 13% increase in employee counts, as well as an increase in the short term incentive compensation allocation to the gas segment. Additional employees in the total company general and administrative area were primarily related to support staff retained in the Dominion Acquisition,which closed on April 30, 2010 and additional hiring to support operations. 94Stock based compensation is higher in the period to period comparison primarily due to the conversion of the CNX Gas performance share units to CONSOL Energy restricted stock units in the year ended December 31, 2009. The conversion resulted in a reduction of approximately $4 million of expense in 2009. Additional expense was also related to stock based compensation allocated from CONSOL Energy to the gas segment in 2010. These increases were offset, in part, by the non vested CNX Gas stock options being terminated in relation to the CNX Gas take in transaction. The expense previously recognized for these options was reversed on the gas segment. All stock based compensation is now allocated from CONSOL Energy. Variable interest earnings are related to various adjustments a third party entity has reflected in its financial statements. CONSOL Energy holds no ownership interest, but guarantees bank loans the entity holds related to its purchases of drilling rigs. CONSOL Energy is also the main customer of the third party, and based on analysis is the primary beneficiary. Therefore, the entity is fully consolidated and then the impact is fully reversed in the noncontrolling interest line discussed below. Banks fees are higher in the period to period comparison due to amending and extending the revolving credit facility related to the gas segment. Financing and acquisition fees are related to legal expenses for the special committee, formed during the CNX Gas take in transaction, and are primarily related to the shareholder litigation. The year ended December 31, 2009 includes $3 million of expense related to a contract buyout with a driller in order to mitigate idle rig charges in certain areas where drilling was not expected to increase in the near term. Other corporate expense increased $2 million in the year to year comparison primarily due to unused firm transportation charges not being allocated to the operating gas segments and various other transactions that occurred throughout both periods, none of which were individually material. Interest expense was $7 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Interest is incurred by the gas segment on the gas segment revolving credit facility, a capital lease and debt held by a variable interest entity. No significant changes in these components occurred in the period to period comparison. Noncontrolling interest represents 100% of the earnings impact of a third party which has been determined to be a variable interest entity, in which the CONSOL Energy gas segment holds no ownership interest, but is the primary beneficiary. The CONSOL Energy gas segment has been determined to be the primary beneficiary due to guarantees of the third partys bank debt related to their purchase of drilling rigs. The third party entity provides drilling services primarily to the CONSOL Energy gas segment. CONSOL Energy consolidates the entity and then reflects 100% of the impact as noncontrolling interest. The consolidation does not significantly impact any amounts reflected in the gas segment income statement. The variance in the noncontrolling interest amounts reflects the third partys variance in earnings in the period to period comparison. 95OTHER SEGMENT ANALYSIS for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the year ended December 31, 2009: The other segment includes activity from sales of industrial supplies, transportation operations and various other corporate activities that are not allocated to the coal or gas segment. The other segment had a loss before income tax of $249 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to a loss of $22 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The other segment also includes total company income tax expense of $109 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 and $221 million for the year ended December 31, 2009.

Total costs related to industrial supply sales were $197 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $190 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The $7 million increase in expense is primarily due to changes in last in first out valuations. Transportation operations: Total revenue from transportation operations was $114 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $84 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The $30 million increase was primarily attributable to additional through put tons at the Baltimore terminal in the period to period comparison. Total costs related to transportation operations were $81 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $70 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The $11 million increase was primarily related to the additional through put tons at the Baltimore terminal in the period to period comparison. Miscellaneous Other: Other income was $17 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $22 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The $5 million decrease was attributable to $6 million of Other Income for the acceleration of a deferred gain associated with the initial sale leaseback of the Companys previous headquarters in 2009. This was offset by $1 million related to various transactions that occurred throughout both periods, none of which were individually material. Other corporate costs include interest cost, acquisition and financing costs and various other miscellaneous corporate charges. Total other costs were $297 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 and $64 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Other corporate costs increased $233 million due to the following: Interest expense of $198 million was incurred in the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $24 million in the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase of $174 million was primarily attributable to the additional interest expense on the long term bonds that were issued in conjunction with the Dominion Acquisition, which closed on April 30, 2010. Financing and acquisition fees of $62 million were incurred in the year ended December 31, 2010 primarily related to the equity and debt issuance that raised approximately $4.6 billion dollars. These fees also include costs related to 96extending and refinancing the CONSOL Energy revolving credit facility, the Dominion Acquisition and the purchase of the CNX Gas noncontrolling interest. Bank fees of $16 million were incurred in the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $5 million in the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase of $11 million was primarily related to the refinanced revolving credit facility. Fees related to the disposition of non core assets of $3 million were incurred in the year ended December 31, 2010. Various other corporate expenses were $21 million in the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $18 million in the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase of $3 million was due to various transactions that occurred throughout both periods, none of which were individually material. In the year ended December 31, 2010, there was $3 million of reduced expense related to an adjustment to assumptions used in the 2009 cease use of the Companys previous headquarter liability. The year ended December 31, 2009 included $13 million of expense related to the cease use of the facility. These transactions resulted in a $16 million improvement in the period to period comparison. Severance payments of $4 million were incurred in the year ended December 31, 2009 related to various layoffs that were necessary due to the economic downturn that occurred. Income Taxes: The effective income tax rate was 23.4% for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 28.1% for the year ended December 31, 2009. The effective tax rate is sensitive to the relationship between pre tax earnings and percentage depletion. The proportion of coal pre tax earnings and gas pre tax earnings also impacts the benefit of percentage depletion on the effective tax rate. The mix of pre tax income by state may also impact the overall effective tax rate. The pre tax income mix by state has changed in the period to period comparison due to the Dominion Acquisition. See Note 6 Income Taxes in the Notes to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10 K for additional explanation of the effective tax rate change in the period to period comparison.

See Note 1Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10 K for further discussion. On an on going basis, we evaluate our estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making the judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from those estimates upon subsequent resolution of identified matters. Management believes that the estimates utilized are reasonable. The following critical accounting policies are materially impacted by judgments, assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements.Business Combinations At acquisition, CONSOL Energy allocates the cost of a business acquisition to the specific tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their relative fair values. Significant judgments and estimates are often made to determine these allocated values, and may include the use of appraisals, consideration of market quotes for similar transactions, employment of discounted cash flow techniques or consideration of other information CONSOL Energy believes relevant. The finalization of the purchase price allocation will typically take a number of months to complete, and if final values are materially different from initially recorded amounts, adjustments are recorded. Any excess of the cost of a business acquisition over the fair values of the net assets and liabilities acquired is recorded as goodwill which is not amortized to expense. Recorded goodwill of a reporting unit is required to be tested for impairment on an annual basis, and between annual testing 97dates if events or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its net book value.Subsequent to the finalization of the purchase price allocation, any adjustments to the recorded values of acquired assets and liabilities would be reflected in the consolidated statement of operations. Once final, it is not permitted to revise the allocation of the original purchase price, even if subsequent events or circumstances prove the original judgments and estimates to be incorrect. In addition, long lived assets like property and equipment, amortizable intangibles and goodwill may be deemed to be impaired in the future resulting in the recognition of an impairment loss. The assumptions and judgments made when recording business combinations will have an impact on reported results of operations for many years into the future. Other Post Employment Benefits (OPEB) Certain subsidiaries of CONSOL Energy provide medical and life insurance benefits to retired employees not covered by the Coal Industry Retiree Health Benefit Act of 1992. The medical plans contain certain cost sharing and containment features, such as deductibles, coinsurance, health care networks and coordination with Medicare. For salaried employees hired before January 1, 2007, the eligibility requirement is either age 55 with 20 years of service or age 62 with 15 years of service. Also, salaried employees and retirees contribute a target of 20% of the medical plan operating costs. Contributions may be higher, dependent on either years of service or a combination of age and years of service at retirement. Prospective annual cost increases of up to 6% will be shared by CONSOL Energy and the participants based on their age and years of service at retirement. Annual cost increases in excess of 6% will be the responsibility of the participants. Any salaried or non represented hourly employees that were hired or rehired effective January 1, 2007 or later will not become eligible for retiree health benefits. In lieu of traditional retiree health coverage, if certain eligibility requirements are met, these employees will receive a retiree medical spending allowance of $2,250 per year for each year of service at retirement. Newly employed inexperienced miners represented by the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA), hired after January 1, 2007, will not be eligible to receive retiree health benefits. In lieu of these benefits, these employees will receive a defined contribution benefit of $1 per each hour worked through December 31, 2013, increasing to $1.50 per hour worked effective January 1, 2014 through December 31, 2016.After our review, various actuarial assumptions, including discount rate, expected trend in health care costs, average remaining service period, average remaining life expectancy, per capita costs and participation level in each future year are used by our independent actuary to estimate the cost and benefit obligations for our retiree health plans. Expected trends in future health care cost assumptions were adjusted from prior year to reflect recent experience and future expectations. The initial expected trend in health care costs at this years measurement date of 6.85% with an ultimate trend rate of 4.50% reached in 2026. The initial expected trend rate at last years measurement date was 8.47% with an ultimate trend rate of 4.50% reached in 2023. A 1.0% decrease in the health care trend rate would decrease interest and service cost for 2011 by approximately $20.9 million. A 1.0% increase in the health care trend rate would increase the interest and service cost by approximately $24.9 million. The discount rate is determined each year at the measurement date. The discount rate is determined by utilizing a corporate yield curve model developed from corporate bond data using only bonds rated Aa by Moodys as of the measurement date. All future post employment benefit expected payments were discounted using a spot rate yield curve as of December 31, 2011. The appropriate discount rate was then selected from resulting discounted cash flows. For the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, the discount rate used to calculate the period end liability and the following years expense was 4.51% and 5.33%, respectively. A 0.25% increase in the discount rate would have decreased 2011 net periodic postretirement benefit costs by approximately $4.7 million. A 0.25% decrease in the discount rate would have increased 2011 net periodic postretirement benefit costs by approximately $5.5 million. Deferred gains and losses are primarily due to historical changes in the discount rate and medical cost inflation differing from expectations in prior years. Changes to interest rates for the rates of returns on instruments that could be used to settle the actuarially determined plan obligations introduce substantial volatility to our costs. Accumulated actuarial gains or losses in excess of a pre established corridor are amortized on a straight line basis over the expected future service of active salary and non represented employees to their assumed retirement age. At December 31, 2011 the average remaining service period is approximately 11 years for our non represented plans. Accumulated actuarial gains or losses in excess of a pre established corridor are amortized on a straight line basis over the expected remaining life of our retired UMWA population. The average remaining service period of this population is not used for amortization purposes because the majority of the UMWA population of our plan is retired. At December 31, 2011, the average remaining life expectancy of our retired UMWA population used to calculate the following years expense is approximately 13 years.The weighted average per capita costs used to value the December 31, 2011 Other Postretirement Benefit liability was approximately 7% less than previously expected based on our trend assumption. If the actual change in per capita cost of medical services or other postretirement benefits are significantly greater or less than the projected trend rates, the per capita cost assumption would need to be adjusted, which could have a significant effect on the costs and liabilities recorded in the financial statements.98Significant increases in health and prescription drug costs for represented hourly retirees could have a material adverse effect on CONSOL Energys operating cash flow. However, the effect on CONSOL Energys cash flow from operations for salaried employees is limited to approximately 6% of the previous years medical cost for salaried employees due to the cost sharing provision in the benefit plan.The estimated liability recognized in the December 31, 2011 financial statements was $3.2 billion. For the year ended December 31, 2011, we paid approximately $156.8 million for other postretirement benefits, all of which were paid from operating cash flow. Our obligations with respect to these liabilities are unfunded at December 31, 2011. CONSOL Energy does not expect to contribute to the other postretirement plan in 2012. We intend to pay benefit claims as they are due.Salaried Pensions CONSOL Energy has non contributory defined benefit retirement plans covering substantially all employees not covered by multi employer plans. The benefits for these plans are based primarily on years of service and employees pay near retirement. CONSOL Energys salaried plan allows for lump sum distributions of benefits earned up until December 31, 2005, at the employees election. The Restoration Plan was frozen effective December 31, 2006 and was replaced prospectively with the CONSOL Energy Supplemental Retirement Plan. CONSOL Energys Restoration Plan allows only for lump sum distributions earned up until December 31, 2006. Effective September 8, 2009, the Supplemental Retirement Plan was amended to include employees of CNX Gas. The Supplemental Retirement Plan was frozen effective December 31, 2011 for certain employees and was replaced prospectively with the CONSOL Energy Defined Contribution Restoration Plan.In March of 2009, the CNX Gas defined benefit retirement plan was merged into the CONSOL Energys non contributory defined benefit retirement plan. At the time, the change did not impact the benefits for employees of CNX Gas. However, during 2010 an amendment was adopted to recognize past service at CNX Gas to current employees of CNX Gas who opted out of the plan for additional company contributions into their defined contribution plan and extend coverage to employees previously not eligible to participate in this plan.Our independent actuaries calculate the actuarial present value of the estimated retirement obligation based on assumptions including rates of compensation, mortality rates, retirement age and interest rates. For the year ended December 31, 2011, compensation increases are assumed to range from 3% to 6% depending on age and job classification. The discount rate is determined each year at the measurement date. The discount rate is determined by utilizing a corporate yield curve model developed from corporate bond data using only bonds rated Aa by Moodys as of the measurement date. All expected benefit payments from the CONSOL Energy retirement plan were discounted using a spot rate yield curve as of December 31, 2011. The appropriate equivalent discount rate was then selected for the resulting discounted pension cash flows. For the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, the discount rate used to calculate the period end liability and the following years expense was 4.50% and 5.30%, respectively. A 0.25% increase in the discount rate would have decreased the 2011 net periodic pension cost by $1.9 million. A 0.25% decrease in the discount rate would have increased the 2011 net periodic pension cost by $2.0 million. Deferred gains and losses are primarily due to historical changes in the discount rate and earnings on assets differing from expectations. At December 31, 2011 the average remaining service period is approximately 10 years. Changes to any of these assumptions introduce substantial volatility to our costs.The market related asset value is derived by taking the cost value of assets as of December 31, 2011 and multiplying it by the average 36 month ratio of the market value of assets to the cost value of assets. CONSOL Energys pension plan weighted average asset allocations at December 31, 2011 consisted of 60% equity securities and 40% debt securities.The estimated liability recognized in the December 31, 2011 financial statements was $274.8 million. For the year ended December 31, 2011, we contributed approximately $72.2 million to defined benefit retirement plans other than multi employer plans trust and to other pension benefits. Our obligations with respect to these liabilities are partially funded at December 31, 2011. CONSOL Energy intends to contribute an amount that will avoid benefit restrictions for the following plan year.Workers Compensation and Coal Workers Pneumoconiosis Workers compensation is a system by which individuals who sustain employment related physical injuries or some type of occupational diseases are compensated for their disabilities, medical costs, and on some occasions, for the costs of their rehabilitation. Workers compensation will also compensate the survivors of workers who suffer employment related deaths. The workers compensation laws are administered by state agencies with each state having its own set of rules and regulations regarding compensation that is owed to an employee that is injured in the course of employment. CONSOL Energy records an actuarially calculated liability, which is determined using various assumptions, including discount rate, future healthcare cost trends, benefit duration and recurrence of injuries. The discount rate is determined each year at the measurement date. The discount rate is determined by utilizing a corporate yield curve model developed from corporate bond data using only bonds rated Aa by Moodys as of the measurement date. All future workers compensation expected benefit payments were discounted 99using a spot rate yield curve as of December 31, 2011. The appropriate equivalent discount rate was then selected from the resulting discounted workers compensation cash flows. For the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, the discount rate used to calculate the period end liability and the following years expense was 4.40% and 5.13%, respectively. A 0.25% increase in the discount rate would have decreased the 2011 workers compensation expense cost by $0.7 million. A 0.25% decrease in the discount rate would have increased the 2011 workers compensation expense by $0.7 million. Deferred gains and losses are primarily due to historical changes in the discount rates, several years of favorable claims experience, various favorable state legislation changes and an overall lower incident rate than our assumptions. Accumulated actuarial gains or losses are amortized on a straight line basis over the expected future service of active employees that are eligible to file a future workers compensation claim. At December 31, 2011, the average remaining service period is approximately 9 years. The estimated liability recognized in the financial statements at December 31, 2011 was approximately $174.1 million. CONSOL Energys policy has been to provide for workers compensation benefits from operating cash flow. For the year ended December 31, 2011, we made payments for workers compensation benefits and other related fees of approximately $32.9 million, all of which was paid from operating cash flow. Our obligations with respect to these liabilities are unfunded at December 31, 2011. CONSOL Energy is responsible under the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969, as amended, for medical and disability benefits to employees and their dependents resulting from occurrences of coal workers pneumoconiosis disease. CONSOL Energy is also responsible under various state statutes for pneumoconiosis benefits. After our review, our independent actuaries calculate the actuarial present value of the estimated pneumoconiosis obligation based on assumptions regarding disability incidence, medical costs, mortality, death benefits, dependents and discount rates. The discount rate is determined each year at the measurement date. The discount rate is determined by utilizing a corporate yield curve model developed from corporate bond data using only bonds rated Aa by Moodys as of the measurement date. All future coal workers pneumoconiosis expected benefit payments were discounted using a spot rate yield curve at December 31, 2011. The appropriate equivalent discount rate was then selected from the resulting discounted coal workers pneumoconiosis cash flows. For the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, the discount rate used to calculate the period end liability and the following years expense was 4.46% and 5.21%, respectively. A 0.25% increase in the discount rate would have increased 2011 coal workers pneumoconiosis benefit by $0.6 million. A 0.25% decrease in the discount rate would have decreased 2011 coal workers pneumoconiosis benefit by $0.6 million. Actuarial gains associated with coal workers pneumoconiosis have resulted from numerous legislative changes over many years which have resulted in lower approval rates for filed claims than our assumptions originally reflected. Actuarial gains have also resulted from lower incident rates and lower severity of claims filed than our assumptions originally reflected. The estimated liability recognized in the financial statements at December 31, 2011 was $183.6 million. For the year ended December 31, 2011, we paid coal workers pneumoconiosis benefits of approximately $11.1 million, all of which was paid from operating cash flow. Our obligations with respect to these liabilities are unfunded at December 31, 2011.Reclamation, Mine Closure and Gas Well Closing Obligations The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act established operational, reclamation and closure standards for all aspects of surface mining as well as most aspects of deep mining. CONSOL Energy accrues for the costs of current mine disturbance and final mine and gas well closure, including the cost of treating mine water discharge where necessary. Estimates of our total reclamation, mine closing liabilities, and gas well closing which are based upon permit requirements and CONSOL Energy engineering expertise related to these requirements, including the current portion, were approximately $650.1 million at December 31, 2011. This liability is reviewed annually, or when events and circumstances indicate an adjustment is necessary, by CONSOL Energy management and engineers. The estimated liability can significantly change if actual costs vary from assumptions or if governmental regulations change significantly.Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations requires that the fair value of an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The present value of the estimated asset retirement costs is capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset. Asset retirement obligations primarily relate to the closure of mines and gas wells and the reclamation of land upon exhaustion of coal and gas reserves. Changes in the variables used to calculate the liabilities can have a significant effect on the mine closing, reclamation and gas well closing liabilities. The amounts of assets and liabilities recorded are dependent upon a number of variables, including the estimated future retirement costs, estimated proven reserves, assumptions involving profit margins, inflation rates, and the assumed credit adjusted risk free interest rate. Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations also requires depreciation of the capitalized asset retirement cost and accretion of the asset retirement obligation over time. The depreciation will generally be determined on a units of production basis, whereas the accretion to be recognized will escalate over the life of the producing assets, typically as production declines.100Income Taxes Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax basis of recorded assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. All available evidence, both positive and negative, must be considered in determining the need for a valuation allowance. At December 31, 2011, CONSOL Energy has deferred tax assets in excess of deferred tax liabilities of approximately $648.8 million. The deferred tax assets are evaluated periodically to determine if a valuation allowance is necessary.Deferred tax valuation allowances decreased $21.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 primarily due to the release of previously recognized valuation allowances related to certain Pennsylvania net operating loss carry forwards and future temporary deductions. Valuation allowances on these net operating loss carry forwards and future temporary deductions were released during the year due to positive evidence outweighing negative evidence indicating that these benefits will be utilized in future years. CONSOL Energy continues to report a deferred tax asset of approximately $35.0 million relating to its state net operating loss carry forwards subject to a full valuation allowance. A review of positive and negative evidence regarding these benefits, primarily the history of financial and tax losses on a separate company basis, concluded that a full valuation allowance was warranted. The net operating loss carry forwards expire at various times from 2018 to 2030. A valuation allowance of $6.0 million continues to be recognized against the state deferred tax asset attributable to future tax deductible differences for certain subsidiaries with histories of financial and tax losses. Management will continue to assess the realization of deferred tax assets attributable to state net operating loss carry forwards and future tax deductible differences based upon updated income forecast data and the feasibility of future tax planning strategies, and may record adjustments to valuation allowances against these deferred tax assets in future periods that could materially impact net income.CONSOL Energy evaluates all tax positions taken on the state and federal tax filings to determine if the position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination. For positions that meet the more likely than not to be sustained criteria, an evaluation to determine the largest amount of benefit, determined on a cumulative probability basis that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement is determined. A previously recognized tax position is derecognized when it is subsequently determined that a tax position no longer meets the more likely than not threshold to be sustained. The evaluation of the sustainability of a tax position and the probable amount that is more likely than not is based on judgment, historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these estimates, that are not readily apparent from other sources, form the basis for recognizing an uncertain tax liability. Actual results could differ from those estimates upon subsequent resolution of identified matters. Estimates of our uncertain tax liabilities, including interest and the current portion, were approximately $30.9 million at December 31, 2011.Stock Based Compensation As of December 31, 2011, we have issued four types of share based payment awards: options, restricted stock units, performance stock options and performance share units. The Black Scholes option pricing model is used to determine fair value of stock options at the grant date. Various inputs are utilized in the Black Scholes pricing model, such as:stock price on measurement date, exercise price defined in the award, expected dividend yield based on historical trend of dividend payouts, risk free interest rate based on a zero coupon treasury bond rate, expected term based on historical grant and exercise behavior, and expected volatility based on historic and implied stock price volatility of CONSOL Energy stock and public peer group stock. These factors can significantly impact the value of stock options expense recognized over the requisite service period of option holders.The fair value of each restricted stock unit awarded is equivalent to the closing market price of a share of our companys stock on the date of the grant. The fair value of each performance share unit is determined by the underlying share price of our company stock on the date of the grant and managements estimate of the probability that the performance conditions required for vesting will be achieved.As of December 31, 2011, $36.6 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested awards is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.66 years. See Note 18"Stock based Compensation" in the Notes to the 101Audited Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 in this Form 10 K for more information.Contingencies CONSOL Energy is currently involved in certain legal proceedings. We have accrued our estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of these claims. This estimate has been developed in consultation with legal counsel involved in the defense of these matters and is based upon an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies. Future results of operations for any particular quarter or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the outcome of these proceedings. See Note 24Commitments and Contingent Liabilities in the Notes to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 in this Form 10 K for further discussion.Successful Efforts Accounting We use the successful efforts method to account for our gas exploration and production activities. Under this method, cost of property acquisitions, successful exploratory wells, development wells and related support equipment and facilities are capitalized. Costs of unsuccessful exploratory or development wells are expensed when such wells are determined to be non productive, or if the determination cannot be made after finding sufficient quantities of reserves to continue evaluating the viability of the project. We use this accounting policy instead of the "full cost" method because it provides a more timely accounting of the success or failure of our gas exploration and production activities.Derivative Instruments CONSOL Energy enters into financial derivative instruments to manage exposure to natural gas and oil price volatility. We measure every derivative instrument at fair value and record them on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability. Changes in fair value of derivatives are recorded currently in earnings unless special hedge accounting criteria are met. For derivatives designated as fair value hedges, the changes in fair value of both the derivative instrument and the hedged item are recorded in earnings. For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portions of changes in fair value of the derivative are reported in other comprehensive income or loss and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods which the forecasted transaction affects earnings. The ineffective portions of hedges are recognized in earnings in the current year. CONSOL Energy currently utilizes only cash flow hedges that are considered highly effective.CONSOL Energy formally assesses, both at inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, whether each derivative is highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedge item. If it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective as a hedge or if a derivative ceases to be a highly effective hedge, CONSOL Energy will discontinue hedge accounting prospectively.Coal and Gas Reserve Values There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities and values of economically recoverable coal and gas reserves, including many factors beyond our control. As a result, estimates of economically recoverable coal and gas reserves are by their nature uncertain. Information about our reserves consists of estimates based on engineering, economic and geological data assembled and analyzed by our staff. Our coal reserves are periodically reviewed by an independent third party consultant. Our gas reserves have been reviewed by independent experts each year. Some of the factors and assumptions which impact economically recoverable reserve estimates include:geological conditions; historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas; the assumed effects of regulations and taxes by governmental agencies; assumptions governing future prices; and future operating costs. Each of these factors may in fact vary considerably from the assumptions used in estimating reserves. For these reasons, estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of coal and gas attributable to a particular group of properties, and classifications of these reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of future net cash flows, may vary substantially. Actual production, revenues and expenditures with respect to our reserves will likely vary from estimates, and these variances may be material. See "Risk Factors" in Item 1A of this report for a discussion of the uncertainties in estimating our reserves.102Liquidity and Capital ResourcesCONSOL Energy generally has satisfied its working capital requirements and funded its capital expenditures and debt service obligations with cash generated from operations and proceeds from borrowings. On April 12, 2011, CONSOL Energy amended and extended its $1.5 billion Senior Secured Credit Agreement through April 12, 2016. The previous facility was set to expire on May 7, 2014. The amendment provides more favorable pricing and the facility continues to be secured by substantially all of the assets of CONSOL Energy and certain of its subsidiaries. CONSOL Energys credit facility allows for up to $1.5 billion for borrowings and letters of credit. CONSOL Energy can request an additional $250 million increase in the aggregate borrowing limit amount. Fees and interest rate spreads are based on a ratio of financial covenant debt to twelve month trailing earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization (EBITDA), measured quarterly. The facility includes a minimum interest coverage ratio covenant of no less than 2.50 to 1.00, measured quarterly. The minimum interest coverage ratio covenant is calculated as the ratio of EBITDA to cash interest expense of CONSOL Energy and certain of its subsidiaries. The interest coverage ratio was 5.80 to 1.00 at December 31, 2011. The facility includes a maximum leverage ratio covenant of no more than 4.75 to 1.00 through March 2013, and no more than 4.50 to 1.00 thereafter, measured quarterly. The maximum leverage ratio covenant is calculated as the ratio of financial covenant debt to twelve month trailing EBITDA for CONSOL Energy and certain subsidiaries. Financial covenant debt is comprised of the outstanding indebtedness and specific letters of credit, less cash on hand, of CONSOL Energy and certain of its subsidiaries. EBITDA, as used in the covenant calculation, excludes non cash compensation expenses, non recurring transaction expenses, uncommon gains and losses, gains and losses on discontinued operations and includes cash distributions received from affiliates plus pro rata earnings from material acquisitions. The leverage ratio was 2.15 to 1.00 at December 31, 2011. The facility also includes a senior secured leverage ratio covenant of no more than 2.00 to 1.00, measured quarterly. The senior secured leverage ratio covenant is calculated as the ratio of secured debt to EBITDA. Secured debt is defined as the outstanding borrowings and letters of credit on the revolving credit facility. The senior secured leverage ratio was 0.19 to 1.00 at December 31, 2011. Covenants in the facility limit our ability to dispose of assets, make investments, purchase or redeem CONSOL Energy common stock, pay dividends, merge with another company and amend, modify or restate, in any material way, the senior unsecured notes. At December 31, 2011, the facility had no outstanding borrowings and $266 million of letters of credit outstanding, leaving $1.2 billion of unused capacity. From time to time, CONSOL Energy is required to post financial assurances to satisfy contractual and other requirements generated in the normal course of business. Some of these assurances are posted to comply with federal, state or other government agencies statutes and regulations. We sometimes use letters of credit to satisfy these requirements and these letters of credit reduce our borrowing facility capacity.CONSOL Energy also has an accounts receivable securitization facility. This facility allows the Company to receive, on a revolving basis, up to $200 million of short term funding and letters of credit. The accounts receivable facility supports sales, on a continuous basis to financial institutions, of eligible trade accounts receivable. CONSOL Energy has agreed to continue servicing the sold receivables for the financial institutions for a fee based upon market rates for similar services. The cost of funds is based on commercial paper rates plus a charge for administrative services paid to financial institutions. At December 31, 2011, eligible accounts receivable totaled approximately $193 million and there were no borrowings or letters of credit outstanding against the facility. On April 11, 2011, CONSOL Energy redeemed all of its outstanding $250 million, 7.875% Notes due March 1, 2012 in accordance with the terms of the indenture governing the Notes. The redemption price included principal of $250 million, a make whole premium of $16 million and accrued interest of $2 million for a total redemption cost of $268 million. CONSOL Energys loss on extinguishment of debt was $16 million, which primarily represents the interest that would have been paid on these notes if held to maturity.On April 12, 2011, CNX Gas entered into a $1.0 billion Senior Secured Credit Agreement which extends until April 12, 2016. It replaced the $700 million senior secured credit facility which was set to expire on May 6, 2014. The replacement facility provides more favorable pricing and the facility continues to be secured by substantially all of the assets of CNX Gas and its subsidiaries. CNX Gas credit facility allows for up to $1.0 billion for borrowings and letters of credit. CNX Gas can request an additional $250 million increase in the aggregate borrowing limit amount. Fees and interest rate spreads are based on the percentage of facility utilization, measured quarterly. An amendment to the credit agreement was approved by the lenders and became effective December 14, 2011. The amendment allows unlimited investments in joint ventures for the development and operation of gas gathering systems and provides for $600 million of loans, advances and dividends from CNX Gas to CONSOL Energy. Investments in CONE Gathering Company, a joint venture with Noble Energy to provide Marcellus gathering capability, are unrestricted under this amendment. The facility includes a minimum interest coverage ratio covenant of no less than 3.00 to 1.00, measured quarterly. The minimum interest coverage ratio covenant is calculated as the ratio of EBITDA to cash interest expense for CNX Gas and its subsidiaries. The interest coverage ratio was 34.18 to 1.00 at December 31, 2011. The facility also includes a maximum leverage ratio covenant of no more than 3.50 to 1.00, measured 103quarterly. The maximum leverage ratio covenant is calculated as the ratio of financial covenant debt to twelve month trailing EBITDA for CNX Gas and its subsidiaries. Financial covenant debt is comprised of the outstanding indebtedness and letters of credit, less cash on hand, of CNX Gas and its subsidiaries. EBITDA, as used in the covenant calculation, excludes non cash compensation expenses, non recurring transaction expenses, gains and losses on the sale of assets, uncommon gains and losses, gains and losses on discontinued operations and includes cash distributions received from affiliates plus pro rata earnings from material acquisitions. The leverage ratio was 0.00 to 1.00 at December 31, 2011. Covenants in the facility limit our ability to dispose of assets, make investments, pay dividends and merge with another company. At December 31, 2011, the facility had no amounts drawn and $70 million of letters of credit outstanding, leaving $930 million of unused capacity.Uncertainty in the financial markets brings additional potential risks to CONSOL Energy. The risks include declines in our stock price, less availability and higher costs of additional credit, potential counterparty defaults, and commercial bank failures. Financial market disruptions may impact our collection of trade receivables. As a result, CONSOL Energy constantly monitors the creditworthiness of our customers. We believe that our current group of customers are financially sound and represent no abnormal business risk.CONSOL Energy believes that cash generated from operations and our borrowing capacity will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements, anticipated capital expenditures (other than major acquisitions), scheduled debt payments, anticipated dividend payments and to provide required letters of credit. Nevertheless, the ability of CONSOL Energy to satisfy its working capital requirements, to service its debt obligations, to fund planned capital expenditures or to pay dividends will depend upon future operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions in the coal and gas industries and other financial and business factors, some of which are beyond CONSOL Energys control.In order to manage the market risk exposure of volatile natural gas prices in the future, CONSOL Energy enters into various physical gas supply transactions with both gas marketers and end users for terms varying in length. CONSOL Energy has also entered into various gas swap transactions that qualify as financial cash flow hedges, which exist parallel to the underlying physical transactions. The fair value of these contracts was a net asset of $251 million at December 31, 2011. The ineffective portion of these contracts was insignificant to earnings in the year ended December 31, 2011. No issues related to our hedge agreements have been encountered to date.CONSOL Energy frequently evaluates potential acquisitions. CONSOL Energy has funded acquisitions with cash generated from operations and a variety of other sources, depending on the size of the transaction, including debt and equity financing. There can be no assurance that additional capital resources, including debt and equity financing, will be available to CONSOL Energy on terms which CONSOL Energy finds acceptable, or at all.Cash Flows (in millions) For the Years Ended December 31, 2011 2010 ChangeCash flows from operating activities$1,528 $1,131 $397Cash used in investing activities$(579) $(5,544) $4,965Cash (used in) provided by financing activities$(606) $4,380 $(4,986)Cash flows provided by operating activities changed in the period to period comparison primarily due to the following items: Operating cash flow increased $274 million in 2011 due to higher net income attributable to CONSOL Energy shareholders in the period to period comparison. The 2011 net income included an approximately $75 million reduction due to the abandonment of Mine 84 which is discussed further in Note 10Property, Plant and Equipment, in the Notes to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. This reduction did not have a corresponding reduction to cash flows from operating activities because it was primarily related to the write down of assets remaining at Mine 84 at the time of the abandonment, not cash obligations. Operating cash flows increased due to various other changes in operating assets, operating liabilities, other assets and other liabilities which occurred throughout both years, none of which were individually material.104Net cash used in investing activities changed in the period to period comparison primarily due to the following items:On April 30, 2010, CONSOL Energy paid $3.470 billion for the Dominion Acquisition. See Note 2Acquisitions and Dispositions, in the Notes to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K for additional details.On May 28, 2010, CONSOL Energy paid $991 million to acquire the shares of CNX Gas common stock and vested stock options which it did not previously own.On September 30, 2011, CONSOL Energy received net proceeds of $485 million related to the Noble transaction, net proceeds of $190 million related to the Antero transaction, and net proceeds of $54 million related to the Hess transaction. See Note 2Acquisitions and Dispositions, in the Notes to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K for additional details.On September 30, 2011, CONSOL Energy received a $67 million cash distribution from CONE Gathering LLC. See Note 2Acquisitions and Dispositions, in the Notes to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K for additional details.Total capital expenditures increased $228 million to $1.38 billion in the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $1.15 billion in the year ended December 31, 2010. Capital expenditures for the gas segment increased $242 million due to the additional Marcellus Shale drilling in the period to period comparison. Capital expenditures for coal and other activities decreased $14 million in the period to period comparison. Face extension projects at various locations were lower by $87 million as a result of the majority of these projects being completed during the 2010 period, $13 million was incurred in the 2010 period as a result of a longwall shield lease buyout at Enlow Fork, and the 2011 period was lower by approximately $32 million related to the Buchanan Reverse Osmosis (RO) system which was primarily completed before January 1, 2011 and an approximate $42 million decrease in 2011 related to various other equipment expenditures throughout both periods. These reductions in coal and other capital were offset, in part by an approximate $122 million increase in expenditures related primarily to the ongoing development of the BMX Mine which is scheduled to begin production in early 2014, and a $38 million increase in 2011 related to the construction of the Northern West Virginia RO system.Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities changed in the period to period comparison primarily due to the following items:Proceeds of $2.75 billion were received on April 1, 2010 in connection with the issuance of $1.5 billion of 8.00% senior unsecured notes due in 2017 and $1.25 billion of 8.25% senior unsecured notes due in 2020. In 2010, proceeds of $1.83 billion were received in connection with the issuance of 44.3 million shares of common stock which was completed on March 31, 2010.In 2011, CONSOL Energy repaid $200 million of borrowings under the accounts receivable securitization facility. In 2010, CONSOL Energy received proceeds of $150 million under this facility.In 2011, CONSOL Energy paid $266 million, including a make whole provision, to redeem the 7.875% notes that were due in March 2012.In 2011, CONSOL Energy paid $15 million related to the solicitation of consents from the holders of CONSOL Energys outstanding 8.00% Senior Notes due 2017, 8.25% Senior Notes due 2020, and 6.375% Senior Notes due 2021. See Note 10Long Term Debt, in the Notes to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements included Item 8 of this Form 10 K for additional details.In 2011, CONSOL Energy paid outstanding borrowings of $155 million under the revolving credit facility. In 2010, CONSOL Energy paid $260 million under this facility.Dividends of $96 million were paid in 2011 compared to $86 million in 2010. The increase was due to the 44.3 million additional shares issued on March 31, 2010 and also due to the increase of the regular annual dividend by 25%, or $0.10 per share, to $0.50 per share on October 27, 2011.In 2011, proceeds of $250 million were received in connection with the issuance of $250 million of 6.375% senior 105unsecured notes due in March 2021.In 2011, CNX Gas, a wholly owned subsidiary, paid outstanding borrowings of $129 million under its revolving credit facility compared to receiving $71 million in 2010.The following is a summary of our significant contractual obligations at December 31, 2011 (in thousands): Payments due by Year Less Than1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years More Than5 Years TotalPurchase Order Firm Commitments$163,381 $81,788 $ $245,169Gas Firm Transportation57,796 134,057 128,022 450,825 770,700CONE Gathering Commitments22,500 157,600 339,800 1,198,500 1,718,400Long Term Debt11,759 6,279 5,287 3,110,668 3,133,993Interest on Long Term Debt244,977 490,592 491,303 554,157 1,781,029Capital (Finance) Lease Obligations8,932 14,608 10,627 29,954 64,121Interest on Capital (Finance) Lease Obligations4,247 6,846 5,223 5,713 22,029Operating Lease Obligations88,502 152,270 95,187 149,771 485,730Long Term LiabilitiesEmployee Related (a)223,687 462,252 478,482 2,471,066 3,635,487Other Long Term Liabilities (b)321,533 125,309 66,218 438,019 951,079Total Contractual Obligations (c)$1,147,314 $1,631,601 $1,620,149 $8,408,673 $12,807,737 (a)Long term liabilitiesemployee related include other post employment benefits, work related injuries and illnesses.

This long term debt consisted of:An aggregate principal amount of $1.5 billion of 8.00% senior unsecured notes due in April 2017. Interest on the notes is payable April 1 and October 1 of each year. Payment of the principal and interest on the notes are guaranteed by most of CONSOL Energys subsidiaries.An aggregate principal amount of $1.25 billion of 8.25% senior unsecured notes due in April 2020. Interest on the notes is payable April 1 and October 1 of each year. Payment of the principal and interest on the notes are guaranteed by most of CONSOL Energys subsidiaries.An aggregate principal amount of $250 million of 6.375% notes due in March 2021.

Payment of the principal and interest on the notes are guaranteed by most of CONSOL Energys subsidiaries.An aggregate principal amount of $103 million of industrial revenue bonds which were issued to finance the Baltimore port facility and bear interest at 5.75% per annum and mature in September 2025. Interest on the industrial revenue bonds is payable March 1 and September 1 of each year.$31 million in advance royalty commitments with an average interest rate of 6.73% per annum.An aggregate principal amount of $64 million of capital leases with a weighted average interest rate of 6.46% per annum.106At December 31, 2011, CONSOL Energy also had no outstanding borrowings and had approximately $266 million of letters of credit outstanding under the $1.5 billion senior secured revolving credit facility.At December 31, 2011, CONSOL Energy had no outstanding borrowings under the accounts receivable securitization facility.At December 31, 2011, CNX Gas, a wholly owned subsidiary, had no outstanding borrowings and approximately $70 million of letters of credit outstanding under its $1.0 billion secured revolving credit facility.Total Equity and DividendsCONSOL Energy had total equity of $3.6 billion at December 31, 2011 and $2.9 billion at December 31, 2010. Total equity increased primarily due to net income attributable to CONSOL Energy shareholders, changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges and the amortization of stock based compensation awards. These increases were offset, in part, by the declaration of dividends and adjustments to actuarial liabilities. See the Consolidated Statements of Stockholders Equity in Item 8 of this Form 10 K for additional details.Dividend information for the current year to date were as follows: Declaration Date Amount Per Share Record Date Payment DateJanuary 27, 2012 $0.125 February 7, 2012 February 21, 2012October 27, 2011 $0.125 November 11, 2011 November 25, 2011July 29, 2011 $0.100 August 10, 2011 August 22, 2011April 29, 2011 $0.100 May 13, 2011 May 24, 2011January 28, 2011 $0.100 February 8, 2011 February 18, 2011On October 27, 2011, CONSOL Energys Board of Directors increased the regular annual dividend by 25%, or $0.10 per share, to $0.50 per share, effective immediately.The declaration and payment of dividends by CONSOL Energy is subject to the discretion of CONSOL Energys Board of Directors, and no assurance can be given that CONSOL Energy will pay dividends in the future. CONSOL Energys Board of Directors determines whether dividends will be paid quarterly. The determination to pay dividends will depend upon, among other things, general business conditions, CONSOL Energys financial results, contractual and legal restrictions regarding the payment of dividends by CONSOL Energy, planned investments by CONSOL Energy and such other factors as the Board of Directors deems relevant. Our credit facility limits our ability to pay dividends in excess of an annual rate of $0.40 per share when our leverage ratio exceeds 4.50 to 1.00 or our availability is less than or equal to $100 million. The leverage ratio was 2.15 to 1.00 and our availability was approximately $1.2 billion at December 31, 2011. The credit facility does not permit dividend payments in the event of default. The indentures to the 2017, 2020 and 2021 notes limit dividends to $0.40 per share annually unless several conditions are met. Conditions include no defaults, ability to incur additional debt and other payment limitations under the indentures. There were no defaults in the year ended December 31, 2011.Off Balance Sheet TransactionsCONSOL Energy does not maintain off balance sheet transactions, arrangements, obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or others that are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on CONSOL Energys financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources which are not disclosed in the Notes to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements. CONSOL Energy participates in various multi employer benefit plans such as the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA) 1974 Pension Plan, the UMWA Combined Benefit Fund and the UMWA 1993 Benefit Plan which generally accepted accounting principles recognize on a pay as you go basis. These benefit arrangements may result in additional liabilities that are not recognized on the balance sheet at December 31, 2011. The various multi employer benefit plans are discussed in Note 17Other Employee Benefit Plans in the Notes to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. CONSOL Energy also uses a combination of surety bonds, corporate guarantees and letters of credit to secure our financial obligations for employee related, environmental, performance and various other items which are not reflected on the balance sheet at December 31, 2011. Management believes these items will expire without being funded. See Note 24Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K for additional details of the various financial guarantees that have been issued by CONSOL Energy.107Recent Accounting PronouncementsIn December 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued an update to the Comprehensive Income Topic of the Accounting Standards Codification intended to improve the comparability, consistency, and transparency of financial reporting and to increase the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income. This update allows entities to continue to report reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income consistent with the presentation requirements in effect before Update 2011 05. All other requirements included within Update 2011 05 are not affected and entities must report comprehensive income either in a single continuous financial statement or in two separate but consecutive financial statements. The effective date of this update is for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2011. We believe adoption of this new guidance will not have a material impact on CONSOL Energys financial statements as these updates have an impact on presentation only. ITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKIn addition to the risks inherent in operations, CONSOL Energy is exposed to financial, market, political and economic risks. The following discussion provides additional detail regarding CONSOL Energys exposure to the risks of changing commodity prices, interest rates and foreign exchange rates. CONSOL Energy is exposed to market price risk in the normal course of selling natural gas production and to a lesser extent in the sale of coal. CONSOL Energy sells coal under both short term and long term contracts with fixed price and or indexed price contracts that reflect market value. CONSOL Energy uses fixed price contracts, collar price contracts and derivative commodity instruments that qualify as cash flow hedges under the Derivatives and Hedging Topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification to minimize exposure to market price volatility in the sale of natural gas. Our risk management policy prohibits the use of derivatives for speculative purposes. CONSOL Energy has established risk management policies and procedures to strengthen the internal control environment of the marketing of commodities produced from its asset base. All of the derivative instruments without other risk assessment procedures are held for purposes other than trading. They are used primarily to mitigate uncertainty, volatility and cover underlying exposures. CONSOL Energys market risk strategy incorporates fundamental risk management tools to assess market price risk and establish a framework in which management can maintain a portfolio of transactions within pre defined risk parameters. CONSOL Energy believes that the use of derivative instruments, along with our risk assessment procedures and internal controls, mitigates our exposure to material risks. However, the use of derivative instruments without other risk assessment procedures could materially affect CONSOL Energys results of operations depending on market prices. Nevertheless, we believe that use of these instruments will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or liquidity. For a summary of accounting policies related to derivative instruments, see Note 1Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. A sensitivity analysis has been performed to determine the incremental effect on future earnings, related to open derivative instruments at December 31, 2011. A hypothetical 10 percent decrease in future natural gas prices would increase future earnings related to derivatives by $0.7 million. Similarly, a hypothetical 10 percent increase in future natural gas prices would decrease future earnings related to derivatives by $0.7 million. CONSOL Energys interest expense is sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates in the United States. At December 31, 2011, CONSOL Energy had $3,198 million aggregate principal amount of debt outstanding under fixed rate instruments and no debt outstanding under variable rate instruments. CONSOL Energys primary exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our revolving credit facility, under which there were no borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2011. CONSOL Energys revolving credit facility bore interest at a weighted average rate of 4.08% per annum during the year ended December 31, 2011. A 100 basis point increase in the average rate for CONSOL Energys revolving credit facility would not have significantly decreased net income for the period. CNX Gas, also had borrowings during the period under its revolving credit facility which bears interest at a variable rate. CNX Gas facility had no outstanding borrowings at December 31, 2011 and bore interest at a weighted average rate of 2.08% per annum during the year ended December 31, 2011. Due to the level of borrowings against this facility and the low weighted average interest rate in the year ended December 31, 2011, a 100 basis point increase in the average rate for CNX Gas revolving credit facility would not have significantly decreased net income for the period.Almost all of CONSOL Energys transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars, and, as a result, it does not have material exposure to currency exchange rate risks.108Hedging VolumesAs of January 23, 2012 our hedged volumes for the periods indicated are as follows: For the Three Months Ended March 31, June 30, September 30, December 31, Total Year2012 Fixed Price Volumes Hedged Mcf19,108,632 19,108,632 19,318,617 19,318,617 76,854,498Weighted Average Hedge Price/Mcf$5.25 $5.25 $5.25 $5.25 $5.252013 Fixed Price Volumes Hedged Mcf12,513,747 12,652,788 12,791,830 12,791,830 50,750,195Weighted Average Hedge Price/Mcf$5.06 $5.06 $5.06 $5.06 $5.062014 Fixed Price Volumes Hedged Mcf10,849,825 10,970,378 11,090,932 11,090,932 44,002,067Weighted Average Hedge Price/Mcf$5.20 $5.20 $5.20 $5.20 $5.202015 Fixed Price Volumes Hedged Mcf927,835 938,144 948,454 948,454 3,762,887Weighted Average Hedge Price/Mcf$3.97 $3.97 $3.97 $3.97 $3.97109
