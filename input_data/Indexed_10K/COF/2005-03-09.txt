Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Introduction Capital One Financial Corporation (the Corporation) is a holding company whose subsidiaries market a variety of consumer financial products and services. In 2004, the Corporation became a bank holding company. The Corporations principal subsidiaries are Capital One Bank (the Bank) which currently offers credit card products and takes retail deposits, Capital One, F.S.B. (the Savings Bank), which offers consumer and commercial lending and consumer deposit products, and Capital One Auto Finance, Inc. (COAF) which offers automobile and other motor vehicle financing products. The Corporation and its subsidiaries are hereafter collectively referred to as the Company. As of December 31, 2004, the Company had 48.6 million accounts and $79.9 billion in managed consumer loans outstanding and was one of the largest providers of MasterCard and Visa credit cards in the world. The Companys profitability is affected by the net interest income and non interest income generated on earning assets, consumer usage and payment patterns, credit quality, levels of marketing expense and operating efficiency. The Companys revenues consist primarily of interest income on consumer loans (including past due fees) and securities and non interest income consisting of servicing income on securitized loans, fees (such as annual membership, cash advance, cross sell, interchange, overlimit and other fee income, collectively fees) and gains on the securitizations of loans. Loan securitization transactions qualifying as sales under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) remove the loan receivables from the consolidated balance sheet; however, the Company continues to both own and service the related accounts. The Company generates earnings from its managed loan portfolio that includes both on balance sheet and off balance sheet loans. Interest income, fees, and recoveries in excess of the interest paid to investors and charge offs generated from off balance sheet loans are recognized as servicing and securitizations income. The Companys primary expenses are the costs of funding assets, provision for loan losses, operating expenses (including salaries and associate benefits), marketing expenses and income taxes. Marketing expenses (e.g., advertising, printing, credit bureau costs and postage) to implement the Companys new product strategies are incurred and expensed prior to the acquisition of new accounts while the resulting revenues are recognized over the life of the acquired accounts. Revenues recognized are a function of the response rate of the initial marketing program, usage and attrition patterns, credit quality of accounts, product pricing and effectiveness of account management programs. Significant Accounting Policies The Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contain a summary of the Companys significant accounting policies, including a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements. Several of these policies are considered to be important to the portrayal of the Companys financial condition, since they require management to make difficult, complex or subjective judgments, some of which may relate to matters that are inherently uncertain. These policies include determination of the level of allowance for loan losses, accounting for securitization transactions, recognition of customer reward costs and finance charge and fee revenue recognition. Additional information about accounting policies can be found in
