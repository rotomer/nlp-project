ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our results of operations and our present financial condition. Our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Form 10 K contain additional information that should be referred to when reviewing this material. Statements in this discussion may be forward looking. These forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, including those discussed below, which could cause actual results to differ from those expressed. Please read Forward Looking Information on page 32. We operate in one segment, natural gas and oil exploration and development. OVERVIEW Our financial results depend upon many factors, particularly the price of natural gas and our ability to market our production on economically attractive terms. Price volatility in the natural gas market has remained prevalent in the last few years. In the first quarter of 1999, we experienced a decline in energy commodity prices, resulting in lower revenues and net income during this period. However, in the summer of 1999 and continuing through 2000, prices improved. For the months of April through October 2000, we had certain natural gas hedges in place that prevented us from realizing the full impact of this price environment. (See the Commodity Price Swaps and Options discussion about hedging on page 38.) Despite this limitation, our realized natural gas price for each month in the year 2000 was higher than the same month of any previous year. In the final months of 2000 and into early 2001, the NYMEX futures market reported unprecedented natural gas contract prices. We benefited from this market with our realized natural gas price reaching $5.66 per Mcf in December and $8.46 per Mcf in January 2001. When the NYMEX futures market was near its high on the last day of December 2000, we entered into a series of price collars that protected us from the subsequent price decline until their expiration in October 2001. These price collar arrangements boosted 2001 revenue by $34.6 million, increasing the average realized natural gas price by $0.50 per Mcf. The table below illustrates how natural gas prices have fluctuated over the course of 2001. "Index" represents the Henry Hub index price. The "2001" price is the natural gas price realized by us and it includes the impact of the natural gas price collar arrangements: (in $ per Mcf) Natural Gas Prices by Month Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Index 9.91 6.22 5.03 5.35 4.87 3.73 3.16 3.19 2.34 1.86 3.16 2.28 2001 8.46 6.28 4.91 5.05 5.08 4.25 3.96 3.79 3.57 3.24 3.06 2.32 Prices for crude oil have followed a similar path as the commodity market fell through 2001. The table below contains the West Texas Intermediate index price ("Index") and our realized crude oil prices by month for 2001. (in $ per Bbl) Crude Oil Prices by Month Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Index 28.66 27.40 26.30 28.46 28.37 26.26 26.35 27.20 23.43 21.18 19.44 19.84 2001 30.32 29.20 26.44 26.31 29.12 27.85 24.72 25.71 24.50 22.85 19.05 19.85 We reported earnings of $1.56 per share, or $47.1 million, for 2001. This is up from the $1.07 per share, or $29.2 million, reported in 2000. The improvement is a result of the stronger commodity price environment during the year 2001 and the impact of the natural gas price collar arrangements, which combined to push our realized natural gas price up 37% to $4.36 per Mcf. Additionally, natural gas production was up 14% and crude oil sales volumes were up 100% from last year. Overall, on a Mcf equivalent basis, our production grew more than 21% over 2000. A 12% production increase was a result of our drilling successes in 2000 and 2001, and the remaining 9% increase resulted from the acquisition of Cody Company, which was effective August 1, 2001. 23 A discussion of our results from recurring operations can be found in the Results of Operations section, beginning on page 33. Before taking into account selected items, net income for 2001 was $51.9 million, or $1.71 per share, and $30.2 million, or $1.10 per share for 2000. In August 2001, we acquired the stock of Cody Company, the parent of Cody Energy LLC ("Cody acquisition") for $231.2 million consisting of $181.3 million of cash and 1,999,993 shares of common stock valued at $49.9 million. Substantially all of the proved reserves of Cody Company are located in the onshore Gulf Coast region. The acquisition was recorded using the purchase method of accounting. As such, the Company reflected the assets and liabilities acquired at fair value in the Companys balance sheet effective August 1, 2001 and the results of operations of Cody Company beginning August 1, 2001. In 2001, these acquired properties contributed 6.2 Bcfe of production, $17.0 million of operating revenue and $19.2 million of operating expenses including $11.6 million of DD&A expense. Additional 2001 costs included $5.3 million of interest expense. These properties contributed $10.3 million in operating cash flow to 2001. The purchase price totaling approximately $315.6 million was allocated to specific assets and liabilities based on certain estimates of fair values, resulting in approximately $302.4 million allocated to property and $13.2 million allocated to working capital items. This $315.6 million was comprised of non cash common stock consideration of $49.9 million and a non cash deferred tax gross up of $78.0 million and acquisition related fees and costs of $6.4 million. The deferred tax gross up pertains to the deferred income taxes attributable to the differences between the tax basis and the estimated fair value of the acquired oil and gas properties. We drilled 208 gross wells with a success rate of 87% in 2001 compared to 129 gross wells and an 86% success rate in 2000. Total capital expenditures were $453.4 million for 2001, including $181.3 million in cash and $49.9 million in common stock paid for Cody Company, compared to $122.6 million in 2000. Capital spent in drilling activity increased $39.5 million, with the largest activity increase coming in the Gulf Coast region, where we continued to develop the Etouffee, Augen and Lake Pelto prospects in south Louisiana and initiated new exploration in south Texas. We increased our spending for seismic data, both 2 D and 3 D, and lease acquisition costs both in the Gulf Coast and Rocky Mountains in order to evaluate and expand our drilling opportunities for 2001 and beyond. The largest portion of this spending occurred in December 2001. Total equivalent production for 2001 was 81.1 Bcfe, an increase of 21% over 2000. Of this increase, 12% resulted from drilling activity and the remaining 9% was a result of the production from the acquired Cody Company properties. At the end of 2001, our debt to total capitalization ratio was 53.1%, up slightly from the end of 2000. This result was achieved despite expending $181.3 million as cash consideration in the Cody acquisition which was sourced primarily by the issuance of $170 million in private placement Notes. During 2000, we improved our debt to total capitalization ratio from 61.1% at the end of 1999 to 52.6% at the close of 2000. This improvement was a result of several significant accomplishments. We sold 3.4 million shares of common stock in May 2000 for net proceeds of $71.5 million, of which $51.6 million was used to repurchase all of our preferred stock. The remaining proceeds, along with another $14.8 million from employee stock option exercises, were used to reduce debt and pay dividends. From year end 1999 to year end 2000, we reduced debt by $24 million. We remain focused on our strategies to grow through the drill bit, concentrating on the highest expected return opportunities, and from synergistic acquisitions. We believe these strategies are appropriate in the current industry environment, enabling us to add shareholder value over the long term. The preceding paragraphs, discussing our strategic pursuits and goals, contain forward looking information. Please read Forward Looking Information on page 32. FINANCIAL CONDITION Capital Resources and Liquidity Our capital resources consist primarily of cash flows from our oil and gas properties and asset based borrowing supported by oil and gas reserves. Our level of earnings and cash flows depends on many factors, including the price of natural gas and oil, our ability to find and produce hydrocarbons and our ability to control and reduce costs. Demand for 24 natural gas has historically been subject to seasonal influences characterized by peak demand and higher prices in the winter heating season. However, in the summer of 2000, our realized gas prices began to climb to unseasonably high levels and by January 2001, we realized the highest prices in the Companys history. Then in 2001, our realized natural gas price declined throughout the year to a low of $2.32 per Mcf in December. A mild winter and the economic recession may be contributing factors in the 2001 pricing volatility. The primary sources of cash during 2001 were funds generated from operations, proceeds from the issuance of Notes (see Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements) and, to a lesser extent, proceeds from the sale of stock. Funds were used primarily for exploration and development expenditures, including the acquisition of Cody Company in August 2001, and dividend payments. We had a net cash outflow of $1.9 million during 2001. The net cash inflow from operating activities of $250.4 million combined with the increase in debt of $124.0 million to substantially fund the $386.1 million of cash used for capital and exploration expenditures. Cash proceeds from the sales of non strategic assets and the sale of stock combined to provide an additional $14.6 million of cash flow. (In millions) 2001 2000 1999 Cash Flows Provided by Operating Activities $250.4 $119.0 $92.5 Cash flows provided by operating activities in 2001 were $131.4 million higher than in 2000 and cash flows provided by operating activities in 2000 were $26.5 million higher than in 1999. These improvements were primarily a result of increased revenues from higher realized commodity prices and to a lesser extent to increased natural gas and oil production. (In millions) 2001 2000 1999 Cash Flows Used by Investing Activities $(379.2) $(116.1) $(37.4) Cash flows used by investing activities in 2001 included the $181.3 million cash portion of the Cody Company acquisition. Additionally, capital spending for drilling and facilities increased $39.5 million, or 49%, from last year to $119.5 million. We drilled 208 gross wells, which represents a 61% increase over 2000. Cash flows used by investing activities in 2000 were attributable to capital and exploration expenditures of $119.2 million, offset by the receipt of $3.1 million in proceeds received from the sale of non strategic oil and gas properties. Cash flows used by investing activities in 1999 were attributable to capital and exploration expenditures of $93.7 million, offset by the receipt of $56.3 million in proceeds received from the sale of non strategic oil and gas properties. (In millions) 2001 2000 1999 Cash Flows Provided (Used) by Financing Activities $126.9 $3.0 $(55.6) Cash flows provided by financing activities in 2001 included the impact of issuing $170 million in a private placement of Notes in July 2001 used to partially fund the Cody Company acquisition. Partially offsetting this debt increase was the reduction to the balance outstanding on the revolving credit facility and the May 2001 prepayment of $16 million in debt that was due in May 2002. Cash flows provided by financing activities in 2000 included $85.1 million in proceeds received from the sale of common stock, both in a block trade and through the exercise of employee stock options. Of the proceeds, $51.6 million was used to repurchase all of the outstanding shares of preferred stock. Additional cash used in financing activities included $24 million used to reduce the year end debt balance to $269 million from $293 million in 1999 and cash used to pay dividends to stockholders. Cash flows used by financing activities in 1999 included $50 million used to reduce the year end debt balance to $293 million from $343 million in 1998 and cash used to pay cash dividends to stockholders. 25 We have a revolving credit facility with a group of banks, the revolving term of which runs to December 2003. The available credit line under this facility, currently $250 million, is subject to adjustment on the basis of the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves (as determined by the banks petroleum engineer) and other assets. Accordingly, oil and gas prices are an important part of this computation. Since the current price environment remains volatile, management can not predict how future price levels may change the banks long term price outlook. To reduce the impact of any redetermination, we strive to manage our debt at a level below the available credit line in order to maintain excess borrowing capacity. At year end, this excess capacity totaled $127 million, or 51% of the total available credit line. Management believes it has the ability to finance, if necessary, our capital requirements, including acquisitions. Oil and gas prices also affect the calculation of the financial ratios for debt covenant compliance. Please read Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a more detailed discussion of our revolving credit facility. In the event that the available credit line is adjusted below the outstanding level of borrowings, we have a period of 180 days to reduce our outstanding debt to the adjusted credit line. The revolving credit agreement also includes a requirement to pay down half of the debt in excess of the adjusted credit line within the first 90 days of any adjustment. Our 2002 interest expense is expected to be approximately $29.2 million, including interest on the $170 million 7.33% weighted average fixed rate notes used to partially fund the acquisition of Cody Company. In May 2001, a $16 million principal payment was made on the 10.18% Notes. This amount had been reflected as "Current Portion of Long Term Debt" on the balance sheet. Additionally, the final $16 million payment on these notes that was due in May 2002 was paid in May 2001 using existing capacity on the revolving credit agreement. Capitalization Our capitalization information is as follows: As of December 31, (In millions) 2001 2000 1999 Long Term Debt $393.0 $253.0 $277.0 Current Portion of Long Term Debt 16.0 16.0 Total Debt $393.0 $269.0 $293.0 Stockholders Equity Common Stock (net of Treasury Stock) $346.6 $242.5 $129.8 Preferred Stock 56.7 Total Equity 346.6 242.5 186.5 Total Capitalization $739.6 $511.5 $479.5 Debt to Capitalization 53.1% 52.6% 61.1% During 2001, dividends were paid on our common stock totaling $4.8 million. We have paid quarterly common stock dividends of $0.04 per share since becoming publicly traded in 1990. The amount of future dividends is determined by our Board of Directors and is dependent upon a number of factors, including future earnings, financial condition and capital requirements. In May 2000, we bought back all of the shares of preferred stock from the holder for $51.6 million. Since this stock had been recorded at a stated value of $56.7 million on our balance sheet, we realized a negative dividend to preferred stockholders of $5.1 million. We received net proceeds of $71.5 million from the sale of 3.4 million shares of common stock in a public offering primarily to fund this transaction. After repurchasing the preferred stock, the excess proceeds were used to reduce debt. 26 Capital and Exploration Expenditures On an annual basis, we generally fund most of our capital and exploration activities, excluding major oil and gas property acquisitions, with cash generated from operations. We budget these capital expenditures based on our projected cash flows for the year. The following table presents major components of our capital and exploration expenditures for the three years ended December 31, 2001. (In millions) 2001 2000 1999 Capital Expenditures Drilling and Facilities $119.5 $ 80.0 $43.9 Leasehold Acquisitions 12.9 10.9 7.2 Pipeline and Gathering 3.8 3.2 3.8 Other 1.9 2.6 3.3 138.1 96.7 58.2 Proved Property Acquisitions 244.1/(1)/ 6.0 18.4 Exploration Expenses 71.2 19.9 11.5 Total $453.4 $122.6 $88.1 /(1)/ The 2001 amount includes the $49.9 million common stock component of the Cody acquisition and excludes the $78.0 million deferred tax gross up. See Note 14, Cody Acquisition. Total capital and exploration expenditures for 2001 increased $330.8 million compared to 2000, primarily as a result of the $231.2 million Cody acquisition. The remaining increase of $99.6 million was due primarily to increased drilling activity as well as increases in leasehold acquisitions costs consistent with our future drilling plans. The 2001 drilling program included an over 68% increase in net wells drilled and a $15.3 million increase in geological and geophysical expenses, including costs of obtaining seismic data that supports future drilling programs. We plan to drill 121 gross wells in 2002 compared with 208 gross wells drilled in 2001. This 2002 drilling program includes $104.6 million in total capital and exploration expenditures, down from $453.4 million in 2001, which was our largest capital program to date. Expected spending in 2002 includes $62.6 million for drilling and dry hole exposure, $7.8 million for lease acquisition and $9.9 million in geological and geophysical expenses. In addition to the drilling and exploration program, other 2002 capital expenditures are planned primarily for production equipment and for gathering and pipeline infrastructure maintenance and construction. We will continue to assess the natural gas price environment and may increase or decrease the capital and exploration expenditures accordingly. 27 Contractual Obligations We are committed to making cash payments in the future on two types on contracts: Note agreements and leases. We have no off balance sheet debt or other such unrecorded obligations and we have not guaranteed the debt of any other party. Below is a schedule of the future payments that we were obligated to make based on agreements in place as of December 31, 2001. Payments Due by Year 2003 2005 2007 & (in thousands) Total 2002 to 2004 to 2006 Beyond Long Term Debt /(1)/ $393,000 $ $123,000 $40,000 $230,000 Operating Leases /(2)/ 29,843 5,194 8,555 7,474 8,620 Total Contractual Cash Obligations $422,843 $5,194 $131,555 $47,474 $238,620 /(1)/ The $123 million shown as scheduled for payment in 2003 represents the December 31, 2001 balance outstanding on the revolving credit facility. Typically, we are able to replace this credit agreement with a new one as this comes due. See discussion in Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. /(2)/ A discussion of operating leases can be found in Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We have no capital leases. Potential Impact of Our Critical Accounting Policies Readers of this document and users of the information contained in it should be aware of how certain events may impact our financial results based on the accounting policies in place. The three most significant policies are discussed below. Commodity Pricing and Risk Management Activities Our revenues, operating results, financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital depend substantially on prevailing prices for natural gas and, to a lesser extent, oil. Declines in oil and gas prices may materially adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity, ability to obtain financing and operating results. Lower oil and gas prices also may reduce the amount of oil and gas that we can produce economically. Historically, oil and gas prices and markets have been volatile, with prices fluctuating widely, and they are likely to continue to be volatile. Depressed prices in the future would have a negative impact on our future financial results. In particular, substantially lower prices would significantly reduce revenue and could potentially impact the outcome of our annual impairment test under SFAS 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets" when adopted. Because our reserves are predominantly natural gas, changes in natural gas prices may have a particularly large impact on our financial results. The majority of production is sold at market responsive prices. Generally, if the commodity indexes fall, the price that we receive for our production will also decline. Therefore, the amount of revenue that we realize is partially determined by factors beyond our control. However, management may mitigate this price risk in a number of ways. Most recently, we have used financial instruments such as natural gas price collar arrangements to reduce the impact of declining pricing on our revenue. Under a price collar arrangement, there is also risk that the index prices will rise above the ceiling price and the Company will not be able to realize the full benefit of the market improvement. We covered 16% of our production in 2000 with natural gas price collar arrangements and prices rose above the ceiling during some months. If we had not had these collars in place in 2000, our realized natural gas price would have been $0.17 per Mcf higher. In 2001, we covered 35% of our natural gas production with price collar arrangements and prices were below the floor for several months. The gains from the 2001 price collars improved our annual realized natural gas price by $0.50 per Mcf. 28 Successful Efforts Method of Accounting We use the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas producing activities. Under this method, acquisition costs for proved and unproved properties are capitalized when incurred. Exploration costs, including seismic purchases and processing, exploratory dry hole drilling costs and costs of carrying and retaining unproved properties are expensed as incurred. During 2001, we drilled 30 exploratory wells and 18 of them were unsuccessful, adding $37.9 million to exploration expense. This 40% success rate for exploratory wells is not unusual, and as we focus more on our exploration program, we are exposed to the risk of dry hole expense. Development costs, including the costs to drill and equip development wells, and successful exploratory drilling costs to locate proved reserves are capitalized. We are also exposed to potential impairments if the book value of our assets exceeds their future expected cash flows. This may occur if a field discovers lower than anticipated reserves or if commodity prices fall below a level that significantly effects anticipated future cash flows on the field. We determine if an impairment has occurred through either adverse changes or as a result of the annual review of all fields. The impairment of unamortized capital costs is measured at a lease level and is reduced to fair value if it is determined that the sum of expected future net cash flows is less than the net book value. Oil and Gas Reserves The process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is inherently uncertain, and the reserve data included in this document are only estimates. Reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of natural gas and crude oil that cannot be measured in an exact manner. The process relies on interpretations of available geologic, geophysic, engineering and production data. The extent, quality and reliability of this technical data can vary. The process also requires certain economic assumptions, some of which are mandated by the SEC, such as oil and gas prices, drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes and availability of funds. The accuracy of a reserve estimate is a function of: . the quality and quantity of available data; . the interpretation of that data; . the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions; and . the judgment of the persons preparing the estimate. Our proved reserve information included in this document is based on estimates we prepared. Estimates prepared by others may be higher or lower than our estimates. Because these estimates depend on many assumptions, all of which may substantially differ from actual results, reserve estimates may be different from the quantities of natural gas and crude oil that are ultimately recovered. In addition, results of drilling, testing and production after the date of an estimate may justify material revisions to the estimate. You should not assume that the present value of future net cash flows is the current market value of our estimated proved natural gas and oil reserves. In accordance with SEC requirements, we base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves on prices and costs on the date of the estimate. Actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs as of the date of the estimate. Our rate of recording depreciation, depletion and amortization expense (DD&A) is dependent upon our estimate of proved reserves. If the estimates of proved reserves declines, the rate at which we record DD&A expense increases, reducing net income. Such a decline may result from lower market prices, which may make it non economic to drill for and produce higher cost fields. In addition, the decline in proved reserve estimates may impact the outcome of our annual impairment test under SFAS 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets" when adopted. 29 Operating Risks and Insurance Coverage Our business involves a variety of operating risks, including: . blowouts, cratering and explosions; . mechanical problems; . uncontrolled flows of oil, natural gas or well fluids; . fires; . formations with abnormal pressures; . pollution and other environmental risks; and . natural disasters. The operation of our natural gas gathering and pipeline systems also involves various risks, including the risk of explosions and environmental hazards caused by pipeline leaks and ruptures. The location of pipelines near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers and industrial sites, could increase these risks. Any of these events could result in loss of human life, significant damage to property, environmental pollution, impairment of our operations and substantial losses to us. In accordance with customary industry practice, we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these risks and losses. The occurrence of any of these events not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations. The costs of these insurance policies are somewhat dependent on our historical claims experience and also the areas in which we choose to operate. During the past few years, we have drilled a higher percentage of our wells in the Gulf Coast, where insurance rates are significantly higher than in other regions such as Appalachia. OTHER ISSUES AND CONTINGENCIES Corporate Income Tax. We generate tax credits for the production of certain qualified fuels, including natural gas produced from tight sands formations and Devonian Shale. The credit for natural gas from a tight sand formation (tight gas sands) amounts to $0.52 per Mmbtu for natural gas sold prior to 2003 from qualified wells drilled in 1991 and 1992. A number of wells drilled in the Appalachian region and Rocky Mountains during 1991 and 1992 qualified for the tight gas sands tax credit. The credit for natural gas produced from Devonian Shale is estimated to be $1.08 per Mmbtu in 2001. In 1995 and 1996, we completed three transactions to monetize the value of these tax credits, resulting in revenues of $2.0 million in 2001 and an estimated $2.1 million in 2002. See Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. We have benefited in the past and may benefit in the future from the alternative minimum tax (AMT) relief granted under the Comprehensive National Energy Policy Act of 1992 (the Act). The Act repealed provisions of the AMT requiring a taxpayers alternative minimum taxable income to be increased on account of certain intangible drilling costs (IDC) and percentage depletion deductions. The repeal of these provisions generally applies to taxable years beginning after 1992. The repeal of the excess IDC preference can not reduce a taxpayers alternative minimum taxable income by more than 40% of the amount of such income determined without regard to the repeal of such preference. Regulations. Our operations are subject to various types of regulation by federal, state and local authorities. See Regulation of Oil and Natural Gas Production and Transportation and Environmental Regulations in the Other Business Matters section of Item 1 Business for a discussion of these regulations. Restrictive Covenants. Our ability to incur debt and to make certain types of investments is subject to certain restrictive covenants in the Companys various debt instruments. Among other requirements, our Revolving Credit Agreement and the Notes (see Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements) specify a minimum annual coverage ratio of operating cash flow to interest expense for the trailing four quarters of 2.8 to 1.0. At December 31, 2001, the calculated ratio for 2001 was 10.0 to 1.0. In the unforeseen event that we fail to comply with these covenants, the Company may apply for a temporary waiver with the bank, which, if granted, would allow us a period of time to remedy the situation. See further discussion in Capital Resources and Liquidity and Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 30 CONCLUSION Our financial results depend upon many factors, particularly the price of natural gas and oil and our ability to market gas on economically attractive terms. The average produced natural gas sales price received by us has changed from year to year as follows: 2001: increased 37% over 2000 to $4.36 per Mcf 2000: increased 44% over 1999 to $3.19 per Mcf 1999: increased 3% over 1998 to $2.22 per Mcf 1998: decreased 15% from 1997 to $2.16 per Mcf 1997: increased 8% over 1996 to $2.53 per Mcf The volatility of natural gas prices in recent years remains prevalent in 2002 with wide price swings in day to day trading on the NYMEX futures market. Given this continued price volatility, we can not predict with certainty what pricing levels will be in the future. Because future cash flows are subject to these variables, there is no assurance that our operations will provide cash sufficient to fully fund our planned capital expenditures. While our 2002 plan now includes $104.6 million in capital and exploration spending, we will periodically assess industry conditions and adjust our 2002 spending plan to ensure the adequate funding of our capital requirements, including, if necessary, reductions in capital and exploration expenditures or common stock dividends. We believe our capital resources, supplemented with external financing if necessary, are adequate to meet our capital requirements. The preceding paragraphs contain forward looking information. See Forward Looking Information on page 32. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statements of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141 "Business Combinations" ("SFAS 141") and No. 142 "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" ("SFAS 142"). SFAS 141 requires all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 to be accounted for under the purchase method. For all business combinations for which the date of acquisition is after June 30, 2001, SFAS 141 also establishes specific criteria for the recognition of intangible assets separately from goodwill. SFAS 141 also requires unallocated negative goodwill (in a case where the purchase price is less than fair market value of the acquired assets) to be written off immediately as an extraordinary gain, rather than deferred and amortized. SFAS 142 changes the accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets after an acquisition. The most significant changes made by SFAS 142 are: 1) goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives will no longer be amortized; 2) goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives must be tested for impairment at least annually; and 3) the amortization period for intangible assets with finite lives will no longer be limited to forty years. The Company does not believe that the adoption of these statements will have a material effect on its financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. In June 2001, the FASB also approved for issuance SFAS 143 "Asset Retirement Obligations." SFAS 143 establishes accounting requirements for retirement obligations associated with tangible long lived assets such as wells and production facilities. SFAS 143 guidance covers (1) the timing of the liability recognition, (2) initial measurement of the liability, (3) allocation of asset retirement cost to expense, (4) subsequent measurement of the liability and (5) financial statement disclosures. SFAS 143 requires that an asset retirement cost should be capitalized as part of the cost of the related long lived asset and subsequently allocated to expense using a systematic and rational method. The Company will adopt the statement effective no later than January 1, 2003, as required. The transition adjustment resulting from the adoption of SFAS 143 will be reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. At this time, the Company cannot reasonably estimate the effect of the adoption of this statement on its financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. In August 2001, the FASB also approved SFAS 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long 31 Lived Assets" ("SFAS 144"). SFAS 144 replaces SFAS 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of." The new accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale applies to all long lived assets, including discontinued operations, and replaces the provisions of APB Opinion No. 30, "Reporting Results of Operations Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business", for the disposal of segments of a business. SFAS 144 requires that those long lived assets be measured at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell, whether reported in continuing operations or in discontinued operations. Therefore, discontinued operations will no longer be measured at net realizable value or include amounts for operating losses that have not yet occurred. SFAS 144 also broadens the reporting of discontinued operations to include all components of an entity with operations that can be distinguished from the rest of the entity and that will be eliminated from the ongoing operations of the entity in a disposal transaction. The provisions of SFAS 144 are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001 and, generally are to be applied prospectively. At this time, the Company cannot estimate the effect of this statement on its financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. * * * Forward Looking Information The statements regarding future financial and operating performance and results, market prices, future hedging activities, and other statements that are not historical facts contained in this report are forward looking statements.

Because they are not a part of our normal business, we have isolated their effects in the table above. These selected items for 2001 were as follows: . The change in derivative fair value 2001 related to the adoption of SFAS 133 on January 1, 2001. See Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. . A severance tax refund of $0.7 million ($1.1 million pre tax) was received in the third quarter for taxes 33 previously paid in Louisiana that recently qualified for the Severance Tax Relief Program as deep wells. . A total impairment of $4.2 million ($6.9 million pre tax) recorded in 2001. Two fields in the Gulf Coast region were impaired in the third quarter since the cost capitalized exceeded the future undiscounted cash flows. Also, one natural gas processing plant in the Rocky Mountains area was written down to fair market value. In the fourth quarter, the Starpath prospect in the Gulf Coast region was impaired. . As a result of the Enron bankruptcy, we recorded $1.4 million ($2.3 million pre tax) of bad debt expense primarily related to physical natural gas sales made to Enron in November 2001. These selected items for 2000 were as follows: . A $9.1 million impairment ($5.6 million after tax) was recorded on the Beaurline field in south Texas as a result of a casing collapse in two of the fields wells. . As a result of repurchasing all of the preferred stock at less than the book value, we recorded a $5.1 million negative stock dividend in May 2000. . Miscellaneous net revenue, primarily from the settlement of a natural gas sales contract, was recorded in the first quarter ($1.4 million after tax). See Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. . As a result of bankruptcy proceedings of two of our customers, we recorded $2.1 million in bad debt expense in the fourth quarter ($1.3 million after tax). . We announced the closure of the regional office in Pittsburgh in May 2000 and recorded costs of $1.0 million ($0.6 million after tax). These costs were recorded in the income statement categories that will receive the future savings benefit ($0.6 million in operations, $0.1 million in exploration and $0.3 million in administration). These selected items for 1999 were as follows: . We had a 15 year cogeneration contract under which we sold approximately 20% of our Western region natural gas per year. The contract was due to expire in 2008, but during 1999 we reached an agreement with the counterparty under which the counterparty bought out the remainder of the contract for $12 million. This transaction, completed in December 1999, accelerated the realization of any future price premium that may have been associated with the contract and added $12 million of pre tax other revenue ($7.3 million after tax). We simultaneously sold forward a similar quantity of Western region gas production through April 2001 at similar prices to those in the old contract. The natural gas sales price stated in this new contract was significantly below year end 2000 market prices in the region. See Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. . In the fourth quarter of 1999, we recorded impairments totaling $7 million on two of our producing fields in the Gulf Coast region ($4.3 million after tax). The Chimney Bayou field was impaired by $6.6 million due to a significant reserve revision on the Broussard Middleton #1R well in connection with a decline in its natural gas production accompanied by a marked increase in water production. The Broussard Middleton #1R was the only producing well in this field. The Lawson field was impaired by $0.4 million due to an unsuccessful workover on one of its wells. . We recorded a $4 million gain on the sale of certain non strategic oil and gas assets, most notably the Clarksburg properties in the Appalachian region sold to EnerVest effective October 1999 ($2.4 million after tax). . We recorded a $1.2 million reserve against other revenue for certain wells no longer deemed to be eligible for the Section 29 tight gas sands credit following an industry tax court ruling ($0.7 million after tax). Late in 1999, the FERC issued a rule proposal that may ultimately restore the eligibility for some or all of the wells in question. For an update on the FERCs actions, please read Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 34 2001 and 2000 Compared The following discussion is based on our results before taking into account the selected items discussed above. Net Income and Revenues. We reported net income in 2001 of $51.9 million, or $1.71 per share. During 2000, we reported net income of $30.2 million, or $1.10 per share. Operating income increased $28.5 million, or 38%, and operating revenues increased $80.6 million, or 22%, in 2001. The improvement in operating revenues was mainly a result of the $107.3 million rise in natural gas sales due to the increases in both natural gas prices and production, and the $22.0 million increase in crude oil sales revenue. Natural gas revenue and our realized price were bolstered by a $34.6 million gain on natural gas price collar arrangements used during 2001. See further discussion in Item 7A. These improvements were partially offset by a decline in brokered natural gas volume that reduced operating revenues by $50.4 million. Operating income was similarly impacted by these revenue changes. The average Gulf Coast natural gas production sales price rose $0.65 per Mcf, or 17%, to $4.44, increasing operating revenues by approximately $16.6 million. In the Western region, the average natural gas production sales price increased $1.02 per Mcf, or 36%, to $3.88, increasing operating revenues by approximately $26.7 million. The average Appalachian natural gas production sales price increased $1.72 per Mcf, or 53%, to $4.96, increasing operating revenues by approximately $29.9 million. The overall weighted average natural gas production sales price increased $1.17 per Mcf, or 37%, to $4.36 per Mcf in 2001. Natural gas production volume in the Gulf Coast region was up 11.5 Bcf, or 82%, to 25.6 Bcf primarily due to production from our discoveries in south Louisiana and production from the Cody Company properties acquired in August 2001. Natural gas production volume in the Western region was down 2.8 Bcf, or 10%, to 26.2 Bcf due primarily to lower levels of drilling activity in the Mid Continent area during the past three years. Natural gas production volume in the Appalachian region was down 0.4 Bcf, or 2%, to 17.4 Bcf, as a result of lower than anticipated success of the Oriskany drilling program in the region in late 2000 and into 2001. Total natural gas production was up 8.3 Bcf, or 14%, in 2001. Crude oil prices fell $1.90 per Bbl, or 7%, to $24.91, resulting in a decrease to operating revenues of approximately $3.6 million. The volume of crude oil sold in the year doubled to 1,908 Mbbls, increasing operating revenues by $25.6 million. This production increase was a result of our 2000 drilling success in south Louisiana (80% increase) and the acquisition of Cody Company (20% increase). Brokered natural gas revenue decreased $50.4 million, or 36%, from the prior year. The sales price of brokered natural gas rose 37%, resulting in an increase in revenue of $24.5 million. The volume of natural gas brokered this year declined by 53%, reducing revenues by $74.9 million. After including the related brokered natural gas costs, we realized a net margin of $2.9 million in 2001 compared to a net margin of $5.4 million in 2000. Excluding the selected items regarding the contract settlements in 2000, other operating revenues increased $1.6 million to $7.1 million. This increase in 2001 is primarily the result of a settlement received as a result of a lawsuit and increased revenue from the sale of natural gas liquids. Costs and Expenses. Total costs and expenses from operations, excluding the selected items related to the impairment of long lived assets and bad debt in each year and the costs associated with closing the regional office in Pittsburgh during 2000, increased $52.1 million, or 18%, from 2000 due primarily to the following: . Brokered natural gas cost decreased $47.9 million, or 35%, primarily due to the $73.0 million impact of the lower volume of brokered sales in 2001. This was partially offset by a $25.1 million increase due to higher natural gas costs compared to the prior year. . Production and pipeline expense increased $6.0 million, or 17%, primarily as a result of costs associated with operating the Cody Company properties acquired in August 2001. Additionally, increased staffing and insurance costs were incurred to support the expanded 2001 drilling program. On a units of production basis, our company wide production and pipeline expense was $0.51 per Mcfe in 2001 versus $0.53 per Mcfe in 2000 as a result of the increased production discussed above. 35 . Exploration expense increased $51.4 million, or 261%, primarily as a result of the following: . A $15.3 million increase in geological and geophysical expenses over last year due to the acquisition of seismic data for future evaluation and increased drilling activity in all regions. . A $34.9 million increase in dry hole costs. Although the drilling success rate improved from 86% in 2000 to 87% in 2001, we drilled a total of 208 gross wells in 2001, a 61% increase over 2000. We recorded seven exploratory dry holes in the higher cost Gulf Coast region versus only two in 2000. We also recorded four exploratory dry holes in the Rocky Mountains area and seven in the Appalachian region for a total of 18, up from a Company total of seven in 2000. . A $0.8 million increase for salaries, wages and incentive compensation largely attributable to increased staffing in the Gulf Coast region to support the expanded drilling program. . Depreciation, depletion, amortization and impairment expense, excluding the selected item related to the SFAS 121 impairment in each year, increased $30.6 million, or 53%, over 2000. Natural gas equivalent production increased 21%, increasing DD&A expense by $12.3 million. The 27% increase in the per unit expense from $0.86 per Mcfe to $1.09 per Mcfe was a result of increased production in the higher cost Gulf Coast region (including the newly acquired Cody properties) and resulted in an $18.3 million increase to DD&A expense for 2001. . General and administrative expenses increased $5.5 million, primarily as a result of increased staffing during the transition period following the Cody Company acquisition and other staffing increases that support our larger operations. Additional cost increases were realized in incentive compensation programs as well as technology updates and related software maintenance. . Taxes other than income increased $6.4 million as a result of higher natural gas and oil revenues. Interest expense decreased $2.1 million due to a lower weighted average interest rate realized in 2001. This was despite the new Notes issued to partially fund the acquisition of Cody Company in August 2001. Income tax expense was up $10.2 million due to the comparable increase in earnings before income tax. Our effective tax rate decreased in 2001 reflecting a shift of activity between states. 2000 and 1999 Compared The following discussion is based on our results before taking into account the selected items discussed above. Net Income and Revenues. We reported net income in 2000 of $30.2 million, or $1.10 per share. During 1999, we reported net income of $0.4 million, or $0.02 per share. Operating income increased $42.9 million, or 135%, and operating revenues increased $83.1 million, or 29%, in 2000. The improvement in operating revenues was mainly a result of the $48.7 million rise in natural gas sales due to the increase in gas prices, and the $24.5 million increase in brokered natural gas sales revenue. Operating revenues were reduced by a $10 million loss on natural gas price collar arrangements used during 2000. See further discussion in Item 7A. Price and production volume increases in crude oil also contributed to the higher operating revenues. Operating income was similarly impacted by these revenue changes. The average Gulf Coast natural gas production sales price rose $1.50 per Mcf, or 66%, to $3.79, increasing operating revenues by approximately $21.2 million. In the Western region, the average natural gas production sales price increased $0.90 per Mcf, or 46%, to $2.86, increasing operating revenues by approximately $24.9 million. The average Appalachian natural gas production sales price increased $0.71 per Mcf, or 28%, to $3.24, increasing operating revenues by approximately $12.7 million. The overall weighted average natural gas production sales price increased $0.97 per Mcf, or 44%, to $3.19, increasing revenues by $58.8 million. Natural gas production volume in the Gulf Coast region was down 1.4 Bcf, or 9%, to 14.1 Bcf primarily due to production difficulties in the Beaurline field and delays in bringing new production on line in south Louisiana. Natural gas production volume in the Western region was down 0.3 Bcf to 29.0 Bcf due primarily to lower levels of drilling activity in the Mid Continent area during 1999 and 2000. Natural gas production volume in the Appalachian 36 region was down 2.9 Bcf to 17.8 Bcf, as a result of the sale of certain non strategic assets in the Appalachian region effective October 1, 1999, and a decrease in drilling activity in the region. Total natural gas production was down 4.6 Bcf, or 7%, generating a revenue decrease of $10.1 million in 2000. Crude oil prices rose $9.59 per Bbl, or 56%, to $26.81, resulting in an increase to operating revenues of approximately $9.2 million. The volume of crude oil sold in the year increased slightly to 953 Mbbls, increasing operating revenues by $0.4 million. Brokered natural gas revenue increased $24.5 million, or 21%, over the prior year. The sales price of brokered natural gas rose 52%, resulting in an increase in revenue of $48.5 million. The volume of natural gas brokered this year declined by 21%, reducing revenues by $24.0 million. After including the related brokered natural gas costs, we realized a net margin of $5.4 million in 2000. Excluding the selected items regarding the contract settlements in 2000, and the sales contract buyout and the Section 29 tax credit provision in 1999, other operating revenues increased $0.2 million to $5.5 million. Costs and Expenses. Total costs and expenses from operations, excluding the selected items related to the impairment of long lived assets in each year and the costs associated with closing the regional office in Pittsburgh during 2000, increased $40.2 million, or 16%, from 1999 due primarily to the following: . Brokered natural gas cost increased $23.5 million, or 21%, primarily due to the $46.5 million impact of higher purchased natural gas prices. This was partially offset by a $23.0 million reduction to purchased natural cost, the result of fewer brokered sales this year compared to the prior year. . Production and pipeline expense increased $1.9 million, or 6%, primarily as a result of costs associated with the expansion of the Gulf Coast regional office, both in staffing and office facilities. Additionally, operational costs for surface equipment and compressor maintenance were up in the Rocky Mountains area where we drilled 50% more net wells in 2000 compared to 1999. On a units of production basis, our company wide production and pipeline expense was $0.53 per Mcfe in 2000 versus $0.47 per Mcfe in 1999. . Exploration expense increased $8.3 million, or 72%, primarily as a result of the following: . A $3.5 million increase in geological and geophysical expenses over last year due to increased drilling activity in all regions. . A $1.3 million increase in delay rental costs over last year largely due to delays in scheduled drilling projects in the Gulf Coast region. . A $2.1 million increase for salaries, wages and incentive compensation largely attributable to increased staffing in the Gulf Coast region to support the expanded drilling program. . A $0.5 million increase in dry hole costs. Although the drilling success rate improved from 84% in 1999 to 86% in 2000, we recorded two exploratory dry holes in the higher cost Gulf Coast region versus only one in 1999. . Depreciation, depletion, amortization and impairment expense, excluding the selected item related to the SFAS 121 impairment in each year, increased $0.5 million, or 1%, over 1999. A 6% decrease in total natural gas equivalent production caused the expense to remain just slightly above last years level, despite the 7% increase in the per unit expense to $0.86 per Mcfe. . General and administrative expenses remained at the same level as in 1999. . Taxes other than income increased $6.1 million as a result of higher natural gas and oil revenues. Interest expense decreased $2.9 million primarily due to lower average levels of borrowing on the revolving credit facility. Income tax expense was up $18.1 million due to the comparable increase in earnings before income tax. No significant asset sale activity occurred in 2000. Gain on the sale of assets was $4 million for 1999. These gains are the result of the non strategic asset divestitures, primarily the sale of the Clarksburg properties in the 37 Appalachian region to EnerVest effective October 1999. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Oil and gas prices fluctuate widely, and low prices for an extended period of time are likely to have a material adverse impact on our business. Our revenues, operating results, financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital depend substantially on prevailing prices for natural gas and, to a lesser extent, oil. Declines in oil and natural gas prices may materially adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity, ability to obtain financing and operating results. Lower oil and gas prices also may reduce the amount of oil and gas that we can produce economically. Historically, oil and gas prices and markets have been volatile, with prices fluctuating widely, and they are likely to continue to be volatile. Oil and gas prices declined substantially in 1998 and early 1999, moved higher through 2000 and into 2001 before declining back to year end 1998 levels in October 2001. Because our reserves are predominantly natural gas, changes in natural gas prices may have a particularly significant impact on our financial results. Prices for oil and natural gas are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil and gas, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control. These factors include: . The domestic and foreign supply of oil and natural gas. . The level of consumer product demand. . Weather conditions. . Political conditions in oil producing regions, including the Middle East. . The ability of the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to agree to and maintain oil price and production controls. . The price of foreign imports. . Actions of governmental authorities. . Domestic and foreign governmental regulations. . The price, availability and acceptance of alternative fuels. . Overall economic conditions. These factors make it impossible to predict with any certainty the future prices of oil and gas. Our hedging policy is designed to reduce the risk of price volatility for our production in the natural gas, natural gas liquids and crude oil markets. Currently we are focusing on protection from natural gas price declines, particularly in light of our capital spending plans. A hedging committee that consists of members of senior management overseas our hedging activity. Our hedging arrangements apply to only a portion of our production and provide only partial price protection against declines in oil and gas prices. These hedging arrangements may expose us to risk of financial loss and limit the benefit to us of increases in prices. Please read the discussion below related to commodity price swaps and Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a more detailed discussion of our hedging arrangements. Commodity Price Swaps and Options Hedges on Production Swaps From time to time, we enter into natural gas and crude oil swap agreements with counterparties to hedge price risk associated with a portion of our production. These derivatives are not held for trading purposes. Under these price swaps, we receive a fixed price on a notional quantity of natural gas and crude oil in exchange for paying a variable price based on a market based index, such as the NYMEX gas and crude oil futures. During 2001, we fixed the price at an average of $3.75 per Mcf on quantities totaling 918 Mmcf, representing 1% of the Companys 2001 natural gas production. We did not have crude oil swap arrangements covering our production in 2001. During 2000, we fixed the price at an average of $4.54 per Mcf on quantities totaling 315 Mmcf, representing less 38 than 1% of the Companys 2000 natural gas production. The notional volume of the crude oil swap transactions was 364 Mbbls at a price of $22.67 per Bbl, which represented approximately 38% of our total oil production for 2000. During 1999, we fixed the price at an average of $2.88 per Mcf on quantities totaling 3,237 Mmcf, representing 5% of the Companys 1999 natural gas production. The notional volume of the crude oil swap transactions was 306 Mbbls at a price of $20.65 per Bbl, which represented approximately one third of our total oil production for 1999. The natural gas price swap arrangement that we entered into during the third quarter of 2000 covered a portion of production over the period of October 2000 through September 2003. However, the counterparty declared bankruptcy in December 2001. Based on the terms of the natural gas swap contract, this action resulted in the cancellation of the contract. At the time of cancellation, the contracts value was less than $0.2 million. As of the years ending December 31, 2001, and 2000, we had open natural gas price swap contracts on our production as follows: Natural Gas Price Swaps Volume Weighted Unrealized in Average Gain/(Loss) Contract Period Mmcf Contract Price (in $ millions) As of December 31, 2001 None As of December 31, 2000 Natural Gas Price Swaps on Production in: Full Year 2001 918 $3.75 $(2.8) Full Year 2002 678 3.11 (1.0) Full Year 2003 423 2.81 (0.5) Financial derivatives related to natural gas production reduced revenues by $0.8 million in 2001 and $0.3 million in 2000. We had no open oil price swap contracts outstanding on our production at December 31/st/ of 2001 or 2000. Financial derivatives related to crude oil reduced revenue by $2.2 million during 2000, but had no impact on 2001 results. Hedges on Production Options In December 2000, we believed that the pricing environment provided a strategic opportunity to significantly reduce the price risk on a portion of our production through the use of costless collars. Under the costless collar arrangements, if the index rises above the ceiling price, we pay the counterparty. If the applicable index falls below the floor, the counterparty pays us. The 2001 natural gas price hedges include several costless collar arrangements based on eight price indexes at which we sell a portion of our production. These hedges were in place for the months of February through October 2001 and covered 24,404 Mmcf, or 35%, of our natural gas production for the year. All indexes were within the collars during February and April, some fell below the floor during the period of March, and all indexes were below the floor from June through October, resulting in a $34.6 million cash revenue for the year. These gains contributed $0.50 per Mcf to our average realized natural gas price for 2001. During 2000, we used several costless collar arrangements to hedge a portion of our natural gas production. There were seven collar arrangements based on separate regional price indexes with a weighted average price floor of $2.74 per Mcf and a weighted average price ceiling of $3.38 per Mcf. These collars were in place during the months of April through October 2000. During this period, if the index rose above the ceiling price, we paid the counterparty. If the applicable index fell below the floor price, the counterparty paid us. These collars covered a total quantity of 9,909 Mmcf, or 16% of our annual production. In April and May 2000, the index prices all fell within the price collar and no settlements were made. In June 2000, all of the indexes rose above the ceiling prices and remained above the ceiling for the duration of the transaction resulting in a $10 million reduction to our realized revenue for the year. If these hedges had not been in place, our average realized natural gas price for 2000 would have been $0.17 per Mcf higher. 39 Again in December of 2001, we believed that the pricing environment provided a strategic opportunity to significantly reduce the price risk on a portion of our future production through the use of natural gas price collar arrangements. As of December 31, 2001, we had open natural gas price collar arrangements to hedge our production as follows: Natural Gas Price Collars Volume Weighted Unrealized in Average Gain/(Loss) Contract Period Mmcf Ceiling / Floor (in $ millions) As of December 31, 2001 Natural Gas Collars on Production in: First Quarter of 2002 12,082 $3.54/$2.68 Second Quarter of 2002 4,027 $3.54/$2.68 As of December 31, 2000 Natural Gas Costless Collars on Production in: First Quarter of 2001 5,274 $9.68/$5.59 Second Quarter of 2001 8,135 $9.68/$5.59 Third Quarter of 2001 8,224 $9.68/$5.59 Fourth Quarter of 2001 2,771 $9.68/$5.59 The natural gas price hedges open at December 31, 2001, noted above, included several collar arrangements based on nine price indexes at which we sell a portion of our production. These hedges are in place for the months of January through April 2002 and cover approximately 60% of our anticipated natural gas production during this period. A premium totaling $0.9 million was paid to purchase these collar arrangements. Hedges on Brokered Transactions We use price swaps to hedge the natural gas price risk on brokered transactions. Typically, we enter into contracts to broker natural gas at a variable price based on the market index price. However, in some circumstances, some of our customers or suppliers request that a fixed price be stated in the contract. After entering into these fixed price contracts to meet the needs of our customers or suppliers, we may use price swaps to effectively convert these fixed price contracts to market sensitive price contracts. These price swaps are held by us to their maturity and are not held for trading purposes. We entered into price swaps with total notional quantities of 1,295 Mmcf in 2000 and 3,572 Mmcf in 1999 related to our brokered activities, representing 3% and 7% respectively, of our total volume of brokered natural gas sold. We did not use price swaps on brokered transactions in 2001. As of the years ending December 31, 2000 and 2001, we had no open natural gas price swap contracts on brokered transactions. Financial derivatives related to natural gas reduced revenues by less than $0.1 million in 2000 and had no impact on revenue in 2001. We are exposed to market risk on these open contracts, to the extent of changes in market prices of natural gas and oil. However, the market risk exposure on these hedged contracts is generally offset by the gain or loss recognized upon the ultimate sale of the commodity that is hedged. Adoption of SFAS 133 We adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" (SFAS 133) on January 1, 2001. Under SFAS 133, the fair value of each derivative instrument is recorded as either an asset or liability on the balance sheet. At the end of each period, these instruments are marked to market. The gain or loss on the change in fair value is recorded as Other Comprehensive Income, a component of equity, to the extent that the derivative instrument is an effective hedge. Under SFAS 133, effectiveness is a measurement of how closely correlated the hedge instrument is with the underlying physical sale. For example, a natural gas price swap that converts Henry Hub index to a fixed price would be perfectly correlated, 40 and 100% effective, if the underlying gas was sold at the Henry Hub index. Any portion of the gains or losses that are considered ineffective under the SFAS 133 test are recorded immediately as a component of operating revenue on the statement of operations. When we adopted SFAS 133, we had two types of hedges in place. The first type was a cash flow hedge that set the price of a certain monthly quantity of natural gas sold in the Gulf Coast region through September 2003. Based on the index price strip, the impact of this hedge on January 1, 2001 was to record a Hedge Loss of $0.1 million and a charge to Other Comprehensive Income of $4.2 million. Correspondingly, a Hedge Liability for $4.3 million was established. This instrument was cancelled in December 2001 with the bankruptcy of the counterparty. No balance related to this hedge remains in Other Comprehensive Income. The second type of hedge outstanding at January 1, 2001 was a natural gas price costless collar agreement. We had entered into eight of these collars for a portion of our production at regional indexes for the months of February through October 2001. The collars had two components of value: intrinsic value and time value. Under SFAS 133, both components were valued at the end of each reporting period. Intrinsic value arises when the index price is either above the ceiling or below the floor for any period covered by the collar. If the index is above the ceiling for any month covered by the collar, the intrinsic value would be the difference between the index and the ceiling prices multiplied by the notional volume. In accordance with the initial SFAS 133 guidance, intrinsic value related to the current month would be recorded as a hedge loss (if the index is above the ceiling) or gain (if the index is below the floor). Starting in 2001 under amended guidance on SFAS 133, any changes in the intrinsic value component related to future months were recorded in Other Comprehensive Income, a component of stockholders equity on the balance sheet, rather than to the income statement to the extent that the hedge was proven to be effective. These natural gas price collars were considered to be highly effective with respect to the intrinsic value calculation, since they were tied to the same indexes at which our natural gas is sold. Also under SFAS 133, the time value component, a market premium/discount, was marked to market through the income statement each period. Since these collar arrangements were executed on the last business day of 2000, the net premium value at adoption on January 1, 2001 was zero. As of December 31, 2001, we had a series of nine natural gas price collar arrangements in place. In accordance with the latest guidance from the FASBs Derivative Implementation Group, we test the effectiveness of the combined intrinsic and time values and the effective portion of each will be recorded as a component of Other Comprehensive Income. Any ineffective portion will be recorded as a gain or loss in the current period. As of December 31, 2001, we have recorded $1.4 million of Other Comprehensive Income, a $0.1 million Unrealized Hedge Gain and a $1.5 million Hedge Asset. 41 Fair Market Value of Financial Instruments The estimated fair value of financial instruments is the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged currently between willing parties. The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheet for cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable approximate fair value. The Company uses available marketing data and valuation methodologies to estimate fair value of debt.
