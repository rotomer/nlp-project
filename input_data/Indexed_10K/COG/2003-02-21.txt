ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our results of operations and our present financial condition. Our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Form 10 K contain additional information that should be referred to when reviewing this material. Statements in this discussion may be forward looking. These forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, including those discussed below, which could cause actual results to differ from those expressed. Please read Forward Looking Information on page 31. We operate in one segment, natural gas and oil exploration and development. OVERVIEW Our financial results depend upon many factors, particularly the price of natural gas and our ability to market our production on economically attractive terms. Price volatility in the natural gas market has remained prevalent in the last few years. In early 2001, the NYMEX futures market reported unprecedented natural gas contract prices. We benefited from this market with our realized natural gas price reaching $5.66 per Mcf in December and $8.46 per Mcf in January 2001. When the NYMEX futures market was near its high on the last day of December 2000, we entered into a series of price collars that protected us from the subsequent price decline until their expiration in October 2001. (See the Commodity Price Swaps and Options discussion about hedging on page 36.) These price collar arrangements boosted 2001 revenue by $34.6 million, increasing the average realized natural gas price by $0.50 per Mcf. In 2002, natural gas prices rose throughout the year beginning with a $2.60 per Mcf price in January and ending with a December realized price of $4.17 per Mcf. This pattern is contrary to the pattern of prices declining throughout the year as seen in 2001. The tables below illustrate how natural gas prices have fluctuated over the course of 2001 and 2002. "Index" represents the Henry Hub index price per Mmbtu. The "2001" and "2002" price is the natural gas price per Mcf realized by us and it includes the impact of the natural gas price collar or swap arrangements: Natural Gas Prices by Month 2002 Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Index 2.61 2.03 2.39 3.40 3.36 3.37 3.26 2.95 3.27 3.72 4.13 4.13 2002 2.60 2.55 2.44 3.25 2.86 2.86 2.74 2.74 2.83 3.41 3.89 4.17 Natural Gas Prices by Month 2001 Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Index 9.91 6.22 5.03 5.35 4.87 3.73 3.16 3.19 2.34 1.86 3.16 2.28 2001 8.46 6.28 4.91 5.05 5.08 4.25 3.96 3.79 3.57 3.24 3.06 2.32 Prices for crude oil have followed a similar path as the commodity market fell through 2001 and rose during 2002.

This is down from the $1.56 per share, or $47.1 million, reported in 2001. The weaker price environment coupled with the impact of our hedge arrangements were the driving factors in this decline. Prices, including the impact of the hedge arrangements, fell 22 31% for natural gas and 4% for oil. Partially offsetting this negative price impact, natural gas production was up 7% and crude oil sales volumes were up 50% from last year. Overall, on a Mcfe basis, our production grew more than 12% over 2001. An 8% production increase was a result of the full year impact of the acquisition of Cody Company, which was effective August 1, 2001, and the remaining 4% resulted from our drilling activities. We drilled 108 gross wells with a success rate of 93% in 2002 compared to 208 gross wells and an 87% success rate in 2001. Total capital expenditures were $126.3 million in 2002 compared to $453.4 million for 2001, which included $181.3 million in cash and $49.9 million in common stock paid for Cody Company. Capital spent in drilling activity decreased $52.5 million from 2001, which remains our largest capital program to date. In previous years, our capital spending, excluding major acquisitions, used substantially all of our operating cash flow. In 2002, our capital and exploration expenditures were under this level, allowing us the reduce debt by $28.0 million. Our strategy in 2003 is anticipated to remain consistent with 2002. We believe our operating cash flow in 2003 will be sufficient to fund our capital and exploration budgeted spending of $154 million and again provide excess cash flow to reduce debt. At the end of 2002, our debt to total capitalization ratio was 51.0%, an improvement from 53.1% at the end of 2001. This improvement was primarily the result of the decrease in debt levels and occurred despite a $13.8 million reduction in the Other Comprehensive Income portion of equity. During 2000, we improved our debt to total capitalization ratio from 61.1% at the end of 1999 to 52.6% at the close of 2000. This improvement was a result of several significant accomplishments. We sold 3.4 million shares of common stock in May 2000 for net proceeds of $71.5 million, of which $51.6 million was used to repurchase all of our preferred stock. The remaining proceeds, along with another $14.8 million from employee stock option exercises, were used to reduce debt and pay dividends. From year end 1999 to year end 2000, we reduced debt by $24 million. We remain focused on our strategies to grow through the drill bit, balancing the higher risk higher reward exploration opportunities with an extensive development program, and from synergistic acquisitions. We plan to remain disciplined in our capital program while providing for growth potential. We believe these strategies are appropriate in the current industry environment, enabling us to add shareholder value over the long term. The preceding paragraphs, discussing our strategic pursuits and goals, contain forward looking information. Please read Forward Looking Information on page 31. FINANCIAL CONDITION Capital Resources and Liquidity Our capital resources consist primarily of cash flows from our oil and gas properties and asset based borrowing supported by oil and gas reserves. Our level of earnings and cash flows depends on many factors, including the price of natural gas and oil, our ability to find and produce hydrocarbons and our ability to control and reduce costs. Demand for natural gas has historically been subject to seasonal influences characterized by peak demand and higher prices in the winter heating season. However, in the summer of 2000, our realized gas prices began to climb to unseasonably high levels and by January 2001, we realized the highest prices in the Companys history. Then in 2001, our realized natural gas price declined throughout the year to a low of $2.32 per Mcf in December. In 2002, commodity prices rose throughout the year, with Decembers realized natural gas price up 60% from the January price. A mild winter and the economic recession may have been contributing factors in the 2001 pricing volatility, while a colder winter and the threat of potential military activity in the Middle East may have contributed to rising prices in 2002. The primary sources of cash during 2002 were funds generated from operations and, to a lesser extent, proceeds from the sale of non strategic assets and the sale of stock. Funds were used primarily for exploration and development expenditures, reductions to the level of borrowing on the revolving credit facility, and dividend payments. 23 We had a net cash outflow of $3.1 million during 2002. The net cash inflow from operating activities of $165.1 million was sufficient to fund the $143.4 million of cash used for capital and exploration expenditures and $21.7 million of the reduction to debt. Cash proceeds from the sales of non strategic assets and the sale of stock combined to provide an additional $8.1 million of cash flow. (In millions) 2002 2001 2000 Cash Flows Provided by Operating Activities $ 165.1 $250.4 $ 119.0 Cash flows provided by operating activities in 2002 were $85.3 million lower than in 2001. This decrease was the result of lower realized commodity prices combined with both an increase in accounts receivable and a decrease in accounts payable. Cash flows provided by operating activities in 2001 were $131.4 million higher than in 2000. This improvement was primarily a result of increased revenues from higher realized commodity prices and to a lesser extent to increased natural gas and oil production. (In millions) 2002 2001 2000 Cash Flows Used by Investing Activities $(138.6) $(379.2) $(116.1) Cash flows used by investing activities in 2002 were attributable to capital and exploration expenditures of $143.3 million, offset by the receipt of $4.7 million in proceeds received from the sale of non strategic oil and gas properties. Cash flows used by investing activities in 2001 included the $181.3 million cash portion of the Cody Company acquisition. Additionally, capital spending for drilling and facilities increased $39.5 million, or 49%, from 2001 to $119.5 million. We drilled 208 gross wells, which represents a 61% increase over 2000. Cash flows used by investing activities in 2000 were attributable to capital and exploration expenditures of $119.2 million, offset by the receipt of $3.1 million in proceeds received from the sale of non strategic oil and gas properties. (In millions) 2002 2001 2000 Cash Flows Provided (Used) by Financing Activities $(29.6) $126.9 $ 3.0 Cash flows used by financing activities in 2002 included $28 million used to reduce the year end debt balance to $365 million from $393 million in 2001 and cash used to pay cash dividends to stockholders. Cash flows provided by financing activities in 2001 included the impact of issuing $170 million in a private placement of Notes in July 2001 used to partially fund the Cody Company acquisition. Partially offsetting this debt increase was the reduction to the balance outstanding on the revolving credit facility and the May 2001 prepayment of $16 million in debt that was due in May 2002. Cash flows provided by financing activities in 2000 included $85.1 million in proceeds received from the sale of common stock, both in a block trade and through the exercise of employee stock options. Of the proceeds, $51.6 million was used to repurchase all of the outstanding shares of preferred stock. Additional cash used in financing activities included $24 million used to reduce the year end debt balance to $269 million from $293 million in 1999 and cash used to pay dividends to stockholders. We have a revolving credit facility with a group of banks, the revolving term of which runs to October 2006. The available credit line under this facility, currently $250 million, is subject to adjustment on the basis of the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves (as determined by the banks petroleum engineer) and other assets. Accordingly, oil and gas prices are an important part of this computation. Since the current price environment remains volatile, management can not predict how future price levels may change the banks long term price outlook. To reduce the impact of any redetermination, we strive to manage our debt at a level below the available credit line in order to maintain excess borrowing capacity. At year end, this excess capacity totaled $155 million, or 62% of the total available credit line. Management believes it has the ability to finance, if necessary, our capital requirements, including acquisitions. Oil and gas prices also affect the calculation of the financial ratios for debt covenant compliance. Please read Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a more detailed discussion of our revolving credit facility. 24 In the event that the available credit line is adjusted below the outstanding level of borrowings, we have a period of three months to reduce our outstanding debt to the adjusted credit line with a requirement to provide additional borrowing base assets or pay down one third of the excess during each of the three months. Our 2003 interest expense is expected to be approximately $23.6 million, including interest on the $170 million 7.33% weighted average fixed rate notes used to partially fund the acquisition of Cody Company. Capitalization Our capitalization information is as follows: As of December 31, (In millions) 2002 2001 2000 Long Term Debt $ 365.0 $ 393.0 $ 253.0 Current Portion of Long Term Debt 16.0 Total Debt $ 365.0 $ 393.0 $ 269.0 Stockholders Equity Common Stock (net of Treasury Stock) $ 350.7 $ 346.6 $ 242.5 Total Equity $ 350.7 $ 346.6 $ 242.5 Total Capitalization $ 715.7 $ 739.6 $ 511.5 Debt to Capitalization 51.0% 53.1% 52.6% During 2002, dividends were paid on our common stock totaling $5.1 million. We have paid quarterly common stock dividends of $0.04 per share since becoming publicly traded in 1990. The amount of future dividends is determined by our Board of Directors and is dependent upon a number of factors, including future earnings, financial condition and capital requirements. In May 2000, we bought back all of the shares of preferred stock from the holder for $51.6 million. Since this stock had been recorded at a stated value of $56.7 million on our balance sheet, we realized a negative dividend to preferred stockholders of $5.1 million. We received net proceeds of $71.5 million from the sale of 3.4 million shares of common stock in a public offering primarily to fund this transaction. After repurchasing the preferred stock, the excess proceeds were used to reduce debt. Capital and Exploration Expenditures On an annual basis, we generally fund most of our capital and exploration activities, excluding major oil and gas property acquisitions, with cash generated from operations. We budget these capital expenditures based on our projected cash flows for the year. The following table presents major components of our capital and exploration expenditures for the three years ended December 31, 2002. (In millions) 2002 2001 2000 Capital Expenditures Drilling and Facilities $ 67.0 $ 119.5 $ 80.0 Leasehold Acquisitions 4.8 12.9 10.9 Pipeline and Gathering 4.1 3.8 3.2 Other 1.4 1.9 2.6 77.3 138.1 96.7 Proved Property Acquisitions 8.8 244.1/(1)/ 6.0 Exploration Expenses 40.2 71.2 19.9 Total $ 126.3 $ 453.4 $ 122.6 (1) The 2001 amount includes the $49.9 million common stock component of the Cody acquisition and excludes the $78.0 million deferred tax gross up. See Note 14, Cody Acquisition. 25 Total capital and exploration expenditures for 2002 decreased $327.1 million compared to 2001. The spending in 2001 included the $231.2 million Cody acquisition. The remaining $95.9 million of the decrease was due to smaller drilling and geological and geophysical programs for 2002. In 2002, we drilled 108 gross wells compared to 208 gross wells drilled in 2001 representing a 48% decline in drilling activity. Also, the 2001 drilling program included a $15.3 million increase in geological and geophysical expenses over 2000, including costs of obtaining seismic data that supports future drilling programs. We plan to drill 180 gross wells in 2003 compared with 108 gross wells drilled in 2002. This 2003 drilling program includes $153.9 million in total capital and exploration expenditures, up from $126.3 million in 2002. Expected spending in 2003 includes $88.9 million for drilling and dry hole exposure, $10.8 million for lease acquisition and $12.9 million in geological and geophysical expenses. In addition to the drilling and exploration program, other 2003 capital expenditures are planned primarily for production equipment and for gathering and pipeline infrastructure maintenance and construction. We will continue to assess the commodity price environment and may increase or decrease the capital and exploration expenditures accordingly so as to not jeopardize our economic returns. Contractual Obligations We are committed to making cash payments in the future on two types on contracts: Note agreements and leases. We have no off balance sheet debt or other such unrecorded obligations and we have not guaranteed the debt of any other party. Below is a schedule of the future payments that we were obligated to make based on agreements in place as of December 31, 2002. Payments Due by Year 2004 2006 2008 & (in thousands) Total 2003 to 2005 to 2007 Beyond Long Term Debt /(1)/ $365,000 $ $20,000 $135,000 $210,000 Operating Leases /(2)/ 27,153 5,590 9,224 7,220 5,119 Total Contractual Cash Obligations $392,153 $5,590 $29,224 $142,220 $215,119 /1)/ $95 million of the amount shown as scheduled for payment in 2006 represents the December 31, 2002 balance outstanding on the revolving credit facility.

See discussion in Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. /(2)/ A discussion of operating leases can be found in Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We have no capital leases. Potential Impact of Our Critical Accounting Policies Readers of this document and users of the information contained in it should be aware of how certain events may impact our financial results based on the accounting policies in place. The three most significant policies are discussed below. Commodity Pricing and Risk Management Activities Our revenues, operating results, financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital depend substantially on prevailing prices for natural gas and, to a lesser extent, oil. Declines in oil and gas prices may materially adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity, ability to obtain financing and operating results. Lower oil and gas prices also may reduce the amount of oil and gas that we can produce economically. Historically, oil and gas prices and markets have been volatile, with prices fluctuating widely, and they are likely to continue to be volatile. Depressed prices in the future would have a negative impact on our future financial results. In particular, substantially lower prices would significantly reduce revenue and could potentially impact the outcome of our annual impairment test under SFAS 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets". Because our reserves are predominantly natural gas, changes in natural gas prices may have a particularly large impact on our financial results. The majority of our production is sold at market responsive prices. Generally, if the commodity indexes fall, the price that we receive for our production will also decline. Therefore, the amount of revenue that we realize is partially determined by factors beyond our control. However, management may mitigate this price risk with the 26 use of financial instruments. Most recently, we have used financial instruments such as price collar and swap arrangements to reduce the impact of declining prices on our revenue. Under both arrangements, there is also risk that the movement of the index prices will result in the Company not being able to realize the full benefit of a market improvement. We covered 16% of our production in 2000 with natural gas price collar arrangements and prices rose above the ceiling during some months. If we had not had these collars in place in 2000, our realized natural gas price would have been $0.17 per Mcf higher. In 2001, we covered 35% of our natural gas production with price collar arrangements and prices were below the floor for several months. The gains from the 2001 price collars improved our annual realized natural gas price by $0.50 per Mcf. During 2002, we hedged 57% of our natural gas production with a combination of price swaps and collars. The impact of these hedges reduced our 2002 realized natural gas price by $0.01 per Mcf. Also in 2002, 43% of our crude oil production was hedged with a series of price collars. The impact of these hedges reduced our realized crude oil price by $1.81 per Bbl in 2002. Successful Efforts Method of Accounting We use the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas producing activities. Under this method, acquisition costs for proved and unproved properties are capitalized when incurred. Exploration costs, including seismic purchases and processing, exploratory dry hole drilling costs and costs of carrying and retaining unproved properties are expensed as incurred. During 2002, we drilled nine exploratory wells and three of them were unsuccessful, adding $6.9 million to exploration expense. Additionally, we abandoned certain sections of exploration well bores that were not economical, in the amount of $3.9 million. This 67% success rate for exploratory wells is higher than our historical rate, and as we focus more on our exploration program, we are exposed to the risk of dry hole expense. Development costs, including the costs to drill and equip development wells, and successful exploratory drilling costs to locate proved reserves are capitalized. We are also exposed to potential impairments if the book value of our assets exceeds their future expected cash flows. This may occur if a field discovers lower than anticipated reserves or if commodity prices fall below a level that significantly effects anticipated future cash flows on the field. We determine if an impairment has occurred through either adverse changes or as a result of the annual review of all fields. The impairment of unamortized capital costs is measured at a lease level and is reduced to fair value if it is determined that the sum of expected future net cash flows is less than the net book value. For the year ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 we had impairment of long lived asset expense of $2.7 million, $6.9 million, and $9.1 million, respectively. Oil and Gas Reserves The process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is inherently uncertain, and the reserve data included in this document are only estimates. Reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of natural gas and crude oil that cannot be measured in an exact manner. The process relies on interpretations of available geologic, geophysic, engineering and production data. The extent, quality and reliability of this technical data can vary. The process also requires certain economic assumptions, some of which are mandated by the SEC, such as oil and gas prices, drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes and availability of funds. The accuracy of a reserve estimate is a function of: . the quality and quantity of available data; . the interpretation of that data; . the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions; and . the judgment of the persons preparing the estimate. Our proved reserve information included in this document is based on estimates we prepared. Estimates prepared by others may be higher or lower than our estimates. Because these estimates depend on many assumptions, all of which may substantially differ from actual results, reserve estimates may be different from the quantities of natural gas and crude oil that are ultimately recovered. In addition, results of drilling, testing and production after the date of an estimate may justify material revisions to the estimate. You should not assume that the present value of future net cash flows is the current market value of our 27 estimated proved natural gas and oil reserves. In accordance with SEC requirements, we base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves on prices and costs on the date of the estimate. Actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs as of the date of the estimate. Our rate of recording depreciation, depletion and amortization expense (DD&A) is dependent upon our estimate of proved reserves. If the estimates of proved reserves declines, the rate at which we record DD&A expense increases, reducing net income. Such a decline may result from lower market prices, which may make it non economic to drill for and produce higher cost fields. In addition, the decline in proved reserve estimates may impact the outcome of our annual impairment test under SFAS 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets", when adopted. Operating Risks and Insurance Coverage Our business involves a variety of operating risks, including: . blowouts, cratering and explosions; . mechanical problems; . uncontrolled flows of oil, natural gas or well fluids; . fires; . formations with abnormal pressures; . pollution and other environmental risks; and . natural disasters. The operation of our natural gas gathering and pipeline systems also involves various risks, including the risk of explosions and environmental hazards caused by pipeline leaks and ruptures. The location of pipelines near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers and industrial sites, could increase these risks. Any of these events could result in loss of human life, significant damage to property, environmental pollution, impairment of our operations and substantial losses to us. In accordance with customary industry practice, we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these risks and losses. The occurrence of any of these events not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations. The costs of these insurance policies are somewhat dependent on our historical claims experience and also the areas in which we choose to operate. During the past few years, we have drilled a higher percentage of our wells in the Gulf Coast, where insurance rates are significantly higher than in other regions such as the East. OTHER ISSUES AND CONTINGENCIES Corporate Income Tax. We generate tax credits for the production of certain qualified fuels, including natural gas produced from tight sands formations and Devonian Shale. The credit for natural gas from a tight sand formation (tight gas sands) amounts to $0.52 per Mmbtu for natural gas sold prior to 2003 from qualified wells drilled in 1991 and 1992. A number of wells drilled in the Eastern region and Rocky Mountains during 1991 and 1992 qualified for the tight gas sands tax credit. The credit for natural gas produced from Devonian Shale is estimated to be $1.10 per Mmbtu in 2002. In 1995 and 1996, we completed three transactions to monetize the value of these tax credits, resulting in revenues of $2.0 million in 2002. The tax credit wells were repurchased in December 2002 and therefore, no monetization revenue will be realized in 2003. See Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. We have benefited in the past and may benefit in the future from the alternative minimum tax (AMT) relief granted under the Comprehensive National Energy Policy Act of 1992 (the Act). The Act repealed provisions of the AMT requiring a taxpayers alternative minimum taxable income to be increased on account of certain intangible drilling costs (IDC) and percentage depletion deductions. The repeal of these provisions generally applies to taxable years beginning after 1992. The repeal of the excess IDC preference can not reduce a taxpayers alternative minimum taxable income by more than 40% of the amount of such income determined without regard to the repeal of such preference. Regulations. Our operations are subject to various types of regulation by federal, state and local authorities. See Regulation of Oil and Natural Gas Production and Transportation and Environmental Regulations in the Other Business Matters section of Item 1 Business for a discussion of these regulations. 28 Restrictive Covenants. Our ability to incur debt and to make certain types of investments is subject to certain restrictive covenants in the Companys various debt instruments. Among other requirements, our Revolving Credit Agreement and the Notes (see Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements) specify a minimum annual coverage ratio of operating cash flow to interest expense for the trailing four quarters of 2.8 to 1.0. At December 31, 2002, the calculated ratio for 2002 was 7.9 to 1.0 on both the Revolving Credit Agreement and the Notes. In the unforeseen event that we fail to comply with these covenants, the Company may apply for a temporary waiver with the bank, which, if granted, would allow us a period of time to remedy the situation. See further discussion in Capital Resources and Liquidity and Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Limited Partnership. As part of the Cody acquisition, we acquired a interest in certain oil and gas properties in the Kurten field, as general partner of a partnership and as an operator. Our current interest in Kurten is approximately 25%, including a one percent interest in the partnership. Under the partnership agreement, we have the right to a reversionary working interest that would bring our ultimate interest to 50% upon the limited partner reaching payout. Under the partnership agreement, the limited partner has the sole option to trigger a liquidation of the partnership. Effective February 13, 2003, the Kurten partnership commenced liquidation at the limited partners election. In connection with the liquidation, an appraisal has been obtained to allocate the interest in the partnership assets. Based on the receipt of the appraisal in February 2003, we would not receive the reversionary interest as part of the liquidation. Due to the impact of the loss of the reversionary interest on future estimated net cash flows of the Kurten field, the limited partners decision and our decision to proceed with the liquidation, we performed an impairment review which resulted in an after tax charge of approximately $55 million. This impairment charge will be reflected in the first quarter of 2003 as an operating expense but will not impact the Companys cash flows. In addition, we will record a downward reserve revision of approximately 16 Bcfe as a result of the loss of the reversionary interest. CONCLUSION Our financial results depend upon many factors, particularly the price of natural gas and oil and our ability to market gas on economically attractive terms. The average produced natural gas sales price received by us, including the impact of derivatives, has changed from year to year as follows: 2002: decreased 31% from 2001 to $3.02 per Mcf 2001: increased 37% over 2000 to $4.36 per Mcf 2000: increased 44% over 1999 to $3.19 per Mcf 1999: increased 3% over 1998 to $2.22 per Mcf 1998: decreased 15% from 1997 to $2.16 per Mcf 1997: increased 8% over 1996 to $2.53 per Mcf The volatility of natural gas prices in recent years remains prevalent in 2003 with wide price swings in day to day trading on the NYMEX futures market. Given this continued price volatility, we can not predict what pricing levels will be in the future. Because future cash flows are subject to these variables, there is no assurance that our operations will provide cash sufficient to fully fund our planned capital expenditures. For these reasons, we periodically use derivative instruments to manage some of the price volatility. While our 2003 plan now includes $153.9 million in capital and exploration spending, we will periodically assess industry conditions and adjust our 2003 spending plan to ensure the adequate funding of our capital requirements, including, if necessary, reductions in capital and exploration expenditures or common stock dividends. We plan on remaining disciplined in our capital program. We believe our capital resources, supplemented with external financing if necessary, are adequate to meet our capital requirements.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In June 2001, the FASB approved for issuance SFAS 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations". SFAS 143 establishes accounting requirements for retirement obligations associated with tangible long lived assets, 29 including (1) the timing of the liability recognition, (2) initial measurement of the liability, (3) allocation of asset retirement cost to expense, (4) subsequent measurement of the liability and (5) financial statement disclosures. SFAS 143 requires that an asset retirement cost should be capitalized as part of the cost of the related long lived asset and subsequently allocated to expense using a systematic and rational method. The adoption of SFAS 143 resulted in (1) an increase of total liabilities, because more retirement obligations are required to be recognized, (2) an increase in the recognized cost of assets, because the retirement costs are added to the carrying amount of the long lived asset and (3) an increase in operating expense, because of the accretion of the retirement obligation and additional depreciation and depletion. The majority of the asset retirement obligations recorded by the Company relate to the plugging and abandonment of oil and gas wells. The Company adopted the statement on January 1, 2003. The transition adjustment resulting from the adoption of SFAS 143 will be reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in January 2003. The impact on the financial statements of adopting SFAS 143 is disclosed in Note 12, "Adoption of SFAS 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations", to the financial statements. In August 2001, the FASB also approved SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets". SFAS 144 replaces SFAS 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of." The new accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale applies to all long lived assets, including discontinued operations, and replaces the provisions of APB Opinion No. 30, "Reporting Results of Operations Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business", for the disposal of segments of a business. SFAS 144 requires that those long lived assets be measured at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell, whether reported in continuing operations or in discontinued operations. Therefore, discontinued operations will no longer be measured at net realizable value or include amounts for operating losses that have not yet occurred. SFAS 144 also broadens the reporting of discontinued operations to include all components of an entity with operations that can be distinguished from the rest of the entity and that will be eliminated from the ongoing operations of the entity in a disposal transaction. The provisions of SFAS 144 are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001 and, were adopted by the Company in 2002. The adoption of this statement did not impact the Companys financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. In April 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 145, "Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44 and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13 and Technical Corrections". SFAS 145, which is effective for fiscal years beginning after May 15, 2002, provides guidance for income statement classification of gains and losses on extinguishment of debt and accounting for certain lease modifications that have economic effects that are similar to sale leaseback transactions. The adoption of this statement did not impact the Companys financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities." SFAS 146 nullifies the guidance of the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 94 3, "Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring)." SFAS 146 requires that a liability for a cost that is associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred. SFAS 146 also establishes that fair value is the objective for the initial measurement of the liability. The provisions of SFAS 146 are required for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after December 31, 2002. The adoption of this statement did not impact the Companys financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure". SFAS 148 amends FASB Statement No. 123, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation", to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation. In addition, this Statement amends the disclosure requirements of Statement 123 to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on the reported results. The provisions of SFAS 148 are effective for financial statements for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2002. The adoption of this statement did not impact the Companys financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. See Note 10, "Capital Stock", to the financial statements. 30 In January 2003, the FASB issued Financial Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities an interpretation of ARB No. 51" (FIN 46 or Interpretation). FIN 46 is an interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin 51, "Consolidated Financial Statements", and addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities (VIEs). The primary objective of the Interpretation is to provide guidance on the identification of, and financial reporting for, entities over which control is achieved through means other than voting rights; such entities are known as VIEs. The Interpretation requires an enterprise to consolidate a VIE if that enterprise has a variable interest that will absorb a majority of the entitys expected losses if they occur, receive a majority of the entitys expected residual returns if they occur, or both. An enterprise shall consider the rights and obligations conveyed by its variable interests in making this determination. This guidance applies immediately to variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003, and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date. It applies in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after June 15, 2003, to variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before February 1, 2003. At this time we have only one entity that could potentially be a VIE. We are evaluating this potential VIE, in which we have a one percent general partner interest and that holds an interest in the Kurten field, to determine if it is a VIE. However, pursuant to the Partnership agreement, the limited partner has elected to liquidate the Partnership. It is anticipated that this liquidation will be completed prior to the effective date of the Interpretation. See "Limited Partnership" on page 29 for discussion related to the Cody acquisition. * * * Forward Looking Information The statements regarding future financial and operating performance and results, market prices, future hedging activities, and other statements that are not historical facts contained in this report are forward looking statements.

Selected Financial and Operating Data (In millions except where specified) 2002 2001 2000 Operating Revenues $ 353.8 $ 447.0 $ 368.7 Operating Expenses 304.9 351.7 303.8 Operating Income 49.1 95.4 64.8 Interest Expense 25.2 20.8 22.9 Net Income 16.1 47.1 29.2 Earnings Per Share Basic $ 0.51 $ 1.56 $ 1.07 Earnings Per Share Diluted $ 0.50 $ 1.53 $ 1.06 Natural Gas Production (Bcf) Gulf Coast 30.4 25.6 14.1 West 25.3 26.2 29.0 East 18.0 17.4 17.8 Total Company 73.7 69.2 60.9 Produced Natural Gas Sales Price ($/Mcf) Gulf Coast $ 3.34 $ 4.44 $ 3.79 West 2.39 3.88 2.86 East 3.38 4.96 3.24 Total Company $ 3.02 $ 4.36 $ 3.19 Crude/Condensate Volume (Mbbl) 2,869 1,908 953 Price ($/Bbl) $ 23.79 $ 24.91 $ 26.81 2002 and 2001 Compared Net Income and Revenues. During 2002, we reported net income of $16.1 million, or $0.51 per share. Operating income decreased $46.3 million, or 49%, and operating revenues decreased $93.3 million, or 21%, in 2002. The decrease in operating revenues was mainly a result of the $80.6 million decline in natural gas sales due to the 31% decrease in natural gas prices and the $32.0 million decrease in brokered natural gas sales revenue, which was also a result of lower prices. Natural gas revenue and our realized price were reduced by $0.6 million due to hedges in place during 2002. See further discussion in Item 7A. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in crude oil revenue of $20.0 million due to a 50% increase in the volume of crude oil produced. Operating income was similarly impacted by these revenue changes. The average Gulf Coast natural gas production sales price declined $1.10 per Mcf, or 25%, to $3.34, decreasing operating revenues by approximately $33.4 million. In the Western region, the average natural gas production sales price decreased $1.49 per Mcf, or 38%, to $2.39, decreasing operating revenues by approximately $37.7 million. The average Eastern natural gas production sales price decreased $1.58 per Mcf, or 32%, to $3.38, decreasing operating revenues by approximately $28.4 million. The overall weighted average natural gas production sales price decreased $1.34 per Mcf, or 31%, to $3.02 per Mcf in 2002. Natural gas production volume in the Gulf Coast region was up 4.8 Bcf, or 19%, to 30.4 Bcf primarily due to production from our discoveries in south Louisiana and production from the Cody Company properties acquired in August 2001. Natural gas production volume in the Western region was down 0.9 Bcf, or 3%, to 25.3 Bcf due primarily to a 29% decline in drilling activity, offset slightly by a 7% increase in the success rate. Natural gas production volume in the Eastern region was up 0.6 Bcf, or 3%, to 18.0 Bcf, as a result increased drilling activity in the region over the past year. Total natural gas production was up 4.5 Bcf, or 7%, in 2002. Crude oil prices fell $1.12 per Bbl, or 4%, to $23.79, resulting in a decrease to operating revenues of 32 approximately $3.2 million. The volume of crude oil sold in the year rose by 50% to 2,869 Mbbls, increasing operating revenues by $23.9 million. This production increase was a result of our 2000 and 2001 drilling success in south Louisiana (60% of the increase) and the acquisition of Cody Company (40% of the increase). Brokered natural gas revenue decreased $32.0 million, or 35%, from the prior year. The sales price of brokered natural gas declined 35%, resulting in a decrease in revenue of $31.3 million. The volume of natural gas brokered this year declined by 1%, reducing revenues by $0.7 million. In prior years, the revenues and expenses related to brokering natural gas were reported net on the Consolidated Statement of Operations as Brokered Natural Gas Margin. Beginning in 2000, these amounts are reported gross as part of Operating Revenues and Operating Expenses. After including the related brokered natural gas costs, we realized a brokered gas margin of $5.7 million in 2002 compared to a brokered gas margin of $2.9 million in 2001. Other operating revenues decreased $0.7 million to $6.4 million. In 2002, we provided for payout liabilities on certain properties not operated by us and certain estimated potential legal settlements. Costs and Expenses. Total costs and expenses from operations decreased $46.8 million, or 13%, from 2001 due primarily to the following: . Brokered natural gas cost decreased $34.8 million, or 40%, primarily due to the $34.1 million impact of decreased natural gas costs per Mcf. Volumes of brokered gas purchases decreased slightly contributing further to a reduction in the amount of $0.7 million. . Production and pipeline expense increased $8.8 million, or 21%, primarily as a result of a full year of costs associated with operating the Cody Company properties acquired in August 2001. Additionally, increased insurance costs and increased drilling activity in the Gulf Coast and Rockies contributed to the rise in expense. On a units of production basis, our company wide production and pipeline expense was $0.55 per Mcfe in 2002 versus $0.51 per Mcfe in 2001. . Exploration expense decreased $31.0 million, or 44%, primarily as a result of the following: . An $8.9 million decrease in geological and geophysical expenses over last year due to the unusually high 2001 acquisition of seismic data for future evaluation. . A $21.0 million decrease in dry hole costs. In 2002, we drilled nine exploratory wells compared to 27 in 2001. Our success rate on these wells improved from 44% in 2001 to 67% in 2002. The $16.9 million in dry hole cost recognized in 2002 includes expenditures related to three wells from the 2001 drilling program determined to be dry in 2002, in the amount of $6.9 million, as well as costs of abandoning certain sections of exploration well bores that were not economical, in the amount of $3.9 million. . A $0.8 million increase for salaries, wages and related benefits largely attributable to increased staffing in the Gulf Coast region during 2001 to support that years expanded drilling program and assimilating Cody. . Depreciation, depletion, amortization and impairment of unproved properties expense increased $17.4 million, or 20%, over 2001. Natural gas equivalent production increased 12%, increasing DD&A expense by $11.4 million. The 6% increase in the per unit expense from $1.09 per Mcfe to $1.16 per Mcfe was a result of increased production in the higher cost Gulf Coast region (including a full year impact of the newly acquired Cody properties) and resulted in an $5.6 million increase to DD&A expense for 2001. . Impairment of Long Lived Assets decreased by $4.1 million this year. This year we recorded impairments on four small fields, three of which were in the Gulf Coast and one in the Rocky Mountains. For each of these fields, the capitalized cost exceeded the future undiscounted cash flows. A pipeline in the Eastern region was written down to fair market value. Last year, two fields in the Gulf Coast region were impaired since the cost capitalized exceeded the future undiscounted cash flows. Also in 2001, one natural gas processing plant in the Rocky Mountains area was written down to fair market value. In the fourth quarter of 2001, the Starpath prospect in the Gulf Coast region was impaired. . General and administrative expenses increased $2.7 million due to the costs associated with the retirement of the chief executive officer in May 2002. . Taxes other than income decreased $3.6 million as a result of lower natural gas and oil revenues. Interest expense increased $4.4 million due to the full year impact of the incremental debt used to partially fund the Cody acquisition in August 2001. Interest expense on the credit facility was down slightly due both to lower 33 levels of borrowings and lower interest rates. Income tax expense was down $19.8 million due to the comparable decrease in earnings before income tax. Our effective tax rate decreased slightly in 2002 reflecting a shift of activity between states. 2001 and 2000 Compared Net Income and Revenues. We reported net income in 2001 of $47.1 million, or $1.56 per share. During 2000, we reported net income of $29.2 million, or $1.07 per share. Operating income increased $30.5 million, or 47%, and operating revenues increased $78.4 million, or 21%, in 2001. The improvement in operating revenues was mainly a result of the $107.3 million rise in natural gas sales due to the increases in both natural gas prices and production, and the $22.0 million increase in crude oil sales revenue. In 2001 our natural gas revenue and our realized price were bolstered by the use of collar arrangements resulting in a $0.50 per Mcf increase to our realized natural gas price. See further discussion in Item 7A. These improvements were partially offset by a decline in brokered natural gas volume that reduced operating revenues by $50.4 million. Operating income was similarly impacted by these revenue changes. The average Gulf Coast natural gas production sales price rose $0.65 per Mcf, or 17%, to $4.44, increasing operating revenues by approximately $16.6 million. In the Western region, the average natural gas production sales price increased $1.02 per Mcf, or 36%, to $3.88, increasing operating revenues by approximately $26.7 million. The average Appalachian natural gas production sales price increased $1.72 per Mcf, or 53%, to $4.96, increasing operating revenues by approximately $29.9 million. The overall weighted average natural gas production sales price increased $1.17 per Mcf, or 37%, to $4.36 per Mcf in 2001. Natural gas production volume in the Gulf Coast region was up 11.5 Bcf, or 82%, to 25.6 Bcf primarily due to production from our discoveries in south Louisiana and production from the Cody Company properties acquired in August 2001. Natural gas production volume in the Western region was down 2.8 Bcf, or 10%, to 26.2 Bcf due primarily to lower levels of drilling activity in the Mid Continent area during the past three years. Natural gas production volume in the Appalachian region was down 0.4 Bcf, or 2%, to 17.4 Bcf, as a result of lower than anticipated success of the Oriskany drilling program in the region in late 2000 and into 2001. Total natural gas production was up 8.3 Bcf, or 14%, in 2001. Crude oil prices fell $1.90 per Bbl, or 7%, to $24.91, resulting in a decrease to operating revenues of approximately $3.6 million. The volume of crude oil sold in the year doubled to 1,908 Mbbls, increasing operating revenues by $25.6 million. This production increase was a result of our 2000 drilling success in south Louisiana (80% increase) and the acquisition of Cody Company (20% increase). Brokered natural gas revenue decreased $50.4 million, or 36%, from the prior year. The sales price of brokered natural gas rose 37%, resulting in an increase in revenue of $24.5 million. The volume of natural gas brokered this year declined by 53%, reducing revenues by $74.9 million. After including the related brokered natural gas costs, we realized a net margin of $2.9 million in 2001 compared to a net margin of $5.4 million in 2000. Other operating revenues decreased $0.7 million to $7.1 million. In 2001, we received a $0.8 million settlement as a result of a lawsuit. In 2000, we realized miscellaneous net revenue of approximately $2.2 million primarily from the settlement of a natural gas sales contract. 34 Costs and Expenses. Total costs and expenses from operations increased $47.9million, or 16%, from 2000 due primarily to the following: . Brokered natural gas cost decreased $47.9 million, or 35%, primarily due to the $73.0 million impact of the lower volume of brokered sales in 2001. This was partially offset by a $25.1 million increase due to higher natural gas costs compared to the prior year. . Production and pipeline expense increased $5.5 million, or 15%, primarily as a result of costs associated with operating the Cody Company properties acquired in August 2001. Additionally, increased staffing and insurance costs were incurred to support the expanded 2001 drilling program. The 2000 expense includes $0.5 million related to the closure of the region office in Pittsburgh. On a units of production basis, our company wide production and pipeline expense was $0.51 per Mcfe in 2001 versus $0.53 per Mcfe in 2000 as a result of the increased production discussed above. . Exploration expense increased $51.3 million, or 258%, primarily as a result of the following: . A $15.3 million increase in geological and geophysical expenses over last year due to the acquisition of seismic data for future evaluation and increased drilling activity in all regions. . A $34.9 million increase in dry hole costs. Although the drilling success rate improved from 86% in 2000 to 87% in 2001, we drilled a total of 208 gross wells in 2001, a 61% increase over 2000. We recorded seven exploratory dry holes in the higher cost Gulf Coast region versus only two in 2000. We also recorded four exploratory dry holes in the Rocky Mountains area and seven in the Appalachian region for a total of 18, up from a Company total of seven in 2000. . A $0.8 million increase for salaries, wages and incentive compensation largely attributable to increased staffing in the Gulf Coast region to support the expanded drilling program. . Depreciation, depletion, amortization and impairment expense increased $30.6 million, or 53%, over 2000. Natural gas equivalent production increased 21%, increasing DD&A expense by $12.3 million. The 27% increase in the per unit expense from $0.86 per Mcfe to $1.09 per Mcfe was a result of increased production in the higher cost Gulf Coast region (including the newly acquired Cody properties) and resulted in an $18.3 million increase to DD&A expense for 2001. . Impairment of long lived assets decreased $2.3 million from 2000. In 2001, two fields in the Gulf Coast region were impaired since the cost capitalized exceeded the future undiscounted cash flows. Also in 2001, one natural gas processing plant in the Rocky Mountains area was written down to fair market value. In the fourth quarter of 2001, the Starpath prospect in the Gulf Coast region was impaired. During 2000, we recorded a $9.1 million impairment on one field in the Gulf Coast due to casing collapse in two of the fields wells. . General and administrative expenses increased $5.4 million, primarily as a result of increased staffing during the transition period following the Cody Company acquisition and other staffing increases that support our larger operations. Additional cost increases were realized in incentive compensation programs as well as technology updates and related software maintenance. . Taxes other than income increased $5.3 million as a result of higher natural gas and oil revenues. Interest expense decreased $2.1 million due to a lower weighted average interest rate realized in 2001. This was despite the new Notes issued to partially fund the acquisition of Cody Company in August 2001. Income tax expense was up $11.0 million due to the comparable increase in earnings before income tax. Our effective tax rate decreased in 2001 reflecting a shift of activity between states. 35 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Oil and gas prices fluctuate widely, and low prices for an extended period of time are likely to have a material adverse impact on our business. Our revenues, operating results, financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital depend substantially on prevailing prices for natural gas and, to a lesser extent, oil. Declines in oil and natural gas prices may materially adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity, ability to obtain financing and operating results. Lower oil and gas prices also may reduce the amount of oil and gas that we can produce economically. Historically, oil and gas prices and markets have been volatile, with prices fluctuating widely, and they are likely to continue to be volatile. Oil and gas prices declined substantially in 1998 and early 1999, moved higher through 2000 and into 2001 before declining back to year end 1998 levels in October 2001. Prices continued to decline for the remainder of 2001. From the end of 2001 through half of 2002 oil and gas prices were constant with an increase in prices during the fourth quarter. Because our reserves are predominantly natural gas, changes in natural gas prices may have a particularly significant impact on our financial results. Prices for oil and natural gas are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil and gas, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control. These factors include: . The domestic and foreign supply of oil and natural gas. . The level of consumer product demand. . Weather conditions. . Political conditions in oil producing regions, including the Middle East. . The ability of the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to agree to and maintain oil price and production controls. . The price of foreign imports. . Actions of governmental authorities. . Domestic and foreign governmental regulations. . The price, availability and acceptance of alternative fuels. . Overall economic conditions. These factors make it impossible to predict with any certainty the future prices of oil and gas. Our hedging policy is designed to reduce the risk of price volatility for our production in the natural gas, natural gas liquids and crude oil markets. A hedging committee that consists of members of senior management overseas our hedging activity. Our hedging arrangements apply to only a portion of our production and provide only partial price protection against declines in oil and gas prices. These hedging arrangements may expose us to risk of financial loss and limit the benefit to us of increases in prices. Please read the discussion below related to commodity price swaps and Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a more detailed discussion of our hedging arrangements. Commodity Price Swaps and Options Hedges on Production Swaps From time to time, we enter into natural gas and crude oil swap agreements with counterparties to hedge price risk associated with a portion of our production. These derivatives are not held for trading purposes. Under these price swaps, we receive a fixed price on a notional quantity of natural gas and crude oil in exchange for paying a variable price based on a market based index, such as the NYMEX gas and crude oil futures. Under our Revolving Credit Agreement, the aggregate level of commodity hedging must not exceed 80% of the anticipated future production during the period covered by the hedges. We did not have crude oil swap arrangements covering our production in 2000, 2001, or 2002. During 2002, we fixed the price at an average of $4.44 per Mcf on quantities totaling 7,870 Bcf, representing 11% of our 2002 natural gas production. During 2001, we fixed the price at an average of $3.75 per Mcf on quantities totaling 918 Mmcf, representing approximately 1% of our 2001 natural gas production. During 2000, we fixed the price at an average of $4.54 per Mcf on quantities totaling 315 Mmcf, representing less than 1% of our 2000 natural gas production. 36 As of the years ended December 31, 2002, and 2001, we had no crude oil swap contracts that qualified as hedges outstanding. We had open natural gas price swap contracts on our production as follows: Natural Gas Price Swaps Volume Weighted Unrealized in Average Loss Contract Period Mmcf Contract Price (In $ millions) As of December 31, 2002 Natural Gas Price Swaps on Production in: First Quarter of 2003 8,333 $ 4.44 Second Quarter of 2003 7,107 4.24 Third Quarter of 2003 7,186 4.24 Fourth Quarter of 2003 7,186 4.24 Full Year of 2003 29,812 4.29 $ 15,062 First Quarter of 2004 2,089 $ 4.42 Second Quarter of 2004 2,089 4.42 Third Quarter of 2004 2,112 4.42 Fourth Quarter of 2004 2,112 4.42 Full Year of 2004 8,402 4.42 $ 1,753 As of December 31, 2001 None Natural gas price swaps increased revenue by $0.9 million in 2002 and reduced revenue by $0.8 million in 2001. From time to time we enter into crude oil range swaps with counterparties. These derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS 133 and are recorded at fair value at the balance sheet date. We entered into two crude oil range swap arrangements as follows: . A fixed price swap at $28.15 per barrel, unless the NYMEX West Texas Intermediate monthly average price falls below $21.00 per barrel. If the NYMEX West Texas Intermediate monthly average price falls below $21.00 per barrel for any month, the swap is cancelled for that month. This instrument covers 730 Mbbls of production over the period January 2003 through December 2003. . A fixed price swap at $27.75 per barrel, unless the NYMEX West Texas Intermediate monthly average price falls below $21.00 per barrel. If the NYMEX West Texas Intermediate monthly average price falls below $21.00 per barrel for any month, the swap is cancelled for that month. This instrument covers 276 Mbbls of production over the period July 2003 through December 2003. The crude oil range swaps at December 31, 2002 had a pre tax unrealized loss in the amount of $0.7 million, which is reflected in crude oil operating revenue, and covered approximately 31% of our anticipated crude oil production during this period. We had no crude oil range swap contracts outstanding during 2001. In January 2003, we entered into a natural gas swap arrangement to reduce the price risk on an additional portion of our 2003 production. The swap arrangement is in place for the months of February through December 2003 with a fixed price of $5.39 per Mcf. This hedge covers 1,597 Mmcf of our anticipated natural gas production for the year. Hedges on Production Options In December 2001 and March 2002, we believed that the pricing environment provided a strategic opportunity to significantly reduce the price risk on a portion of our 2002 production through the use of a series of collars. Under the collar arrangements, if the index rises above the ceiling price, we pay the counterparty. If the applicable index falls below the floor, the counterparty pays us. The 2002 natural gas price hedges include several collar arrangements based on nine price indexes. The first series of natural gas price collars were in place for the months of January through April 2002 with a weighted average price floor of $2.68 per Mcf and a weighted average price ceiling of $3.53 per Mcf. These hedges covered 16,145 Mmcf, or 22% of our natural gas production for the 37 year. The second series of natural gas price collars were in place for the months of May through August 2002 with a weighted average price floor of $2.54 per Mcf and a weighted average price ceiling of $3.17 per Mcf. These hedges covered 18,284 Mmcf, or 25% of our natural gas production for the year. All indexes were within the collars during the month of January, all were below the floor for February through March, and most were above the ceiling in April through August, resulting in a cash expenditure of $1.4 million for the year. Overall, the natural gas collar and swap arrangements resulted in a reduction of $0.01 per Mcf to our average realized natural gas price for 2002. During 2001, we used several costless collar arrangements to hedge a portion of our 2001 natural gas production. The 2001 natural gas price hedges include several costless collar arrangements based on eight price indexes at which we sell a portion of our production. These hedges were in place for the months of February through October 2001 and covered 24,404 Mmcf, or 35%, of our natural gas production for the year. All indexes were within the collars during February and April, some fell below the floor during the period of March, and all indexes were below the floor from June through October, resulting in a $34.6 million cash revenue for the year. These gains contributed $0.50 per Mcf to our average realized natural gas price for 2001. Again in August 2002, we believed that the pricing environment provided a strategic opportunity to significantly reduce the price risk on a portion of our 2003 production through the use of natural gas price collar arrangements. As of the years ended December 31, 2002, and 2001, we had open natural gas price collar contracts on our production as follows: Natural Gas Price Collars Volume Weighted Unrealized in Average Loss Contract Period Mmcf Ceiling / Floor (In $ millions) As of December 31, 2002 Natural Gas Collars on Production in: First Quarter of 2003 2,066 $5.03/$4.36 Second Quarter of 2003 2,089 $5.03/$4.36 Third Quarter of 2003 2,112 $5.03/$4.36 Fourth Quarter of 2003 2,112 $5.03/$4.36 Full Year of 2003 8,379 $5.03/$4.36 $ 2,090 As of December 31, 2001 Natural Gas Costless Collars on Production in: First Quarter of 2002 12,082 $3.54/$2.68 Second Quarter of 2002 4,027 $3.54/$2.68 Full Year of 2002 16,109 $3.54/$2.68 The natural gas price collars open at December 31, 2002, noted above, included several collar arrangements based on two price indexes at which we sell a portion of our production. These hedges are in place for the full year of 2003 and cover approximately 11% of our anticipated natural gas production during this period. We also have crude oil collars open at December 31, 2002. These hedges are in place for the months of January through June 2003 with a weighted average price floor of $24.75 and a weighted average price ceiling of $28.86. These hedges cover approximately 11% of our anticipated crude oil production during this period. Crude oil collars reduced revenue by $5.2 million during 2002, but had no impact on 2001 results. Subsequent to year end we entered into a series of natural gas costless collar and natural gas and crude oil price swap arrangements to significantly reduce the price risk on a portion of our 2003 and 2004 production. These arrangements are as follows: . A natural gas costless collar in place for the months of February through December 2003 with a weighted average price floor of $4.71 per Mcf and a weighted average price ceiling of $5.98 per Mcf. This hedge covers 6,386 Mmcf of our anticipated natural gas production for the year. 38 . A natural gas costless collar in place for the full year of 2004 with a weighted average price floor of $4.33 per Mcf and a weighted average price ceiling of $5.42 per Mcf. This hedge covers 5,041 Mmcf of our anticipated natural gas production for the year. . A natural gas costless collar in place for the full year of 2004 with a weighted average price floor of $4.16 per Mcf and a weighted average price ceiling of $5.25 per Mcf. This hedge covers 3,346 Mmcf of our anticipated natural gas production for the year. . A natural gas costless collar in place for the months of March through December 2003 with a weighted average price floor of $3.91 per Mcf and a weighted average price ceiling of $5.08 per Mcf. This hedge covers 1,371 Mmcf of our anticipated natural gas production for the year. . A natural gas price swap in place for the months of March through December 2003 with a fixed price of $4.46 per Mcf. This hedge covers 1,371 Mmcf of our anticipated natural gas production for the year. . A fixed price swap at $30.00 per barrel, unless the NYMEX West Texas Intermediate monthly average price falls below $22.00 per barrel. If the NYMEX West Texas Intermediate monthly average price falls below $22.00 per barrel for any month, the swap is cancelled for that month. This instrument covers 92 Mbbls of production over the period July 2003 through December 2003. Adoption of SFAS 133 We adopted SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities", on January 1, 2001. Under SFAS 133, the fair value of each derivative instrument is recorded as either an asset or liability on the balance sheet. At the end of each period, these instruments are marked to market. The gain or loss on the change in fair value is recorded as Other Comprehensive Income, a component of equity, to the extent that the derivative instrument is an effective hedge. Under SFAS 133, effectiveness is a measurement of how closely correlated the hedge instrument is with the underlying physical sale. For example, a natural gas price swap that converts Henry Hub index to a fixed price would be perfectly correlated, and 100% effective, if the underlying gas were sold at the Henry Hub index. Any portion of the gains or losses that are considered ineffective under the SFAS 133 test are recorded immediately as a component of operating revenue on the statement of operations. When we adopted SFAS 133, we had two types of hedges in place. The first type was a cash flow hedge that set the price of a certain monthly quantity of natural gas sold in the Gulf Coast region through September 2003. Based on the index price strip, the impact of this hedge on January 1, 2001 was to record a Hedge Loss of $0.1 million and a charge to Other Comprehensive Income of $4.2 million. Correspondingly, a Hedge Liability for $4.3 million was established. This instrument was cancelled in December 2001 with the bankruptcy of the counterparty. No balance related to this hedge remains in Other Comprehensive Income. The second type of hedge outstanding at January 1, 2001 was a natural gas price costless collar agreement. We had entered into eight of these collars for a portion of our production at regional indexes for the months of February through October 2001. The collars had two components of value: intrinsic value and time value. Under SFAS 133, both components were valued at the end of each reporting period. Intrinsic value arises when the index price is either above the ceiling or below the floor for any period covered by the collar. If the index is above the ceiling for any month covered by the collar, the intrinsic value would be the difference between the index and the ceiling prices multiplied by the notional volume. In accordance with the initial SFAS 133 guidance, intrinsic value related to the current month would be recorded as a hedge loss (if the index is above the ceiling) or gain (if the index is below the floor). Starting in 2001 under amended guidance on SFAS 133, any changes in the intrinsic value component related to future months were recorded in Other Comprehensive Income, a component of stockholders equity on the balance sheet, rather than to the income statement to the extent that the hedge was proven to be effective. These natural gas price collars were considered to be highly effective with respect to the intrinsic value calculation, since they were tied to the same indexes at which our natural gas is sold. Also under SFAS 133, the time value component, a market premium/discount, was marked to market through the income statement each period. Since these collar arrangements were executed on the last business day of 2000, the net premium value at adoption on January 1, 2001 was zero. 39 As of December 31, 2001, we had a series of nine natural gas price collar arrangements outstanding. As of December 31, 2002 we had a series of 16 natural gas price swap arrangements, two natural gas price collar arrangements, two crude oil price collar arrangements, and two crude oil swap arrangements outstanding. In accordance with the latest guidance from the FASBs Derivative Implementation Group, we test the effectiveness of the combined intrinsic and time values and the effective portion of each will be recorded as a component of Other Comprehensive Income. Any ineffective portion will be recorded as a gain or loss in the current period. As of December 31, 2002, we had recorded $18.8 million of Other Comprehensive Income ($11.6 million net of deferred taxes), a $0.6 million Unrealized Hedge Loss in revenue, a $0.6 million Hedge Asset, and a $20.0 million Hedge Liability, exclusive of the crude oil range swaps. As of December 31, 2001, we had recorded $1.4 million of Other Comprehensive Income ($0.8 million net of deferred taxes), a $0.1 million Unrealized Hedge Gain in revenue and a $1.5 million Hedge Asset. Fair Market Value of Financial Instruments The estimated fair value of financial instruments is the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged currently between willing parties. The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheet for cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable approximate fair value. The Company uses available marketing data and valuation methodologies to estimate fair value of debt. This disclosure is presented in accordance with SFAS 107, "Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments" and does not impact our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
