ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our results of operations and our present financial condition. Our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Form 10 K contain additional information that should be referred to when reviewing this material. Statements in this discussion may be forward looking. These forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, including those discussed below, which could cause actual results to differ from those expressed. Please read Forward Looking Information on page 30. We operate in one segment, natural gas and oil exploration and development. OVERVIEW Cabot Oil & Gas is a leading independent oil and gas company engaged in the exploration, development and exploitation of natural gas and crude oil from its properties in North America. Our exploration activities are concentrated in areas with known hydrocarbon resources, which are conducive to large, multi well, repeatable drilling programs and our technical skills. Our program is disciplined and balanced with a focus on achieving strong financial returns. At Cabot, there are three types of investment alternatives that constantly compete for available capital. These include drilling opportunities, acquisition opportunities and financial opportunities such as debt repayment. Depending on circumstances, we allocate capital among the alternatives based on a rate of return approach. Our goal is to invest capital in the highest return opportunities available at any given time. Our financial results depend upon many factors, particularly the price of natural gas and our ability to market our production on economically attractive terms. Price volatility in the natural gas market has remained prevalent in the last few years. Throughout 2002 and 2003, the NYMEX futures market reported unprecedented natural gas contract prices. Our realized natural gas price was $4.51 per Mcf in 2003. To lock in these high prices, we entered into a series of crude oil and natural gas price collars and swaps. These financial instruments are an integral element of our risk management strategy but prevented us from realizing the full impact of the price environment. Commodity prices are impacted by many factors that are outside of our control. Historically, commodity prices have been volatile and we expect them to remain volatile. Commodity prices are affected by changes in market demands, overall economic activity, weather, pipeline capacity constraints, inventory storage levels, basis differentials and other factors. As a result, we cannot accurately predict future natural gas and crude oil prices, and therefore, we cannot determine what effect increases or decreases will have on our capital program, production volumes and future revenues. In addition to production volumes and commodity prices, finding and developing sufficient amounts of crude oil and natural gas reserves at economical costs are critical to our long term success. The tables below illustrate how natural gas prices have fluctuated over the course of 2002 and 2003. Index represents the Henry Hub index price per Mmbtu. The 2002 and 2003 price is the natural gas price per Mcf realized by us and it includes the impact of the natural gas price collar or swap arrangements: Natural Gas Prices by Month 2003 Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Index 4.96 5.66 9.11 5.14 5.12 5.95 5.30 4.69 4.93 4.44 4.45 4.86 2003 4.33 4.62 4.71 4.48 4.44 4.57 4.65 4.43 4.53 4.33 4.34 4.67 Natural Gas Prices by Month 2002 Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Index 2.61 2.03 2.39 3.40 3.36 3.37 3.26 2.95 3.27 3.72 4.13 4.13 2002 2.60 2.55 2.44 3.25 2.86 2.86 2.74 2.74 2.83 3.41 3.89 4.17 Prices for crude oil have followed a similar path as the commodity market continued to rise in 2002 and through 2003. The tables below contain the NYMEX average crude oil price (Index) and our realized per Bbl crude oil prices by month for 2002 and 2003. 20 Table of Contents (in $ per Bbl) Crude Oil Prices by Month 2003 Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Index 32.70 35.73 33.16 28.14 28.07 30.52 30.70 31.60 28.31 30.35 31.06 32.14 2003 29.81 31.47 31.35 29.65 29.18 28.95 30.11 28.82 26.46 27.17 29.43 32.93 (in $ per Bbl) Crude Oil Prices by Month 2002 Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Index 19.43 20.54 24.15 26.02 26.73 25.34 26.73 28.09 29.53 28.71 25.97 29.33 2002 18.56 20.11 22.93 24.27 24.40 23.92 24.14 24.70 26.03 25.57 24.19 25.79 We reported earnings of $0.66 per share, or $21.1 million, for 2003. This is up from the $0.51 per share, or $16.1 million, reported in 2002. The stronger price environment was the driving factor in this improvement. Prices, including the impact of the hedge arrangements, rose 49% for natural gas and 24% for oil. Substantially offsetting this positive price impact was an after tax impairment of $54.4 million related to our Kurten field (see Limited Partnership for discussion of the impairment) and a slight decline in natural gas and crude oil production. We drilled 173 gross wells with a success rate of 89% in 2003 compared to 108 gross wells with a 93% success rate in 2002. Total capital and exploration expenditures increased $61.9 million to $188.2 million in 2003 compared to $126.3 million for 2002. In previous years, our capital spending, excluding major acquisitions, used substantially all of our operating cash flow. In 2003, our capital and exploration expenditures were under this level, allowing us to reduce debt by $95.0 million. Our strategy in 2004 is anticipated to remain consistent with 2003. We believe our operating cash flow in 2004 will be sufficient to fund our capital and exploration budgeted spending of $207.4 million and again provide excess cash flow. We remain focused on our strategies to grow through the drill bit, balancing the higher risk higher reward exploration opportunities with an extensive development program, and from synergistic acquisitions. We plan to remain disciplined in our capital program while providing for growth potential. We believe these strategies are appropriate in the current industry environment, enabling us to add shareholder value over the long term. The preceding paragraphs, discussing our strategic pursuits and goals, contain forward looking information. Please read Forward Looking Information on page 30. FINANCIAL CONDITION Capital Resources and Liquidity Our capital resources consist primarily of cash flows from our oil and gas properties and asset based borrowings supported by our oil and gas reserves. The level of earnings and cash flows depends on many factors, including the price of crude oil and natural gas and our ability to control and reduce costs. Demand for crude oil and natural gas has historically been subject to seasonal influences characterized by peak demand and higher prices in the winter heating season. However, demand and prices moved higher, strengthening from the first half of 2002 into the summer and continued to strengthen through 2003. Prices in 2003 were the result of a higher demand associated with colder than normal winter temperatures, combined with higher storage injection demand in the second and third quarters. 21 Table of Contents Our primary source of cash during 2003 was from funds generated from operations and proceeds from the sale of certain non strategic assets. Cash was primarily used to fund exploration and development expenditures, reduce debt and pay dividends. We had a net cash outflow of $0.9 million during 2003. See below for additional discussion and analysis of cash flow. Year Ended December 31, 2003 2002 Variance Cash Flows Provided by Operating Activities 241,638 164,182 77,456 Cash Flows Used by Investing Activities (151,856 ) (138,668 ) (13,188 ) Cash Flows Used by Financing Activities (90,660 ) (27,364 ) (63,296 ) Net Increase (Decrease) in Cash and Cash Equivalents (878 ) (1,850 ) 972 Cash flow discussion and analysis: Cash flows from operating activities increased due to higher commodity prices partially offset by lower natural gas and crude oil production sales volumes. See Results of Operations for a review of the impact of prices and volumes on sales. Cash flows used in investing activities increased due to an increase in capital spending and exploration expense. Cash flows used in financing activities increased due to additional debt repayments. The available credit line under our revolving credit facility, currently $250 million, is subject to adjustment on the basis of the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves (as determined by the banks petroleum engineer) and other assets. At December 31, 2003, there was no outstanding balance due on the revolving credit facility. The revolving term of the credit facility ends in October 2006. We strive to manage our debt at a level below the available credit line in order to maintain excess borrowing capacity. Management believes that we have the ability to finance through existing available capacity or new debt or equity offerings, if necessary, our capital requirements, including acquisitions. In the event that the available credit line is adjusted below the outstanding level of borrowings, we have a period of three months to reduce our outstanding debt to the adjusted credit line with a requirement to provide additional borrowing base assets or pay down one third of the excess during each of the three months. Our 2004 interest expense is expected to be approximately $20.0 million. From time to time we enter into financial instruments to hedge our natural gas and crude oil production prices. While the mark to market positions under the hedging agreements will fluctuate with commodity prices, as a producer, our liquidity exposure due to its outstanding derivative instruments tends to increase when commodity prices increase. Consequently, we are most likely to have the largest unfavorable mark to market position in a high commodity price environment. At December 31, 2003, the aggregate mark to market liability under the aforementioned hedging agreements was $38.5 million. 22 Table of Contents Capitalization Our capitalization information is as follows: December 31, 2003 2002 (In millions) Debt $ 270.0 $ 365.0 Stockholders Equity 365.2 350.7 Total Capitalization $ 635.2 $ 715.7 Debt to Capitalization 43 % 51 % For the year ended December 31, 2003, we paid dividends of $5.0 million on our common stock. A regular dividend of $0.04 per share of common stock has been declared for each quarter since we became a public company. Capital and Exploration Expenditures On an annual basis, we generally fund most of our capital and exploration activities, excluding major oil and gas property acquisitions, with cash generated from operations. We budget these capital expenditures based on our projected cash flows for the year. The following table presents major components of our capital and exploration expenditures for the three years ended December 31, 2003. (In millions) 2003 2002 2001 Capital Expenditures Drilling and Facilities $ 102.0 $ 67.0 $ 119.5 Leasehold Acquisitions 14.1 4.8 12.9 Pipeline and Gathering 10.6 4.1 3.8 Other 1.8 1.4 1.9 128.5 77.3 138.1 Proved Property Acquisitions 1.5 8.8 (1) 244.1 Exploration Expense 58.2 40.2 71.2 Total $ 188.2 $ 126.3 $ 453.4 (1) The 2001 amount includes the $49.9 million common stock component of the Cody acquisition and excludes the $78.0 million deferred tax gross up. We plan to drill 276 gross wells in 2004 compared with 173 gross wells drilled in 2003. This 2004 drilling program includes approximately $207.4 million in total capital and exploration expenditures, up from $188.2 million in 2003. We will continue to assess the natural gas price environment and may increase or decrease the capital and exploration expenditures accordingly. There are many factors that impact our depreciation, depletion and amortization rate. These include reserve additions and revisions, development costs, impairments and changes in anticipated production in a future period. In 2004 management expects an increase in our depreciation, depletion and amortization rate due to production declines and reserve revisions on certain wells in south Louisiana. This change may result in an increase of depreciation, depletion and amortization of 10 to 15 percent greater than 2003 levels. This increase will not have an impact on our cash flows. 23 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations We are committed to making cash payments in the future on two types of contracts: note agreements and leases. We have no off balance sheet debt or other such unrecorded obligations, and we have not guaranteed the debt of any other party. Below is a schedule of the future payments that we were obligated to make based on agreements in place as of December 31, 2003. Payments Due by Year (in thousands) Total 2004 2005 to 2006 2007 to 2008 2009 &Beyond Long Term Debt $ 270,000 $ $ 40,000 $ 40,000 $ 190,000 Operating Leases 19,341 4,650 8,066 6,019 606 Total Contractual Cash Obligations $ 289,341 $ 4,650 $ 48,066 $ 46,019 $ 190,606 Non GAAP Financial Measures From time to time management discloses Discretionary Cash Flow and Net Income and Earnings Per Share, excluding selected items. These non GAAP financial measure calculations may be presented in earnings releases of the Company, furnished in Form 8 K to the Securities and Exchange Commission, along with reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP financial measure for the period. Discretionary Cash Flow is defined as Net Income plus non cash charges and Exploration Expense. Discretionary Cash Flow is widely accepted as a financial indicator of an oil and gas companys ability to generate cash which is used to internally fund exploration and development activities, pay dividends and service debt. Discretionary Cash Flow is presented based on managements belief that this non GAAP measure is helpful to investors when comparing our cash flow with the cash flow of other companies that use the Full Cost method of accounting for oil and gas producing activities or have different financing and capital structures or tax rates. Discretionary Cash Flow is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities, as defined by GAAP, or as a measure of liquidity, or an alternative to Net Income. Net Income excluding selected items and Earnings Per Share excluding selected items are presented based on managements belief that these non GAAP measures enable a user of the financial information to understand the impact of these items on reported results. Additionally, this presentation provides a beneficial comparison to similarly adjusted measurements of prior periods. Net Income and Earnings Per Share excluding selected items are not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to Net Income and Earnings Per Share, as defined by GAAP. Potential Impact of Our Critical Accounting Policies Readers of this document and users of the information contained in it should be aware of how certain events may impact our financial results based on the accounting policies in place. The three most significant policies are discussed below. Successful Efforts Method of Accounting We use the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas producing activities. Under this method, acquisition costs for proved and unproved properties are capitalized when incurred. Exploration costs, including seismic purchases and processing, exploratory dry hole drilling costs and costs of carrying and retaining unproved properties are expensed as incurred. An exploratory dry hole could have a significant effect on the results of operations. Development costs, including the costs to drill and equip development wells, and successful exploratory drilling costs to locate proved reserves are capitalized. We are also exposed to potential impairments if the book value of our assets exceeds their future expected cash flows. This may occur if a field discovers lower than anticipated reserves or if commodity prices fall below a level 24 Table of Contents that significantly effects anticipated future cash flows on the field. We determine if an impairment has occurred through either adverse changes or as a result of the annual review of all fields. The impairment of unamortized capital costs is measured at a lease level and is reduced to fair value if it is determined that the sum of expected future net cash flows is less than the net book value. Revenue Recognition The Company applies the sales method of accounting for natural gas revenue. Under this method, revenues are recognized based on the actual volume of natural gas sold to purchasers. Natural gas production operations may include joint owners who take more or less than the production volumes entitled to them on certain properties. Production volume is monitored to minimize these natural gas imbalances. Oil and Gas Reserves The process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is inherently uncertain, and the reserve data included in this document are only estimates. The process relies on interpretations of available geologic, geophysic, engineering and production data. The extent, quality and reliability of this technical data can vary. The process also requires certain economic assumptions, some of which are mandated by the SEC, such as oil and gas prices, drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes and availability of funds. The accuracy of a reserve estimate is a function of: the quality and quantity of available data; the interpretation of that data; the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions; and the judgment of the persons preparing the estimate. Our proved reserve information included in this document is based on estimates we prepared. Estimates prepared by others may be higher or lower than our estimates. Because these estimates depend on many assumptions, all of which may substantially differ from actual results, reserve estimates may be different from the quantities of natural gas and crude oil that are ultimately recovered. In addition, results of drilling, testing and production after the date of an estimate may justify material revisions to the estimate. You should not assume that the present value of future net cash flows is the current market value of our estimated proved natural gas and oil reserves. In accordance with SEC requirements, we base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves on prices on the date of the estimate. Our rate of recording depreciation, depletion and amortization expense (DD&A) is dependent upon our estimate of proved reserves. If the estimates of proved reserves declines, the rate at which we record DD&A expense increases, reducing net income. Such a decline may result from lower market prices, which may make it non economic to drill for and produce higher cost fields. In addition, the decline in proved reserve estimates may impact the outcome of our annual impairment test under SFAS 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. Carrying Value of Long Lived Assets We perform an impairment analysis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an assets carrying amount may not be recoverable. Cash flows used in the impairment analysis are determined based upon our estimates of proved crude oil, NGLs and natural gas reserves, future crude oil, NGLs and natural gas prices and costs to extract these reserves. Downward revisions in estimated reserve quantities, increases in future cost estimates or depressed crude oil, NGLs and natural gas prices could cause us to reduce the carrying amounts of its properties. Costs attributable to our unproved properties are not subject to the impairment analysis described above, however, a portion of the costs associated with such properties is subject to amortization on a composite basis based on past experience and average property lives. As these properties are developed and reserves are proven, the remaining 25 Table of Contents capitalized costs are subject to depreciation and depletion. If the development of these properties is deemed unsuccessful, the capitalized costs related to the unsuccessful activity is expensed in the year the determination is made. The rate at which the unproved properties are written off depends on the timing and success of the Companys future exploration program. Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities Periodically we enter into derivative commodity instruments to hedge our exposure to price fluctuations on natural gas and crude oil production. We follow the accounting prescribed in SFAS 133. Under SFAS 133, the fair value of each derivative instrument is recorded as either an asset or liability on the balance sheet. At the end of each period, these instruments are marked to market. The gain or loss on the change in fair value is recorded as Other Comprehensive Income, a component of equity, to the extent that the derivative instrument is an effective hedge. Under SFAS 133, effectiveness is a measurement of how closely correlated the hedge instrument is with the underlying physical sale. For example, a natural gas price swap that converts Henry Hub index to a fixed price would be perfectly correlated, and 100% effective, if the underlying gas were sold at the Henry Hub index. Any portion of the gains or losses that are considered ineffective under the SFAS 133 test are recorded immediately as a component of operating revenue on the statement of operations. Long Term Employee Benefit Costs Our costs of long term employee benefits, particularly pension and postretirement benefits, are incurred over long periods of time, and involve many uncertainties over those periods. The net periodic benefit cost attributable to current periods is based on several assumptions about such future uncertainties, and is sensitive to changes in those assumptions. It is managements responsibility, often with the assistance of independent experts, to select assumptions that in its judgment represent best estimates of those uncertainties. It also is managements responsibility to review those assumptions periodically to reflect changes in economic or other factors that affect those assumptions. The current benefit service costs, as well as the existing liabilities, for pensions and other postretirement benefits are measured on a discounted present value basis. The discount rate is a current rate, related to the rate at which the liabilities could be settled. Our assumed discount rate is based on average rates published for high quality fixed income securities. The benefit obligation and the periodic cost of postretirement medical benefits also are measured based on assumed rates of future increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits. As of December 31, 2003, the assumed rate of increase was 8.0%. The net periodic cost of pension benefits included in expense also is affected by the expected long term rate of return on plan assets assumption. The expected return on plan assets rate is normally changed less frequently than the assumed discount rate, and reflects long term expectations, rather than current fluctuations in market conditions. The actual rate of return on plan assets may differ from the expected rate due to the volatility normally experienced in capital markets. Managements goal is to manage the investments over the long term to achieve optimal returns with an acceptable level of risk and volatility. Additional information on the key assumptions underlying these benefit costs appears in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Stock Based Compensation In accordance with current accounting standards there are two alternative methods that can be used to account for stock based compensation. The first method is the Intrinsic Value method and recognizes compensation cost as the excess, if any, of the quoted market price of our stock at the grant date over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock. The second method is the Fair Value method. Under the fair value method, compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of an award and is recognized over the service period, which is usually the vesting period. Currently, we account for stock based compensation in accordance with the Intrinsic Value method. 26 Table of Contents OTHER ISSUES AND CONTINGENCIES Corporate Income Tax. We generated tax credits for the production of certain qualified fuels, including natural gas produced from tight sands formations and Devonian Shale. The credit for natural gas from a tight sand formation (tight gas sands) amounted to $0.52 per Mmbtu for natural gas sold prior to 2003 from qualified wells drilled in 1991 and 1992. A number of wells drilled in the Eastern region and Rocky Mountains during 1991 and 1992 qualified for the tight gas sands tax credit. The credit for natural gas produced from Devonian Shale was $1.09 per Mmbtu in 2002. In 1995 and 1996, we completed three transactions to monetize the value of these tax credits, resulting in revenues of $2.0 million in 2002. The tax credit wells were repurchased in December 2002 and therefore, no monetization revenue was realized in 2003. See Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. We have benefited in the past and may benefit in the future from the alternative minimum tax (AMT) relief granted under the Comprehensive National Energy Policy Act of 1992 (the Act). The Act repealed provisions of the AMT requiring a taxpayers alternative minimum taxable income to be increased on account of certain intangible drilling costs (IDC) and percentage depletion deductions. The repeal of these provisions generally applies to taxable years beginning after 1992. The repeal of the excess IDC preference can not reduce a taxpayers alternative minimum taxable income by more than 40% of the amount of such income determined without regard to the repeal of such preference. Regulations. Our operations are subject to various types of regulation by federal, state and local authorities. See Regulation of Oil and Natural Gas Production and Transportation and Environmental Regulations in the Other Business Matters section of Item 1 Business for a discussion of these regulations. Restrictive Covenants. Our ability to incur debt and to make certain types of investments is subject to certain restrictive covenants in the Companys various debt instruments. Among other requirements, our Revolving Credit Agreement and the Notes specify a minimum annual coverage ratio of operating cash flow to interest expense for the trailing four quarters of 2.8 to 1.0. At December 31, 2003, we are in compliance with all restrictive covenants on both the Revolving Credit Agreement and the Notes. In the unforeseen event that we fail to comply with these covenants, the Company may apply for a temporary waiver with the bank, which, if granted, would allow us a period of time to remedy the situation. See further discussion in Capital Resources and Liquidity. Limited Partnership. As part of the Cody acquisition, we acquired an interest in certain oil and gas properties in the Kurten field, as general partner of a partnership and as an operator. Prior to the liquidation of the partnership and the divestiture of our interest in the field, we had an interest of approximately 25%, including a one percent interest in the partnership. The liquidation and divestiture was effective July 31 and November 1, respectively, of 2003. Under the partnership agreement, we had the right to a reversionary working interest that would have brought our ultimate interest to 50% upon the limited partner reaching payout. Under the partnership agreement, the limited partner had the option to trigger a liquidation of the partnership. Effective February 13, 2003, the Kurten partnership commenced liquidation at the limited partners election. In connection with the liquidation, an appraisal was obtained to allocate the interest in the partnership assets. Based on the receipt of the appraisal in February 2003, we would not receive the reversionary interest as part of the liquidation. Due to the impact of the loss of the reversionary interest on future estimated net cash flows of the Kurten field, the limited partners decision and our decision to proceed with the liquidation, we performed an impairment review which resulted in an after tax charge of approximately $54.4 million. This impairment charge is reflected in the 2003 Statement of Operations as an operating expense but did not impact our cash flows. 27 Table of Contents Operating Risks and Insurance Coverage. Our business involves a variety of operating risks, including: blowouts, cratering and explosions; mechanical problems; uncontrolled flows of oil, natural gas or well fluids; fires; formations with abnormal pressures; pollution and other environmental risks; and natural disasters. The operation of our natural gas gathering and pipeline systems also involves various risks, including the risk of explosions and environmental hazards caused by pipeline leaks and ruptures. The location of pipelines near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers and industrial sites, could increase these risks. Any of these events could result in loss of human life, significant damage to property, environmental pollution, impairment of our operations and substantial losses to us. In accordance with customary industry practice, we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these risks and losses. The occurrence of any of these events not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations. The costs of these insurance policies are somewhat dependent on our historical claims experience and also the areas in which we choose to operate. During the past few years, we have drilled a higher percentage of our wells in the Gulf Coast, where insurance rates are significantly higher than in other regions such as the East. Commodity Pricing and Risk Management Activities. Our revenues, operating results, financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital depend substantially on prevailing prices for natural gas and, to a lesser extent, oil. Declines in oil and gas prices may materially adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity, ability to obtain financing and operating results. Lower oil and gas prices also may reduce the amount of oil and gas that we can produce economically. Historically, oil and gas prices and markets have been volatile, with prices fluctuating widely, and they are likely to continue to be volatile. Depressed prices in the future would have a negative impact on our future financial results. In particular, substantially lower prices would significantly reduce revenue and could potentially impact the outcome of our annual impairment test under SFAS 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. Because our reserves are predominantly natural gas, changes in natural gas prices may have a particularly large impact on our financial results. The majority of our production is sold at market responsive prices. Generally, if the commodity indexes fall, the price that we receive for our production will also decline. Therefore, the amount of revenue that we realize is partially determined by factors beyond our control. However, management may mitigate this price risk with the use of financial instruments. Most recently, we have used financial instruments such as price collar and swap arrangements to reduce the impact of declining prices on our revenue. Under both arrangements, there is also risk that the movement of the index prices will result in the Company not being able to realize the full benefit of a market improvement. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In June 2001, the FASB approved for issuance Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations. SFAS 143 establishes accounting requirements for retirement obligations associated with tangible long lived assets, including (1) the timing of the liability recognition, (2) initial measurement of the liability, (3) allocation of asset retirement cost to expense, (4) subsequent measurement of the liability and (5) financial statement disclosures. SFAS 143 requires that an asset retirement cost should be capitalized as part of the cost of the related long lived asset and subsequently allocated to expense using a systematic and rational method. The adoption of SFAS 143 resulted in (1) an increase of total liabilities, because more retirement obligations are required to be recognized, (2) an increase in the recognized cost of assets, because the retirement costs are added to the carrying amount of the long lived assets, and (3) an increase in operating expense, because of the accretion of the retirement obligation and additional depreciation and depletion. The majority of the asset retirement obligations recorded by the Company relate to the 28 Table of Contents plugging and abandonment of oil and gas wells. The Company adopted the statement on January 1, 2003. The transition adjustment resulting from the adoption of SFAS 143 has been reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in January 2003. In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure. SFAS 148 amends SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation. In addition, this statement amends the disclosure requirements of SFAS 123 to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on the reported results. The provisions of SFAS 148 are effective for financial statements for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2002. In January 2003, the FASB issued Financial Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities An Interpretation of ARB No. 51 (FIN 46 or Interpretation). FIN 46 is an interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin 51, Consolidated Financial Statements, and addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities (VIEs). The primary objective of the Interpretation is to provide guidance on the identification of, and financial reporting for, entities over which control is achieved through means other than voting rights; such entities are known as VIEs. The Interpretation requires an enterprise to consolidate a VIE if that enterprise has a variable interest that will absorb a majority of the entitys expected losses if they occur, receive a majority of the entitys expected residual returns if they occur or both. An enterprise shall consider the rights and obligations conveyed by its variable interests in making this determination. At December 31, 2003 we did not have any entities that would qualify for consolidation in accordance with the provisions of FIN 46. Therefore, the adoption of FIN 46 did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements. In April 2003 the FASB issued SFAS 149, Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. SFAS 149 amends and clarifies accounting for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and hedging activities under SFAS 133. The amendments set forth in SFAS 149 require that contracts with comparable characteristics be accounted for similarly. SFAS 149 is generally effective for contracts entered into or modified after June 30, 2003 (with a few exceptions) and for hedging relationships designated after June 30, 2003. The guidance is to be applied prospectively only. The adoption of SFAS 149 did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements. In May 2003 the FASB issued SFAS 150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity. This Statement establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. It requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability (or an asset in some circumstances). Many of those instruments were previously classified as equity. This statement was developed in response to concerns expressed by preparers, auditors, regulators, investors, and other users of financial statements about issuers&acute; classification in the statement of financial position of certain financial instruments that have characteristics of both liabilities and equity but that have been presented either entirely as equity or between the liabilities section and the equity section of the statement of financial position. This statement also addresses questions about the classification of certain financial instruments that embody obligations to issue equity shares. In accordance with SFAS 150, companies with consolidated entities that will terminate by a specified date, such as limited life partnerships, will have to measure the liabilities for the other owners interests in those limited life entities based on the fair values of the limited life entities assets. Period to period changes in the liabilities are to be reported in the consolidated income statement as interest costs. As a result of SFAS 150, liability amounts and related interest costs may be significantly greater than the minority interests previously recognized. This Statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003, and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after June 15, 2003. The adoption of this standard did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements. We have been made aware of an issue regarding the application of provisions of SFAS 141, Business Combinations and SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (SFAS 142 ) to companies in the extractive industries, including oil and gas companies. The issue is whether SFAS 142 requires registrants to reclassify costs associated with mineral rights, 29 Table of Contents including both proved and unproved leasehold acquisition costs, as intangible assets in the balance sheet, apart from other capitalized oil and gas property costs. Historically, Cabot and other oil and gas companies have included the cost of these oil and gas leasehold interests as part of oil and gas properties and provided the disclosures required by SFAS No. 69, Disclosures about Oil and Gas Producing Activities ( SFAS 69 ). Also under consideration is whether SFAS 142 requires registrants to provide the additional disclosures prescribed by SFAS 142 for intangible assets for costs associated with mineral rights. If it is ultimately determined that SFAS 142 requires us to reclassify costs associated with mineral rights from property and equipment to intangible assets, management currently believes that its results of operations and financial condition would not be affected, since such intangible assets would continue to be depleted and assessed for impairment in accordance with existing successful efforts accounting rules and impairment standards. In addition, costs associated with mineral rights would continue to be characterized as oil and gas property costs in our required disclosures under SFAS 69. At December 31, 2003, we had net undeveloped leaseholds of approximately $63.0 million that would be classified on our balance sheet as intangible undeveloped leaseholds and developed leaseholds of approximately $318.4 million (net of accumulated depletion) that would be classified as intangible developed leaseholds if we applied the interpretation currently being discussed. On December 23, 2003, the FASB issued SFAS 132, Employers Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits, an amendment of SFAS 87, 88, and 106, and a revision of SFAS 132. This statement revises employers disclosures about pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans. It does not change the measurement or recognition of those plans required by SFAS 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, SFAS 88, Employers Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits, and SFAS 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions. The new rules require additional disclosures about the assets, obligations, cash flows, and net periodic benefit cost of defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans. The required information should be provided separately for pension plans and for other postretirement benefit plans. The new disclosures are effective for 2003 calendar year financial statements. * * * Forward Looking Information The statements regarding future financial and operating performance and results, market prices, future hedging activities, and other statements that are not historical facts contained in this report are forward looking statements.

During the corresponding period of 2002, we reported net income of $16.1 million, or $0.51 per share. Operating income increased by $17.5 million compared to the comparable period of the prior year. The increase in net income and operating income was substantially due to an increase in our realized natural gas and crude oil prices. Natural Gas Production Revenues The average total company realized natural gas production sales price, including the realized impact of derivative instruments, was $4.51 per Mcf. Due to derivative instruments this price was reduced by $0.68 per Mcf. The following table excludes the unrealized impact of the change in derivative fair value for the year ended December 31, 2003 and 2002. These amounts have been included in the Natural Gas Production Revenues line item on the Statement of Operations. See Item 7A for a discussion of the realized and unrealized impact of derivative instruments on operating revenues.

The increase in the realized crude oil price combined with the decline in production resulted in a net revenue increase of $14.6 million. Other Net Operating Revenues Other operating revenues increased $3.6 million. This change was a result of an increase in plant revenue, transportation revenue and natural gas liquid revenue for the year ended December 31, 2003. Operating Expenses Total costs and expenses from operations increased $150.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to the year ended December 31, 2002. The primary reasons for this fluctuation are as follows: Brokered natural gas cost increased $33.2 million. For additional information related to this increase see the analysis performed for Brokered Natural Gas Revenue and Cost. Exploration expense increased $18.0 million as a result of higher dry hole expense in 2003. During 2003, we drilled 15 dry exploratory wells compared to 3 in the corresponding period of 2002. 33 Table of Contents Impairment of natural gas producing properties expense increased $91.1 million. This increase is substantially related to a pre tax non cash impairment charge of $87.9 million related to the loss of a reversionary interest in the Kurten field. Effective February 13, 2003, the Kurten partnership commenced liquidation at the limited partners election. In connection with the liquidation, an appraisal was obtained to allocate the interest in the partnership assets. Based on the receipt of the appraisal in February 2003, we would not receive the reversionary interest as part of the liquidation. Due to the impact of the loss of the reversionary interest on future estimated net cash flows of the Kurten field we performed an impairment review which resulted in an $87.9 million charge. Taxes other than income increased $12.4 million as a result of higher commodity prices realized in the year ended 2003 as compared to the same period of the prior year. Interest Expense Interest expense decreased $2.4 million. This variance is due to the combination of a lower average level of outstanding debt on the revolving credit facility as well as a decline in interest rates. Income Tax Expense Income tax expense increased $7.4 million due to a comparable increase in our pre tax net income. 2002 and 2001 Compared Net Income and Operating Revenue During 2002, we reported net income of $16.1 million, or $0.51 per share. Operating income decreased $46.3 million and operating revenues decreased $93.3 million in 2002. The decrease in operating revenues was mainly a result of the $80.6 million decline in natural gas sales due to the 31% decrease in natural gas prices and the $32.0 million decrease in brokered natural gas sales revenue, which was also a result of lower prices. Natural gas revenue and our realized price were reduced by $0.6 million due to hedges in place during 2002. See further discussion in Item 7A. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in crude oil revenue of $20.0 million due to a 50% increase in the volume of crude oil produced. Operating income was similarly impacted by these revenue changes. 34 Table of Contents Natural Gas Production Revenues The average total company realized natural gas production sales price, including the realized impact of derivative instruments, was $3.02 per Mcf. Due to derivative instruments this price was reduced by $0.01 per Mcf. The following table excludes the unrealized impact of the change in derivative fair value for the year ended December 31, 2002 and 2001.

This increase was slightly offset by a decline in crude oil prices which resulted in a net increase in crude oil revenue of $20.8 million. Other Net Operating Revenues Other operating revenues decreased $0.7 million to $6.4 million. In 2002, we provided for payout liabilities on certain properties not operated by us and certain estimated potential legal settlements. 37 Table of Contents Operating Expenses Total costs and expenses from operations decreased $46.8 million, or 13%, from 2001 due primarily to the following: Brokered natural gas cost decreased $34.8 million primarily due to the $34.1 million impact of decreased natural gas costs per Mcf. Volumes of brokered gas purchases decreased slightly contributing further to a reduction in the amount of $0.7 million. Production and pipeline expense increased $8.8 million, or 21%, primarily as a result of a full year of costs associated with operating the Cody Company properties acquired in August 2001. Additionally, increased insurance costs and increased drilling activity in the Gulf Coast and Rockies contributed to the rise in expense. On a units of production basis, our company wide production and pipeline expense was $0.55 per Mcfe in 2002 versus $0.51 per Mcfe in 2001. Exploration expense decreased $31.0 million primarily as a result of the following: An $8.9 million decrease in geological and geophysical expenses over last year due to the unusually high 2001 acquisition of seismic data for future evaluation. A $21.0 million decrease in dry hole costs. In 2002, we drilled nine exploratory wells compared to 27 in 2001. Our success rate on these wells improved from 44% in 2001 to 67% in 2002. The $16.9 million in dry hole cost recognized in 2002 includes expenditures related to three wells from the 2001 drilling program determined to be dry in 2002, in the amount of $6.9 million, as well as costs of abandoning certain sections of exploration well bores that were not economical, in the amount of $3.9 million. A $0.8 million increase for salaries, wages and related benefits largely attributable to increased staffing in the Gulf Coast region during 2001 to support that years expanded drilling program and assimilating Cody. Depreciation, depletion, amortization and impairment of unproved properties expense increased $17.4 million, or 20%, over 2001. Natural gas equivalent production increased 12%, increasing DD&A expense by $11.4 million. The 6% increase in the per unit expense from $1.09 per Mcfe to $1.16 per Mcfe was a result of increased production in the higher cost Gulf Coast region (including a full year impact of the newly acquired Cody properties) and resulted in an $5.6 million increase to DD&A expense for 2001. Impairment of Long Lived Assets decreased by $4.1 million this year. This year we recorded impairments on four small fields, three of which were in the Gulf Coast and one in the Rocky Mountains. For each of these fields, the capitalized cost exceeded the future undiscounted cash flows. A pipeline in the Eastern region was written down to fair market value. Last year, two fields in the Gulf Coast region were impaired since the cost capitalized exceeded the future undiscounted cash flows. Also in 2001, one natural gas processing plant in the Rocky Mountains area was written down to fair market value. In the fourth quarter of 2001, the Starpath prospect in the Gulf Coast region was impaired. General and administrative expenses increased $2.7 million due to the costs associated with the retirement of the chief executive officer in May 2002. Taxes other than income decreased $3.6 million as a result of lower natural gas and oil revenues. Interest Expense Interest expense increased $4.4 million due to the full year impact of the incremental debt used to partially fund the Cody acquisition in August 2001. Interest expense on the credit facility was down slightly due both to lower levels of borrowings and lower interest rates. Income Tax Expense Income tax expense was down $19.8 million due to the comparable decrease in earnings before income tax. Our effective tax rate decreased slightly in 2002 reflecting a shift of activity between states. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Oil and gas prices fluctuate widely, and low prices for an extended period of time are likely to have a material adverse impact on our business. Our revenues, operating results, financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital depend substantially on prevailing prices for natural gas and, to a lesser extent, oil. Declines in oil and natural gas prices may materially adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity, ability to obtain financing and operating results. Lower oil and gas prices also may reduce the amount of oil and gas that we can produce economically. Historically, oil and gas prices and markets have been volatile, with prices fluctuating widely, and they are likely to continue to be volatile. Prices for oil and natural gas are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil and gas, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control. These factors include: The domestic and foreign supply of oil and natural gas. The level of consumer product demand. Weather conditions. Political conditions in oil producing regions, including the Middle East. The ability of the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to agree to and maintain oil price and production controls. The price of foreign imports. Actions of governmental authorities. Domestic and foreign governmental regulations. The price, availability and acceptance of alternative fuels. Overall economic conditions. These factors make it impossible to predict with any certainty the future prices of oil and gas. Our hedging policy is designed to reduce the risk of price volatility for our production in the natural gas and crude oil markets. A hedging committee that consists of members of senior management oversees our hedging activity. Our hedging arrangements apply to only a portion of our production and provide only partial price protection. These hedging arrangements may expose us to risk of financial loss and limit the benefit of increases in prices. Please read the discussion below related to commodity price swaps for a more detailed discussion of our hedging arrangements. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activity Periodically we enter into derivative commodity instruments to hedge our exposure to price fluctuations on natural gas and crude oil production. At December 31, 2003, we had 32 cash flow hedges open: 15 natural gas price collar arrangements and 17 natural gas price swap arrangements. Additionally, we had four crude oil financial instruments and one natural gas financial instrument open at December 31, 2003, that did not qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS 133. At December 31, 2003, a $33.9 million ($21.0 million net of tax) unrealized loss was recorded to Other Comprehensive Income, along with a $39.6 million derivative liability and a $1.2 million derivative receivable. The change in derivative fair value for the current and prior periods have been included as a component of Natural Gas Production and Crude Oil and Condensate revenue, as appropriate. 39 Table of Contents The following table summarizes the realized and unrealized impact of derivative activity reflected in the respective line item in Operating Revenues. Year Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 Realized Unrealized Realized Unrealized Realized Unrealized Operating Revenues Increase / (Decrease) to Revenue Natural Gas Production $ (48,829 ) $ (1,468 ) $ (574 ) $ (1,683 ) $ 33,840 $ 177 Crude Oil $ (3,963 ) $ (1,879 ) $ (5,202 ) $ (693 ) $ $ Assuming no change in commodity prices, after December 31, 2003 we would reclassify to earnings, over the next 12 months, $20.3 million in after tax expenditures associated with commodity derivatives. This reclassification represents the net liability associated with open positions at December 31, 2003 related to anticipated 2004 production. Hedges on Production Swaps From time to time, we enter into natural gas and crude oil swap agreements with counterparties to hedge price risk associated with a portion of our production. These derivatives are not held for trading purposes. Under these price swaps, we receive a fixed price on a notional quantity of natural gas and crude oil in exchange for paying a variable price based on a market based index, such as the NYMEX gas and crude oil futures. Under our Revolving Credit Agreement, the aggregate level of commodity hedging must not exceed 80% of the anticipated future equivalent production during the period covered by the hedges. During 2003, natural gas price swaps covered 34,806 Mmcf, or 48% of our gas production, fixing the sales price of this gas at an average of $4.49 per Mcf. At December 31, 2003, we had open natural gas price swap contracts covering our 2004 and 2005 production as follows: Natural Gas Price Swaps Contract Period VolumeinMmcf Weighted Average Contract Price Unrealized Loss (In Thousands) As of December 31, 2003 Natural Gas Price Swaps on Production in: First Quarter 2004 8,017 $ 5.17 Second Quarter 2004 7,148 4.99 Third Quarter 2004 7,226 4.99 Fourth Quarter 2004 7,226 4.99 Full Year 2004 29,617 $ 5.04 $ 24,610 First Quarter 2005 2,510 $ 5.13 Second Quarter 2005 2,537 5.13 Third Quarter 2005 2,565 5.13 Fourth Quarter 2005 2,565 5.13 Full Year 2005 10,177 $ 5.13 $ 2,284 From time to time we enter into natural gas and crude oil derivative arrangements that do not qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS 133. These financial instruments are recorded at fair value at the balance sheet date. At December 31, 2003, we had four open crude oil swap arrangements and one natural gas swap arrangement with an unrealized net loss of $2.6 million and $0.8 million, respectively, recognized in Operating Revenues. 40 Table of Contents Hedges on Production Options Throughout 2002 and 2003, we believed that the pricing environment provided a strategic opportunity to significantly reduce the price risk on a portion of our production through the use of natural gas and crude oil collars. Under the collar arrangements, if the index price rises above the ceiling price, we pay the counterparty. If the index falls below the floor price, the counterparty pays us. During 2003, natural gas price collars covered 16,136 Mmcf, or 22% of our gas production, with a weighted average floor of $4.46 per Mcf and a weighted average ceiling of $5.41 per Mcf.
