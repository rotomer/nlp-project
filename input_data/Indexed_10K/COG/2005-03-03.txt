ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our results of operations and our present financial condition. Our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Form 10 K contain additional information that should be referred to when reviewing this material. Statements in this discussion may be forward looking. These forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, including those discussed below, which could cause actual results to differ from those expressed. Please read Forward Looking Information on page 36. We operate in one segment, natural gas and oil exploration and development. OVERVIEW Cabot Oil & Gas is a leading independent oil and gas company engaged in the exploration, development and exploitation of natural gas and crude oil from its properties in North America. Our exploration activities are concentrated in areas with known hydrocarbon resources, which are conducive to multi well, repeatable drilling programs. Our program is designed to be disciplined and balanced with a focus on achieving strong financial returns. At Cabot, there are three types of investment alternatives that constantly compete for available capital. These include drilling opportunities, acquisition opportunities and financial opportunities such as debt repayment or repurchase of common stock. Depending on circumstances, we allocate capital among the alternatives based on a rate of return approach. Our goal is to invest capital in the highest return opportunities available at any given time. Our financial results depend upon many factors, particularly the price of natural gas and crude oil and our ability to market our production on economically attractive terms. Price volatility in the commodity markets has remained prevalent in the last few years. Throughout 2003 and 2004, the futures market reported unprecedented natural gas and crude oil contract prices. Our realized natural gas and crude oil price, net of the impact of derivative instruments, was $5.20 per Mcf and $31.55 per Bbl, respectively, in 2004. To ensure a certain rate of return for our program, we entered into a series of crude oil and natural gas price collars and swaps. These financial instruments are an integral element of our risk management strategy but prevented us from realizing the full impact of the price environment. Commodity prices are impacted by many factors that are outside of our control. Historically, commodity prices have been volatile and we expect them to remain volatile. Commodity prices are affected by changes in market demands, which are impacted by overall economic activity, weather, pipeline capacity constraints, inventory storage levels, basis differentials and other factors. As a result, we cannot accurately predict future natural gas and crude oil prices, and therefore, we cannot determine what effect increases or decreases will have on our capital program, production volumes and future revenues. In addition to production volumes and commodity prices, finding and developing sufficient amounts of crude oil and natural gas reserves at economical costs are critical to our long term success. The tables below illustrate how natural gas prices have fluctuated over the course of 2003 and 2004. Index represents the Henry Hub index price per Mmbtu. The 2003 and 2004 price is the natural gas price per Mcf realized by us and includes the realized impact of our natural gas price collar and swap arrangements, as applicable: 25 Table of Contents (in $ per Mcf) Natural Gas Prices by Month 2004 Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Index $ 6.15 $ 5.77 $ 5.15 $ 5.37 $ 5.94 $ 6.68 $ 6.14 $ 6.04 $ 5.08 $ 5.79 $ 7.63 $ 7.78 2004 $ 5.23 $ 5.23 $ 5.17 $ 4.88 $ 4.96 $ 5.23 $ 5.39 $ 5.21 $ 4.54 $ 5.29 $ 5.63 $ 5.55 (in $ per Mcf) Natural Gas Prices by Month 2003 Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Index $ 4.96 $ 5.66 $ 9.11 $ 5.14 $ 5.12 $ 5.95 $ 5.30 $ 4.69 $ 4.93 $ 4.44 $ 4.45 $ 4.86 2003 $ 4.33 $ 4.62 $ 4.71 $ 4.48 $ 4.44 $ 4.57 $ 4.65 $ 4.43 $ 4.53 $ 4.33 $ 4.34 $ 4.67 Prices for crude oil have followed a similar path as the commodity price continued to maintain strength in 2003 and rose further in 2004. The tables below contain the NYMEX average crude oil price (Index) and our realized per barrel (Bbl) crude oil prices by month for 2003 and 2004. The 2003 and 2004 price is the crude oil price per Bbl realized by us and includes the realized impact of our crude oil derivative arrangements: (in $ per Bbl) Crude Oil Prices by Month 2004 Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Index $ 34.23 $ 34.50 $ 36.72 $ 36.62 $ 40.28 $ 38.05 $ 40.81 $ 44.88 $ 45.94 $ 53.09 $ 48.48 $ 43.26 2004 $ 30.62 $ 30.66 $ 31.62 $ 30.97 $ 30.80 $ 31.51 $ 31.43 $ 33.00 $ 31.61 $ 32.87 $ 33.15 $ 30.46 (in $ per Bbl) Crude Oil Prices by Month 2003 Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Index $ 32.70 $ 35.73 $ 33.16 $ 28.14 $ 28.07 $ 30.52 $ 30.70 $ 31.60 $ 28.31 $ 30.35 $ 31.06 $ 32.14 2003 $ 29.81 $ 31.47 $ 31.35 $ 29.65 $ 29.18 $ 28.95 $ 30.11 $ 28.82 $ 26.46 $ 27.17 $ 29.43 $ 32.93 We reported earnings of $2.72 per share, or $88.4 million, for 2004. This is up from the $0.66 per share, or $21.1 million, reported in 2003. The decline in impairments of oil and gas properties was the driving factor in this improvement. In 2003, there was an after tax impairment of $54.4 million related to our Kurten field (see Limited Partnership for discussion of the impairment). In addition, the stronger price environment contributed to the earnings increase. Prices, including the impact of the hedge arrangements, rose 15% for natural gas and 7% for oil. We drilled 256 gross wells with a success rate of 95% in 2004 compared to 173 gross wells with an 89% success rate in 2003. Total capital and exploration expenditures increased $71.3 million to $259.5 million in 2004 compared to $188.2 million for 2003. We believe our operating cash flow in 2005 will be sufficient to fund our capital and exploration budgeted spending of approximately $280 million and again provide excess cash flow. Any excess cash flow may be used for acquisitions, to pay current debt due, repurchase common stock, expand our capital program or other opportunities. Our 2005 strategy will remain consistent with 2004 focusing on a disciplined approach to investment that balances our drilling effort between exploration opportunities and the development program, along with acquisition opportunities and a continued financial focus including stock buyback and debt repayment. The preceding paragraphs, discussing our strategic pursuits and goals, contain forward looking information. Please read Forward Looking Information on page 36. 26 Table of Contents FINANCIAL CONDITION Capital Resources and Liquidity Our primary source of cash in 2004 was from funds generated from operations. Proceeds from the sale of common stock under stock option plans during 2004 roughly offset our repurchase of 405,100 treasury shares of Company stock at a weighted average purchase price of $38.58. The Company generates cash from the sale of natural gas and crude oil. Operating cash flow fluctuations are substantially driven by commodity prices and changes in our production volumes. Prices for crude oil and natural gas have historically been subject to seasonal influences characterized by peak demand and higher prices in the winter heating season; however, the impact of other risks and uncertainties have influenced prices throughout the recent years. Working capital is substantially influenced by these variables. Fluctuation in cash flow may result in an increase or decrease in our capital and exploration expenditures. See Results of Operations for a review of the impact of prices and volumes on sales. Cash flows provided by operating activities were primarily used to fund exploration and development expenditures, purchase treasury stock and pay dividends. See below for additional discussion and analysis of cash flow. Year Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 Cash Flows Provided by Operating Activities $ 273,022 $ 241,638 $ 164,182 Cash Flows Used by Investing Activities (255,357 ) (151,856 ) (138,668 ) Cash Flows Used by Financing Activities (8,363 ) (90,660 ) (27,364 ) Net Increase (Decrease) in Cash and Cash Equivalents $ 9,302 $ (878 ) $ (1,850 ) Operating Activities. Net cash provided by operating activities in 2004 increased $31.4 million over 2003. This increase is primarily due to higher commodity prices. Key drivers of net operating cash flows are commodity prices, production volumes and operating costs. Average realized natural gas prices increased 15% over 2003, while crude oil realized prices increased 7% over the same period. Production volumes declined slightly, with a 5 percent reduction of equivalent production in 2004 compared to 2003. While we believe 2005 commodity production may exceed 2004 levels, we are unable to predict future commodity prices, and as a result cannot provide any assurance about future levels of net cash provided by operating activities. Net cash provided by operating activities in 2003 increased $77.5 million over 2002. This increase is primarily due to higher commodity prices. Key drivers of net operating cash flows are commodity prices, production volumes and operating costs. Average natural gas prices increased 49% over 2002, while crude oil prices increased 24% over the same period. Production volumes declined slightly with a 2% reduction of equivalent production in 2003 compared to 2002. See page 25 for a discussion on commodity prices and Results of Operations for a review of the impact of prices and volumes on sales revenue. 27 Table of Contents Investing Activities. The primary driver of cash used by investing activities is capital spending and exploration expense. We establish the budget for these amounts based on our current estimate of future commodity prices. Due to the volatility of commodity prices our budget may be periodically adjusted during any given year. Cash flows used in investing activities increased for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 in the amounts of $103.5 million and $13.2 million. The increase from 2003 to 2004 is primarily due to an increase in drilling activity as a result of higher commodity prices. This increase largely occurred in our East region and the Rocky Mountain area of our West region. Our initial drilling activity in Canada also contributed to the increase. Cash flows used in investing activities increased from 2002 to 2003 due to an increase in capital spending and exploration expense in response to higher commodity prices and exploitation of acquired properties. This increase was partially offset by proceeds received from the sale of certain non strategic assets. Financing Activities. Cash flows used by financing activities were $8.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. This is the result of proceeds from the exercise of stock options, offset by the purchase of treasury shares and dividend payments. Cash flows used by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2003 was $90.7 million. This is substantially due to a net repayment on our revolving credit facility in the amount of $95.0 million. Cash utilized for the repayments was generated from operating cash flows. The cash flows used by financing activities in 2002 is primarily due to a net repayment on our revolving credit facility of $25.0 million. The available credit line under our revolving credit facility, which was $250 million at year end, but can be expanded up to $350 million, is subject to adjustment on the basis of the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves (as determined by the banks petroleum engineer) and other assets. At December 31, 2004, we had no outstanding balance on the credit facility. The revolving term of the credit facility ends in December 2009. We strive to manage our debt at a level below the available credit line in order to maintain excess borrowing capacity. Management believes that we have the ability to finance through new debt or equity offerings, if necessary, our capital requirements, including acquisitions. Our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of two million shares of our common stock in the open market or in negotiated transactions. All purchases executed have been through open market transactions. There is no expiration date associated with the authorization to repurchase securities of the Company. See Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities in Item 5 Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Repurchases of Equity Securities for additional information. 28 Table of Contents Capitalization Information about our capitalization is as follows: December 31, 2004 2003 (In millions) Debt (1) $ 270.0 $ 270.0 Stockholders Equity (2) (3) 455.7 365.2 Total Capitalization $ 725.7 $ 635.2 Debt to Capitalization (3) 37 % 43 % Cash and Cash Equivalents $ 10.0 $ 0.7 (1) Includes $20.0 million of current portion of long term debt in 2004. (2) Includes common stock, net of treasury stock. (3) Includes the impact of the Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss at December 31, 2004 and 2003 of $20.4 million and $23.1 million, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2004, we paid dividends of $5.2 million on our common stock. A regular dividend of $0.04 per share of common stock has been declared for each quarter since we became a public company. Capital and Exploration Expenditures On an annual basis, we generally fund most of our capital and exploration activities, excluding major oil and gas property acquisitions, with cash generated from operations and, when necessary, our revolving credit facility. We budget these capital expenditures based on our projected cash flows for the year. The following table presents major components of our capital and exploration expenditures for the three years ended December 31, 2004. (In millions) 2004 2003 2002 Capital Expenditures Drilling and Facilities $ 174.0 $ 102.0 $ 67.0 Leasehold Acquisitions 18.3 14.1 4.8 Pipeline and Gathering 13.5 10.6 4.1 Other 1.6 1.8 1.4 207.4 128.5 77.3 Proved Property Acquisitions 4.0 1.5 8.8 Exploration Expense 48.1 58.2 40.2 Total $ 259.5 $ 188.2 $ 126.3 We plan to drill about 300 gross wells in 2005 compared with 256 gross wells drilled in 2004. This 2005 drilling program includes approximately $280.0 million in total capital and exploration expenditures, up from $259.5 million in 2004. We will continue to assess the natural gas price environment and may increase or decrease the capital and exploration expenditures accordingly. There are many factors that impact our depreciation, depletion and amortization rate. These include reserve additions and revisions, development costs, impairments and changes in anticipated production in a future period. In 2005 management expects an increase in our depreciation, depletion and amortization rate due to production declines and higher capital costs. This change may result in an increase of depreciation, depletion and amortization of 5% to 10% greater than 2004 levels. This increase will not have an impact on our cash flows. 29 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations Our known material contractual obligations include long term debt, interest on long term debt and operating leases. We have no off balance sheet debt or other similar unrecorded obligations, and we have not guaranteed the debt of any other party. A summary of our known contractual obligations as of December 31, 2004 are set forth in the following table: Payments Due by Year (In thousands) Total 2005 2006 to 2007 2008 to 2009 2010 & Beyond Long Term Debt (1) $ 270,000 $ 20,000 $ 40,000 $ 40,000 $ 170,000 Interest on Long Term Debt (2) 126,405 19,545 34,776 29,024 43,060 Firm Gas Transportation Agreements 87,888 8,117 13,321 7,565 58,885 Operating Leases 17,000 4,889 8,882 2,847 382 Total Contractual Cash Obligations $ 501,293 $ 52,551 $ 96,979 $ 79,436 $ 272,327 (1) Including current portion. (2) Interest payments have been calculated utilizing the fixed rate of our $270 million long term debt outstanding at December 31, 2004. At December 31, 2004 we had no outstanding debt on our revolving credit facility. See Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for details of long term debt. Amounts related to our asset retirement obligations are not included in the above table given the uncertainty regarding the actual timing of such expenditures. The total amount of asset retirement obligations at December 31, 2004 is $40.4 million. Potential Impact of Our Critical Accounting Policies Readers of this document and users of the information contained in it should be aware of how certain events may impact our financial results based on the accounting policies in place. The most significant policies are discussed below. Oil and Gas Reserves The process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is inherently uncertain, and the reserve data included in this document are only estimates. The process relies on interpretations of available geologic, geophysic, engineering and production data. The extent, quality and reliability of this technical data can vary. The degree of uncertainty varies among the three regions in which we operate. The estimation of reserves in the Gulf Coast region requires more estimates than the East and West regions and inherently has more uncertainty surrounding reserve estimation. The differences in the reserve estimation process are substantially due to the geological conditions in which the wells are drilled. The process also requires certain economic assumptions, some of which are mandated by the SEC, such as oil and gas prices. Additional assumptions include drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes and availability of funds. The accuracy of a reserve estimate is a function of: the quality and quantity of available data; the interpretation of that data; the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions; and the judgment of the persons preparing the estimate. In 2004, 2003 and 2002, 100% of our reserves were subject to an external review by Miller & Lents, Ltd., an independent oil and gas reservoir engineering consulting firm, who in their opinion determined the estimates to be reasonable in the aggregate. Additionally, in 2004, 2003 and 2002, we did not have a significant reserve revision recorded. For more information regarding reserve estimation, including historical reserve revisions, refer to the Supplemental Oil and Gas Disclosure beginning on page 85. 30 Table of Contents Our rate of recording depreciation, depletion and amortization expense (DD&A) is dependent upon our estimate of proved reserves, which is utilized in our unit of production method calculation. If the estimates of proved reserves were to be reduced, the rate at which we record DD&A expense would increase, reducing net income. Such a reduction in reserves may result from lower market prices, which may make it non economic to drill for and produce higher cost fields. A five percent positive or negative revision to proved reserves throughout the Company would decrease or increase the DD&A rate by approximately $0.04 to $0.05 per Mcfe. Revisions in significant fields may individually affect our DD&A rate. It is estimated that a positive or negative reserve revision of 10% in one of our most productive fields would have a $0.02 impact on our total DD&A rate. In addition, a decline in proved reserve estimates may impact the outcome of our annual impairment test under SFAS 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. Due to the inherent imprecision of the reserve estimation process, risks associated with the operations of proved producing properties, and market sensitive commodity prices utilized in our impairment analysis, management cannot determine if an impairment is reasonably likely to occur in the future. Carrying Value of Oil and Gas Properties We evaluate the impairment of our oil and gas properties on a lease by lease basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an assets carrying amount may not be recoverable. We compare expected undiscounted future cash flows to the net book value of the asset. If the future undiscounted cash flows, based on our estimate of future crude oil and natural gas prices, operating costs and anticipated production from proved reserves are lower than the net book value of the asset, the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value. Commodity pricing is estimated by using a combination of historical and current prices adjusted for geographical location and quality differentials, as well as other factors that management believes will impact realizable prices. Fair value is calculated by discounting the future cash flows. In 2002 there were no unusual or unexpected occurrences that caused significant revisions in estimated cash flows which were utilized in our impairment test. In 2003 we significantly revised the estimated cash flow utilized in our impairment review of the Kurten field due to a loss of a reversionary interest in the field. In December 2003 our remaining interest in the field was sold. For additional discussion on the Kurten field impairment see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. In 2004 there were no unusual or unexpected occurrences that caused significant revisions in estimated cash flows which were utilized in our impairment test. Costs attributable to our unproved properties are not subject to the impairment analysis described above, however, a portion of the costs associated with such properties is subject to amortization based on past experience and average property lives. Average property lives are determined on a regional basis and based on the estimated life of unproved property leasehold rights. Historically, the average property lives in each of the regions have not significantly changed. However, if the average property life increases, the amount of the amortization charge in a given reporting period will decrease. If the average unproved property life decreases or increases by one year the amortization would increase by approximately $2.3 million or decrease by approximately $1.9 million, respectively per year. In the past the average leasehold life in the Gulf Coast region has been shorter than the average life in the East and West regions. Average property lives in the Gulf Coast, East and West regions have been four, six and six years, respectively. Average property lives in Canada are estimated to be five years. As these properties are developed and reserves are proven, the remaining capitalized costs are subject to depreciation and depletion. If the development of these properties is deemed unsuccessful, the capitalized costs related to the unsuccessful activity is expensed in the year the determination is made. The rate at which the unproved properties are written off depends on the timing and success of our future exploration program. 31 Table of Contents Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities Periodically we enter into derivative commodity instruments to hedge our exposure to price fluctuations on natural gas and crude oil production. We follow the accounting prescribed in SFAS 133. Under SFAS 133, the fair value of each derivative instrument is recorded as either an asset or liability on the balance sheet. At the end of each period, these instruments are marked to market. The gain or loss on the change in fair value is recorded as Other Comprehensive Income, a component of equity, to the extent that the derivative instrument is designated as an effective hedge. Under SFAS 133, effectiveness is a measurement of how closely correlated the hedge instrument is with the underlying physical sale. For example, a natural gas price swap that converts Henry Hub index to a fixed price would be perfectly correlated, and 100% effective, if the underlying gas were sold at the Henry Hub index. Any portion of the gains or losses that are considered ineffective under the SFAS 133 test are recorded immediately as a component of operating revenue on the statement of operations. Long Term Employee Benefit Costs Our costs of long term employee benefits, particularly pension and postretirement benefits, are incurred over long periods of time, and involve many uncertainties over those periods. The net periodic benefit cost attributable to current periods is based on several assumptions about such future uncertainties, and is sensitive to changes in those assumptions. It is managements responsibility, often with the assistance of independent experts, to select assumptions that in its judgment represent best estimates of those uncertainties. It also is managements responsibility to review those assumptions periodically to reflect changes in economic or other factors that affect those assumptions. The current benefit service costs, as well as the existing liabilities, for pensions and other postretirement benefits are measured on a discounted present value basis. The discount rate is a current rate, related to the rate at which the liabilities could be settled. Our assumed discount rate is based on average rates published for high quality fixed income securities. The benefit obligation and the periodic cost of postretirement medical benefits also are measured based on assumed rates of future increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits. As of December 31, 2004, the assumed rate of increase was 10.0%. The net periodic cost of pension benefits included in expense also is affected by the expected long term rate of return on plan assets assumption. The expected return on plan assets rate is normally changed less frequently than the assumed discount rate, and reflects long term expectations, rather than current fluctuations in market conditions. The actual rate of return on plan assets may differ from the expected rate due to the volatility normally experienced in capital markets. Managements goal is to manage the investments over the long term to achieve optimal returns with an acceptable level of risk and volatility. Stock Based Compensation Prior to the issuance of SFAS 123R Share Based Payment, there were two alternative methods that could be used to account for stock based compensation. The first method is the Intrinsic Value method and recognizes compensation cost as the excess, if any, of the quoted market price of our stock at the grant date over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock. The second method is the Fair Value method. Under the fair value method, compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of an award and is recognized over the service period, which is usually the vesting period. Currently, we account for stock based compensation in accordance with the Intrinsic Value method. SFAS 123R requires that the fair value of stock options and any other equity based compensation must be expensed at the grant date. To calculate the fair value, either a binomial or Black Scholes valuation model may be used. We currently expense performance share awards; however, beginning in the third quarter of 2005, we will be required to expense all stock based compensation. Further discussion of SFAS 123R and stock compensation is included in Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements on page 35. 32 Table of Contents OTHER ISSUES AND CONTINGENCIES Corporate Income Tax. We generated tax credits for the production of certain qualified fuels, including natural gas produced from tight sands formations and Devonian Shale. The credit for natural gas from a tight sand formation (tight gas sands) amounted to $0.52 per Mmbtu for natural gas sold prior to 2003 from qualified wells drilled in 1991 and 1992. A number of wells drilled in the East region and Rocky Mountains during 1991 and 1992 qualified for the tight gas sands tax credit. The credit for natural gas produced from Devonian Shale was $1.09 per Mmbtu in 2002. In 1995 and 1996, we completed three transactions to monetize the value of these tax credits, resulting in revenues of $2.0 million in 2002. The tax credit wells were repurchased in December 2002 and no tax credits were generated in 2003 or 2004 as the credits expired in 2002. See Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. We have benefited in the past and may benefit in the future from the alternative minimum tax (AMT) relief granted under the Comprehensive National Energy Policy Act of 1992 (the Act). The Act repealed provisions of the AMT requiring a taxpayers alternative minimum taxable income to be increased on account of certain intangible drilling costs (IDC) and percentage depletion deductions. The repeal of these provisions generally applies to taxable years beginning after 1992. The repeal of the excess IDC preference can not reduce a taxpayers alternative minimum taxable income by more than 40% of the amount of such income determined without regard to the repeal of such preference. Regulations. Our operations are subject to various types of regulation by federal, state and local authorities. See Regulation of Oil and Natural Gas Production and Transportation and Environmental Regulations in the Other Business Matters section of Item 1 Business for a discussion of these regulations. Restrictive Covenants. Our ability to incur debt and to make certain types of investments is subject to certain restrictive covenants in the Companys various debt instruments. Among other requirements, our Revolving Credit Agreement and the Notes specify a minimum annual coverage ratio of operating cash flow to interest expense for the trailing four quarters of 2.8 to 1.0. At December 31, 2004, we are in compliance with all restrictive covenants on both the Revolving Credit Agreement and the Notes. In the unforeseen event that we fail to comply with these covenants, the Company may apply for a temporary waiver with the lender, which, if granted, would allow us a period of time to remedy the situation. See further discussion in Capital Resources and Liquidity. Limited Partnership. As part of the 2001 Cody acquisition, we acquired an interest in certain oil and gas properties in the Kurten field, as general partner of a partnership and as an operator. We had approximately a 25% interest in the field, including a one percent interest in the partnership. Under the partnership agreement, we had the right to a reversionary working interest that would bring our ultimate interest to 50% upon the limited partner reaching payout. Based on the addition of this reversionary interest, and because the field has over a 40 year reserve life, approximately $91 million was allocated to this field under purchase accounting at the time of the acquisition. Additionally, the limited partner had the sole option to trigger a liquidation of the partnership. Effective February 13, 2003, liquidation of the partnership commenced at the election of the limited partner. The limited partner was a financial entity and not an industry operator. Their decision to liquidate was based upon their perception that the value of their investment in the partnership had increased due to an increase in underlying commodity prices, primarily oil, since their investment in 1999. We proceeded with the liquidation to avoid having a minority interest in a non operated water flood field for which the new operator was not designated at the time of liquidation. In connection with the liquidation, an appraisal was required to be obtained to allocate the interest in the partnership assets. Additionally, we were required to test the field for recoverability in accordance with FAS 144. Pursuant to the terms of the partnership agreement and based on the appraised value of the partnership assets it was not possible for us to obtain the reversionary interest as part of the liquidation. Due to the impact of the loss of the reversionary interest on future estimated net cash flows of the Kurten field, the limited partners decision and our decision to proceed with the liquidation, an impairment review was performed which required an after tax impairment charge in the first quarter of 2003 of $54.4 million. This impairment charge is reflected in the 2003 Statement of Operations as an operating expense but did not impact our cash flows. 33 Table of Contents Operating Risks and Insurance Coverage. Our business involves a variety of operating risks, including: blowouts, cratering and explosions; mechanical problems; uncontrolled flows of oil, natural gas or well fluids; fires; formations with abnormal pressures; pollution and other environmental risks; and natural disasters. The operation of our natural gas gathering and pipeline systems also involves various risks, including the risk of explosions and environmental hazards caused by pipeline leaks and ruptures. The location of pipelines near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers and industrial sites, could increase these risks. Any of these events could result in loss of human life, significant damage to property, environmental pollution, impairment of our operations and substantial losses to us. In accordance with customary industry practice, we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these risks and losses. The occurrence of any of these events not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations. The costs of these insurance policies are somewhat dependent on our historical claims experience and also the areas in which we choose to operate. During the past few years, we have invested a significant portion of our drilling dollars in the Gulf Coast, where insurance rates are significantly higher than in other regions such as the East. Commodity Pricing and Risk Management Activities. Our revenues, operating results, financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital depend substantially on prevailing prices for natural gas and, to a lesser extent, oil. Declines in oil and gas prices may materially adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity, ability to obtain financing and operating results. Lower oil and gas prices also may reduce the amount of oil and gas that we can produce economically. Historically, oil and gas prices and markets have been volatile, with prices fluctuating widely, and they are likely to continue to be volatile. Depressed prices in the future would have a negative impact on our future financial results. In particular, substantially lower prices would significantly reduce revenue and could potentially impact the outcome of our annual impairment test under SFAS 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. Because our reserves are predominantly natural gas, changes in natural gas prices may have a particularly large impact on our financial results. The majority of our production is sold at market responsive prices. Generally, if the commodity indexes fall, the price that we receive for our production will also decline. Therefore, the amount of revenue that we realize is partially determined by factors beyond our control. However, management may mitigate this price risk with the use of financial instruments. Most recently, we have used financial instruments such as price collar and swap arrangements to reduce the impact of declining prices on our revenue. Under both arrangements, there is also risk that the movement of the index prices will result in the Company not being able to realize the full benefit of a market improvement. 34 Table of Contents Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In May 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) No. FAS 106 2, Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003. This FSP provides guidance on the accounting for the effects of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the Act) for employers that sponsor postretirement health care plans that provide prescription drug benefits. This FSP also requires those employers to provide certain disclosures regarding the effect of the federal subsidy provided by the Act (the subsidy). This FSP supersedes FSP 106 1, Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 and is effective for the first interim period beginning after June 15, 2004. Our current accumulated projected benefit obligation and net periodic postretirement benefit cost does not reflect any amount associated with the subsidy. Furthermore, in 2004, we amended our postretirement benefit plan to exclude prescription drug benefits for participants age 65 and older effective January 1, 2006. The adoption of this FSP is not expected to impact our operating results, financial position or cash flows. In November 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 151, Inventory Costs an amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4 in an effort to unite the United States accounting standards for inventories with International Accounting Standards leading to consistent application of certain accounting requirements. FAS 151 addresses accounting for abnormal amounts of freight, handling costs, idle facility expense and spoilage (wasted material) and requires that these costs be recognized as current period expenses. Previously, these costs had to be categorized as so abnormal as to require treatment as current period charges. In addition, allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion must be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. FAS 151 will be effective for fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005. The adoption of this statement is not expected to impact our operating results, financial position or cash flows. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS 153 Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets an amendment of APB Opinion No. 29. This statement requires that nonmonetary exchanges must be recorded at fair value and the appropriate gain or loss must be recognized so long as the fair value is determinable and the transaction has commercial substance. According to this statement, companies can no longer use the similar productive assets concept to account for nonmonetary exchanges at book value with no gain or loss being recognized. FAS 153 will be effective for fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005. The adoption of this statement may impact our operating results, financial position or cash flows in future periods if such a nonmonetary exchange occurs. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R, Share Based Payment. SFAS 123R revises SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, and focuses on accounting for share based payments for services by employer to employee. The statement requires companies to expense the fair value of employee stock options and other equity based compensation at the grant date. The statement does not require a certain type of valuation model and either a binomial or Black Scholes model may be used. The provisions of SFAS 123R are effective for financial statements for fiscal periods ending after June 15, 2005. We are currently evaluating the method of adoption and the impact on our operating results. Our future cash flows will not be impacted by the adoption of this standard. See Footnote 1 Stock Based Compensation for further information. 35 Table of Contents In February 2005, the FASB released for public comment proposed Staff Position FAS 19 a Accounting for Suspended Well Costs. This proposed staff position would amend FASB Statement No. 19 Financial Accounting and Reporting by Oil and Gas Producing Companies and provides guidance about exploratory well costs to companies who use the successful efforts method of accounting. The proposed position states that exploratory well costs should continue to be capitalized if: 1) a sufficient quantity of reserved are discovered in the well to justify its completion as a producing well and 2) sufficient progress is made in assessing the reserves and the wells economic and operating feasibility. If the exploratory well costs do not meet both of these criteria, these costs should be expensed, net of any salvage value. Additional disclosures are required to provide information about managements evaluation of capitalized exploratory well costs. In addition, the Staff Position requires the disclosure of: 1) net changes from period to period of capitalized exploratory well costs for wells that are pending the determination of proved reserves, 2) the amount of exploratory well costs that have been capitalized for a period greater than one year after the completion of drilling and 3) an aging of exploratory well costs suspended for greater than one year with the number of wells it related to. Further, the disclosures should describe the activities undertaken to evaluate the reserves and the projects, the information still required to classify the associated reserves as proved and the estimated timing for completing the evaluation. Although this Staff Position is not final and has not been adopted by us, we have included the additional disclosures in Note 2. Comments on this proposed FSP are expected by March 7, 2005. * * * Forward Looking Information The statements regarding future financial and operating performance and results, market prices, future hedging activities, and other statements that are not historical facts contained in this report are forward looking statements. The words expect, project, estimate, believe, anticipate, intend, budget, plan, forecast, predict, may, should, could, will and similar expressions are also intended to identify forward looking statements. Such statements involve risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, market factors, market prices (including regional basis differentials) of natural gas and oil, results for future drilling and marketing activity, future production and costs and other factors detailed herein and in our other Securities and Exchange Commission filings.

During 2003, we reported net income of $21.1 million, or $0.66 per share. Operating income increased by $94.1 million compared to the prior year, from $66.6 million to $160.7 million. The increase in net income and operating income was principally due to decreased operating expenses from 2003 to 2004 related to the decrease in impairments of oil and gas properties of $90.3 million related to the loss in 2003 of a reversionary interest in the Kurten field. In addition, the increases in operating income and net income were due to an increase in our realized natural gas and crude oil prices. Natural Gas Production Revenues Our average total company realized natural gas production sales price, including the realized impact of derivative instruments, was $5.20 per Mcf compared to $4.51 per Mcf for the comparable period of the prior year. These prices include the realized impact of derivative instruments which reduced these prices by $0.76 per Mcf in 2004 and $0.68 per Mcf in 2003. The following table excludes the unrealized gain from the change in derivative fair value of $0.9 million and the unrealized loss of $1.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. These unrealized changes in fair value have been included in the Natural Gas Production revenues line item on the Statement of Operations.

Natural gas production was up slightly from the prior year and production revenues also increased from 2003. Natural gas production increased slightly in all regions except the West region, where the decline in production was due to lower capital spending in 2003 and continued natural decline. The increases in both sales price and production resulted in an increase in natural gas production revenues of $54.7 million. 37 Table of Contents Brokered Natural Gas Revenue and Cost Year Ended December 31, Variance 2004 2003 Amount Percent Sales Price ($/Mcf) $ 6.56 $ 5.16 $ 1.40 27 % Volume Brokered (Mmcf) 12,876 18,557 (5,681 ) (31 )% Brokered Natural Gas Revenues (in thousands) $ 84,416 $ 95,754 Purchase Price ($/Mcf) $ 5.84 $ 4.64 $ 1.20 26 % Volume Brokered (Mmcf) 12,876 18,557 (5,681 ) (31 )% Brokered Natural Gas Cost (in thousands) $ 75,217 $ 86,104 Brokered Natural Gas Margin (in thousands) $ 9,199 $ 9,650 $ (451 ) (5 )% (in thousands) Sales Price Variance Impact on Revenue $ 18,026 Volume Variance Impact on Revenue $ (29,363 ) $ (11,337 ) (in thousands) Purchase Price Variance Impact on Purchases $ (15,451 ) Volume Variance Impact on Purchases $ 26,338 $ 10,887 The decrease in brokered natural gas revenues of $11.3 million combined with the decline in brokered natural gas cost of $10.9 million resulted in a decrease to the brokered natural gas margin of $0.5 million. 38 Table of Contents Crude Oil and Condensate Revenues Our average total company realized crude oil sales price, including the realized impact of derivative instruments, was $31.55 per Bbl compared to $29.55 per Bbl for 2003. These prices include the realized impact of derivative instruments which reduced these prices by $8.98 per Bbl in 2004 and $1.41 per Bbl in 2003. The following table excludes the unrealized loss from the change in derivative fair value of $2.9 million and $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. These unrealized changes in fair value have been included in the Crude Oil and Condensate revenues line item on the Statement of Operations.

The increase in the realized crude oil price combined with the decline in production resulted in a net revenue decrease of $20.0 million. 39 Table of Contents Other Operating Revenues Other operating revenues decreased $3.7 million. This change was primarily a result of decreases in natural gas transportation revenue and natural gas liquid revenue for the year ended December 31, 2004. Operating Expenses Total costs and expenses from operations decreased $85.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to the year ended December 31, 2003. The primary reasons for this fluctuation are as follows: Brokered natural gas cost decreased $10.9 million. For additional information related to this decrease see the analysis performed for Brokered Natural Gas Revenue and Cost. Exploration expense decreased $10.0 million primarily as a result of higher dry hole expense in 2003. During 2004, we drilled 5 dry exploratory wells compared to 15 in the corresponding period of 2003. Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization increased, as anticipated, by approximately 9% or $8.4 million. The increase was primarily due to negative reserve revisions in south Louisiana in 2003, which increased the per Mcfe DD&A rate. Impairment of producing properties expense decreased $90.3 million. This decrease is substantially related to a pre tax non cash impairment charge of $87.9 million related to the loss of a reversionary interest in the Kurten field incurred in 2003 as discussed below in the Operating Expenses section of 2003 and 2002 Compared. General and Administrative expense increased $9.6 million from 2003 to 2004. Stock compensation expense increased by $4.9 million as a result of performance share awards issued in 2004 and increased amortization of restricted stock grants for grants which occurred during the year. Compliance fees related to Sarbanes Oxley increased expenses by $2.3 million, and there was a $1.2 million increase in employee related expenses. Taxes other than income increased $3.9 million as a result of higher commodity prices realized in the year ended 2004 as compared to the same period of the prior year. Interest Expense Interest expense decreased $1.7 million. This variance is due to a lower average level of outstanding debt on the revolving credit facility offset somewhat by an increase in Prime rates. Average daily borrowings under the revolving credit facility during the year were $0.5 million in 2004 which is a decrease from $0.7 million in 2003. Our other remaining debt is at fixed interest rates. Income Tax Expense Income tax expense increased $35.2 million due to a comparable increase in our pre tax net income. 40 Table of Contents 2003 and 2002 Compared We reported net income for the year ended December 31, 2003 of $21.1 million, or $0.66 per share. During the corresponding period of 2002, we reported net income of $16.1 million, or $0.51 per share. Operating income increased by $17.5 million compared to the comparable period of the prior year. The increase in net income and operating income was substantially due to an increase in our realized natural gas and crude oil prices. Natural Gas Production Revenues The average total company realized natural gas production sales price, including the realized impact of derivative instruments, was $4.51 per Mcf. Due to derivative instruments this price was reduced by $0.68 per Mcf. The following table excludes the unrealized impact of the change in derivative fair value for the year ended December 31, 2003 and 2002. These amounts have been included in the Natural Gas Production Revenues line item on the Statement of Operations.

The increase in the realized crude oil price combined with the decline in production resulted in a net revenue increase of $14.6 million. 43 Table of Contents Other Operating Revenues Other operating revenues increased $3.6 million. This change was a result of an increase in plant revenue, transportation revenue and natural gas liquid revenue for the year ended December 31, 2003. Operating Expenses Total costs and expenses from operations increased $150.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to the year ended December 31, 2002. The primary reasons for this fluctuation are as follows: Brokered natural gas cost increased $33.2 million. For additional information related to this increase see the analysis performed for Brokered Natural Gas Revenue and Cost. Exploration expense increased $18.0 million as a result of higher dry hole expense in 2003. During 2003, we drilled 15 dry exploratory wells compared to 3 in the corresponding period of 2002. Impairment of producing properties expense increased $91.1 million. This increase is substantially related to a pre tax non cash impairment charge of $87.9 million related to the loss of a reversionary interest in the Kurten field. Effective February 13, 2003, the Kurten partnership commenced liquidation at the limited partners election. In connection with the liquidation, an appraisal was obtained to allocate the interest in the partnership assets. Based on the receipt of the appraisal in February 2003, we would not receive the reversionary interest as part of the liquidation. Due to the impact of the loss of the reversionary interest on future estimated net cash flows of the Kurten field we performed an impairment review which resulted in an $87.9 million charge. Taxes other than income increased $12.4 million as a result of higher commodity prices realized in the year ended 2003 as compared to the same period of the prior year. Interest Expense Interest expense decreased $2.4 million. This variance is due to the combination of a lower average level of outstanding debt on the revolving credit facility as well as a decline in interest rates. Income Tax Expense Income tax expense increased $7.4 million due to a comparable increase in our pre tax net income. 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Oil and gas prices fluctuate widely, and low prices for an extended period of time are likely to have a material adverse impact on our business. Our revenues, operating results, financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital depend substantially on prevailing prices for natural gas and, to a lesser extent, oil. Declines in oil and natural gas prices may materially adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity, ability to obtain financing and operating results. Lower oil and gas prices also may reduce the amount of oil and gas that we can produce economically. Historically, oil and gas prices and markets have been volatile, with prices fluctuating widely, and they are likely to continue to be volatile. Prices for oil and natural gas are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil and gas, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control. These factors include: The domestic and foreign supply of oil and natural gas. The level of consumer product demand. Weather conditions. Political conditions in oil producing regions, including the Middle East. The ability of the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to agree to and maintain oil price and production controls. The price of foreign imports. Actions of governmental authorities. Domestic and foreign governmental regulations. The price, availability and acceptance of alternative fuels. Overall economic conditions. These factors make it impossible to predict with any certainty the future prices of oil and gas. Our hedging strategy is designed to reduce the risk of price volatility for our production in the natural gas and crude oil markets. A hedging committee that consists of members of senior management oversees our hedging activity. Our hedging arrangements apply to only a portion of our production and provide only partial price protection. These hedging arrangements may expose us to risk of financial loss and limit the benefit of increases in prices. Please read the discussion below related to commodity price swaps for a more detailed discussion of our hedging arrangements. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activity Periodically, we enter into derivative commodity instruments to hedge our exposure to price fluctuations on natural gas and crude oil production. At December 31, 2004, we had 15 cash flow hedges open: 7 natural gas price collar arrangements, one crude oil collar arrangement and 7 natural gas price swap arrangements. Additionally, we had two crude oil financial instruments open at December 31, 2004, that did not qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS 133. At December 31, 2004, a $28.8 million ($17.8 million net of tax) unrealized loss was recorded to Other Comprehensive Income, along with a $38.4 million derivative liability and a $2.9 million derivative receivable. The change in the fair value of derivatives designated as hedges that is effective is initially recorded to Other Comprehensive Income. The ineffective portion, if any, of the change in the fair value of derivatives designated as hedges, and the change in fair value of all other derivatives is recorded currently in earnings as a component of Natural Gas Production and Crude Oil and Condensate revenue, as appropriate. 45 Table of Contents The following table summarizes the realized and unrealized impact of derivative activity reflected in the respective line item in Operating Revenues. Year Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 (In thousands) Realized Unrealized Realized Unrealized Realized Unrealized Operating Revenues Increase / (Decrease) to Revenue Natural Gas Production $ (55,008 ) $ 914 $ (48,829 ) $ (1,468 ) $ (574 ) $ (1,683 ) Crude Oil (17,908 ) (2,917 ) (3,963 ) (1,879 ) (5,202 ) (693 ) Assuming no change in commodity prices, after December 31, 2004 we would reclassify to earnings, over the next 12 months, $17.8 million in after tax expenditures associated with commodity derivatives. This reclassification represents the net liability associated with open positions currently not reflected in earnings at December 31, 2004 related to anticipated 2005 production. Hedges on Production Swaps From time to time, we enter into natural gas and crude oil swap agreements with counterparties to hedge price risk associated with a portion of our production. These derivatives are not held for trading purposes. Under these price swaps, we receive a fixed price on a notional quantity of natural gas and crude oil in exchange for paying a variable price based on a market based index, such as the NYMEX gas and crude oil futures. Under our Revolving Credit Agreement, the aggregate level of commodity hedging must not exceed 100% of the anticipated future equivalent production during the period covered by these cash flow hedges. During 2004, natural gas price swaps covered 29,617 Mmcf, or 41% of our gas production, fixing the sales price of this gas at an average of $5.04 per Mcf. At December 31, 2004, we had open natural gas price swap contracts covering 2005 production as follows: Natural Gas Price Swaps Contract Period VolumeinMmcf WeightedAverageContract Price UnrealizedGain /(Loss)(In thousands) As of December 31, 2004 Natural Gas Price Swaps on Production in: First Quarter 2005 5,069 $ 5.14 Second Quarter 2005 5,125 5.14 Third Quarter 2005 5,181 5.14 Fourth Quarter 2005 5,181 5.14 Full Year 2005 20,556 $ 5.14 $ (27,897 ) From time to time we enter into natural gas and crude oil derivative arrangements that do not qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS 133. These financial instruments are recorded at fair value at the balance sheet date. At December 31, 2004, we had two open crude oil swap arrangements with an unrealized net loss of $5.5 million recognized in Operating Revenues. 46 Table of Contents Hedges on Production Options From time to time, we enter into natural gas and crude oil collar agreements with counterparties to hedge price risk associated with a portion of our production. These cash flow hedges are not held for trading purposes. Under the collar arrangements, if the index price rises above the ceiling price, we pay the counterparty.
