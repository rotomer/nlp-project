ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our results of operations and our present financial condition. Our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying Notes included elsewhere in this Form 10 K contain additional information that should be referred to when reviewing this material. Statements in this discussion may be forward looking. These forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, including those discussed below, which could cause actual results to differ from those expressed. Please read Forward Looking Information for further details. We operate in one segment, natural gas and oil exploration and exploitation, exclusively within the United States and Canada. OVERVIEW Cabot Oil & Gas and its subsidiaries are a leading independent oil and gas company engaged in the exploration, development, acquisition, exploitation, production and marketing of natural gas, and to a lesser extent, crude oil and natural gas liquids from its properties in North America. We also transport, store, gather and produce natural gas for resale. Our exploration activities are concentrated in areas with known hydrocarbon resources, which are conducive to multi well, repeatable drilling programs. Our program is designed to be disciplined and balanced with a focus on achieving strong financial returns. At Cabot, there are three types of investment alternatives that constantly compete for available capital: drilling opportunities, acquisition opportunities and financial opportunities such as debt repayment or repurchase of common stock. Depending on circumstances, we allocate capital among the alternatives based on a rate of return approach. Our goal is to invest capital in the highest return opportunities available at any given time. Our financial results depend upon many factors, particularly the price of natural gas and crude oil and our ability to market our production on economically attractive terms. Price volatility in the commodity markets has remained prevalent in the last few years. Throughout 2004 and 2005, the futures market reported unprecedented natural gas and crude oil contract prices. Our realized natural gas and crude oil price was $6.74 per Mcf and $44.19 per Bbl, respectively, in 2005. These realized prices include the realized impact of derivative instruments. In an effort to manage commodity price risk, we entered into a series of crude oil and natural gas price collars and swaps. These financial instruments are an element of our risk management strategy but prevented us from realizing the full impact of the price environment. Commodity prices are impacted by many factors that are outside of our control. Historically, commodity prices have been volatile and we expect them to remain volatile. Commodity prices are affected by changes in market demands, which are impacted by overall economic activity, weather, pipeline capacity constraints, inventory storage levels, basis differentials and other factors. As a result, we cannot accurately predict future natural gas, natural gas liquids and crude oil prices, and therefore, we cannot determine what effect increases or decreases will have on our capital program, production volumes and future revenues. In addition to production volumes and commodity prices, finding and developing sufficient amounts of crude oil and natural gas reserves at economical costs are critical to our long term success. See Risk Factors Natural gas and oil prices fluctuate widely, and low prices for an extended period of time are likely to have a material adverse impact on our business and Risk Factors Our future performance depends on our ability to find or acquire additional natural gas and oil reserves that are economically recoverable in Item 1A. 29 Table of Contents The tables below illustrate how natural gas prices have fluctuated by month over 2004 and 2005. Index represents the first of the month Henry Hub index price per Mmbtu. The 2004 and 2005 price is the natural gas price per Mcf realized by us and includes the realized impact of our natural gas price collar and swap arrangements, as applicable: (in $ per Mcf) Natural Gas Prices by Month 2005 Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Index $ 6.21 $ 6.29 $ 6.30 $ 7.33 $ 6.77 $ 6.13 $ 6.98 $ 7.65 $ 10.97 $ 13.93 $ 13.85 $ 11.21 2005 $ 5.78 $ 5.84 $ 5.52 $ 6.28 $ 6.19 $ 5.55 $ 6.05 $ 6.58 $ 7.76 $ 8.94 $ 8.53 $ 7.78 (in $ per Mcf) Natural Gas Prices by Month 2004 Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Index $ 6.15 $ 5.77 $ 5.15 $ 5.37 $ 5.94 $ 6.68 $ 6.14 $ 6.04 $ 5.08 $ 5.79 $ 7.63 $ 7.78 2004 $ 5.23 $ 5.23 $ 5.17 $ 4.88 $ 4.96 $ 5.23 $ 5.39 $ 5.21 $ 4.54 $ 5.29 $ 5.63 $ 5.55 Prices for crude oil have followed a similar path as the commodity price continued to maintain strength in 2004 and rose further in 2005. The tables below contain the NYMEX monthly average crude oil price (Index) and our realized per barrel (Bbl) crude oil prices by month for 2004 and 2005. The 2004 and 2005 price is the crude oil price per Bbl realized by us and includes the realized impact of our crude oil derivative arrangements: (in $ per Bbl) Crude Oil Prices by Month 2005 Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Index $ 46.85 $ 48.05 $ 54.63 $ 53.22 $ 49.87 $ 56.42 $ 59.03 $ 64.99 $ 65.55 $ 62.27 $ 58.34 $ 59.45 2005 $ 38.18 $ 40.57 $ 47.30 $ 44.95 $ 41.88 $ 44.58 $ 46.24 $ 46.62 $ 45.05 $ 45.92 $ 45.59 $ 43.70 (in $ per Bbl) Crude Oil Prices by Month 2004 Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Index $ 34.23 $ 34.50 $ 36.72 $ 36.62 $ 40.28 $ 38.05 $ 40.81 $ 44.88 $ 45.94 $ 53.09 $ 48.48 $ 43.26 2004 $ 30.62 $ 30.66 $ 31.62 $ 30.97 $ 30.80 $ 31.51 $ 31.43 $ 33.00 $ 31.61 $ 32.87 $ 33.15 $ 30.46 We reported earnings of $3.04 per share, or $148.4 million, for 2005. This is up from the $1.81 per share, or $88.4 million, reported in 2004. The stronger price environment was a primary contributor to the earnings increase due to the increase in natural gas and oil revenues. Prices, including the realized impact of derivative instruments, rose 30% for natural gas and 40% for oil. We drilled 316 gross wells with a success rate of 95% in 2005 compared to 256 gross wells with a 95% success rate in 2004. Total capital and exploration expenditures increased by $166.1 million to $425.6 million, of which $73.1 million was for property acquisitions, in 2005 compared to $259.5 million for 2004. We believe our operating cash flow in 2006 will be sufficient to fund our capital and exploration budgeted spending of approximately $396 million and again provide excess cash flow. Any excess cash flow may be used for acquisitions, to pay current debt due, repurchase common stock, expand our capital program or other opportunities. Our 2006 strategy will remain consistent with 2005. We will remain focused on our strategies of balancing our capital investments between higher risk projects with the potential for higher returns and lower risk projects with more stable returns, along with balancing longer life investments with impact exploration opportunities. In the current year we have allocated our planned program for capital and exploration expenditures among our various operating regions. We believe these strategies are appropriate in the current industry environment and will continue to add shareholder value over the long term. The preceding paragraphs, discussing our strategic pursuits and goals, contain forward looking information. Please read Forward Looking Information for further details. 30 Table of Contents FINANCIAL CONDITION Capital Resources and Liquidity Our primary source of cash in 2005 was from funds generated from operations, as well as borrowings on our revolving credit facility and, to a lesser extent, proceeds from the exercise of stock options under our stock plans. We generate cash from the sale of natural gas and crude oil. Operating cash flow fluctuations are substantially driven by commodity prices and changes in our production volumes. Prices for crude oil and natural gas have historically been subject to seasonal influences characterized by peak demand and higher prices in the winter heating season; however, the impact of other risks and uncertainties have influenced prices throughout the recent years. Working capital is also substantially influenced by these variables. During 2005, approximately 1.4 Bcfe of expected production in our Gulf Coast region was deferred due to the impacts of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. These hurricanes did not have a material adverse impact on our capital resources nor liquidity. Fluctuation in cash flow may result in an increase or decrease in our capital and exploration expenditures. See Results of Operations for a review of the impact of prices and volumes on sales. Cash flows provided by operating activities were primarily used to fund exploration and development expenditures, purchase treasury stock and pay dividends. Proceeds from the exercise of stock options under stock option plans during 2005 partially offset our repurchase of 452,300 treasury shares of common stock at a weighted average purchase price of $42.41. See below for additional discussion and analysis of cash flow. Year Ended December 31, (In thousands) 2005 2004 2003 Cash Flows Provided by Operating Activities $ 364,560 $ 273,022 $ 241,638 Cash Flows Used by Investing Activities (412,150 ) (255,357 ) (151,856 ) Cash Flows Provided / (Used) by Financing Activities 48,190 (8,363 ) (90,660 ) Net Increase / (Decrease) in Cash and Cash Equivalents $ 600 $ 9,302 $ (878 ) Operating Activities. Net cash provided by operating activities in 2005 increased $91.5 million over 2004. This increase is primarily due to higher commodity prices. Key components impacting net operating cash flows are commodity prices, production volumes and operating costs. Average realized natural gas prices increased 30% over 2004, while crude oil realized prices increased 40% over the same period. Production volumes declined slightly, with a less than one percent reduction of equivalent production in 2005 compared to 2004. While we believe 2006 commodity production may exceed 2005 levels, we are unable to predict future commodity prices, and as a result cannot provide any assurance about future levels of net cash provided by operating activities. Net cash provided by operating activities in 2004 increased $31.4 million over 2003. This increase is primarily due to higher commodity prices. Key components of net operating cash flows are commodity prices, production volumes and operating costs. Average realized natural gas prices increased 15% over 2003, while crude oil realized prices increased 7% over the same period. Production volumes declined, with a 5% reduction of equivalent production in 2004 compared to 2003. See Results of Operations for a discussion on commodity prices and a review of the impact of prices and volumes on sales revenue. Investing Activities. The primary uses of cash by investing activities are capital spending and exploration expense. We establish the budget for these amounts based on our current estimate of future commodity prices. Due to the volatility of commodity prices, our capital expenditures may be periodically adjusted during any given year. Cash flows used in investing activities increased for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 in the amounts of $156.8 million and $103.5 million, respectively. The increase from 2004 to 2005 is primarily due to an increase in drilling activity in the East region and the Rocky Mountains area of our West region in response to higher commodity prices. Our continued drilling activity in Canada also contributed to the increase. In addition, we spent $73.1 million in proved property acquisitions, primarily in the Gulf Coast. The increase from 2003 to 2004 was also primarily due to an increase in drilling activity in response to higher commodity prices. This increase largely occurred in our East region and the Rocky Mountains area of our West region. Our initial drilling activity in Canada also contributed to the increase. 31 Table of Contents Financing Activities. Cash flows provided by financing activities were $48.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, resulting from borrowings under the credit facility, partially offset by the purchase of treasury stock and dividend payments. Cash flows used by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2004 were $8.4 million. This is the result of proceeds from the exercise of stock options, offset by the purchase of treasury shares and dividend payments. Cash flows used by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2003 were $90.7 million. This is substantially due to a net repayment on our revolving credit facility in the amount of $95.0 million. Cash utilized for the repayments was generated from operating cash flows. At December 31, 2005, we had $90 million of debt outstanding under our credit facility. The credit facility provides for an available credit line of $250 million, which can be expanded up to $350 million, either with the existing banks or new banks. The available credit line is subject to adjustment on the basis of the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves (as determined by the banks petroleum engineer) and other assets. The revolving term of the credit facility ends in December 2009. We strive to manage our debt at a level below the available credit line in order to maintain excess borrowing capacity. Management believes that we have the ability to finance through new debt or equity offerings, if necessary, our capital requirements, including potential acquisitions. In August 1998, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of two million shares of our common stock in the open market or in negotiated transactions. As a result of the 3 for 2 stock split effected in March 2005, this figure has been adjusted to three million shares. During 2005, we repurchased 452,300 shares of our common stock at a weighted average price of $42.41. All purchases executed to date have been through open market transactions. There is no expiration date associated with the authorization to repurchase our securities. The maximum number of shares that may yet be purchased under the plan as of December 31, 2005 was 1,486,150. See Item 5 Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities for additional information. Capitalization Information about our capitalization is as follows: December 31, (In millions) 2005 2004 Debt (1) $ 340.0 $ 270.0 Stockholders Equity 600.2 455.7 Total Capitalization $ 940.2 $ 725.7 Debt to Capitalization 36 % 37 % Cash and Cash Equivalents $ 10.6 $ 10.0 (1) Includes $20.0 million of current portion of long term debt at both December 31, 2005 and 2004. Includes $90 million of borrowings under our revolving credit facility at December 31, 2005. There were no borrowings under our revolving credit facility at December 31, 2004. For the year ended December 31, 2005, we paid dividends of $7.2 million on our common stock. A regular dividend of $0.04 per share of common stock, or $0.027 per share for dividends prior to the 3 for 2 stock split as adjusted for the split, has been declared for each quarter since we became a public company. Capital and Exploration Expenditures On an annual basis, we generally fund most of our capital and exploration activities, excluding significant oil and gas property acquisitions, with cash generated from operations and, when necessary, our revolving credit facility. We budget these capital expenditures based on our projected cash flows for the year. 32 Table of Contents The following table presents major components of our capital and exploration expenditures for the three years ended December 31, 2005. (In millions) 2005 2004 2003 Capital Expenditures Drilling and Facilities $ 249.3 $ 174.0 $ 102.0 Leasehold Acquisitions 22.1 18.3 14.1 Pipeline and Gathering 17.9 13.5 10.6 Other 1.4 1.6 1.8 290.7 207.4 128.5 Proved Property Acquisitions 73.1 4.0 1.5 Exploration Expense 61.8 48.1 58.2 Total $ 425.6 $ 259.5 $ 188.2 We plan to drill about 391 gross wells in 2006 compared with 316 gross wells drilled in 2005. This 2006 drilling program includes approximately $396 million in total capital and exploration expenditures, down from $425.6 million in 2005. Capital and exploration expenditures in 2005 included a layer of $73.1 million in proved property acquisitions as shown in the table above. We will continue to assess the natural gas price environment and may increase or decrease the capital and exploration expenditures accordingly. There are many factors that impact our depreciation, depletion and amortization rate. These include reserve additions and revisions, development costs, impairments and changes in anticipated production in a future period. In 2006 management expects an increase in our depreciation, depletion and amortization rate due to negative reserve revisions and higher capital costs. This change may result in an increase of depreciation, depletion and amortization of 10% to 15% greater than 2005 levels. This increase will not have an impact on our cash flows. Contractual Obligations Our known material contractual obligations include long term debt, interest on long term debt, firm gas transportation agreements, drilling rig commitments and operating leases. We have no off balance sheet debt or other similar unrecorded obligations, and we have not guaranteed the debt of any other party. A summary of our known contractual obligations as of December 31, 2005 are set forth in the following table: Payments Due by Year 2007 2009 2011 & (In thousands) Total 2006 to 2008 to 2010 Beyond Long Term Debt (1) $ 340,000 $ 20,000 $ 40,000 $ 110,000 $ 170,000 Interest on Long Term Debt (2) 132,960 24,632 44,950 32,673 30,705 Firm Gas Transportation Agreements (3) 93,766 11,661 19,839 6,762 55,504 Drilling Rig Commitments (3) 104,315 26,055 68,585 9,675 Operating Leases 17,746 4,876 9,174 3,696 Total Contractual Cash Obligations $ 688,787 $ 87,224 $ 182,548 $ 162,806 $ 256,209 (1) Including current portion. At December 31, 2005, we had $90 million of outstanding debt on our revolving credit facility. See Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for details of long term debt. (2) Interest payments have been calculated utilizing the fixed rates of our $250 million long term debt outstanding at December 31, 2005. Interest payments on the $90 million of outstanding borrowings on our revolving credit facility were calculated by assuming that the December 31, 2005 outstanding balance of $90 million will be outstanding through the 2009 maturity date and by assuming a constant interest rate of 7.25% which was the December 31, 2005 interest rate. Actual results will likely differ from these estimates and assumptions. (3) For further information on our obligations under firm gas transportation agreements and drilling rig commitments, see Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 33 Table of Contents Amounts related to our asset retirement obligations are not included in the above table given the uncertainty regarding the actual timing of such expenditures. The total amount of asset retirement obligations at December 31, 2005 is $43.0 million. Subsequent to December 31, 2005, we entered into an agreement for one additional drilling rig in the Gulf Coast. The total commitment over the next four years is $27.4 million, of which $0.8 million, $9.1 million, $9.1 million and $8.4 million will be paid out during the years 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009, respectively. Potential Impact of Our Critical Accounting Policies Readers of this document and users of the information contained in it should be aware of how certain events may impact our financial results based on the accounting policies in place. The most significant policies are discussed below. Oil and Gas Reserves The process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is inherently uncertain, and the reserve data included in this document are only estimates. The process relies on interpretations of available geologic, geophysic, engineering and production data. The extent, quality and reliability of this technical data can vary. The degree of uncertainty varies among the three regions in which we operate. The estimation of reserves in the Gulf Coast region requires more estimates than the East and West regions and inherently has more uncertainty surrounding reserve estimation. The differences in the reserve estimation process are substantially due to the geological conditions in which the wells are drilled. The process also requires certain economic assumptions, some of which are mandated by the SEC, such as oil and gas prices. Additional assumptions include drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes and availability of funds. The accuracy of a reserve estimate is a function of: the quality and quantity of available data; the interpretation of that data; the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions; and the judgment of the persons preparing the estimate. Since 1990, 100% of our reserves have been reviewed by Miller & Lents, Ltd., an independent oil and gas reservoir engineering consulting firm, who in their opinion determined the estimates presented to be reasonable in the aggregate. We have not been required to record a significant reserve revision in the past three years. For more information regarding reserve estimation, including historical reserve revisions, refer to the Supplemental Oil and Gas Information. Our rate of recording depreciation, depletion and amortization expense (DD&A) is dependent upon our estimate of proved reserves, which is utilized in our unit of production method calculation. If the estimates of proved reserves were to be reduced, the rate at which we record DD&A expense would increase, reducing net income. Such a reduction in reserves may result from lower market prices, which may make it non economic to drill for and produce higher cost fields. A five percent positive or negative revision to proved reserves throughout the Company would decrease or increase the DD&A rate by approximately $0.05 to $0.06 per Mcfe. Revisions in significant fields may individually affect our DD&A rate. It is estimated that a positive or negative reserve revision of 10% in one of our most productive fields would have a $0.01 impact on our total DD&A rate. These estimated impacts are based on current data, and actual events could require different adjustments to DD&A. In addition, a decline in proved reserve estimates may impact the outcome of our annual impairment test under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. Due to the inherent imprecision of the reserve estimation process, risks associated with the operations of proved producing properties, and market sensitive commodity prices utilized in our impairment analysis, management cannot determine if an impairment is reasonably likely to occur in the future. 34 Table of Contents Carrying Value of Oil and Gas Properties We evaluate the impairment of our oil and gas properties on a lease by lease basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an assets carrying amount may not be recoverable. We compare expected undiscounted future cash flows to the net book value of the asset. If the future undiscounted cash flows, based on our estimate of future crude oil and natural gas prices, operating costs and anticipated production from proved reserves are lower than the net book value of the asset, the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value. Commodity pricing is estimated by using a combination of historical and current prices adjusted for geographical location and quality differentials, as well as other factors that management believes will impact realizable prices. Fair value is calculated by discounting the future cash flows. In 2003, we significantly revised the estimated cash flow utilized in our impairment review of the Kurten field due to a loss of a reversionary interest in the field. In December 2003, our remaining interest in the field was sold. For additional discussion on the Kurten field impairment see Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In 2004 and 2005, there were no unusual or unexpected occurrences that caused significant revisions in estimated cash flows which were utilized in our impairment test. Costs attributable to our unproved properties are not subject to the impairment analysis described above; however, a portion of the costs associated with such properties is subject to amortization based on past experience and average property lives. Average property lives are determined on a regional basis and based on the estimated life of unproved property leasehold rights. Historically, the average property lives in each of the regions have not significantly changed. If the average unproved property life decreases or increases by one year, the amortization would increase by approximately $2.7 million or decrease by approximately $1.6 million, respectively per year. In the past, the average leasehold life in the Gulf Coast region has been shorter than the average life in the East and West regions. Average property lives in the Gulf Coast, East and West regions have been four, seven and seven years, respectively. Average property lives in Canada are estimated to be six years. As these properties are developed and reserves are proven, the remaining capitalized costs are subject to depreciation and depletion. If the development of these properties is deemed unsuccessful, the capitalized costs related to the unsuccessful activity is expensed in the year the determination is made. The rate at which the unproved properties are written off depends on the timing and success of our future exploration program. Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities Periodically we enter into derivative commodity instruments to hedge our exposure to price fluctuations on natural gas and crude oil production. We follow the accounting prescribed in SFAS No. 133. Under SFAS No. 133, the fair value of each derivative instrument is recorded as either an asset or liability on the balance sheet. At the end of each quarterly period, these instruments are marked to market. The gain or loss on the change in fair value is recorded as Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, a component of equity, to the extent that the derivative instrument is designated as a hedge and is effective. Under SFAS No. 133, effectiveness is a measurement of how closely correlated the hedge instrument is with the underlying physical sale. For example, a natural gas price swap that converts Henry Hub index to a fixed price would be perfectly correlated, and 100% effective, if the underlying gas were sold at the Henry Hub index. Any portion of the gains or losses that are considered ineffective under the SFAS No. 133 test are recorded immediately as a component of Operating Revenue, either in Natural Gas Production or Crude Oil and Condensate Revenue, on the Statement of Operations. Long Term Employee Benefit Costs Our costs of long term employee benefits, particularly pension and postretirement benefits, are incurred over long periods of time, and involve many uncertainties over those periods. The net periodic benefit cost attributable to current periods is based on several assumptions about such future uncertainties, and is sensitive to changes in those assumptions. It is managements responsibility, often with the assistance of independent experts, to select assumptions that in its judgment represent best estimates of those uncertainties. It also is managements responsibility to review those assumptions periodically to reflect changes in economic or other factors that affect those assumptions. The current benefit service costs, as well as the existing liabilities, for pensions and other postretirement benefits are measured on a discounted present value basis. The discount rate is a current rate, related to the rate at which the liabilities could be settled. Our assumed discount rate is based on average rates of return published for a theoretical portfolio of high quality fixed income securities. In order to select the discount rate, we use benchmarks such as the 35 Table of Contents Moodys Aa Corporate Rate, which was 5.48% annualized for 2005, and the Citigroup Pension Liability Index, which was 5.55% for 2005. We look to these benchmarks as well as considering durations of expected benefit payments. We have determined based on these assumptions that a discount rate of 5.5% at December 31, 2005 is reasonable. In order to value our pension liabilities, we use the RP 2000 mortality table. This is a widely accepted table used for valuing pension liabilities. This table represents a more recent and conservative mortality table than the prior years 1983 Group Annuity Mortality Table, and appears to be an appropriate table based on the demographics of our benefit plans. Another consideration that is made is a salary scale selection. We have assumed that salaries will increase 4% based on our expectation of future salary increases. The benefit obligation and the periodic cost of postretirement medical benefits also are measured based on assumed rates of future increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits. As of December 31, 2005, the assumed rate of increase was 9.0%. The net periodic cost of pension benefits included in expense also is affected by the expected long term rate of return on plan assets assumption. The expected return on plan assets rate is normally changed less frequently than the assumed discount rate, and reflects long term expectations, rather than current fluctuations in market conditions. The actual rate of return on plan assets may differ from the expected rate due to the volatility normally experienced in capital markets. Managements goal is to manage the investments over the long term to achieve optimal returns with an acceptable level of risk and volatility. We have established objectives regarding plan assets in the pension plan. In our pension calculations, we have used 8% as the expected long term return on plan assets for 2005, 2004 and 2003. However, we expect to achieve a minimum 5% annual real rate of return on the total portfolio over the long term. We believe that this is a reasonable estimate based on our actual results. The actual rate of return on plan assets annualized over the past ten years is approximately 10%. We generally target a portfolio of assets that are within a range of approximately 60% to 80% for equity securities and approximately 20% to 40% for fixed income securities. Large capitalization equities may make up a maximum of 65% of the portfolio. Small capitalization equities and international equities may make up a maximum of 30% and 15%, respectively, of the portfolio. Fixed income bonds may make up a maximum of 40% of our portfolio. Stock Based Compensation Prior to the issuance of SFAS No. 123(R) Share Based Payment (revised 2004), there were two alternative methods that could be used to account for stock based compensation. The first method is the Intrinsic Value method and recognizes compensation cost as the excess, if any, of the quoted market price of our stock at the grant date over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock. The second method is the Fair Value method. Under the fair value method, compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of an award and is recognized over the service period, which is usually the vesting period. As of December 31, 2005, we account for stock based compensation in accordance with the Intrinsic Value method. SFAS No. 123(R) requires that the fair value of stock options and any other equity based compensation must be expensed at the grant date. To calculate the fair value, either a binomial or Black Scholes valuation model may be used. We currently expense performance share awards; however, beginning in the first quarter of 2006, we will be required to expense all stock based compensation. Further discussion of SFAS No. 123(R) and stock compensation is included in Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements. On October 26, 2005, the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors approved the acceleration to December 15, 2005 of the vesting of 198,799 unvested stock options awarded in February 2003 under our Second Amended and Restated 1994 Long Term Incentive Plan and 24,500 unvested stock options awarded in April 2004 under our 2004 Incentive Plan. The 198,799 shares awarded to employees under the 1994 plan at an exercise price of $15.32 would have vested in February 2006. The 24,500 shares awarded to non employee directors under the 2004 plan at an exercise price of $23.32 would have vested 12,250 shares in April 2006 and April 2007, respectively. The decision to accelerate the vesting of these unvested options, which we believed to be in the best interest of our shareholders and employees, was made solely to reduce compensation expense and administrative burden associated with our adoption of SFAS No. 123(R). 36 Table of Contents The accelerated vesting of the options did not have an impact on our results of operations or cash flows for 2005. The acceleration of vesting is expected to reduce our compensation expense related to these options by approximately $0.2 million for 2006. OTHER ISSUES AND CONTINGENCIES Corporate Income Tax. We have benefited in the past and may benefit in the future from the alternative minimum tax (AMT) relief granted under the Comprehensive National Energy Policy Act of 1992 (the Act). The Act repealed provisions of the AMT requiring a taxpayers alternative minimum taxable income to be increased on account of certain intangible drilling costs (IDC) and percentage depletion deductions for corporations other than integrated oil companies. The repeal of these provisions generally applies to taxable years beginning after 1992. The repeal of the excess IDC preference can not reduce a taxpayers alternative minimum taxable income by more than 40% of the amount of such income determined without regard to the repeal of such preference. Regulations. Our operations are subject to various types of regulation by federal, state and local authorities. See Regulation of Oil and Natural Gas Exploration and Production, Natural Gas Marketing, Gathering and Transportation, Federal Regulation of Petroleum and Environmental Regulations in the Other Business Matters section of Item 1 Business for a discussion of these regulations. Restrictive Covenants. Our ability to incur debt and to make certain types of investments is subject to certain restrictive covenants in the Companys various debt instruments. Among other requirements, our revolving credit agreement and our senior notes specify a minimum annual coverage ratio of operating cash flow to interest expense for the trailing four quarters of 2.8 to 1.0. At December 31, 2005, we are in compliance in all material respects with all restrictive covenants on both the revolving credit agreement and notes. In the unforeseen event that we fail to comply with these covenants, the Company may apply for a temporary waiver with the lender, which, if granted, would allow us a period of time to remedy the situation. See further discussion in Capital Resources and Liquidity. Limited Partnership. As part of the 2001 Cody acquisition, we acquired an interest in certain oil and gas properties in the Kurten field, as general partner of a partnership and as an operator. We had approximately a 25% interest in the field, including a one percent interest in the partnership. Under the partnership agreement, we had the right to a reversionary working interest that would bring our ultimate interest to 50% upon the limited partner reaching payout. Based on the addition of this reversionary interest, and because the field has over a 40 year reserve life, approximately $91 million was allocated to this field under purchase accounting at the time of the acquisition. Additionally, the limited partner had the sole option to trigger a liquidation of the partnership. Effective February 13, 2003, liquidation of the partnership commenced at the election of the limited partner. The limited partner was a financial entity and not an industry operator. Their decision to liquidate was based upon their perception that the value of their investment in the partnership had increased due to an increase in underlying commodity prices, primarily oil, since their investment in 1999. We proceeded with the liquidation to avoid having a minority interest in a non operated water flood field for which the new operator was not designated at the time of liquidation. In connection with the liquidation, an appraisal was required to be obtained to allocate the interest in the partnership assets. Additionally, we were required to test the field for recoverability in accordance with SFAS No. 144. Pursuant to the terms of the partnership agreement and based on the appraised value of the partnership assets it was not possible for us to obtain the reversionary interest as part of the liquidation. Due to the impact of the loss of the reversionary interest on future estimated net cash flows of the Kurten field, the limited partners decision and our decision to proceed with the liquidation, an impairment review was performed which required an impairment charge in the first quarter of 2003 of $87.9 million ($54.4 million after tax). This impairment charge is reflected in the 2003 Statement of Operations as an operating expense but did not impact our cash flows. Operating Risks and Insurance Coverage. Our business involves a variety of operating risks. See Risk Factors We face a variety of hazards and risks that could cause substantial financial losses in Item 1A. In accordance with customary industry practice, we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these risks and losses. The occurrence of any of these events not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations. The costs of these insurance policies are somewhat dependent on our historical claims experience and also the areas in which we choose to operate. During the past few years, we have invested a significant portion of our drilling dollars in the Gulf Coast, where insurance rates are significantly higher than in other regions such as the East. 37 Table of Contents Commodity Pricing and Risk Management Activities. Our revenues, operating results, financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital depend substantially on prevailing prices for natural gas and, to a lesser extent, oil. Declines in oil and gas prices may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity, ability to obtain financing and operating results. Lower oil and gas prices also may reduce the amount of oil and gas that we can produce economically. Historically, oil and gas prices and markets have been volatile, with prices fluctuating widely, and they are likely to continue to be volatile. Depressed prices in the future would have a negative impact on our future financial results. In particular, substantially lower prices would significantly reduce revenue and could potentially impact the outcome of our annual impairment test under SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. Because our reserves are predominantly natural gas, changes in natural gas prices may have a particularly large impact on our financial results. The majority of our production is sold at market responsive prices. Generally, if the commodity indexes fall, the price that we receive for our production will also decline. Therefore, the amount of revenue that we realize is partially determined by factors beyond our control. However, management may mitigate this price risk with the use of derivative financial instruments. Most recently, we have used financial instruments such as price collar and swap arrangements to reduce the impact of declining prices on our revenue. Under both arrangements, there is also risk that the movement of the index prices will result in the Company not being able to realize the full benefit of a market improvement. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In March 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations. This Interpretation clarifies the definition and treatment of conditional asset retirement obligations as discussed in SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations. A conditional asset retirement obligation is defined as an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are dependent on future events that may be outside the control of the Company. FIN No. 47 states that a company must record a liability when incurred for conditional asset retirement obligations if the fair value of the obligation is reasonably estimable. This Interpretation is intended to provide more information about long lived assets, more information about future cash outflows for these obligations and more consistent recognition of these liabilities. FIN No. 47 is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2005. Our financial position, results of operations and cash flows were not impacted by this Interpretation, since we currently record all asset retirement obligations. On April 4, 2005, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) FAS 19 1 Accounting for Suspended Well Costs. This staff position amends FASB Statement No. 19 Financial Accounting and Reporting by Oil and Gas Producing Companies and provides guidance about exploratory well costs to companies who use the successful efforts method of accounting. The position states that exploratory well costs should continue to be capitalized if: 1) a sufficient quantity of reserves are discovered in the well to justify its completion as a producing well and 2) sufficient progress is made in assessing the reserves and the wells economic and operating feasibility. If the exploratory well costs do not meet both of these criteria, these costs should be expensed, net of any salvage value. Additional annual disclosures are required to provide information about managements evaluation of capitalized exploratory well costs. In addition, the Staff Position requires the annual disclosure of: 1) net changes from period to period of capitalized exploratory well costs for wells that are pending the determination of proved reserves, 2) the amount of exploratory well costs that have been capitalized for a period greater than one year after the completion of drilling and 3) an aging of exploratory well costs suspended for greater than one year with the number of wells it related to. Further, the disclosures should describe the activities undertaken to evaluate the reserves and the projects, the information still required to classify the associated reserves as proved and the estimated timing for completing the evaluation. For our disclosures, refer to Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections A replacement of APB Opinion No. 20 and FASB Statement No. 3. In order to enhance financial reporting consistency between periods, SFAS No. 154 modifies the requirements for the accounting and reporting of the direct effects of changes in accounting principles. Under APB Opinion No. 20, the cumulative effect of voluntary changes in accounting principle 38 Table of Contents was recognized in Net Income in the period of the change. Unlike the treatment previously prescribed by APB Opinion No. 20, retrospective application is now required, unless it is not practical to determine the specific effects in each period or the cumulative effect. If the period specific effects cannot be determined, it is required that the new accounting principle must be retrospectively applied in the earliest period possible to the balance sheet accounts and a corresponding adjustment be made to the opening balance of retained earnings or another equity account. If the cumulative effect cannot be determined, it is necessary to apply the new accounting principles prospectively at the earliest practical date. If it is not feasible to retrospectively apply the change in principle, the reason that this is not possible and the method used to report the change is required to be disclosed. The statement also provides that changes in accounting for depreciation, depletion or amortization should be treated as changes in accounting estimate inseparable from a change in accounting principle and that disclosure of the preferability of the change is required. SFAS No. 154 is effective for accounting changes made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123(R), Share Based Payment. SFAS No. 123(R) revises SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, and focuses on accounting for share based payments for services provided by employee to employer. The statement requires companies to expense the fair value of employee stock options and other equity based compensation at the grant date. The statement does not require a certain type of valuation model, and either a binomial or Black Scholes model may be used. During the first quarter of 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved a new rule for public companies to delay the adoption of this standard. In April 2005, the SEC took further action to amend Regulation S X to state that the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R) will be effective beginning with the first annual or interim reporting period of the registrants first fiscal year beginning on or after June 15, 2005 for all non small business issuers. As a result, we will not adopt this SFAS until the first quarter of 2006. We plan to use the modified prospective application method as detailed in SFAS No. 123(R). At this time, management does not believe that the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) will materially impact our operating results, nor will there be any impact on our future cash flows. See Stock Based Compensation below for further information. In October 2005, the FASB issued FSP FAS 123(R) 2, Practical Accommodation to the Application of Grant Date as defined in FASB Statement No. 123(R). This FSP provides guidance on the definition and practical application of grant date as described in SFAS No. 123(R). The grant date is described as the date that the employee and employer have met a mutual understanding of the key terms and conditions of an award. The other elements of the definition of grant date are: 1) the award must be authorized, 2) the employer must be obligated to transfer assets or distribute equity instruments so long as the employee has provided the necessary service and 3) the employee is affected by changes in the companys stock price. To determine the grant date, we are allowed to use the date the award is approved in accordance with our corporate governance requirements so long as the three elements described above are met. Furthermore, the recipient cannot negotiate the awards terms and conditions with the employer and the key terms and conditions of the award are communicated to all recipients within a reasonably short time period from the approval date. We will adopt this FSP in conjunction with the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R). In November 2005, the FASB issued FSP FAS 123(R) 3 Transition Election Related to Accounting for the Tax Effects of Share Based Payment Awards, which provides a simpler, more practical transition election relating to the calculation of the APIC pool. The APIC pool is defined as the pool of excess tax benefits available to absorb tax deficiencies occurring after the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R). Under this FSP, companies can elect to perform simpler computations to derive the beginning balance of the APIC pool as well as the impact on the APIC pool of fully vested and outstanding awards as of the SFAS No. 123(R) adoption date. The beginning balance can be computed by taking the sum of all tax benefits incurred prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) from stock based compensation plans less the tax effected (using a blended statutory rate) pro forma stock based compensation cost. In addition, increases to the APIC pool for fully vested awards can be calculated by multiplying the tax rate times the tax benefit of the deduction. The calculation of any awards that are partially vested or granted after the SFAS No. 123(R) adoption date will not be affected by this FSP and will be calculated in accordance with SFAS No. 123(R) which requires that only the excess tax benefit or deficiency of the tax deduction over the tax effect of the compensation cost recognized should be considered for the APIC pool. Also under the FSP, all tax benefits recognized on fully vested awards and the excess tax benefits for partially vested and new awards will be reported on the Statement of Cash Flows as a component of financing activities. Companies will have up to one year after adopting SFAS No. 123(R) to decide to elect and disclose whether they plan to use the alternative method or the original method prescribed in SFAS No. 123(R) for the calculation of the APIC pool. We will adopt this FSP in conjunction with the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R). 39 Table of Contents In February 2006, the FASB issued FSP FAS 123(R) 4, Classification of Options and Similar Instruments Issued as Employee Compensation That Allow for Cash Settlement upon the Occurrence of a Contingent Event. Within certain share based payment plans, a company can be required to settle outstanding options upon the occurrence of certain events, such as a change in control or liquidity of a company or the death or disability of the shareholder. This FSP amends paragraphs 32 and A229 of SFAS No. 123(R) to incorporate a probability assessment by a company. Under SFAS No. 123(R), it is required that options and similar instruments be classified as liabilities if the entity can be required under any circumstances to settle the instrument in cash or other assets. Under the FSP, a cash settlement feature that can be exercised only upon the occurrence of a contingent event that is outside of the employees control does not meet the criteria for liability classification, and should remain to be classified in equity, unless it becomes probable that the contingent event will occur. The effective date for the guidance in this FSP is upon the initial adoption of SFAS No. 123(R). We will adopt this FSP in conjunction with the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R). * * * Forward Looking Information The statements regarding future financial and operating performance and results, market prices, future hedging activities, and other statements that are not historical facts contained in this report are forward looking statements. The words expect, project, estimate, believe, anticipate, intend, budget, plan, forecast, predict, may, should, could, will and similar expressions are also intended to identify forward looking statements. Such statements involve risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, market factors, market prices (including regional basis differentials) of natural gas and oil, results for future drilling and marketing activity, future production and costs and other factors detailed herein and in our other Securities and Exchange Commission filings.

Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual outcomes may vary materially from those indicated. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 2005 and 2004 Compared We reported net income for the year ended December 31, 2005 of $148.4 million, or $3.04 per share. During 2004, we reported net income of $88.4 million, or $1.81 per share. Operating income increased by $98.0 million compared to the prior year, from $160.7 million to $258.7 million. The increase in operating income from 2004 to 2005 was principally due to an increase in natural gas and oil production revenues partially offset by an increase in total operating expenses. Net income increased from 2004 to 2005 by $60.0 million due to an increase in operating income partially offset by an increase of $37.6 million in income tax expense. Natural Gas Production Revenues Our average total company realized natural gas production sales price, including the realized impact of derivative instruments, was $6.74 per Mcf compared to $5.20 per Mcf for the comparable period of the prior year. These prices include the realized impact of derivative instruments, which reduced these prices by $1.33 per Mcf in 2005 and $0.76 per Mcf in 2004. The following table excludes the unrealized gain from the change in derivative fair value of $1.1 million and $0.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. These unrealized changes in fair value have been included in the Natural Gas Production Revenues line item in the Statement of Operations. 40 Table of Contents Year EndedDecember 31, Variance 2005 2004 Amount Percent Natural Gas Production (Mmcf) Gulf Coast 28,071 31,358 (3,287 ) (10 )% West 23,224 21,866 1,358 6 % East 21,435 19,442 1,993 10 % Canada 1,149 167 982 588 % Total Company 73,879 72,833 1,046 1 % Natural Gas Production Sales Price ($/Mcf) Gulf Coast $ 6.38 $ 5.27 $ 1.11 21 % West $ 6.00 $ 4.75 $ 1.25 26 % East $ 8.02 $ 5.60 $ 2.42 43 % Canada $ 6.79 $ 4.69 $ 2.10 45 % Total Company $ 6.74 $ 5.20 $ 1.54 30 % Natural Gas Production Revenue (in thousands) Gulf Coast $ 179,061 $ 165,177 $ 13,884 8 % West 139,298 103,851 35,447 34 % East 171,902 108,935 62,967 58 % Canada 7,802 784 7,018 895 % Total Company $ 498,063 $ 378,747 $ 119,316 32 % Price Variance Impact on Natural Gas Production Revenue (in thousands) Gulf Coast $ 31,200 West 28,997 East 51,798 Canada 2,414 Total Company $ 114,409 Volume Variance Impact on Natural Gas Production Revenue (in thousands) Gulf Coast $ (17,317 ) West 6,448 East 11,170 Canada 4,606 Total Company $ 4,907 The increase in Natural Gas Production Revenue is due substantially to the increase in natural gas sales prices. In addition, the slight increase in production was due to the successful drilling programs in the East, West and Canada. Partially offsetting this was the decrease in the Gulf Coast production. The increase in the realized natural gas price combined with the increase in production resulted in a net revenue increase of $119.3 million. 41 Table of Contents Brokered Natural Gas Revenue and Cost Year EndedDecember 31, Variance 2005 2004 Amount Percent Sales Price ($/Mcf) $ 9.14 $ 6.56 $ 2.58 39 % Volume Brokered (Mmcf) 10,793 12,876 (2,083 ) (16 )% Brokered Natural Gas Revenues (in thousands) $ 98,605 $ 84,416 Purchase Price ($/Mcf) $ 8.08 $ 5.84 $ 2.24 38 % Volume Brokered (Mmcf) 10,793 12,876 (2,083 ) (16 )% Brokered Natural Gas Cost (in thousands) $ 87,183 $ 75,217 Brokered Natural Gas Margin (in thousands) $ 11,422 $ 9,199 $ 2,223 24 % (in thousands) Sales Price Variance Impact on Revenue $ 27,852 Volume Variance Impact on Revenue (13,664 ) $ 14,188 (in thousands) Purchase Price Variance Impact on Purchases $ (24,130 ) Volume Variance Impact on Purchases 12,165 $ (11,965 ) The increased brokered natural gas margin of $2.2 million was driven by an increased sales price that outpaced the increase in purchase cost, offset in part by a decrease in volume. 42 Table of Contents Crude Oil and Condensate Revenues Our average total company realized crude oil sales price for 2005, including the realized impact of derivative instruments, was $44.19 per Bbl compared to $31.55 per Bbl for 2004. These prices include the realized impact of derivative instruments, which reduced these prices by $9.93 per Bbl in 2005 and $8.98 per Bbl in 2004. The following table excludes the unrealized gain from the change in derivative fair value of $5.5 million and the unrealized loss from the change in derivative fair value of $2.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. These unrealized changes in fair value have been included in the Crude Oil and Condensate Revenues line item in the Statement of Operations.

The decrease in oil production is primarily the result of the decrease in the Gulf Coast region production due to the continued natural decline of the CL&F lease in south Louisiana, as well as the impact of hurricanes which included the shutting in and deferring of production at the Breton Sound offshore lease, one of our largest areas of offshore oil production. 43 Table of Contents Impact of Derivative Instruments on Operating Revenues The following table reflects the realized impact of cash settlements and the net unrealized change in fair value of derivative instruments: Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 Realized Unrealized Realized Unrealized (In thousands) Operating Revenues Increase/(Decrease) to Revenue Cash Flow Hedges Natural Gas Production $ (98,223 ) $ 1,114 $ (54,564 ) $ 137 Crude Oil (2,430 ) (6 ) 6 Total Cash Flow Hedges (100,653 ) 1,108 (54,564 ) 143 Other Derivative Financial Instruments Natural Gas Production (444 ) 777 Crude Oil (14,842 ) 5,518 (17,908 ) (2,923 ) Total Other Derivative Financial Instruments (14,842 ) 5,518 (18,352 ) (2,146 ) $ (115,495 ) $ 6,626 $ (72,916 ) $ (2,003 ) We are exposed to market risk to the extent of changes in market prices of natural gas and oil. However, the market risk exposure on these derivative contracts is generally offset by the gain or loss recognized upon the ultimate sale of the commodity. Other Operating Revenues Other operating revenues decreased $3.6 million. This change was primarily a result of an increase in our payout liability associated with the reduction of our interest due to customary reversionary interest owned by others, which correspondingly decreased other operating revenues. In addition, our revenues from net profits interest declined over the prior year. This revenue variance also results, to a lesser extent, from changes in our wellhead gas imbalances over the previous year. Operating Expenses Total costs and expenses from operations increased $54.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to the year ended December 31, 2004. The primary reasons for this fluctuation are as follows: Exploration expense increased $13.7 million in 2005, primarily as a result of increased dry hole expenses partially offset by decreased spending on geological and geophysical expenses. During 2005, we spent $6.8 million less on geological and geophysical activities but incurred an additional $18.9 million in dry hole expense. In addition, we spent an additional $0.8 million on delay rentals. The increase in dry hole expense is mainly due to expenses incurred in the Gulf Coast and, to a smaller extent, in Canada and the West. Taxes Other Than Income increased by $13.3 million from 2004 compared to 2005, primarily due to increased production taxes as a result of increased commodity prices. Additionally, ad valorem and franchise taxes were higher compared to the prior year. Brokered Natural Gas Cost increased by $12.0 million from 2004 to 2005. See the preceding table labeled Brokered Natural Gas Revenue and Cost for further analysis. Direct Operations expense increased by $8.2 million. This is primarily the result of increased expenses for outside operated properties and workovers. In addition, there were increases over the prior year in maintenance charges, equipment expenses and employee related expenses. Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization increased by $5.1 million in 2005. This is primarily due to an increase in offshore DD&A rates associated with the commencement of offshore production in late 2004 and increased production in the East and West regions. 44 Table of Contents Impairment of Oil and Gas Properties decreased by $3.5 million as we incurred no impairment expense in the current year. The costs incurred in the prior year related to a field in south Louisiana. Further analysis of this impairment is discussed in Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Impairment of Unproved Properties increased $2.8 million over the prior year. This is due to increased amortization related to unproved property additions both offshore and onshore, including an increase in our Canadian additions. General and Administrative expense increased by $2.9 million in 2005. This increase is primarily due to increased stock compensation expense relating to performance share awards, increased professional services fees and higher employee related expenses. Partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in miscellaneous expenses, primarily due to the reversal of the reserve attributable to litigation that was settled in the 2005 period. Interest Expense, Net Interest expense, net increased $0.1 million. Interest expense related to borrowings under our revolving credit facility was higher in the current year due to higher average borrowings. Average borrowings based on month end balances for the 2005 year were approximately $130 million compared to approximately $95 million in the prior year. In addition, the effective interest rate on the credit facility increased to 6.9% during 2005 from 4.2% during the prior year. Partially offsetting this was an increase in interest income on our short term investments. Income Tax Expense Income tax expense increased $37.6 million due to an increase in our pre tax net income. 2004 and 2003 Compared We reported net income for the year ended December 31, 2004 of $88.4 million, or $1.81 per share. During 2003, we reported net income of $21.1 million, or $0.44 per share. Operating income increased by $94.1 million compared to the prior year, from $66.6 million to $160.7 million. The increase in net income and operating income was principally due to decreased operating expenses from 2003 to 2004 related to the decrease in impairments of oil and gas properties of $90.3 million related to the loss in 2003 of a reversionary interest in the Kurten field. In addition, the increases in operating income and net income were due to an increase in our realized natural gas and crude oil prices. Natural Gas Production Revenues Our average total company realized natural gas production sales price, including the realized impact of derivative instruments, was $5.20 per Mcf compared to $4.51 per Mcf for the comparable period of the prior year. These prices include the realized impact of derivative instruments which reduced these prices by $0.76 per Mcf in 2004 and $0.68 per Mcf in 2003. The following table excludes the unrealized gain from the change in derivative fair value of $0.9 million and the unrealized loss of $1.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Natural gas production was up slightly from the prior year and production revenues also increased from 2003. Natural gas production increased slightly in all regions except the West region, where the decline in production was due to lower capital spending in 2003 and continued natural decline. The increases in both sales price and production resulted in an increase in natural gas production revenues of $54.7 million. 46 Table of Contents Brokered Natural Gas Revenue and Cost Year EndedDecember 31, Variance 2004 2003 Amount Percent Sales Price ($/Mcf) $ 6.56 $ 5.16 $ 1.40 27 % Volume Brokered (Mmcf) 12,876 18,557 (5,681 ) (31 )% Brokered Natural Gas Revenues (in thousands) $ 84,416 $ 95,754 Purchase Price ($/Mcf) $ 5.84 $ 4.64 $ 1.20 26 % Volume Brokered (Mmcf) 12,876 18,557 (5,681 ) (31 )% Brokered Natural Gas Cost (in thousands) $ 75,217 $ 86,104 Brokered Natural Gas Margin (in thousands) $ 9,199 $ 9,650 $ (451 ) (5 )% (in thousands) Sales Price Variance Impact on Revenue $ 18,026 Volume Variance Impact on Revenue (29,363 ) $ (11,337 ) (in thousands) Purchase Price Variance Impact on Purchases $ (15,451 ) Volume Variance Impact on Purchases 26,338 $ 10,887 The decrease in brokered natural gas revenues of $11.3 million combined with the decline in brokered natural gas cost of $10.9 million resulted in a decrease to the brokered natural gas margin of $0.5 million. 47 Table of Contents Crude Oil and Condensate Revenues Our average total company realized crude oil sales price, including the realized impact of derivative instruments, was $31.55 per Bbl compared to $29.55 per Bbl for 2003. These prices include the realized impact of derivative instruments, which reduced these prices by $8.98 per Bbl in 2004 and $1.41 per Bbl in 2003. The following table excludes the unrealized loss from the change in derivative fair value of $2.9 million and $1.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

The increase in the realized crude oil price combined with the decline in production resulted in a net revenue decrease of $20.0 million. 48 Table of Contents Impact of Derivative Instruments on Operating Revenues The following table reflects the realized impact of cash settlements and the net unrealized change in fair value of derivative instruments: Year Ended December 31, 2004 2003 Realized Unrealized Realized Unrealized (In thousands) Operating Revenues Increase/(Decrease) to Revenue Cash Flow Hedges Natural Gas Production $ (54,564 ) $ 137 $ (48,829 ) $ (691 ) Crude Oil 6 (2,973 ) 32 Total Cash Flow Hedges (54,564 ) 143 (51,802 ) (659 ) Other Derivative Financial Instruments Natural Gas Production (444 ) 777 (777 ) Crude Oil (17,908 ) (2,923 ) (990 ) (1,911 ) Total Other Derivative Financial Instruments (18,352 ) (2,146 ) (990 ) (2,688 ) $ (72,916 ) $ (2,003 ) $ (52,792 ) $ (3,347 ) We are exposed to market risk to the extent of changes in market prices of natural gas and oil. However, the market risk exposure on these derivative contracts is generally offset by the gain or loss recognized upon the ultimate sale of the commodity. Other Operating Revenues Other operating revenues decreased $3.7 million. This change was primarily a result of decreases in natural gas transportation revenue and natural gas liquid revenue for the year ended December 31, 2004. Operating Expenses Total costs and expenses from operations decreased $85.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to the year ended December 31, 2003. The primary reasons for this fluctuation are as follows: Brokered Natural Gas Cost decreased $10.9 million. For additional information related to this decrease see the analysis performed for Brokered Natural Gas Revenue and Cost. Exploration expense decreased $10.0 million primarily as a result of higher dry hole expense in 2003. During 2004, we drilled 5 dry exploratory wells compared to 15 in the corresponding period of 2003. Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization increased, as anticipated, by approximately 9% or $8.4 million. The increase was primarily due to negative reserve revisions in south Louisiana in 2003, which increased the per Mcfe DD&A rate in 2004. Impairment of Oil and Gas Properties expense decreased $90.3 million. This decrease is substantially related to a pre tax non cash impairment charge of $87.9 million incurred in 2003 related to the loss of a reversionary interest in the Kurten field. Effective February 13, 2003, the Kurten partnership commenced liquidation at the limited partners election. In connection with the liquidation, an appraisal was obtained to allocate the interest in the partnership assets. Based on the receipt of the appraisal in February 2003, we determined that we would not receive the reversionary interest as part of the liquidation. Due to the impact of the loss of the reversionary interest on future estimated net cash flows of the Kurten field, we performed an impairment review which resulted in an $87.9 million charge. General and Administrative expense increased $9.6 million from 2003 to 2004. Stock compensation expense increased by $4.9 million as a result of performance share awards issued in 2004 and increased amortization of restricted stock grants for grants which occurred during the year. Compliance fees related to Sarbanes Oxley increased expenses by $2.3 million, and there was a $1.2 million increase in employee related expenses. Taxes Other Than Income increased $3.9 million as a result of higher commodity prices realized during the year 2004 as compared to the prior year. 49 Table of Contents Interest Expense, Net Interest expense decreased $1.7 million. This variance is due to a lower average level of outstanding debt on the revolving credit facility offset somewhat by an increase in Prime rates. Average daily borrowings under the revolving credit facility during the year were $0.5 million in 2004 which is a decrease from $0.7 million in 2003. Our other remaining debt is at fixed interest rates. Income Tax Expense Income tax expense increased $35.2 million due to an increase in our pre tax net income. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activity Our hedging strategy is designed to reduce the risk of price volatility for our production in the natural gas and crude oil markets. A hedging committee that consists of members of senior management oversees our hedging activity. Our hedging arrangements apply to only a portion of our production and provide only partial price protection. These hedging arrangements limit the benefit to us of increases in prices, but offer protection in the event of price declines. Further, if our counterparties defaulted, this protection might be limited as we might not receive the benefits of the hedges. Please read the discussion below as well as Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a more detailed discussion of our hedging arrangements. Periodically, we enter into derivative commodity instruments to hedge our exposure to price fluctuations on natural gas and crude oil production. Under our revolving credit agreement, the aggregate level of commodity hedging must not exceed 100% of the anticipated future equivalent production during the period covered by these cash flow hedges. At December 31, 2005, we had nine cash flow hedges open: eight natural gas price collar arrangements and one crude oil price collar arrangement. At December 31, 2005, a $20.7 million ($12.9 million net of tax) unrealized loss was recorded to Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, along with a $22.4 million short term derivative liability and a $1.7 million short term derivative receivable, which is shown in Other Current Assets on the Balance Sheet. The change in the fair value of derivatives designated as hedges that is effective is initially recorded to Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income. The ineffective portion, if any, of the change in the fair value of derivatives designated as hedges, and the change in fair value of all other derivatives is recorded currently in earnings as a component of Natural Gas Production and Crude Oil and Condensate Revenue, as appropriate. Assuming no change in commodity prices, after December 31, 2005 we would expect to reclassify to the Statement of Operations, over the next 12 months, $12.9 million in after tax charges associated with commodity hedges. This reclassification represents the net liability associated with open positions currently not reflected in earnings at December 31, 2005 related to anticipated 2006 production. Hedges on Production Swaps From time to time, we enter into natural gas and crude oil swap agreements with counterparties to hedge price risk associated with a portion of our production. These derivatives are not held for trading purposes. Under these price swaps, we receive a fixed price on a notional quantity of natural gas and crude oil in exchange for paying a variable price based on a market based index, such as the NYMEX gas and crude oil futures. During 2005, natural gas price swaps covered 20,557 Mmcf, or 28% of our gas production, fixing the sales price of this gas at an average of $5.14 per Mcf. At December 31, 2005, we had no open natural gas price swap contracts covering 2006 production. From time to time, we enter into natural gas and crude oil derivative arrangements that do not qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS No. 133. These financial instruments are recorded at fair value at the balance sheet date. At December 31, 2005, we did not have any of these types of arrangements. 50 Table of Contents Hedges on Production Options From time to time, we enter into natural gas and crude oil collar agreements with counterparties to hedge price risk associated with a portion of our production. These cash flow hedges are not held for trading purposes. Under the collar arrangements, if the index price rises above the ceiling price, we pay the counterparty. If the index price falls below the floor price, the counterparty pays us. During 2005, natural gas price collars covered 15,157 Mmcf of our gas production, or 21% of our gas production with a weighted average floor of $5.59 per Mcf and a weighted average ceiling of $8.61 per Mcf. During 2005, an oil price collar covered 365 Mbbl of our crude oil production, or 21% of our crude oil production with a weighted average floor of $40.00 per Mbbl and a weighted average ceiling of $50.50 per Mbbl. At December 31, 2005, we had open natural gas price collar contracts covering our 2006 production as follows: Natural Gas Price Collars Contract Period VolumeinMmcf WeightedAverageCeiling / Floor Net UnrealizedLoss (In thousands) As of December 31, 2005 First Quarter 2006 6,702 $ 12.74 / $8.25 Second Quarter 2006 6,776 12.74 / 8.25 Third Quarter 2006 6,850 12.74 / 8.25 Fourth Quarter 2006 6,851 12.74 / 8.25 Full Year 2006 27,179 $ 12.74 / $8.25 $ (20,425 ) At December 31, 2005, we had one open crude oil price collar contract covering our 2006 production as follows: Crude Oil Price Collar Contract Period VolumeinMbbl WeightedAverageCeiling / Floor Net UnrealizedLoss (In thousands) As of December 31, 2005 First Quarter 2006 90 $ 76.00 / $50.00 Second Quarter 2006 91 76.00 / 50.00 Third Quarter 2006 92 76.00 / 50.00 Fourth Quarter 2006 92 76.00 / 50.00 Full Year 2006 365 $ 76.00 / $50.00 $ (317 ) We are exposed to market risk on these open contracts, to the extent of changes in market prices of natural gas and crude oil. However, the market risk exposure on these hedged contracts is generally offset by the gain or loss recognized upon the ultimate sale of the commodity that is hedged. The preceding paragraphs contain forward looking information concerning future production and projected gains and losses, which may be impacted both by production and by changes in the future market prices of energy commodities. See Forward Looking Information for further details. 51 Table of Contents Fair Market Value of Financial Instruments The estimated fair value of financial instruments is the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged currently between willing parties.
