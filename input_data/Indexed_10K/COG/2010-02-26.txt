ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our results of operations and our present financial condition. Our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Form 10 K contain additional information that should be referred to when reviewing this material. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to reflect changes in presenting the geographic areas in which we conduct our operations. These areas consist of the North (comprised of the East and Rocky Mountain areas) and South (comprised of the Gulf Coast and Anadarko areas). In previous periods, we presented the geographic areas as East, Gulf Coast, West and Canada. Statements in this discussion may be forward looking. These forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, including those discussed below, which could cause actual results to differ from those expressed. Please read Forward Looking Information for further details. 30 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements We operate in one segment, natural gas and oil development, exploitation and exploration, exclusively within the United States. In April 2009, we sold substantially all of our Canadian properties to a private Canadian company. OVERVIEW Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation is a leading independent oil and gas company engaged in the development, exploitation, exploration, production and marketing of natural gas, and to a lesser extent, crude oil and natural gas liquids from its properties in the Continental U.S. We also transport, store, gather and produce natural gas for resale. Our exploitation and exploration activities are concentrated in areas with known hydrocarbon resources, which are conducive to multi well, repeatable drilling programs. Our program is designed to be disciplined and balanced, with a focus on achieving strong financial returns. At Cabot, we evaluate three types of investment alternatives that compete for available capital: drilling opportunities, financial opportunities such as debt repayment or repurchase of common stock and acquisition opportunities. Depending on circumstances, we allocate capital among the alternatives based on a rate of return approach. Our goal is to invest capital in the highest return opportunities available at any given time. At any one time, one or more of these may not be economically feasible. Our financial results depend upon many factors, particularly the price of natural gas and crude oil and our ability to market our production on economically attractive terms. Price volatility in the commodity markets has remained prevalent in the last few years. Throughout 2009 commodity index prices in general traded in a range significantly below recent highs. However, our realized natural gas and crude oil price was $7.47 per Mcf and $85.52 per Bbl, respectively, in 2009 and were significantly increased by our positions from our derivative instruments, which contributed approximately 45% of our realized revenues in 2009. In an effort to manage commodity price risk, we entered into a series of crude oil and natural gas price swaps and collars. These financial instruments are an important element of our risk management strategy. Commodity prices are impacted by many factors that are outside of our control. Historically, commodity prices have been volatile and we expect them to remain volatile. Commodity prices are affected by changes in market supply and demand, which are impacted by overall economic activity, weather, pipeline capacity constraints, inventory storage levels, basis differentials and other factors. As a result, we cannot accurately predict future natural gas, NGL and crude oil prices and, therefore, we cannot determine with any degree of certainty what effect increases or decreases will have on our capital program, production volumes and future revenues. In addition to production volumes and commodity prices, finding and developing sufficient amounts of crude oil and natural gas reserves at economical costs are critical to our long term success. See Risk Factors Natural gas and oil prices fluctuate widely, and low prices for an extended period of time are likely to have a material adverse impact on our business and Risk Factors Our future performance depends on our ability to find or acquire additional natural gas and oil reserves that are economically recoverable in Item 1A. The tables below illustrate how natural gas prices have fluctuated by month over 2008 and 2009. Index represents the first of the month Henry Hub index price per Mmbtu. The 2008 and 2009 price is the natural gas price per Mcf realized by us and includes the realized impact of our natural gas price collar and swap arrangements, as applicable: Natural Gas Prices by Month 2009 Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Index $ 6.16 $ 4.49 $ 4.07 $ 3.65 $ 3.33 $ 3.54 $ 3.96 $ 3.37 $ 2.84 $ 3.72 $ 4.28 $ 4.49 2009 $ 7.72 $ 7.32 $ 7.46 $ 7.03 $ 7.28 $ 7.45 $ 7.50 $ 7.45 $ 7.25 $ 7.42 $ 8.03 $ 7.75 Natural Gas Prices by Month 2008 Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Index $ 7.13 $ 8.01 $ 8.96 $ 9.59 $ 11.29 $ 11.93 $ 13.11 $ 9.23 $ 8.40 $ 7.48 $ 6.47 $ 6.90 2008 $ 7.46 $ 7.82 $ 8.45 $ 9.03 $ 9.38 $ 9.50 $ 9.36 $ 8.61 $ 8.05 $ 7.89 $ 7.70 $ 7.54 31 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Prices for crude oil rose to record high levels in 2008, but experienced significant declines in the fourth quarter of 2008. Prices improved during 2009. The tables below contain the NYMEX monthly average crude oil price (Index) and our realized per barrel (Bbl) crude oil prices by month for 2008 and 2009. The 2008 and 2009 price is the crude oil price per Bbl realized by us and includes the realized impact of our crude oil derivative arrangements: Crude Oil Prices by Month 2009 Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Index $ 41.92 $ 39.26 $ 48.06 $ 49.95 $ 59.21 $ 69.70 $ 64.29 $ 71.14 $ 69.47 $ 75.82 $ 78.15 $ 74.60 2009 $ 75.41 $ 73.98 $ 76.29 $ 78.86 $ 85.94 $ 86.26 $ 82.22 $ 92.16 $ 87.54 $ 92.13 $ 95.35 $ 95.41 Crude Oil Prices by Month 2008 Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Index $ 92.93 $ 95.35 $ 105.42 $ 112.46 $ 125.46 $ 134.02 $ 133.48 $ 116.69 $ 103.76 $ 76.72 $ 57.44 $ 42.04 2008 $ 83.71 $ 85.02 $ 90.85 $ 92.56 $ 99.79 $ 103.83 $ 102.76 $ 101.16 $ 93.51 $ 87.10 $ 69.16 $ 62.45 We reported earnings of $1.43 per share, or $148.3 million, for 2009, a decrease from the $2.10 per share, or $211.3 million, reported in 2008. Natural gas revenues decreased from 2008 to 2009 as a result of decreased commodity market prices, partially offset by increased natural gas production and favorable natural gas hedge settlements. Crude oil revenues remained flat from 2008 to 2009 primarily due to increased crude oil production and favorable oil hedge settlements, offset by a decrease in realized prices. Prices, including the realized impact of derivative instruments, decreased by 11% for natural gas and 4% for oil. We drilled 143 gross wells with a success rate of 95% in 2009 compared to 432 gross wells with a success rate of 97% in 2008. Total capital and exploration expenditures decreased by $840.6 million to $640.4 million in 2009 compared to $1,481.0 million (including the east Texas acquisition) in 2008. This decrease was largely due to the $604 million acquisition of east Texas assets in 2008 and a decrease of $231.9 million in total drilling. We believe our cash on hand and operating cash flow in 2010 will be sufficient to fund our budgeted capital and exploration spending of approximately $585 million. Any additional needs are expected to be funded by borrowings from our credit facility. Our 2010 strategy will remain consistent with 2009. We will remain focused on our strategies of pursuing lower risk drilling opportunities that provide more predictable results on our accumulated acreage position. Additionally, we intend to maintain spending discipline and manage our balance sheet in an effort to ensure sufficient liquidity, including cash resources and available credit. In the current year we have allocated our planned program for capital and exploration expenditures primarily to the Marcellus Shale in northeast Pennsylvania, and to a lesser extent east Texas. We believe these strategies are appropriate for our portfolio of projects and the current industry environment and will continue to add shareholder value over the long term. The preceding paragraphs, discussing our strategic pursuits and goals, contain forward looking information. Please read Forward Looking Information for further details. FINANCIAL CONDITION Capital Resources and Liquidity Our primary sources of cash in 2009 were from funds generated from the sale of natural gas and crude oil production (including hedge realizations) and, to a lesser extent, the sales of properties during the year and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. These cash flows were primarily used to fund our development and exploratory expenditures, in addition to payments for debt service, debt issuance costs, contributions to our pension plan and dividends. See below for additional discussion and analysis of cash flow. 32 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements We generate cash from the sale of natural gas and crude oil. Operating cash flow fluctuations are substantially driven by commodity prices and changes in our production volumes. Prices for crude oil and natural gas have historically been volatile, including seasonal influences characterized by peak demand and higher prices in the winter heating season; however, the impact of other risks and uncertainties have also influenced prices throughout the recent years. Commodity prices have recently experienced increased volatility due to adverse market conditions in our economy. In addition, fluctuations in cash flow may result in an increase or decrease in our capital and exploration expenditures. See Results of Operations for a review of the impact of prices and volumes on sales. Our working capital is also substantially influenced by variables discussed above. From time to time, our working capital will reflect a surplus, while at other times it will reflect a deficit. This fluctuation is not unusual. We believe we have adequate credit availability and liquidity available to meet our working capital requirements. Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 (In thousands) Cash Flows Provided by Operating Activities $ 614,052 $ 634,447 $ 462,137 Cash Flows Used in Investing Activities (531,027 ) (1,452,289 ) (589,922 ) Cash Flows Provided by / (Used in) Financing Activities (70,968 ) 827,445 104,429 Net Increase / (Decrease) in Cash and Cash Equivalents $ 12,057 $ 9,603 $ (23,356 ) Operating Activities. Key components impacting net operating cash flows are commodity prices, production volumes and operating costs. Net cash provided by operating activities in 2009 decreased by $20.4 million over 2008. This decrease was mainly due to a decrease in oil and gas revenues, partially offset by lower operating, interest and tax expense. Average realized natural gas prices decreased by 11% in 2009 compared to 2008 and average realized crude oil prices decreased by 4% over the same period. Equivalent production volumes increased by 8% in 2009 compared to 2008 as a result of higher natural gas and crude oil production. We are unable to predict future commodity prices and, as a result, cannot provide any assurance about future levels of net cash provided by operating activities. Realized prices may continue to decline during 2010. For 2009, we had natural gas price swaps covering 16.1 Bcf of our 2009 gas production at an average price of $12.18 per Mcf and natural gas price collars covering 47.3 Bcf of our 2009 gas production, with a weighted average floor of $9.40 per Mcf and a weighted average ceiling of $12.39 per Mcf. As of December 31, 2009, we have natural gas price swaps covering 19.3 Bcf of our 2010 gas production at an average price of $9.30 per Mcf, and no natural gas price collars. Accordingly, based on our current hedge position, we will be more subject to the effects of natural gas price volatility in 2010 than in 2009. In addition, given the current market for derivatives, if we were to hedge all our 2010 production, we would expect our realized prices to be lower than our 2009 realized prices. Net cash provided by operating activities in 2008 increased by $172.3 million over 2007. This increase was mainly due to an increase in net income, the receipt of cash of $20.2 million in 2008 in connection with the settlement of a dispute and an increase of $13.7 million in cash received for income tax refunds. In addition, cash flows from operating activities increased as a result of other working capital changes. Average realized natural gas prices increased by 16% in 2008 over 2007 and average realized crude oil prices increased by 33% over the same period. Equivalent production volumes increased by 11% in 2008 compared to 2007 as a result of higher natural gas production. See Results of Operations for a discussion on commodity prices and a review of the impact of prices and volumes on sales revenue. Investing Activities. The primary uses of cash in investing activities were capital spending and exploration expenses. We established the budget for these amounts based on our current estimate of future commodity prices 33 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements and cash flows. Due to the volatility of commodity prices and new opportunities which may arise, our capital expenditures may be periodically adjusted during any given year. Cash flows used in investing activities decreased by $921.3 million from 2008 to 2009 and increased by $862.4 million from 2007 to 2008. The decrease from 2008 to 2009 was due to a decrease of $862.8 million in acquisitions and capital expenditures and an increase of $78.1 million of proceeds from the sale of assets, partially offset by an increase of $19.6 million in exploration expenditures. In August 2008, we completed the acquisition of producing properties, leasehold acreage and a natural gas gathering infrastructure in east Texas for total net cash consideration of approximately $604.0 million. The increase from 2007 to 2008 was due to an increase of $866.0 million in capital expenditures, including an increase of approximately $601.8 million primarily due to the $604.0 million east Texas acquisition and an increase of $130.5 million related to unproved leasehold acquisitions primarily in northeast Pennsylvania. In addition, there were $5.0 million of lower proceeds from the sale of assets in 2008 compared to 2007. Partially offsetting these increases to cash used in investing activities were decreased exploration expenditures of $8.6 million in 2008 compared to 2007. Financing Activities. Cash flows provided by financing activities decreased by $898.4 million from 2008 to 2009. This was primarily due to a decrease in borrowings from debt of $787 million, partially offset by a decrease in repayments of debt of $208 million, and a decrease in net proceeds from the sale of common stock of $316.1 million primarily due to our June 2008 issuance of 5,002,500 shares of common stock in a public offering. Common stock proceeds and debt borrowings in 2008 were largely used to finance the acquisition of east Texas properties and undeveloped acreage. Cash paid for capitalized debt issuance costs and dividends increased by a total of $6.4 million, partially offset by an increase of $3.1 million in the tax benefit associated with stock based compensation. Cash flows provided by financing activities increased by $723.0 million from 2007 to 2008. This was primarily due to an increase in debt consisting of our July 2008 and December 2008 private placements of debt ($492 million) and an increase of $45 million in borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Additionally, net proceeds from the sale of common stock increased by $311.1 million primarily due to the June 2008 issuance of common stock. The tax benefit for stock based compensation increased by $10.7 million from 2007 to 2008, but was partially offset by an increase in dividends and capitalized debt issuance costs paid. At December 31, 2009, we had $143 million of borrowings outstanding under our unsecured credit facility at a weighted average interest rate of 3.9%. In April 2009, we entered into a new revolving credit facility and terminated our prior credit facility. The new credit facility provides for an available credit line of $500 million and contains an accordion feature allowing us to increase the available credit line to $600 million, if any one or more of the existing banks or new banks agree to provide such increased commitment amount. The available credit line is subject to adjustment on the basis of the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves (as determined by the banks based on our reserve reports and engineering reports) and certain other assets and the outstanding principal balance of our senior notes. We strive to manage our debt at a level below the available credit line in order to maintain excess borrowing capacity. Our revolving credit facility includes a covenant limiting our total debt. Management believes that, with internally generated cash, existing cash and availability under our revolving credit facility, we have the capacity to finance our spending plans and maintain our strong financial position. At the same time, we will closely monitor the capital markets. In July 2008, we completed a private placement of $425 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured fixed rate notes with a weighted average interest rate of 6.51%, consisting of amounts due in July 2018, 2020 and 2023. In December 2008, we completed a private placement of $67 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured 9.78% fixed rate notes due in December 2018. Please refer to Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details. In June 2008, we entered into an underwriting agreement pursuant to which we sold an aggregate of 5,002,500 shares of common stock at a price to us of $62.66 per share. We received $313.5 million in net 34 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements proceeds, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions. These net proceeds were used temporarily to reduce outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility prior to funding a portion of the purchase price of our east Texas acquisition, which closed in the third quarter of 2008. Immediately prior to (and in connection with) this issuance, we retired 5,002,500 shares of treasury stock, which had a weighted average purchase price of $16.46. Capitalization Information about our capitalization is as follows: December 31, 2009 2008 (Dollars in millions) Debt(1) $ 805.0 $ 867.0 Stockholders Equity 1,812.5 1,790.6 Total Capitalization $ 2,617.5 $ 2,657.6 Debt to Capitalization 31 % 33 % Cash and Cash Equivalents $ 40.2 $ 28.1 (1) Includes $35.9 million of current portion of long term debt at December 31, 2008. Includes $143 million and $185 million of borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2009, we paid dividends of $12.4 million ($0.03 per share) on our common stock. A regular dividend has been declared for each quarter since we became a public company in 1990. Capital and Exploration Expenditures On an annual basis, we generally fund most of our capital and exploration activities, excluding any significant oil and gas property acquisitions, with cash generated from operations and, when necessary, our revolving credit facility. We budget these capital expenditures based on our projected cash flows for the year. The following table presents major components of our capital and exploration expenditures for the three years ended December 31, 2009. 2009 2008 2007 (In millions) Capital Expenditures Drilling and Facilities(1) $ 401.1 $ 624.3 $ 539.7 Leasehold Acquisitions 145.7 152.7 22.2 Acquisitions 0.4 625.0 4.0 Pipeline and Gathering 32.9 36.9 28.2 Other 9.5 10.9 2.3 589.6 1,449.8 596.4 Exploration Expense 50.8 31.2 39.8 Total $ 640.4 $ 1,481.0 $ 636.2 (1) Includes Canadian currency translation effects of $4.6 million, $(27.7) million and $15.0 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. We plan to drill approximately 136 gross wells (123.9 net) in 2010 compared with 143 gross wells (118.5 net) drilled in 2009. The number of net wells we plan to drill in 2010 is up slightly from 2009. This 2010 drilling 35 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements program includes approximately $585 million in total capital and exploration expenditures, down from $640.4 million in 2009. This decline is primarily due to lower projected lease acquisition expenditures. We will continue to assess the natural gas and crude oil price environment and our liquidity position and may increase or decrease the capital and exploration expenditures accordingly. There are many factors that impact our depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) rate. These include reserve additions and revisions, development costs, impairments and changes in anticipated production in future periods. In 2010, management expects an increase in our DD&A rate due to higher capital costs, partially as a result of inflationary cost pressures in the industry over the last four years and increased lease acquisition costs in Pennsylvania. This change is currently estimated to be approximately 11% greater than 2009 levels. This increase will not have an impact on our cash flows. Contractual Obligations Our material contractual obligations include long term debt, interest on long term debt, firm gas transportation agreements, drilling rig commitments and operating leases. We have no off balance sheet debt or other similar unrecorded obligations. A summary of our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2009 are set forth in the following table: Total Payments Due by Year 2010 2011 to2012 2013 to2014 2015 &Beyond (In thousands) Long Term Debt(1) $ 805,000 $ $ 218,000 $ 75,000 $ 512,000 Interest on Long Term Debt(2) 396,857 52,280 87,914 76,949 179,714 Firm Gas Transportation Agreements(3) 80,403 10,977 21,599 6,746 41,081 Drilling Rig Commitments(3) 6,364 6,364 Operating Leases(3) 26,776 5,845 10,029 8,443 2,459 Total Contractual Cash Obligations $ 1,315,400 $ 75,466 $ 337,542 $ 167,138 $ 735,254 (1) At December 31, 2009, we had $143 million of debt outstanding under our revolving credit facility. See Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for details of long term debt. (2) Interest payments have been calculated utilizing the fixed rates of our $662 million long term debt outstanding at December 31, 2009. Interest payments on our revolving credit facility were calculated by assuming that the December 31, 2009 outstanding balance of $143 million will be outstanding through the April 2012 maturity date. A constant interest rate of 3.9% was assumed, which was the 2009 weighted average interest rate. Actual results will differ from these estimates and assumptions. (3) For further information on our obligations under firm gas transportation agreements, drilling rig commitments and operating leases, see Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Amounts related to our asset retirement obligations are not included in the above table given the uncertainty regarding the actual timing of such expenditures. The total amount of asset retirement obligations at December 31, 2009 was $29.7 million, up from $28.0 million at December 31, 2008, primarily due to $1.3 million of accretion expense during 2009 as well as $0.4 million of drilling additions. Potential Impact of Our Critical Accounting Policies Readers of this document and users of the information contained in it should be aware of how certain events may impact our financial results based on the accounting policies in place. The most significant policies are discussed below. 36 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Oil and Gas Reserves The process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is inherently imprecise, and the reserve data included in this document are only estimates. The process relies on interpretations of available geologic, geophysical, engineering and production data. The extent, quality and reliability of this technical data can vary. The process also requires certain economic assumptions, some of which are mandated by the SEC, such as oil and gas prices. Additional assumptions include drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes and availability of funds. Since 1990, 100% of our reserves have been reviewed by Miller & Lents, Ltd., an independent oil and gas reservoir engineering consulting firm, who in their opinion determined the estimates presented to be reasonable in the aggregate. In 2009 we had a net downward revision of 200.1 Bcfe primarily due to (i) downward revisions of 101.6 Bcfe due to lower 2009 oil and natural gas prices compared to 2008 and (ii) downward revisions of 120.4 Bcfe due to the removal of proved undeveloped reserves scheduled for development beyond five years primarily due to the application of the SECs new oil and gas reserve calculation methodology, partially offset by 21.9 Bcfe of positive performance revisions. In accordance with the new rules we priced proved oil and gas reserves using the 12 month average oil and gas index prices, calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average for the first day of the month price for each month within the 12 month period prior to the end of the reporting period. We did not record significant reserve revisions during 2008 and 2007. For more information regarding reserve estimation, including historical reserve revisions, refer to the Supplemental Oil and Gas Information. Our rate of recording DD&A expense is dependent upon our estimate of proved reserves, which is utilized in our unit of production method calculation. If the estimates of proved reserves were to be reduced, the rate at which we record DD&A expense would increase, reducing net income. Such a reduction in reserves may result from lower market prices, which may make it non economic to drill for and produce higher cost fields. A five percent positive or negative revision to proved reserves throughout the Company would decrease or increase the DD&A rate by approximately $0.07 to $0.09 per Mcfe. Revisions in significant fields may individually affect our DD&A rate. It is estimated that a positive or negative reserve revision of 10% in one of our most productive fields would have a $(0.02) to $0.04 per Mcfe impact on our total DD&A rate. These estimated impacts are based on current data, and actual events could require different adjustments to our DD&A rate. In addition, a decline in proved reserve estimates may impact the outcome of our impairment test under Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment. Due to the inherent imprecision of the reserve estimation process, risks associated with the operations of proved producing properties and market sensitive commodity prices utilized in our impairment analysis, management cannot determine if an impairment is reasonably likely to occur in the future. Carrying Value of Oil and Gas Properties We evaluate the impairment of our oil and gas properties on a field by field basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an assets carrying amount may not be recoverable. We compare expected undiscounted future cash flows to the net book value of the asset. If the future undiscounted expected cash flows, based on our estimate of future crude oil and natural gas prices, operating costs and anticipated production from proved reserves are lower than the net book value of the asset, the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value. Commodity pricing is estimated by using a combination of assumptions management uses in its budgeting and forecasting process as well as historical and current prices adjusted for geographical location and quality differentials, as well as other factors that management believes will impact realizable prices. Fair value is calculated by discounting the future cash flows. The discount factor used (16% at December 31, 2009) is based on rates utilized by market participants that are commensurate with the risks inherent in the development and production of the underlying natural gas and oil. In 2009, 2008 and 2007, there were no unusual or unexpected occurrences that caused significant revisions in estimated cash flows which were utilized in our impairment test. In the event that commodity prices remain low or continue to decline, there could be a significant revision in the future. 37 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Costs attributable to our unproved properties are not subject to the impairment analysis described above; however, a portion of the costs associated with such properties is subject to amortization based on past experience and average property lives. Average property lives are determined on a regional basis and based on the estimated life of unproved property leasehold rights. Historically, the average property life in each of the regions has not significantly changed. During the latter part of 2008 and during 2009, commodity prices declined at a significant rate as the global economy struggled with a worldwide recession. This price environment has resulted in reduced capital available for exploration projects as well as development drilling. We have considered these impacts discussed above when assessing the impairment of our undeveloped acreage, especially in exploratory areas. If the average unproved property life decreases or increases by one year, the amortization would increase by approximately $19.3 million or decrease by approximately $13.8 million, respectively per year. In the past, based on the customary terms of the leases, the average leasehold life in the South region has been shorter than the average life in the North region. Average property lives in the North and South regions have been five and three years, respectively. As these properties are developed and reserves are proven, the remaining capitalized costs are subject to depreciation and depletion. If the development of these properties is deemed unsuccessful, the capitalized costs related to the unsuccessful activity is expensed in the year the determination is made. The rate at which the unproved properties are written off depends on the timing and success of our future exploration program. Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities We follow the accounting prescribed in ASC 815. Under ASC 815, the fair value of each derivative instrument is recorded as either an asset or liability on the balance sheet. At the end of each quarterly period, these instruments are marked to market. The gain or loss on the change in fair value is recorded as Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, a component of equity, to the extent that the derivative instrument is designated as a hedge and is effective. Under ASC 815, effectiveness is a measurement of how closely correlated the hedge instrument is with the underlying physical sale. For example, a natural gas price swap that converts Henry Hub index to a fixed price would be perfectly correlated, and 100% effective, if the underlying gas were sold at the Henry Hub index. The ineffective portion, if any, of the change in the fair value of derivatives designated as hedges, and the change in fair value of derivatives not qualifying as hedges, is recorded currently in earnings as a component of Natural Gas Production and Crude Oil and Condensate Revenue, as appropriate in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Fair Value Measurements Effective January 1, 2008, we adopted those provisions of ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, that were required to be adopted (which excluded certain non financial assets and liabilities). Effective January 1, 2009, we applied all of the provisions of ASC 820, and this adoption did not have a material impact on any of our financial statements except for our impairment of oil and gas properties (see Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements). In the future, areas that could cause an impact would primarily be limited to asset impairments, including long lived assets, asset retirement obligations and assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination, if any. As defined in ASC 820, fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price). The transaction is based on a hypothetical transaction in the principal or most advantageous market considered from the perspective of the market participant that holds the asset or owes the liability. We utilize market data or assumptions that market participants who are independent, knowledgeable and willing and able to transact would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique. These inputs can be readily observable, market corroborated or generally unobservable. We attempt to utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. We are able to classify fair value balances based 38 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements on the observability of those inputs. ASC 820 establishes a formal fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to level 1 measurements and the lowest priority to level 3 measurements, and accordingly, level 1 measurements should be used whenever possible. As of December 31, 2009, we had $114.7 million of financial assets, or 3% of our total assets, classified as Level 3. This was entirely comprised of our derivative receivable balance from our oil and gas cash flow hedges. During 2009, realized gains of $240.9 million were recognized in other comprehensive income. Derivative settlements during the year totaled $395.0 million. The fair values of our natural gas and crude oil price collars and swaps are valued based upon quotes obtained from counterparties to the agreements and are designated as Level 3. Such quotes have been derived using a Black Scholes model for the active oil and gas commodities market that considers various inputs including current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments, quoted forward prices for natural gas and crude oil, volatility factors and interest rates, such as a LIBOR curve for a similar length of time as the derivative contract term. These estimates are compared to multiple quotes obtained from counterparties for reasonableness. We adjust the fair value quotes received by our counterparties to take into account either the counterparties nonperformance risk or our own nonperformance risk. We measured the nonperformance risk of our counterparties by reviewing credit default swap spreads for the various financial institutions in which we have derivative transactions. The resulting reduction to the net receivable derivative contract position was $0.2 million. In times where we have net derivative contract liabilities, our nonperformance risk is evaluated using a market credit spread provided by our bank. Additional disclosures are required for transactions measured at fair value and we have included these disclosures in Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Long Term Employee Benefit Costs Our costs of long term employee benefits, particularly pension and postretirement benefits, are incurred over long periods of time, and involve many uncertainties over those periods. The net periodic benefit cost attributable to current periods is based on several assumptions about such future uncertainties, and is sensitive to changes in those assumptions. It is managements responsibility, often with the assistance of independent experts, to select assumptions that in its judgment represent best estimates of those uncertainties. It also is managements responsibility to review those assumptions periodically to reflect changes in economic or other factors that affect those assumptions. The current benefit service costs, as well as the existing liabilities, for pensions and other postretirement benefits are measured on a discounted present value basis. The discount rate is a current rate, related to the rate at which the liabilities could be settled. Our assumed discount rate is based on average rates of return published for a theoretical portfolio of high quality fixed income securities. In order to select the discount rate, we use benchmarks such as the Moodys Aa Corporate Rate, which was 5.49% as of December 31, 2009, and the Citigroup Pension Liability Index, which was 5.96% as of December 31, 2009. We look to these benchmarks as well as considering durations of expected benefit payments. We have determined based on these assumptions that a discount rate of 5.75% at December 31, 2009 is reasonable. In order to value our pension liabilities, we use the IRS 2009 Static Mortality Table based on the demographics of our benefit plans. We have also assumed that salaries will increase four percent based on our expectation of future salary increases. The benefit obligation and the periodic cost of postretirement medical benefits also are measured based on assumed rates of future increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits. As of December 31, 2009, the assumed rate of increase was 10%. The net periodic cost of pension benefits included in expense also is affected by the expected long term rate of return on plan assets assumption. The expected return on plan assets rate is normally changed less frequently than the assumed discount rate, and reflects long term expectations, rather than current fluctuations in market conditions. The actual rate of return on plan assets may differ from the expected rate due to the volatility normally experienced in capital markets. Managements goal is to manage the investments over the long term to achieve optimal returns with an acceptable level of risk and volatility. 39 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements We have established objectives regarding plan assets in the pension plan. We attempt to maximize return over the long term, subject to appropriate levels of risk. One of our plan objectives is that the performance of the equity portion of the pension plan exceed the Standard and Poors 500 Index over the long term. We also seek to achieve a minimum five percent annual real rate of return (above the rate of inflation) on the total portfolio over the long term. We establish the long term expected rate of return by developing a forward looking long term expected rate of return assumption for each asset class, taking into account factors such as the expected real return for the specific asset class and inflation. In our pension calculations, we have used eight percent as the expected long term return on plan assets for 2009, 2008 and 2007. A Monte Carlo simulation was run using 5,000 simulations based upon our actual asset allocation and liability duration, which has been determined to be approximately 15 years. This model uses historical data for the period of 1926 2007 for stocks, bonds and cash to determine the best estimate range of future returns. The median rate of return, or return that we expect to achieve over 50 percent of the time, is approximately nine percent. We expect to achieve at a minimum approximately seven percent annual real rate of return on the total portfolio over the long term at least 75 percent of the time. We believe that the eight percent chosen is a reasonable estimate based on our actual results. We generally target a portfolio of assets utilizing equity securities, fixed income securities and cash equivalents that are within a range of approximately 50% to 80% for equity securities and approximately 20% to 40% for fixed income securities. Large capitalization equities may make up a maximum of 65% of the portfolio. Small capitalization equities and international equities may make up a maximum of 30% and 15%, respectively, of the portfolio. Fixed income bonds may make up a maximum of 40% of our portfolio. The account will typically be fully invested; however, as a temporary investment or an asset protection measure, part of the account may be invested in money market investments up to 20%. One percent of the portfolio is invested in short term funds at the designated bank to meet the cash flow needs of the plan. No prohibited investments, including direct or indirect investments in commodities, commodity futures, derivatives, short sales, real estate investment trusts, letter stock, restricted stock or other private placements, are allowed without prior committee approval. Stock Based Compensation We account for stock based compensation under a fair value based method of accounting prescribed under ASC 718 for stock options and similar equity instruments. Under the fair value method, compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of an award and is recognized over the service period, which is usually the vesting period. To calculate the fair value, either a binomial or Black Scholes valuation model may be used. Stock based compensation cost for all types of awards is included in General and Administrative Expense in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Stock options and stock appreciation rights (SARs) are granted with an exercise price equal to the average of the high and low trading price of our stock on the grant date. The grant date fair value is calculated by using a Black Scholes model that incorporates assumptions for stock price volatility, risk free rate of return, expected dividend and expected term. The expected term was derived by reviewing minimum and maximum expected term outputs from the Black Scholes model based on award type and employee type. This term represents the period of time that awards granted are expected to be outstanding. The stock price volatility was calculated using our historical closing stock price data for the period associated with the expected term through the grant date of each award. The risk free rate of return percentages are based on the continuously compounded equivalent of the US Treasury (Nominal 10) within the expected term as measured on the grant date. The expected dividend percentage assumes that we will continue to pay a consistent level of dividend each quarter. Expense is recorded based on a graded vesting schedule over a three year service period, with one third of the award becoming exercisable each year on the anniversary date of the grant. The forfeiture rate is determined based on the forfeiture history by type of award and by the group of individuals receiving the award. The fair value of restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and certain performance share awards (which contain vesting restrictions based either on operating income or internal performance metrics) are measured 40 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements based on the average of the high and low trading price of our stock on the grant date. Restricted stock awards primarily vest either at the end of a three year service period, or on a graded vesting basis of one third at each anniversary date over a three year service period. The annual forfeiture rate for restricted stock awards ranges from 0% to 7.1% based on approximately ten years of our history for this type of award to various employee groups. Performance shares that vest based on operating income or operating cash flow metrics vest on a graded vesting basis of one third at each anniversary date over a three year service period and no forfeiture rate is assumed. Performance shares that vest based on internal metrics vest at the end of a three year performance period and an annual forfeiture rate of 5.2% is assumed. Expense for restricted stock units is recorded immediately as these awards vest immediately. Restricted stock units are granted only to our directors and no forfeiture rate is assumed. We grant another type of performance share award to executive employees that vest at the end of a three year performance period based on the comparative performance of our stock measured against sixteen other companies in our peer group. Depending on our performance, an aggregate of up to 100% of the fair market value of a share of our stock may be payable in common stock plus up to an additional 100% of the fair market value of a share of our stock may be payable in cash. These awards are accounted for by bifurcating the equity and liability components. A Monte Carlo model is used to value the liability component as well as the equity portion of the certain awards on the date of grant. The four primary inputs for the Monte Carlo model are the risk free rate, volatility of returns, correlation in movement of total shareholder return and the expected dividend. An interpolated risk free rate was generated from the Federal Reserve website for constant maturity treasuries for one and two year bonds (as of the reporting date) set equal to the remaining duration of the performance period. Volatility was set equal to the annualized daily volatility for the remaining duration of the reporting period ending on the reporting date. Correlation in movement of total shareholder return was determined based on a correlation matrix that was created which identifies total shareholder return correlations for each pair of companies in the peer group, including us. The paired returns in the correlation matrix ranged from approximately 52% to approximately 86% for us and our peer group. The expected dividend is calculated using our annual dividends paid ($0.12 per share for 2009) divided by the December 31, 2009 closing price of our stock ($43.59). Based on these inputs discussed above, a ranking was projected identifying our rank relative to the peer group for each award period. No forfeiture rate is assumed for this type of award. Expense related to these awards can be volatile based on our comparative ranking at the end of each quarter. We used the shortcut approach to derive our initial windfall tax benefit pool. We chose to use a one pool approach which combines all awards granted to employees, including non employee directors. On January 16, 2008, our Board of Directors adopted a Supplemental Employee Incentive Plan. The plan was intended to provide a compensation tool tied to stock market value creation to serve as an incentive and retention vehicle for full time non officer employees by providing for cash payments in the event our common stock reached specified trading prices. The bonus payout of a minimum of 50% of an employees base salary was triggered if, for any 20 trading days (which need not be consecutive) that fell within a period of 60 consecutive trading days occurring on or before November 1, 2011, the closing price per share of our common stock equaled or exceeded the final price goal of $60 per share. The plan also provided that an interim distribution of 10% of an employees base salary would be paid to eligible employees upon achieving the interim price goal of $50 per share prior to December 31, 2009. On the January 16, 2008 adoption date of the plan, our closing stock price was $40.71. On April 8, 2008 and subsequently on June 2, 2008, we achieved the interim and final target goals and total distributions of $15.7 million were paid in 2009. No further distributions will be made under this plan. On July 24, 2008, our Board of Directors adopted a second Supplemental Employee Incentive Plan (Plan II). Plan II is similar to the January 2008 Supplemental Incentive Plan; however, the final target is that the closing price per share of our common stock must equal or exceed the price goal of $105 per share on or before June 20, 2012. Under Plan II, each eligible employee may receive (upon approval by the Compensation 41 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Committee) a distribution of 50% of his or her base salary (or 30% of base salary if we paid interim distributions upon the achievement of the interim price goal discussed below). Plan II provides that a distribution of 20% of an eligible employees base salary upon achieving the interim price goal of $85 per share on or before June 30, 2010. The Compensation Committee can increase the 50% or 20% payment as it applies to any employee. Payments under this plan will partially be paid within 15 business days after achieving the target and the remaining portion will be paid based on a separate payment date as described in Plan II. These awards under both plans discussed above have been accounted for as liability awards under ASC 718. The total expense for 2009 and 2008 was $1.2 million and $15.9 million, respectively, and is included in General and Administrative Expense in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. For further information regarding the supplemental employee incentive plans and our other stock based compensation awards, please refer to Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. OTHER ISSUES AND CONTINGENCIES Regulations. Our operations are subject to various types of regulation by federal, state and local authorities. See Regulation of Oil and Natural Gas Exploration and Production, Natural Gas Marketing, Gathering and Transportation, Federal Regulation of Petroleum and Environmental Regulations in the Other Business Matters section of Item 1 for a discussion of these regulations. Restrictive Covenants. Our ability to incur debt and to make certain types of investments is subject to certain restrictive covenants in our various debt instruments. Among other requirements, our revolving credit agreement and our senior notes specify a minimum annual coverage ratio of operating cash flow to interest expense for the trailing four quarters of 2.8 to 1.0. In addition, we are required to maintain an asset coverage ratio of the present value of proved reserves plus working capital to debt of 1.5 to 1.0 and a current ratio of 1.0 to 1.0. Our senior notes require us to maintain a ratio of cash and proved reserves to indebtedness and other liabilities of 1.5 to 1.0. At December 31, 2009, we were in compliance in all material respects with all restrictive covenants on both the revolving credit agreement and notes. In the unforeseen event that we fail to comply with these covenants, we may apply for a temporary waiver with the lender, which, if granted, would allow us a period of time to remedy the situation. See further discussion in Capital Resources and Liquidity. Operating Risks and Insurance Coverage. Our business involves a variety of operating risks. See Risk Factors We face a variety of hazards and risks that could cause substantial financial losses in Item 1A. In accordance with customary industry practice, we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these risks and losses. The occurrence of any of these events not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations. The costs of these insurance policies are somewhat dependent on our historical claims experience and also the areas in which we choose to operate. Commodity Pricing and Risk Management Activities. Our revenues, operating results, financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital depend substantially on prevailing prices for natural gas and, to a lesser extent, oil. Declines in oil and gas prices may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity, ability to obtain financing and operating results. Lower oil and gas prices also may reduce the amount of oil and gas that we can produce economically. Historically, oil and gas prices and markets have been volatile, with prices fluctuating widely, and they are likely to continue to be volatile. Depressed prices in the future would have a negative impact on our future financial results. In particular, substantially lower prices would significantly reduce revenue and could potentially trigger an impairment under ASC 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment. Because our reserves are predominantly natural gas, changes in natural gas prices may have a particularly large impact on our financial results. The majority of our production is sold at market responsive prices. Generally, if the related commodity index falls, the price that we receive for our production will also decline. Therefore, the amount of revenue that we realize is partially determined by factors beyond our control. However, management may mitigate this price 42 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements risk on all or a portion of our anticipated production with the use of derivative financial instruments. Most recently, we have used financial instruments such as price collars and swap arrangements to reduce the impact of declining prices on our revenue. Under both arrangements, there is also a risk that the movement of index prices may result in our inability to realize the full benefit of an improvement in market conditions. Settlement of Dispute. In December 2008, we settled a dispute with a third party and as a result recorded a gain of $51.9 million (approximately $32.5 million after tax). The dispute involved the propriety of possession of our intellectual property by a third party. The settlement was comprised of $20.2 million in cash paid by the third party to us and $31.7 million related to the fair value of unproved property rights transferred by the third party to us. The fair market value of the unproved property rights was determined based on observable market costs and conditions over a recent time period. Values were pro rated by property based on the primary term remaining on the properties. Recently Adopted Accounting Standards In July 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASC 105, Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, establishing the accounting standards codification and the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) as the sole source of authoritative non governmental U.S. GAAP. The Codification was not intended to change U.S. GAAP; however, references to various accounting pronouncements and literature will now differ from what was previously being used in practice. Authoritative literature is now referenced by topic rather than by type of standard. As of July 1, 2009, the FASB no longer issues Statements, Interpretations, Staff Positions or EITF Abstracts. The FASB now communicates new accounting standards by issuing an Accounting Standards Update (ASU). All guidance in the Codification has an equal level of authority. ASC 105 is effective for financial statements that cover interim and annual periods ending after September 15, 2009, and supersedes all accounting standards in U.S. GAAP, aside from those issued by the SEC. There was no impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows as a result of the Codification. In February 2008, the FASB issued an amendment to ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, which granted a one year deferral (to fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years) for certain non financial assets and liabilities measured on a nonrecurring basis to comply with ASC 820. Effective January 1, 2009, we applied these amendments of ASC 820 discussed above and there was no material impact on our financial statements except for our impairment of oil and gas properties. For further information, please refer to Note 2 and Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Effective January 1, 2009, we adopted amendments that the FASB made to ASC 260, Earnings Per Share, regarding determining whether instruments granted in share based payment transactions are participating securities. The adoption of these amendments did not have a material impact on our financial statements. For further information, please refer to Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In March 2008, the FASB amended the disclosure requirements prescribed in ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging. We adopted these amendments as of January 1, 2009. The principal impact was to require the expansion of our disclosure regarding our derivative instruments. For further information, please refer to Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activity in Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In April 2009, the FASB amended guidance in ASC 820 regarding determining fair value when the volume and level of activity for an asset or liability has significantly decreased and identifying transactions that are not orderly. If an entity determines that either the volume or level of activity for an asset or liability has significantly decreased from normal conditions, or that price quotations or observable inputs are not associated with orderly transactions, increased analysis and management judgment will be required to estimate fair value. The objective in fair value measurement remains unchanged from what is prescribed in ASC 820 and should be reflective of the current exit price. Disclosures in interim and annual periods must include inputs and valuation techniques used to measure fair value, along with any changes in valuation techniques and related inputs during the period. In 43 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements addition, disclosures for debt and equity securities must be provided on a more disaggregated basis. These amendments became effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending after June 15, 2009 and did not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In April 2009, the FASB amended ASC 825, Financial Instruments, to require disclosures about fair value of financial instruments for publicly traded companies for both interim and annual periods. Historically, these disclosures were only required annually. The interim disclosures are intended to provide financial statement users with more timely and transparent information about the effects of current market conditions on an entitys financial instruments that are not otherwise reported at fair value. These amendments became effective for interim reporting periods ending after June 15, 2009. Comparative disclosures are only required for periods ending after the initial adoption. There was no material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows as a result of the adoption. For further information, please refer to Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In April 2009, the FASB amended the other than temporary impairment guidance for debt securities in ASC 320, Investments Debt and Equity Securities, to make the guidance more operational and to improve the presentation and disclosure of other than temporary impairments on debt and equity securities in the financial statements. There were no amendments made to the recognition and measurement guidance for equity securities, but a new method of recognizing and reporting for debt securities was established. Disclosure requirements for impaired debt and equity securities have been expanded significantly and are now required quarterly, as well as annually. These amendments became effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending after June 15, 2009 and did not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Comparative disclosures are only required for periods ending after the initial adoption. In June 2009, the FASB amended ASC 855, Subsequent Events, to require entities to disclose the date through which they have evaluated subsequent events and whether the date corresponds with the release of their financial statements. In addition, a new concept of financial statements being available to be issued was introduced. These amendments became effective for interim and annual periods ending after June 15, 2009 and did not have any impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In August 2009, the FASB issued ASU No. 2009 05, Fair Value Measurement and Disclosures: Measuring Liabilities at Fair Value, which provides clarification on measuring liabilities at fair value when a quoted price in an active market is not available. ASU No. 2009 05 specifies that in cases where a quoted price in an active market is not available, a valuation technique should be applied that uses either the quote of the liability when traded as an asset, the quoted prices for similar liabilities or similar liabilities when traded as assets, or another valuation technique consistent with existing fair value measurement guidance. Valuation methods discussed include using an income approach, such as a present value technique, or a market approach based on the amount at the measurement date that the reporting entity would pay to transfer the identical liability or would receive to enter into the identical liability. Entities are not required to include a separate input or adjustment to other inputs relating to the existence of a restriction that prevents the transfer of the liability. ASU No. 2009 05 is codified in ASC 820 10 and is effective for the first reporting period (including interim periods) beginning after issuance. There was no impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows as a result of the adoption of ASU No. 2009 05. For further information, please refer to Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In December 2008, the SEC issued Release No. 33 8995, Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting, which amends the oil and gas disclosures for oil and gas producers contained in Regulations S K and S X, as well as adding a section to Regulation S K (Subpart 1200) to codify the revised disclosure requirements in Securities Act Industry Guide 2, which has been phased out. Release No. 33 8995 is intended to provide investors with a more meaningful and comprehensive understanding of oil and gas reserves. Energy companies affected by Release No. 33 8995 are required to price proved oil and gas reserves using the unweighted arithmetic average of the price on the first day of each month within the 12 month period prior to the end of the reporting period, unless 44 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements prices are defined by contractual arrangements, excluding escalations based on future conditions. SEC Release No. 33 8995 is effective beginning January 1, 2010. The adoption of Release No. 33 8995 resulted in a downward revision to our proved reserves. For further information, please refer to the Supplemental Oil and Gas Information in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In January 2010, the FASB issued ASU No. 2010 03, Oil and Gas Reserve Estimation and Disclosures, in order to align the oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosure requirements of Extractive Activities Oil and Gas (Topic 932) with the requirements in the SECs final rule, Modernization of the Oil and Gas Reporting Requirements issued in December 2008. The amendments to Topic 932 are effective for annual reporting periods ending on or after December 31, 2009. In December 2008, the FASB issued an amendment to ASC 715 20, Compensation Retirement Benefits Defined Benefit Plans General, which requires enhanced disclosures regarding company benefit plans. Disclosure regarding plan assets should include discussion about how investment allocation decisions are made, the major categories of plan assets, the inputs and valuation techniques used to measure plan assets and significant concentrations of risk within plan assets. These amendments to ASC 715 20 are effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2009, and earlier application is permitted. Prior year periods presented for comparative purposes are not required to comply. These amendments to ASC 715 20 did not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In January 2010, the FASB issued ASU No. 2010 06, Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements, which amends ASC 820 10 50 to require new disclosures concerning (1) transfers into and out of Levels 1 and 2 of the fair value measurement hierarchy, and (2) activity in Level 3 measurements. In addition, ASU No. 2010 06 clarifies certain existing disclosure requirements regarding the level of disaggregation and inputs and valuation techniques. Finally, ASU No. 2010 06 makes conforming amendments to the guidance on employers disclosures about postretirement benefit plans assets (FASB ASC 715 20 50). ASU No. 2010 06 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2009; however, the requirements to disclose separately purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements in the Level 3 reconciliation are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2010 (and for interim periods within such years). Early adoption is allowed. We are currently evaluating the impact ASU No. 2010 06 may have on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Forward Looking Information The statements regarding future financial and operating performance and results, market prices, future hedging activities, and other statements that are not historical facts contained in this report are forward looking statements. The words expect, project, estimate, believe, anticipate, intend, budget, plan, forecast, predict, may, should, could, will and similar expressions are also intended to identify forward looking statements. Such statements involve risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, market factors, market prices (including regional basis differentials) of natural gas and oil, results for future drilling and marketing activity, future production and costs and other factors detailed herein and in our other Securities and Exchange Commission filings. See Risk Factors in Item 1A for additional information about these risks and uncertainties. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual outcomes may vary materially from those indicated. 45 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 2009 and 2008 Compared We reported net income for 2009 of $148.3 million, or $1.43 per share. During 2008, we reported net income of $211.3 million, or $2.10 per share. Net income decreased in 2009 by $63.0 million, primarily due to a decrease in operating revenues, an increase in depreciation, depletion and amortization, an increase in interest expense, an increase in exploration expense and an increase in direct operations. Also impacting net income in 2008 was a gain on the settlement of a dispute. These decreases and increases were partially offset by decreased operating and income tax expenses, decreased brokered natural gas cost, decreased impairments of oil and gas properties and other assets, decreased impairments of unproved properties, decreased general and administrative expense and loss on sale of assets. Operating revenues decreased by $66.5 million largely due to decreases in brokered natural gas and natural gas production revenues. Operating expenses decreased by $33.1 million between periods due primarily to decreases in impairments of unproved properties and oil and gas properties, brokered natural gas costs, taxes other than income and general and administrative expenses, partially offset by increased depreciation, depletion and amortization, exploration expense and direct operations. In addition, net income was impacted in 2009 by higher interest expense, decreased income tax expense and, to a lesser extent, loss on sale of assets. Income tax expense was lower in 2009 as a result of a decrease in operating income, as discussed above, and a decrease in the effective tax rate. The decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily due to an overall reduction in state deferred tax liabilities and tax benefits associated with foreign tax credits. Natural Gas Production Revenues Our average total company realized natural gas production sales price, including the realized impact of derivative instruments, was $7.47 per Mcf for 2009 compared to $8.39 per Mcf for 2008. These prices include the realized impact of derivative instrument settlements, which increased the price by $3.80 per Mcf in 2009 and by $0.20 per Mcf in 2008. The following table excludes the unrealized loss from the change in fair value of our basis swaps of $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, which has been included within Natural Gas Production Revenues in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. There was no revenue impact from the unrealized change in natural gas derivative fair value for the year ended December 31, 2008.

This increase in natural gas production was primarily a result of increased production in the North region associated with the initiation of production in Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania in the third quarter of 2008 and increased drilling in the Marcellus Shale prospect in Susquehanna County as well as increased natural gas production in the South region associated with the properties we acquired in east Texas in August 2008 and drilling in the Angie field. Partially offsetting these production gains were decreases in production in Canada due to the sale of substantially all of our Canadian properties in April 2009.

Crude Oil and Condensate Revenues Our average total company realized crude oil sales price, including the realized impact of derivative instruments, was $85.52 per Bbl for 2009 compared to $89.11 per Bbl for 2008. These prices include the realized impact of derivative instrument settlements, which increased the price by $28.25 per Bbl in 2009 and decreased the price by $6.33 per Bbl in 2008. There was no revenue impact from the unrealized change in crude oil and condensate derivative fair value in 2009 or 2008.

The increase in crude oil production was primarily the result of increased production in the South region associated with the properties we acquired in the east Texas acquisition in August 2008 and an increase related to Pettet development in the Angie field, partially offset by a decrease in production in Canada due to the sale of substantially all of our Canadian properties in April 2009. 48 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Impact of Derivative Instruments on Operating Revenues The following table reflects the realized impact of cash settlements and the net unrealized change in fair value of derivative instruments: Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 Realized Unrealized Realized Unrealized (In thousands) Operating Revenues Increase/(Decrease) to Revenue Cash Flow Hedges Natural Gas Production $ 371,915 $ $ 17,972 $ Crude Oil 23,112 (4,951 ) Total Cash Flow Hedges 395,027 13,021 Other Derivative Financial Instruments Natural Gas Basis Swaps (1,954 ) Total Other Derivative Financial Instruments (1,954 ) Total Cash Flow Hedges and Other Derivative Financial Instruments $ 395,027 $ (1,954 ) $ 13,021 $ We are exposed to market risk on derivative instruments to the extent of changes in market prices of natural gas and oil. However, the market risk exposure on these derivative contracts is generally offset by the gain or loss recognized upon the ultimate sale of the commodity. Although notional contract amounts are used to express the volume of natural gas price agreements, the amounts that can be subject to credit risk in the event of non performance by third parties are substantially smaller. We do not anticipate any material impact on our financial results due to non performance by third parties. Our primary derivative contract counterparties are Bank of Montreal, BNP Paribas, JPMorgan Chase, Key Bank and Morgan Stanley. Operating Expenses Total costs and expenses from operations decreased by $33.1 million in 2009 from 2008. The primary reasons for this fluctuation are as follows: Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization increased by $35.9 million from 2008 to 2009. This is primarily due to the impact on the DD&A rate of higher capital costs and higher natural gas and oil production volumes, including the east Texas acquisition in August 2008. Brokered Natural Gas Cost decreased by $33.4 million from 2008 to 2009. See the preceding table titled Brokered Natural Gas Revenue and Cost for further analysis. Taxes Other Than Income decreased by $21.9 million from 2008 to 2009 due to lower production taxes as a result of lower average natural gas and crude oil prices. Exploration expense increased by $19.6 million from 2008 to 2009 primarily due to higher charges for idle contract rigs and higher dry hole and geological and geophysical costs. Impairment of Oil & Gas Properties and Other Assets decreased by $18.1 million from 2008 to 2009. Impairments in 2009 consisted of approximately $12.0 million in the Fossil Federal field in San Miguel County, Colorado resulting from lower well performance and $5.6 million in the Beaurline field in Hidalgo County, Texas resulting from lower well performance. Impairment of Unproved Properties decreased by $11.5 million from 2008 to 2009, primarily due to the $17.0 million impairment of Mississippi, Montana and North Dakota leases in 2008 offset by increased lease acquisition costs incurred in several exploratory and developmental areas in the North and in east Texas as well as the amortization of undeveloped costs associated with the east Texas acquisition in August 2008. 49 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements General and Administrative expenses decreased by $5.8 million from 2008 to 2009. This is primarily due to decreased stock compensation expense largely related to a reduction in supplemental employee compensation expense of $14.7 million, partially offset by an increase in performance share award expense of $5.5 million and an increase in pension expense related to our qualified pension plan. Direct Operations expenses increased by $2.1 million from 2008 to 2009 primarily due to higher personnel and labor expenses, increased severance and employee relocation costs associated with the reorganization of operations and higher compressor and outside operated properties charges. Interest Expense, Net Interest expense, net increased by $22.6 million from 2008 to 2009 primarily due to increased interest expense related to the $492 million principal amount of debt we issued in our July and December 2008 private placements. Weighted average borrowings under our credit facility based on daily balances were approximately $166 million during 2009 compared to approximately $172 million during 2008. The weighted average effective interest rate on the credit facility decreased to approximately 4.0% during 2009 compared to approximately 4.8% during 2008. Income Tax Expense Income tax expense decreased by $49.4 million due to a decrease in our pre tax income. The effective tax rates for 2009 and 2008 were 33.6% and 37.0%, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily due to an overall reduction in state deferred tax liabilities and tax benefits associated with foreign tax credits. 2008 and 2007 Compared We reported net income for the year ended December 31, 2008 of $211.3 million, or $2.10 per share. During 2007, we reported net income of $167.4 million, or $1.73 per share. This increase of $43.9 million in net income was primarily due to an increase in operating revenues and gains on asset sales and settlements, partially offset by increased operating, interest and income tax expenses. Operating revenues increased by $213.6 million, largely due to increases in both natural gas production revenues and brokered natural gas revenues and crude oil and condensate revenues. Operating expenses increased by $155.9 million between periods due to increases in all categories of operating expenses other than exploration expense. In addition, net income was impacted by an increase in gain on sale of assets and gain on settlement of dispute of $39.6 million as well as an increase in expenses of $53.4 million resulting from a combination of increased income tax expense and interest and other expenses. Income tax expense was higher in 2008 as a result of higher income before income taxes in 2008 compared to 2007, in addition to an increase in the effective tax rate. 50 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Natural Gas Production Revenues Our average total company realized natural gas production sales price, including the realized impact of derivative instruments, was $8.39 per Mcf for 2008 compared to $7.23 per Mcf for 2007. These prices include the realized impact of derivative instrument settlements, which increased the price by $0.20 per Mcf in 2008 and by $0.99 per Mcf in 2007. There was no revenue impact from the unrealized change in natural gas derivative fair value for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007.

Natural gas production in the South region increased due to increased production in the Minden field, largely due to the properties we acquired in east Texas in August 2008, as well as increased drilling in the County Line field. In addition, natural gas production increased in the North region associated with an increase in the drilling program and increased drilling activity in West Virginia and northeastern Pennsylvania. Canada increased due to drilling in the Hinton field. 51 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Brokered Natural Gas Revenue and Cost Year EndedDecember 31, Variance 2008 2007 Amount Percent Sales Price ($/Mcf) $ 10.39 $ 8.40 $ 1.99 24 % Volume Brokered (Mmcf) x 10,996 x 11,101 (105 ) (1 %) Brokered Natural Gas Revenues (In thousands) $ 114,220 $ 93,215 Purchase Price ($/Mcf) $ 9.14 $ 7.37 $ 1.77 24 % Volume Brokered (Mmcf) x 10,996 x 11,101 (105 ) (1 %) Brokered Natural Gas Cost (In thousands) $ 100,449 $ 81,819 Brokered Natural Gas Margin (In thousands) $ 13,771 $ 11,396 $ 2,375 21 % (In thousands) Sales Price Variance Impact on Revenue $ 21,882 Volume Variance Impact on Revenue (882 ) $ 21,000 (In thousands) Purchase Price Variance Impact on Purchases $ (19,399 ) Volume Variance Impact on Purchases 774 $ (18,625 ) The increased brokered natural gas margin of $2.4 million is a result of an increase in sales price that outpaced the increase in purchase price, partially offset by a decrease in the volumes brokered in 2008 over 2007. Crude Oil and Condensate Revenues Our average total company realized crude oil sales price was $89.11 per Bbl for 2008 compared to $67.16 per Bbl for 2007. These prices include the realized impact of derivative instrument settlements, which decreased the price by $6.33 per Bbl in 2008 and by $0.97 per Bbl in 2007.

The decrease in oil production is mainly the result of a natural decline in crude oil production in the North and South regions. Impact of Derivative Instruments on Operating Revenues The following table reflects the realized impact of cash settlements and the net unrealized change in fair value of derivative instruments: Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 Realized Unrealized Realized Unrealized (In thousands) Operating Revenues Increase / (Decrease) to Revenue Cash Flow Hedges Natural Gas Production $ 17,972 $ $ 79,838 $ Crude Oil (4,951 ) (796 ) Total Cash Flow Hedges $ 13,021 $ $ 79,042 $ Operating Expenses Total costs and expenses from operations increased by $155.9 million in 2008 from 2007. The primary reasons for this fluctuation are as follows: Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization increased by $41.5 million from 2007 to 2008. This is primarily due to the impact on the DD&A rate of higher capital costs and higher natural gas production volumes, including the east Texas acquisition. Impairment of Oil & Gas Properties and Other Assets increased by $31.1 million from 2007 to 2008 primarily related to impairments of approximately $28.3 million in the Trawick field in Rusk County, Texas in the South region resulting from a decline in natural gas prices and higher well costs as well as $3.0 million in the Corral Creek field in Washakie County, Wyoming in the North region resulting from lower than expected performance from the two well field. 53 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements General and Administrative expenses increased by $23.4 million from 2007 to 2008. This is primarily due to increased stock compensation expense related to the payouts of our supplemental employee incentive plan bonuses ($15.7 million) as well as increased expense related to our performance share awards ($5.1 million). Impairment of Unproved Properties increased by $22.5 million from 2007 to 2008, primarily due to increased lease acquisition costs in several exploratory and developmental areas, as well as a $17.0 million charge for the impairment of three exploratory oil and gas prospects located in Mississippi, Montana and North Dakota. These prospects were impaired as a result of the significant decline in commodity prices in the fourth quarter of 2008 and abandonment of our exploration plans. Brokered Natural Gas Cost increased by $18.6 million from 2007 to 2008. See the preceding table titled Brokered Natural Gas Revenue and Cost for further analysis. Direct Operations expenses increased by $14.6 million from 2007 to 2008 primarily due to higher personnel and labor expenses, maintenance expenses, treating, compressor, pipeline and workover costs and vehicle and fuel expenses, partially offset by lower insurance costs. Taxes Other Than Income increased by $12.8 million from 2007 to 2008 due to higher production taxes as a result of higher operating revenues and, to a lesser extent, higher ad valorem taxes, partially offset by lower franchise taxes. Exploration expense decreased by $8.6 million from 2007 to 2008 primarily due to fewer dry holes, partially offset by increased geological and geophysical costs. Interest Expense, Net Interest expense, net increased by $19.2 million in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to increased interest expense related to the debt we issued in our July and December 2008 private placements and, to a lesser extent, higher average credit facility borrowings, offset in part by a lower weighted average interest rate on our revolving credit facility borrowings and lower outstanding borrowings on our 7.19% fixed rate debt. Weighted average borrowings under our credit facility based on daily balances were approximately $172 million during 2008 compared to approximately $52 million during 2007. The weighted average effective interest rate on the credit facility decreased to 4.8% during 2008 from 7.2% during 2007. Income Tax Expense Income tax expense increased by $34.2 million due to a comparable increase in our pre tax income. The effective tax rates for 2008 and 2007 were 37.0% and 35.0%, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to a one time benefit for state taxes in 2007 of approximately $2.8 million attributable to favorable treatment of the gain from the sale of south Louisiana properties in 2006 and a reduction in special deductions in 2008. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market Risk Our primary market risk is exposure to oil and natural gas prices. Realized prices are mainly driven by worldwide prices for oil and spot market prices for North American natural gas production. Commodity prices are volatile and unpredictable. The debt and equity markets have recently experienced unfavorable conditions, which may affect our ability to access those markets. As a result of the volatility and disruption in the capital markets and our increased level of borrowings, we may experience increased costs associated with future borrowings and debt issuances. At this time, we do not believe our liquidity has been materially affected by the recent market events. We will continue to monitor events and circumstances surrounding each of our lenders in our revolving credit facility. 54 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activity Our hedging strategy is designed to reduce the risk of price volatility for our production in the natural gas and crude oil markets. A hedging committee that consists of members of senior management oversees our hedging activity. Our hedging arrangements apply to only a portion of our production and provide only partial price protection. These hedging arrangements limit the benefit to us of increases in prices, but offer protection in the event of price declines. Further, if our counterparties defaulted, this protection might be limited as we might not receive the benefits of the hedges. Please read the discussion below as well as Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a more detailed discussion of our hedging arrangements. Periodically, we enter into derivative commodity instruments to hedge our exposure to price fluctuations on natural gas and crude oil production. Our credit agreement restricts our ability to enter into commodity hedges other than to hedge or mitigate risks to which we have actual or projected exposure or as permitted under our risk management policies and not subjecting us to material speculative risks. At December 31, 2009, we had 12 cash flow hedges open: 11 natural gas price swap arrangements and one crude oil price swap arrangement. During 2009, we entered into six new derivative contracts covering anticipated natural gas production for 2012. These natural gas basis swaps did not qualify for hedge accounting under ASC 815. These natural gas basis swaps mitigate the risk associated with basis differentials that may expand or increase over time, thus reducing the exposure and risk of basis fluctuations. As of December 31, 2009, we had the following outstanding commodity derivatives: Commodity DerivativeType Weighted AverageContract Price Volume ContractPeriod Net UnrealizedGain(In thousands) Derivatives designated as Hedging Instruments under ASC 815 Natural Gas Swap $ 9.30 per Mcf 35,856 Mmcf 2010 $ 98,906 Crude Oil Swap $ 125.00 per Bbl 365 Mbbl 2010 15,564 $ 114,470 Derivatives not qualifying as Hedging Instruments under ASC 815 Natural Gas Basis Swap $ (0.27 ) per Mcf 16,123 Mmcf 2012 (2,003 ) $ 112,467 The amounts set forth under the net unrealized gain column in the tables above represent our total unrealized gain position at December 31, 2009 and do not include the impact of nonperformance risk. Also impacting the total unrealized net gain (reflecting the net receivable position) in accumulated other comprehensive income / (loss) in the Consolidated Balance Sheet is a reduction of $0.2 million related to our assessment of our counterparties nonperformance risk. This risk was primarily evaluated by reviewing credit default swap spreads for the various financial institutions in which we have derivative transactions. From time to time, we enter into natural gas and crude oil swap agreements with counterparties to hedge price risk associated with a portion of our production. These cash flow hedges are not held for trading purposes. Under these price swaps, we receive a fixed price on a notional quantity of natural gas or crude oil in exchange for paying a variable price based on a market based index, such as the NYMEX gas and crude oil futures. During 2009, four natural gas price swaps covered 16,079 Mmcf, or 16%, of our 2009 gas production at an average price of $12.18 per Mcf. We had one crude oil price swap covering 365 Mbbl, or 45%, of our 2009 oil production at a price of $125.25 per Bbl. 55 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements From time to time, we enter into natural gas and crude oil collar agreements with counterparties to hedge price risk associated with a portion of our production. These cash flow hedges are not held for trading purposes. Under the collar arrangements, if the index price rises above the ceiling price, we pay the counterparty. If the index price falls below the floor price, the counterparty pays us. During 2009, 14 natural gas price collars covered 47,253 Mmcf, or 48%, of our 2009 gas production, with a weighted average floor of $9.40 per Mcf and a weighted average ceiling of $12.39 per Mcf. We are exposed to market risk on these open contracts, to the extent of changes in market prices of natural gas and crude oil. However, the market risk exposure on these hedged contracts is generally offset by the gain or loss recognized upon the ultimate sale of the commodity that is hedged. The preceding paragraphs contain forward looking information concerning future production and projected gains and losses, which may be impacted both by production and by changes in the future market prices of energy commodities. See Forward Looking Information for further details. Fair Market Value of Financial Instruments The estimated fair value of financial instruments is the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged currently between willing parties. The carrying amounts reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheet for cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable approximate fair value. The fair value of long term debt is the estimated cost to acquire the debt, including a credit spread for the difference between the issue rate and the year end market rate. The credit spread is our default or repayment risk. The credit spread (premium or discount) is determined by comparing our fixed rate notes to new issues (secured and unsecured) and secondary trades of similar size and credit statistics for both public and private debt. The fair values of all of the fixed rate notes, excluding the credit facility, are based on interest rates currently available to us. The credit facility approximates fair value because this instrument bears interest at rates based on current market rates. We use available marketing data and valuation methodologies to estimate the fair value of debt.
