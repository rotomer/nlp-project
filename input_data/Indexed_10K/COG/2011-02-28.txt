ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our results of operations and our present financial condition. Our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Form 10 K contain additional information that should be referred to when reviewing this material. In 2009, we reorganized our operations by combining the Rocky Mountain and Appalachian areas to form the North region and by combining the Anadarko Basin with our Texas and Louisiana areas to form the South region. Additionally, we exited Canada through the sale of our properties in April 2009. Prior to the third quarter of 2009, we presented our geographic areas as East, Gulf Coast, West and Canada. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to reflect changes in presenting the geographic areas in which we conduct our operations. 33 Table of Contents We operate in one segment, natural gas and oil development, exploitation and exploration, exclusively within the United States. Statements in this discussion may be forward looking. These forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, including those discussed below, which could cause actual results to differ from those expressed. Please read Forward Looking Information for further details. OVERVIEW Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation is a leading independent oil and gas company engaged in the development, exploitation, exploration, production and marketing of natural gas, crude oil and, to a lesser extent, natural gas liquids from its properties in the Continental United States. We also transport, store, gather and produce natural gas for resale. Our exploitation and exploration activities are concentrated in areas with known hydrocarbon resources, which are conducive to multi well, repeatable drilling programs. Our program is designed to be disciplined and balanced, with a focus on achieving strong financial returns. We evaluate three types of investment alternatives that compete for available capital: drilling opportunities, financial opportunities such as debt repayment or repurchase of common stock and acquisition opportunities. Depending on circumstances, we allocate capital among the alternatives based on a rate of return approach. Our goal is to invest capital in the highest return opportunities available at any given time. At any one time, one or more of these may not be economically feasible. Our financial results depend upon many factors, particularly the price of natural gas and crude oil and our ability to market our production on economically attractive terms. Price volatility in the commodity markets has remained prevalent in the last few years. Our realized natural gas and crude oil price was $5.54 per Mcf and $97.91 per Bbl, respectively, in 2010 and were significantly increased by our positions from our derivative instruments, which contributed approximately 22% of our realized revenues in 2010. In an effort to manage commodity price risk, we opportunistically enter into crude oil and natural gas price swaps and collars. These financial instruments are a component of our risk management strategy. Commodity prices are impacted by many factors that are outside of our control. Historically, commodity prices have been volatile and we expect them to remain volatile. Commodity prices are affected by changes in market supply and demand, which are impacted by overall economic activity, weather, pipeline capacity constraints, inventory storage levels, basis differentials and other factors. As a result, we cannot accurately predict future natural gas, NGL and crude oil prices and, therefore, we cannot determine with any degree of certainty what effect increases or decreases will have on our capital program, production volumes and future revenues. In addition to production volumes and commodity prices, finding and developing sufficient amounts of crude oil and natural gas reserves at economical costs are critical to our long term success. See Risk Factors Natural gas and oil prices fluctuate widely, and low prices for an extended period of time are likely to have a material adverse impact on our business and Risk Factors Our future performance depends on our ability to find or acquire additional natural gas and oil reserves that are economically recoverable in Item 1A. The table below illustrates how natural gas prices have fluctuated by month over 2009 and 2010. Index represents the first of the month Henry Hub index price per Mmbtu.

Crude oil revenues increased slightly from 2009 to 2010 primarily due to increased realized prices, partially offset by decreased crude oil production. Prices, including the realized impact of derivative instruments, decreased by 26% for natural gas and increased by 14% for oil. We drilled 113 gross wells with a success rate of 98% in 2010 compared to 143 gross wells with a success rate of 95% in 2009. Total capital and exploration expenditures increased by $251.1 million to $891.5 million in 2010 compared to $640.4 million in 2009. This increase was due to a $230.6 million increase in the North region substantially driven by an expanded Marcellus horizontal drilling program in northeast Pennsylvania to hold acreage and $42.8 million in the South region due to due to an increase in lease acquisitions to establish a greater position in the oil window of the Eagle Ford shale. We believe our cash on hand and operating cash flow in 2011 will be sufficient to fund our budgeted capital and exploration spending of approximately $600 million. Any additional needs are expected to be funded by borrowings from our credit facility. Our 2011 strategy will remain consistent with 2010. We will remain focused on our strategies of pursuing lower risk drilling opportunities that provide more predictable results on our accumulated acreage position. Additionally, we intend to maintain spending discipline and manage our balance sheet in an effort to ensure sufficient liquidity, including cash resources and available credit. In the current year we have allocated our planned program for capital and exploration expenditures primarily to the Marcellus shale in northeast Pennsylvania, and the Eagle Ford shale in south Texas. We believe these strategies are appropriate for our portfolio of projects and the current industry environment and will continue to add shareholder value over the long term. The preceding paragraphs, discussing our strategic pursuits and goals, contain forward looking information. Please read Forward Looking Information for further details. FINANCIAL CONDITION Capital Resources and Liquidity Our primary sources of cash in 2010 were from funds generated from the sale of natural gas and crude oil production (including hedge realizations), borrowings under our revolving credit facility, issuance of private placement debt and the sales of properties and other assets during the year. These cash flows were primarily used to fund our development and exploratory expenditures, in addition to repayments for debt and related interest, payments for debt issuance costs, contributions to our pension plan and dividends. See below for additional discussion and analysis of cash flow. 35 Table of Contents We generate cash from the sale of natural gas and crude oil. Operating cash flow fluctuations are substantially driven by commodity prices and changes in our production volumes. Prices for crude oil and natural gas have historically been volatile, including seasonal influences characterized by peak demand and higher prices in the winter heating season; however, the impact of other risks and uncertainties have also influenced prices throughout the recent years. In addition, fluctuations in cash flow may result in an increase or decrease in our capital and exploration expenditures. See Results of Operations for a review of the impact of prices and volumes on revenues. Our working capital is also substantially influenced by variables discussed above. From time to time, our working capital will reflect a surplus, while at other times it will reflect a deficit. This fluctuation is not unusual. We believe we have adequate availability under our credit facility and liquidity available to meet our working capital requirements. Year Ended December 31, (In thousands) 2010 2009 2008 Cash Flows Provided by Operating Activities $ 484,911 $ 614,052 $ 634,447 Cash Flows Used in Investing Activities (613,741 ) (531,027 ) (1,452,289 ) Cash Flows Provided by / (Used in) Financing Activities 144,621 (70,968 ) 827,445 Net Increase / (Decrease) in Cash and Cash Equivalents $ 15,791 $ 12,057 $ 9,603 Operating Activities. Key components impacting net operating cash flows are commodity prices, production volumes and operating costs. Net cash provided by operating activities in 2010 decreased by $129.1 million over 2009. This decrease was mainly due to a decrease in oil and gas revenues and higher operating and interest expense. Average realized natural gas prices decreased by 26% in 2010 compared to 2009 and average realized crude oil prices increased by 14% over the same period. Equivalent production volumes increased by 27% in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to higher natural gas production. We are unable to predict future commodity prices and, as a result, cannot provide any assurance about future levels of net cash provided by operating activities. Realized prices may continue to decline during 2011. For 2010, we had natural gas price swaps covering 35.9 Bcf, or 29%, of our 2010 natural gas production at an average price of $9.30 per Mcf. We also had crude oil price swaps covering 730 Mmbl, or 90%, of our 2010 crude oil production at an average price of $104.25 per Bbl. As of December 31, 2010, we have natural gas price swaps covering 12.9 Bcf of our 2011 gas production at an average price of $6.24 per Mcf and crude oil collars covering 365 MBbls of our 2011 crude oil production, with a floor of $80.00 per Bbl and a ceiling of $93.25 per Bbl. Accordingly, based on our current hedge position, we will be more subject to the effects of natural gas and crude oil price volatility in 2011 than in 2010. In addition, given the current market for derivatives, if we were to hedge all our 2011 production, we would expect our realized prices to be lower than our 2010 realized prices. Net cash provided by operating activities in 2009 decreased by $20.4 million over 2008. This decrease was mainly due to a decrease in oil and gas revenues, partially offset by lower operating, interest and tax expense. Average realized natural gas prices decreased by 11% in 2009 compared to 2008 and average realized crude oil prices decreased by 4% over the same period. Equivalent production volumes increased by 8% in 2009 compared to 2008 as a result of higher natural gas and crude oil production. See Results of Operations for a discussion on commodity prices and a review of the impact of prices and volumes on sales revenue. Investing Activities. The primary uses of cash in investing activities were capital spending and exploration expenses. We established the budget for these amounts based on our current estimate of future commodity prices and cash flows. Due to the volatility of commodity prices and new opportunities which may arise, our capital 36 Table of Contents expenditures may be periodically adjusted during any given year. Cash flows used in investing activities increased by $82.7 million from 2009 to 2010 and decreased by $921.3 million from 2008 to 2009. The increase from 2009 to 2010 was due to an increase of $246.4 million in acquisitions and capital and exploration expenditures partially offset by an increase of $163.3 million of proceeds from the sale of assets. The decrease from 2008 to 2009 was due to a decrease of $843.2 million in acquisitions and capital expenditures and an increase of $78.1 million of proceeds from the sale of assets. In August 2008, we completed the acquisition of producing properties, leasehold acreage and a natural gas gathering infrastructure in east Texas for total net cash consideration of approximately $604.0 million. Financing Activities. Cash flows provided by financing activities increased by $215.6 million from 2009 to 2010. This was primarily due to an increase in borrowings of $420.0 million, partially offset by an increase in repayments of debt of $188.0 million, an increase in cash paid for capitalized debt issuance costs by a total of $3.4 million and a decrease of $13.7 million in the tax benefit associated with stock based compensation. Cash flows provided by financing activities decreased by $898.4 million from 2008 to 2009. This was primarily due to a decrease in borrowings from debt of $787 million, partially offset by a decrease in repayments of debt of $208 million, and a decrease in net proceeds from the sale of common stock of $316.1 million primarily due to our June 2008 issuance of common stock in a public offering. Common stock proceeds and debt borrowings in 2008 were largely used to finance the acquisition of east Texas properties and undeveloped acreage. Cash paid for capitalized debt issuance costs and dividends increased by a total of $6.4 million, partially offset by an increase of $3.1 million in the tax benefit associated with stock based compensation. At December 31, 2010, we had $213.0 million of borrowings outstanding under our unsecured credit facility at a weighted average interest rate of 3.1%. In December 2010, we completed a private placement of $175.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured fixed rate notes with a weighted average interest rate of 5.58%, consisting of amounts due in January 2021, 2023 and 2026. In September 2010, we amended and restated our revolving credit facility to increase the available credit line to $900 million with an accordion feature allowing us to increase the available credit line to $1.0 billion, if any one or more of the existing banks or new banks agree to provide such increased commitment amount, and to extend the term to September 2015. The available credit line is subject to adjustment on the basis of the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves (as determined by the banks based on our reserve reports and engineering reports) and certain other assets and the outstanding principal balance of our senior notes. The amended facility provides for a $1.5 billion borrowing base. We strive to manage our debt at a level below the available credit line in order to maintain excess borrowing capacity. Our revolving credit facility includes a covenant limiting our total debt. As of December 31, 2010, our available credit under our credit facility is $525.0 million. In June 2010, we amended the agreements governing our credit facility and senior notes to amend the required asset coverage ratio (the present value of our proved reserves plus working capital to debt) contained in the agreements. The amendment also changed the ratio for maximum calculated indebtedness to borrowing base (as defined in the credit facility agreement). In July 2008, we completed a private placement of $425 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured fixed rate notes with a weighted average interest rate of 6.51%, consisting of amounts due in July 2018, 2020 and 2023. In December 2008, we completed a private placement of $67 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured 9.78% fixed rate notes due in December 2018. 37 Table of Contents In June 2008, we entered into an underwriting agreement pursuant to which we sold an aggregate of 5,002,500 shares of common stock at a price to us of $62.66 per share. We received $313.5 million in net proceeds, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions. These net proceeds were used temporarily to reduce outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility prior to funding a portion of the purchase price of our east Texas acquisition, which closed in the third quarter of 2008. Immediately prior to (and in connection with) this issuance, we retired 5,002,500 shares of treasury stock, which had a weighted average purchase price of $16.46. Management believes that, with internally generated cash, existing cash and availability under our revolving credit facility, we have the capacity to finance our spending plans and maintain our strong financial position. At the same time, we will closely monitor the capital markets. Capitalization Information about our capitalization is as follows: December 31, (Dollars in thousands) 2010 2009 Debt(1) $ 975,000 $ 805,000 Stockholders Equity $ 1,872,700 $ 1,812,514 Total Capitalization $ 2,847,700 $ 2,617,514 Debt to Capitalization 34 % 31 % Cash and Cash Equivalents $ 55,949 $ 40,158 (1) Includes $213.0 million and $143.0 million of borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2010, we paid dividends of $12.5 million ($0.12 per share) on our common stock. A regular dividend has been declared for each quarter since we became a public company in 1990. Capital and Exploration Expenditures On an annual basis, we generally fund most of our capital and exploration activities, excluding any significant oil and gas property acquisitions, with cash generated from operations and, when necessary, borrowings under our revolving credit facility. We budget these capital expenditures based on our projected cash flows for the year. The following table presents major components of our capital and exploration expenditures for the three years ended December 31, 2010. (In thousands) 2010 2009 2008 Capital Expenditures Drilling and Facilities(1) $ 654,153 $ 401,143 $ 624,344 Leasehold Acquisitions 130,675 145,681 152,666 Acquisitions 801 394 624,975 Pipeline and Gathering 54,811 32,861 36,900 Other 8,368 9,506 10,855 848,808 589,585 1,449,740 Exploration Expense 42,725 50,784 31,200 Total $ 891,533 $ 640,369 $ 1,480,940 (1) Includes Canadian currency translation effects of $4.6 million and $(27.7) million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. There was no impact from Canadian currency translation in 2010. 38 Table of Contents We plan to drill approximately 110 gross wells (83.1 net) in 2011 compared with 113 gross wells (87.1 net) drilled in 2010. This 2011 drilling program includes approximately $600 million in total capital and exploration expenditures, down from $891.5 million in 2010. This decline is primarily due to the lower well count together with lower projected lease acquisition expenditures as the result of our reduced program spending due to lower commodity prices and reduced infrastructure investments. We will continue to assess the natural gas and crude oil price environment and our liquidity position and may increase or decrease the capital and exploration expenditures accordingly. There are many factors that impact our depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) rate. These include reserve additions and revisions, development costs, impairments and changes in anticipated production in future periods. In 2011, management expects a small decrease in our DD&A rate primarily due to increased production and reserve additions in the Marcellus shale. Such changes in our DD&A rate and related expense do not have an impact on our cash flows. Contractual Obligations Our material contractual obligations include long term debt, interest on long term debt, firm gas transportation agreements, drilling rig commitments and operating leases. We have no off balance sheet debt or other similar unrecorded obligations. A summary of our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2010 are set forth in the following table: Payments Due by Year (In thousands) Total 2011 2012 to2013 2014 to2015 2016 &Beyond Long Term Debt(1) $ 975,000 $ $ 75,000 $ $ 900,000 Interest on Long Term Debt(2) 448,894 59,140 112,780 99,098 177,876 Firm Gas Transportation Agreements(3) 485,619 32,504 64,040 56,712 332,363 Operating Leases(3) 22,158 5,414 9,902 6,842 Total Contractual Cash Obligations $ 1,931,671 $ 97,058 $ 261,722 $ 162,652 $ 1,410,239 (1) At December 31, 2010, we had $213.0 million of debt outstanding under our revolving credit facility. See Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for details of long term debt. (2) Interest payments have been calculated utilizing the fixed rates of our $762.0 million long term debt outstanding at December 31, 2010. Interest payments on our revolving credit facility were calculated by assuming that the December 31, 2010 outstanding balance of $213.0 million will be outstanding through the September 2015 maturity date. A constant interest rate of 3.8% was assumed, which was the 2010 weighted average interest rate. Actual results will differ from these estimates and assumptions. (3) For further information on our obligations under firm gas transportation agreements and operating leases, see Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Amounts related to our asset retirement obligations are not included in the above table given the uncertainty regarding the actual timing of such expenditures. The total amount of asset retirement obligations at December 31, 2010 was $72.3 million, up from $29.7 million at December 31, 2009, primarily due to $40.4 million in revisions of previous estimates due to increased plugging and abandonment costs and $1.9 million in accretion expense during 2010. See Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details. Potential Impact of Our Critical Accounting Policies Readers of this document and users of the information contained in it should be aware of how certain events may impact our financial results based on the accounting policies in place. Our most significant policies are discussed below. 39 Table of Contents Successful Efforts Method of Accounting We follow the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas producing activities. Acquisition costs for proved and unproved properties are capitalized when incurred. Exploration costs, including geological and geophysical costs, the costs of carrying and retaining unproved properties and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed. Development costs, including costs to drill and equip development wells and successful exploratory drilling costs to locate proved reserves are capitalized. Oil and Gas Reserves The process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is inherently imprecise, and the reserve data included in this document are only estimates. The process relies on interpretations of available geologic, geophysical, engineering and production data. The extent, quality and reliability of this technical data can vary. The process also requires certain economic assumptions, some of which are mandated by the SEC, such as oil and gas prices. Additional assumptions include drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes and availability of funds. Any significant variance in the interpretations or assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of our reserves. Our reserves have been prepared by our petroleum engineering staff and audited by Miller & Lents, Ltd., independent petroleum engineers, who in their opinion determined the estimates presented to be reasonable in the aggregate. For more information regarding reserve estimation, including historical reserve revisions, refer to the Supplemental Oil and Gas Information. Our rate of recording DD&A expense is dependent upon our estimate of proved and proved developed reserves, which are utilized in our unit of production method calculation. If the estimates of proved reserves were to be reduced, the rate at which we record DD&A expense would increase, reducing net income. Such a reduction in reserves may result from lower market prices, which may make it uneconomic to drill for and produce higher cost fields. A five percent positive or negative revision to proved reserves throughout the Company would decrease or increase the DD&A rate by approximately ($0.10) to $0.12 per Mcfe. Revisions in significant fields may individually affect our DD&A rate. It is estimated that a positive or negative reserve revision of 10% in one of our most productive fields would have a ($0.06) to $0.07 per Mcfe impact on our total DD&A rate. These estimated impacts are based on current data, and actual events could require different adjustments to our DD&A rate. In addition, a decline in proved reserve estimates may impact the outcome of our impairment test under Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment. Due to the inherent imprecision of the reserve estimation process, risks associated with the operations of proved producing properties and market sensitive commodity prices utilized in our impairment analysis, management cannot determine if an impairment is reasonably likely to occur in the future. Carrying Value of Oil and Gas Properties We evaluate the impairment of our oil and gas properties on a field by field basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an assets carrying amount may not be recoverable. We compare expected undiscounted future cash flows to the net book value of the asset. If the future undiscounted expected cash flows, based on our estimate of future crude oil and natural gas prices, operating costs and anticipated production from proved reserves are lower than the net book value of the asset, the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value. Commodity pricing is estimated by using a combination of assumptions management uses in its budgeting and forecasting process as well as historical and current prices adjusted for geographical location and quality differentials, as well as other factors that management believes will impact realizable prices. In the event that commodity prices remain low or continue to decline, there could be a significant revision in the future. Fair value is calculated by discounting the future cash flows. The discount factor used is based on rates utilized by market participants that are commensurate with the risks inherent in the development and production of the underlying natural gas and oil. 40 Table of Contents Costs attributable to our unproved properties are not subject to the impairment analysis described above; however, a portion of the costs associated with such properties is subject to amortization based on past experience and average property lives. Average property lives are determined on a geographical basis and based on the estimated life of unproved property leasehold rights. Historically, the average property life in each of the regions has not significantly changed. The commodity price environment may impact the capital available for exploration projects as well as development drilling. We have considered these impacts when determining the amortization rate of our undeveloped acreage, especially in exploratory areas. If the average unproved property life decreases or increases by one year, the amortization would increase by approximately $17.3 million or decrease by approximately $12.3 million, respectively per year. In the past, based on the customary terms of the leases, the average leasehold life in the South region has been shorter than the average life in the North region. Average property lives in the North and South regions have been five and three years, respectively. As these properties are developed and reserves are proven, the remaining capitalized costs are subject to depreciation and depletion. If the development of these properties is deemed unsuccessful, the capitalized costs related to the unsuccessful activity is expensed in the year the determination is made. The rate at which the unproved properties are written off depends on the timing and success of our future exploration and development program. Asset Retirement Obligation The majority of our asset retirement obligation relates to the plugging and abandonment of oil and gas wells and to a lesser extent meter stations, pipelines, processing plants and compressors. The Company records the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred, with the associated asset retirement cost capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related long lived asset. The recognition of an asset retirement obligation requires management to make assumptions that include estimated plugging and abandonment costs, timing of settlements, inflation rates and discount rate. In periods subsequent to initial measurement, the asset retirement cost is allocated to expense using a systematic and rational method over the assets useful life, while increases in the discounted ARO liability resulting from the passage of time (accretion expense) is reflected as depreciation, depletion and amortization expense. Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities We follow the accounting prescribed in ASC 815. Under ASC 815, the fair value of each derivative instrument is recorded as either an asset or liability on the balance sheet. At the end of each quarterly period, these instruments are marked to market. The gain or loss on the change in fair value is recorded as Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, a component of equity, to the extent that the derivative instrument is designated as a hedge and is effective. The ineffective portion, if any, of the change in the fair value of derivatives designated as hedges, and the change in fair value of derivatives not qualifying as hedges, is recorded currently in earnings as a component of Natural Gas and Crude Oil and Condensate Revenue in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. The fair value of our derivative instruments are measured based on quotes from the Companys counterparties. Such quotes have been derived using valuation models that consider various inputs including current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments, quoted forward prices for natural gas and crude oil, volatility factors and interest rates, such as a LIBOR curve for a similar length of time as the derivative contract term as applicable. These estimates are verified using relevant NYMEX futures contracts or are compared to multiple quotes obtained from counterparties for reasonableness. The Company measured the nonperformance risk of its counterparties by reviewing credit default swap spreads for the various financial institutions in which it has derivative transactions. In times where we have net derivative contract liabilities, our nonperformance risk is evaluated using a market credit spread provided by our bank. 41 Table of Contents Employee Benefit Plans Our costs of long term employee benefits, particularly pension and postretirement benefits, are incurred over long periods of time, and involve many uncertainties over those periods. The net periodic benefit cost attributable to current periods is based on several assumptions about such future uncertainties, and is sensitive to changes in those assumptions. It is managements responsibility, often with the assistance of independent experts, to select assumptions that in its judgment represent best estimates of those uncertainties. It also is managements responsibility to review those assumptions periodically to reflect changes in economic or other factors that affect those assumptions. Significant assumptions used to determine our projected pension obligation and related costs include discount rates, expected return on plan assets, and rate of compensation increases, while the assumptions used to determine our postretirement benefit obligation and related costs include discount rates and health care cost trends. See Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a full discussion of our employee benefit plans. Stock Based Compensation We account for stock based compensation under a fair value based method of accounting prescribed under ASC 718. Under the fair value method, compensation cost is measured at the grant date and remeasured each reporting period for liability classified awards based on the fair value of an award and is recognized over the service period, which is usually the vesting period. To calculate the fair value, either a binomial or Black Scholes valuation model may be used. The use of these models requires significant judgment with respect to expected life, volatility and other factors. Stock based compensation cost for all types of awards is included in General and Administrative Expense in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. See Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a full discussion of our stock based compensation. OTHER ISSUES AND CONTINGENCIES Regulations. Our operations are subject to various types of regulation by federal, state and local authorities. See Regulation of Oil and Natural Gas Exploration and Production, Natural Gas Marketing, Gathering and Transportation, Federal Regulation of Petroleum and Environmental Regulations in the Other Business Matters section of Item 1 for a discussion of these regulations. Restrictive Covenants. Our ability to incur debt and to make certain types of investments is subject to certain restrictive covenants in our various debt instruments. Among other requirements, our revolving credit agreement and our senior notes specify a minimum annual coverage ratio of operating cash flow to interest expense for the trailing four quarters of 2.8 to 1.0. In addition, we are required to maintain an asset coverage ratio of the present value of proved reserves plus working capital to debt of 1.75 to 1.0 and a current ratio of 1.0 to 1.0. Our senior notes require us to maintain a ratio of cash and proved reserves to indebtedness and other liabilities of 1.75 to 1.0. At December 31, 2010, we were in compliance in all material respects with all restrictive covenants on both the revolving credit agreement and notes. In the unforeseen event that we fail to comply with these covenants, we may apply for a temporary waiver with the lender, which, if granted, would allow us a period of time to remedy the situation. Operating Risks and Insurance Coverage. Our business involves a variety of operating risks. See Risk Factors We face a variety of hazards and risks that could cause substantial financial losses in Item 1A. In accordance with customary industry practice, we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these risks and losses. The occurrence of any of these events not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations. The costs of these insurance policies are somewhat dependent on our historical claims experience and also the areas in which we choose to operate. Commodity Pricing and Risk Management Activities. Our revenues, operating results, financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital depend substantially on prevailing prices for natural gas and oil. Declines in oil and gas prices may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity, 42 Table of Contents ability to obtain financing and operating results. Lower oil and gas prices also may reduce the amount of oil and gas that we can produce economically. Historically, oil and gas prices and markets have been volatile, with prices fluctuating widely, and they are likely to continue to be volatile. Depressed prices in the future would have a negative impact on our future financial results. In particular, substantially lower prices would significantly reduce revenue and could potentially trigger an impairment under ASC 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment. Because our reserves are predominantly natural gas, changes in natural gas prices may have a more significant impact on our financial results. The majority of our production is sold at market responsive prices. Generally, if the related commodity index falls, the price that we receive for our production will also decline. Therefore, the amount of revenue that we realize is partially determined by factors beyond our control. However, management may mitigate this price risk on all or a portion of our anticipated production with the use of derivative financial instruments. Most recently, we have used financial instruments such as price collars and swap arrangements to reduce the impact of declining prices on our revenue. Under both arrangements, there is also a risk that the movement of index prices may result in our inability to realize the full benefit of an improvement in market conditions. Settlement of Dispute. In December 2008, we settled a dispute with a third party and as a result recorded a gain of $51.9 million. The dispute involved the propriety of possession of our intellectual property by a third party. The settlement was comprised of $20.2 million in cash paid by the third party to us and $31.7 million related to the fair value of unproved property rights transferred by the third party to us. The fair market value of the unproved property rights was determined based on observable market costs and conditions over a recent time period. Values were pro rated by property based on the primary term remaining on the properties. Recently Adopted Accounting Standards In February 2010, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2010 09, Subsequent Events, which amends ASC 855 to eliminate the requirement to disclose the date through which management has evaluated subsequent events in the financial statements. ASU No. 2010 09 was effective upon issuance and its adoption had no impact on the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Effective January 1, 2010, the Company partially adopted the provisions of FASB ASU No. 2010 06, Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements, which amends ASC 820 10 50 to require new disclosures concerning (1) transfers into and out of Levels 1 and 2 of the fair value measurement hierarchy, and (2) activity in Level 3 measurements. In addition, ASU No. 2010 06 clarifies certain existing disclosure requirements regarding the level of disaggregation and inputs and valuation techniques and makes conforming amendments to the guidance on employers disclosures about postretirement benefit plans assets. The requirements to disclose separately purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements in the Level 3 reconciliation are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2010 (and for interim periods within such years). Accordingly, the Company will apply the disclosure requirements relative to the Level 3 reconciliation in the first quarter of 2011. There was no impact on the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows as a result of the partial adoption of ASU No. 2010 06. For further information, please refer to Note 14. Forward Looking Information The statements regarding future financial and operating performance and results, market prices, future hedging activities, and other statements that are not historical facts contained in this report are forward looking statements. The words expect, project, estimate, believe, anticipate, intend, budget, plan, forecast, predict, may, should, could, will and similar expressions are also intended to identify forward looking statements. Such statements involve risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, market factors, market prices (including regional basis differentials) of natural gas and oil, results for future drilling and marketing activity, future production and costs and other factors detailed herein and in our other Securities and Exchange Commission filings. See Risk Factors in Item 1A for additional information about these risks and 43 Table of Contents uncertainties. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual outcomes may vary materially from those indicated. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 2010 and 2009 Compared We reported net income for 2010 of $103.4 million, or $0.99 per share. During 2009, we reported net income of $148.3 million, or $1.43 per share. Net income decreased in 2010 by $45.0 million, primarily due to increased operating, income tax and interest expenses and decreased operating revenues partially offset by increased gain on sale of assets. Operating revenues decreased by $35.2 million largely due to decreases in natural gas and brokered natural gas revenues, partially offset by an increase in crude oil and condensate revenues. Operating expenses increased by $90.2 million between periods due primarily to increases in depreciation, depletion and amortization, impairment of oil and gas properties and other assets, general and administrative expense and direct operations. These increases were partially offset by decreases in brokered natural gas cost, taxes other than income and exploration expense. Revenue, Price and Volume Variances Below is a discussion of revenue, price and volume variances. Year Ended December 31, Variance 2010 2009 Amount Percent Revenue Variances (In thousands) Natural Gas(1) $ 694,803 $ 731,688 $ (36,885) (5 %) Brokered Natural Gas 65,281 75,283 (10,002) (13 %) Crude Oil and Condensate 79,091 69,936 9,155 13 % Other 5,086 4,323 763 18 % (1) Natural Gas Revenues exclude the unrealized loss from the change in fair value of our basis swaps of $0.2 million and $2.0 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively.

(2) These prices include the realized impact of derivative instrument settlements, which increased the price by $22.31 per Bbl in 2010 and by $28.85 per Bbl in 2009. 44 Table of Contents Natural Gas Revenues The decrease in Natural Gas Revenue of $36.9 million, excluding the impact of the unrealized gains and losses discussed above, is due primarily to the decrease in realized natural gas prices, decreased production in the South region associated with normal production declines, delays in completions and a shift from gas to oil projects, as well as the sale of our Canadian properties in April 2009. Partially offsetting these decreases was an increase in natural gas production in the North region associated with increased drilling and the start up of a portion of the Lathrop compressor station in the Marcellus shale at the end of the second quarter of 2010. Crude Oil and Condensate Revenues The $9.2 million increase in crude oil and condensate revenues is primarily due to an increase in realized crude oil prices and an increase in crude oil production in the South region associated with the Eagle Ford shale and Pettet formation production. These increases are partially offset by lower production in the North region as well as the sale of our Canadian properties in April 2009. Brokered Natural Gas Revenue and Cost Year EndedDecember 31, Variance Price andVolumeVariances(In thousands) 2010 2009 Amount Percent Brokered Natural Gas Sales Sales Price ($/Mcf) $ 5.41 $ 5.95 $ (0.54 ) (9 %) $ (6,527 ) Volume Brokered (Mmcf) x 12,072 x 12,656 (584 ) (5 %) (3,475 ) Brokered Natural Gas Revenues (In thousands) $ 65,281 $ 75,283 $ (10,002 ) Brokered Natural Gas Purchases Purchase Price ($/Mcf) $ 4.68 $ 5.30 $ (0.62 ) (12 %) $ 7,489 Volume Brokered (Mmcf) x 12,072 x 12,656 (584 ) (5 %) 3,075 Brokered Natural Gas Cost (In thousands) $ 56,466 $ 67,030 $ 10,564 Brokered Natural Gas Margin (In thousands) $ 8,815 $ 8,253 $ 562 The increased brokered natural gas margin of $0.6 million is a result of a lesser decrease in sales price than in purchase price, partially offset by a decrease in volumes brokered. 45 Table of Contents Impact of Derivative Instruments on Operating Revenues The following table reflects the realized impact of cash settlements and the net unrealized change in fair value of derivative instruments: Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 (In thousands) Realized Unrealized Realized Unrealized Operating Revenues Increase / (Decrease) to Revenue Cash Flow Hedges Natural Gas $ 154,960 $ $ 371,915 $ Crude Oil 18,030 23,112 Total Cash Flow Hedges 172,990 395,027 Other Derivative Financial Instruments Natural Gas Basis Swaps (226 ) (1,954 ) Total Other Derivative Financial Instruments (226 ) (1,954 ) Total Cash Flow Hedges and Other Derivative Financial Instruments $ 172,990 $ (226 ) $ 395,027 $ (1,954 ) Operating and Other Expenses Year Ended December 31, Variance (In thousands) 2010 2009 Amount Percent Operating and Other Expenses Brokered Natural Gas Cost $ 56,466 $ 67,030 $ (10,564 ) (16 %) Direct Operations Field and Pipeline 99,642 93,985 5,657 6 % Taxes Other Than Income 37,894 44,649 (6,755 ) (15 %) Exploration 42,725 50,784 (8,059 ) (16 %) Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization 327,083 251,260 75,823 30 % Impairment of Oil and Gas Properties and Other Assets 40,903 17,622 23,281 132 % General and Administrative 79,177 68,374 10,803 16 % Total Operating Expense $ 683,890 $ 593,704 $ 90,186 15 % (Gain) / Loss on Sale of Assets $ (106,294 ) $ 3,303 $ (109,597 ) (3,318 %) Interest Expense and Other 67,941 58,979 8,962 15 % Income Tax Expense 95,112 74,947 20,165 27 % Total costs and expenses from operations increased by $90.2 million from 2009 to 2010. The primary reasons for this fluctuation are as follows: Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization increased by $75.8 million from 2009 to 2010, primarily due to increased depreciation and depletion from increased capital spending and higher equivalent production volumes. Amortization of unproved properties increased $17.6 million primarily due to increased unproved leasehold costs in the Marcellus shale and the Eagle Ford shale in south Texas in late 2009 and continuing into 2010. Impairment of Oil & Gas Properties and Other Assets increased by $23.3 million from 2009 to 2010. Impairments in 2010 consisted of a $35.8 million impairment of two south Texas fields due to continued price declines and limited activity and a $5.1 million impairment related to drilling and service equipment. 46 Table of Contents General and Administrative expenses increased by $10.8 million from 2009 to 2010. The increase is primarily due to a $9.9 million increase in legal expenses primarily related to the December 2010 PaDEP settlement, ongoing litigation and related legal fees, a $8.3 million increase in pension expense primarily due to termination and amendment of our pension plans and a $2.4 million increase in incentive compensation. These increases were partially offset by an $8.5 million decrease in stock compensation expense primarily due to prior year awards that fully vested in February 2010 and a reduction in stock price. Brokered Natural Gas Cost decreased by $10.6 million from 2009 to 2010. See the preceding table titled Brokered Natural Gas Revenue and Cost for further analysis. Exploration expense decreased by $8.1 million from 2009 to 2010 primarily due to lower dry hole costs as a result of drilling one dry hole in 2010 compared to two dry holes in 2009. The decrease was partially offset by higher geophysical and geological expenses associated with seismic purchases related to our Marcellus, Eagle Ford and Haynesville shale properties during 2010. Taxes Other Than Income decreased by $6.8 million from 2009 to 2010 primarily due to decreased production and ad valorem taxes due to lower natural gas prices and property values partially offset by increased business and occupational taxes and franchise taxes. Direct Operations expenses increased by $5.7 million from 2009 to 2010 primarily due to lease maintenance expense in both the North and South regions and plug and abandonment costs in the North region related to plugging and abandoning three vertical wells in accordance with the PaDEPs Second Modified Consent Order. Gain / (Loss) on Sale of Assets Gain / (Loss) on Sale of Assets increased by $109.6 million from 2009 to 2010. During 2010, we recognized a gain of $49.3 million from the sale of our Pennsylvania gathering infrastructure, $40.7 million from the sale of our investment in Tourmaline, $10.8 million from the sale of certain oil and gas properties in the Texas Panhandle, $10.3 million on the sale of our Woodford shale properties, partially offset by an impairment loss of $5.1 million on certain oil and gas properties in Colorado. During 2009, we recognized a $16.0 million loss on sale of assets primarily due to the sale of the Canadian properties, partially offset by a $12.7 million gain on sale of assets related to the sale of our Thornwood properties in the North region. Interest Expense, Net Interest expense, net increased by $9.0 million from 2009 to 2010 primarily due to an increase in weighted average borrowings under our credit facility based on daily balances of approximately $340.4 million during 2010 compared to approximately $166 million during 2009, and to a lesser extent to the $175.0 million of debt we issued in December 2010. The weighted average effective interest rate on the credit facility decreased to approximately 3.8% during 2010 compared to approximately 4.0% during 2009. Interest expense in 2010 also includes a make whole premium payment of $2.8 million associated with the early payment of $75.0 million of the 7.33% fixed rate notes that were due in July 2011. Income Tax Expense Income tax expense increased by $20.2 million due to a higher effective tax rate offset by a decrease in our pre tax income. The effective tax rates for 2010 and 2009 were 47.9% and 33.6%, respectively. The effective tax rate was higher primarily due to an increase in our state rates used in establishing deferred income taxes mainly due to a shift in our state apportionment factors to higher rate states, primarily in Pennsylvania, as a result of our increased focus on development of our Marcellus shale properties. 47 Table of Contents 2009 and 2008 Compared We reported net income for 2009 of $148.3 million, or $1.43 per share. During 2008, we reported net income of $211.3 million, or $2.10 per share. Net income decreased in 2009 by $63.0 million, primarily due to decreased operating revenues and increased operating expenses, partially offset by increased gain on sale of assets. Operating revenues decreased by $66.5 million largely due to decreases in brokered natural gas and natural gas revenues. Operating expenses decreased by $33.1 million between periods due primarily to decreases in brokered natural gas costs, taxes other than income and general and administrative expenses, partially offset by increased depreciation, depletion and amortization, exploration expense and direct operations. In addition, net income was impacted in 2009 by higher interest expense, decreased income tax expense and, to a lesser extent, loss on sale of assets. Income tax expense was lower in 2009 as a result of a decrease in operating income, as discussed above, and a decrease in the effective tax rate. The decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily due to an overall reduction in state deferred tax liabilities and tax benefits associated with foreign tax credits. Revenue, Price and Volume Variances Below is a discussion of revenue, price and volume variances.

(2) These prices include the realized impact of derivative instrument settlements, which increased the price by $28.25 per Bbl in 2009 and decreased the price by $6.33 per Bbl in 2008. Natural Gas Revenues The decrease in Natural Gas Revenue of $27.1 million, excluding the impact of the unrealized gains and losses discussed above, is almost entirely due to the sale of our Canadian properties and a decrease in realized natural gas prices that was essentially offset by an increase in natural gas production. This increase in natural gas 48 Table of Contents production was primarily a result of increased production in the North region associated with the initiation of production in Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania in the third quarter of 2008 and increased drilling in the Marcellus shale prospect in Susquehanna County as well as increased natural gas production in the South region associated with the properties we acquired in east Texas in August 2008 and drilling in the Angie field. Partially offsetting these production gains were decreases in production in Canada due to the sale of substantially all of our Canadian properties in April 2009. Crude Oil and Condensate Revenues The increase in crude oil production, partially offset by a decrease in realized crude oil prices, resulted in a net revenue increase of $0.2 million. The increase in crude oil production was primarily the result of increased production in the South region associated with the properties we acquired in the east Texas acquisition in August 2008 and an increase related to Pettet formation production in the Angie field, partially offset by a decrease in production in Canada due to the sale of substantially all of our Canadian properties in April 2009.

The primary reasons for this fluctuation are as follows: Brokered Natural Gas Cost decreased by $33.4 million from 2008 to 2009. See the preceding table titled Brokered Natural Gas Revenue and Cost for further analysis. Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization increased by $24.3 million from 2008 to 2009. This is primarily due to the impact on the DD&A rate of higher capital costs and higher natural gas and oil production volumes, including the east Texas acquisition in August 2008. Amortization of unproved properties decreased by $11.5 million from 2008 to 2009, primarily due to the $17.0 million impairment of Mississippi, Montana and North Dakota leases in 2008 offset by increased lease acquisition costs incurred in several exploratory and developmental areas in the North and in east Texas as well as the amortization of undeveloped costs associated with the east Texas acquisition in August 2008. Taxes Other Than Income decreased by $21.9 million from 2008 to 2009 due to lower production taxes as a result of lower average natural gas and crude oil prices. Exploration expense increased by $19.6 million from 2008 to 2009 primarily due to higher charges for idle contract rigs and higher dry hole and geological and geophysical costs. Impairment of Oil & Gas Properties and Other Assets decreased by $18.1 million from 2008 to 2009. Impairments in 2009 consisted of approximately $12.0 million in the Fossil Federal field in San Miguel County, Colorado resulting from lower well performance and $5.6 million in the Beaurline field in Hidalgo County, Texas resulting from lower well performance. General and Administrative expenses decreased by $5.8 million from 2008 to 2009. This is primarily due to decreased stock compensation expense largely related to a reduction in supplemental employee compensation expense of $14.7 million, partially offset by an increase in performance share award expense of $5.5 million and an increase in pension expense related to our qualified pension plan. Direct Operations expenses increased by $2.1 million from 2008 to 2009 primarily due to higher personnel and labor expenses, increased severance and employee relocation costs associated with the reorganization of operations and higher compressor and outside operated properties charges. Interest Expense, Net Interest expense, net increased by $22.6 million from 2008 to 2009 primarily due to increased interest expense related to the $492 million principal amount of debt we issued in our July and December 2008 private 50 Table of Contents placements. Weighted average borrowings under our credit facility based on daily balances were approximately $166 million during 2009 compared to approximately $172 million during 2008. The weighted average effective interest rate on the credit facility decreased to approximately 4.0% during 2009 compared to approximately 4.8% during 2008. Income Tax Expense Income tax expense decreased by $49.4 million due to a decrease in our pre tax income. The effective tax rates for 2009 and 2008 were 33.6% and 37.0%, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily due to an overall reduction in state deferred tax liabilities and tax benefits associated with foreign tax credits. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market Risk Our primary market risk is exposure to oil and natural gas prices. Realized prices are mainly driven by worldwide prices for oil and spot market prices for North American natural gas production. Commodity prices are volatile and unpredictable. The capital markets continue to be volatile with periods of easy access and times with unfavorable conditions. As a result of the volatility in the capital markets and our increased level of borrowings, we may at times experience increased costs associated with future borrowings and debt issuances based on recent financings. At this time, we do not believe our liquidity has been materially affected by market events. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activity Our hedging strategy is designed to reduce the risk of price volatility for our production in the natural gas and crude oil markets. A hedging committee that consists of members of senior management oversees our hedging activity. Our hedging arrangements apply to only a portion of our production and provide only partial price protection. These hedging arrangements limit the benefit to us of increases in prices, but offer protection in the event of price declines. Further, if our counterparties defaulted, this protection might be limited as we might not receive the benefits of the hedges. Please read the discussion below as well as Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a more detailed discussion of our hedging arrangements. Periodically, we enter into derivative commodity instruments to hedge our exposure to price fluctuations on natural gas and crude oil production. Our credit agreement restricts our ability to enter into commodity hedges other than to hedge or mitigate risks to which we have actual or projected exposure or as permitted under our risk management policies and not subjecting us to material speculative risks. As of December 31, 2010, we had 11 derivative contracts open: four natural gas price swap arrangements, six natural gas basis swaps arrangements and one crude oil price collar arrangement. During 2010, we entered into a total of six new derivative contracts including one crude oil swap contract for 2010, four natural gas swap contracts for 2011 and one crude oil collar contract for 2011. 51 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2010, we had the following outstanding commodity derivatives: Commodity and Derivative Type Weighted Average Contract Price Volume Contract Period Net UnrealizedGain / (Loss)(In thousands) Derivatives Designated as Hedging Instruments Natural Gas Swaps $6.24 per Mcf 12,909 Mmcf January December 2011 $ 18,669 Crude Oil Collars $93.25 Ceiling /$80.00 Floor per Bbl 365 Mbbl January December 2011 (1,743 ) $ 16,926 Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments Natural Gas Basis Swaps $(0.27) per Mcf 16,123 Mmcf January December 2012 (2,180 ) $ 14,746 The amounts set forth under the net unrealized gain / (loss) column in the tables above represent our total unrealized derivative position at December 31, 2010 and include the impact of nonperformance risk. Nonperformance risk was primarily evaluated by reviewing credit default swap spreads for the various financial institutions in which we have derivative transactions. From time to time, we enter into natural gas and crude oil swap agreements with counterparties to hedge price risk associated with a portion of our production. These cash flow hedges are not held for trading purposes. Under these price swaps, we receive a fixed price on a notional quantity of natural gas or crude oil in exchange for paying a variable price based on a market based index, such as the NYMEX gas and crude oil futures. During 2010, natural gas price swaps covered 35.9 Bcf, or 29%, of our 2010 gas production at an average price of $9.30 per Mcf. We had two crude oil price swaps covering 730 Mbbl, or 90%, of our 2010 oil production at an average price of $104.25 per Bbl. During 2010, we also entered into crude oil swaps to hedge our price exposure on our 2010 production, natural gas swaps to hedge our price exposure on our 2011 production and crude oil price collars to hedge our price exposure on our 2011 production. In addition, we also have natural gas basis swaps covering a portion of anticipated 2012 production, which do not qualify for hedge accounting. We are exposed to market risk on derivative instruments to the extent of changes in market prices of natural gas and crude oil. However, the market risk exposure on these derivative contracts is generally offset by the gain or loss recognized upon the ultimate sale of the commodity. Although notional contract amounts are used to express the volume of natural gas agreements, the amounts that can be subject to credit risk in the event of non performance by third parties are substantially smaller. We do not anticipate any material impact on our financial results due to non performance by third parties. Our primary derivative contract counterparties are Bank of Montreal, JPMorgan, Bank of America and BNP Paribas. The preceding paragraphs contain forward looking information concerning future production and projected gains and losses, which may be impacted both by production and by changes in the future market prices of energy commodities. See Forward Looking Information for further details. Fair Market Value of Financial Instruments The estimated fair value of financial instruments is the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged currently between willing parties. The carrying amounts reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheet for cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable approximate fair value due to the short term maturities of these instruments. 52 Table of Contents The fair value of long term debt is the estimated cost to acquire the debt, including a credit spread for the difference between the issue rate and the period end market rate. The credit spread is our default or repayment risk. The credit spread (premium or discount) is determined by comparing our fixed rate notes and credit facility to new issuances (secured and unsecured) and secondary trades of similar size and credit statistics for both public and private debt. The fair value of all of the fixed rate notes and the credit facility is based on interest rates currently available to the us. We use available marketing data and valuation methodologies to estimate the fair value of debt. The carrying amounts and fair values of long term debt are as follows: December 31, 2010 December 31, 2009 (In thousands) CarryingAmount EstimatedFair Value CarryingAmount EstimatedFair Value Long Term Debt $ 975,000 $ 1,100,830 $ 805,000 $ 863,559 53 Table of Contents
