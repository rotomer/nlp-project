ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our results of operations and our present financial condition. Our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Form 10 K contain additional information that should be referred to when reviewing this material. As a result of our production growth and the commencement of various transportation and gathering agreements in 2011, we began separately reporting our transportation and gathering costs as a component of operating expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Previously reported transportation and gathering costs were reflected as a component of Natural Gas Revenues and have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation. Accordingly, previously reported operating revenues and operating expenses have increased with no impact on previously reported net income. On January 3, 2012, the Board of Directors declared a 2 for 1 split of our common stock in the form of a stock dividend. The stock dividend was distributed on January 25, 2012 to shareholders of record as of January 17, 2012. All common stock accounts and per share data have been retroactively adjusted to give effect to the 2 for 1 split of our common stock. Statements in this discussion may be forward looking. These forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, including those discussed below, which could cause actual results to differ from those expressed. Please read "Forward Looking Information" for further details. OVERVIEW Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation is a leading independent oil and gas company engaged in the development, exploitation, exploration, production and marketing of natural gas, crude oil and, to a lesser extent, natural gas liquids from its properties in the continental United States. We also transport, store, gather and produce natural gas for resale. Our exploitation and exploration activities are concentrated in areas with known hydrocarbon resources, which are conducive to multi well, repeatable drilling programs. Our program is designed to be disciplined and balanced, with a focus on achieving strong financial returns. We evaluate three types of investment alternatives that compete for available capital: drilling opportunities, financial opportunities such as debt repayment or repurchase of common stock, and acquisition opportunities. Depending on circumstances, we allocate capital among the alternatives based on a rate of return approach. Our goal is to invest capital in the highest return opportunities available at any given time that meet our strategic objectives. At any one time, one or more of these may not be economically feasible. Our financial results depend upon many factors, particularly the price of natural gas and crude oil and our ability to market our production on economically attractive terms. Price volatility in the commodity markets has remained prevalent in the last few years. Our realized natural gas and crude oil price was $4.46 per Mcf and $90.49 per Bbl, respectively, in 2011. In an effort to manage commodity price risk, we opportunistically enter into natural gas and crude oil price swaps and collars. These financial instruments are a component of our risk management strategy. Commodity prices are impacted by many factors that are outside of our control. Historically, commodity prices have been volatile and we expect them to remain volatile. Commodity prices are affected by changes in market supply and demand, which are impacted by overall economic activity, weather, pipeline capacity constraints, inventory storage levels, basis differentials and other factors. As a result, we cannot accurately predict future natural gas, NGL and crude oil prices and, therefore, we cannot determine with any degree of certainty what effect increases or decreases will have on our capital program, production volumes and future revenues. In addition to production volumes and 34 Table of Contents commodity prices, finding and developing sufficient amounts of crude oil and natural gas reserves at economical costs are critical to our long term success. See "Risk Factors Natural gas and oil prices fluctuate widely, and low prices for an extended period of time are likely to have a material adverse impact on our business" and "Risk Factors Our future performance depends on our ability to find or acquire additional natural gas and oil reserves that are economically recoverable" in Item 1A. The table below illustrates how natural gas prices have fluctuated by month over 2010 and 2011. "Index" represents the first of the month Henry Hub index price per Mmbtu. The "2010" and "2011" price is the natural gas price per Mcf realized by us and includes the realized impact of our natural gas derivative instruments, as applicable: Natural Gas Prices by Month 2011 Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Index $ 4.22 $ 4.32 $ 3.79 $ 4.24 $ 4.38 $ 4.33 $ 4.36 $ 4.38 $ 3.85 $ 3.76 $ 3.51 $ 3.36 2011 $ 4.64 $ 4.97 $ 4.46 $ 4.76 $ 4.72 $ 4.55 $ 4.71 $ 4.70 $ 4.33 $ 4.14 $ 3.89 $ 4.03 Natural Gas Prices by Month 2010 Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Index $ 5.82 $ 5.28 $ 4.81 $ 3.84 $ 4.27 $ 4.16 $ 4.73 $ 4.78 $ 3.64 $ 3.84 $ 3.29 $ 4.27 2010 $ 7.10 $ 6.61 $ 6.43 $ 5.52 $ 5.66 $ 5.76 $ 5.81 $ 5.76 $ 5.00 $ 5.13 $ 4.80 $ 5.57 The table below illustrates how crude oil prices have fluctuated by month over 2010 and 2011. "Index" represents the NYMEX monthly average crude oil price.

Crude oil revenues increased from 2010 to 2011 primarily due to increased crude oil production partially offset by decreased realized prices. Prices, including the realized impact of derivative instruments, decreased by 22% for natural gas and 8% for crude oil. We drilled 161 gross wells with a success rate of over 99% in 2011 compared to 113 gross wells with a success rate of 98% in 2010. Total capital and exploration expenditures increased by $14.0 million to $905.5 million in 2011 compared to $891.5 million in 2010. The increase in spending was substantially driven by an expanded Marcellus shale horizontal drilling program and increases in our drilling programs in the Eagle Ford oil shale in south Texas and the Marmaton oil play in Oklahoma. We believe our cash on hand and operating cash flow in 2012 will be sufficient to fund our budgeted capital and exploration spending between $750 and $790 million. Any additional needs are expected to be funded by borrowings from our credit facility. Our 2012 strategy will remain consistent with 2011. While we consider acquisitions from time to time, we remain focused on pursuing drilling opportunities that provide more predictable results on our 35 Table of Contents accumulated acreage position. Additionally, we intend to maintain spending discipline and manage our balance sheet in an effort to ensure sufficient liquidity, including cash resources and available credit. For 2012, we have allocated our planned program for capital and exploration expenditures primarily to the Marcellus shale in northeast Pennsylvania, the Eagle Ford oil shale in south Texas and, to a lesser extent, the Marmaton oil play in Oklahoma. We believe these strategies are appropriate for our portfolio of projects and the current commodity pricing environment and will continue to add shareholder value over the long term. The preceding paragraphs, discussing our strategic pursuits and goals, contain forward looking information. Please read "Forward Looking Information" for further details. FINANCIAL CONDITION Capital Resources and Liquidity Our primary sources of cash in 2011 were from funds generated from the sale of natural gas and crude oil production (including hedge realizations), borrowings under our credit facility and the sales of properties and other assets during the year. These cash flows were primarily used to fund our capital and exploration expenditures, in addition to repayments of debt and related interest, contributions to our pension plans and dividends. See below for additional discussion and analysis of cash flow. We generate cash from the sale of natural gas and crude oil. Operating cash flow fluctuations are substantially driven by commodity prices and changes in our production volumes. Prices for crude oil and natural gas have historically been volatile, including seasonal influences characterized by peak demand and higher prices in the winter heating season; however, the impact of other risks and uncertainties have also influenced prices throughout the recent years. In addition, fluctuations in cash flow may result in an increase or decrease in our capital and exploration expenditures. See "Results of Operations" for a review of the impact of prices and volumes on revenues. Our working capital is also substantially influenced by variables discussed above. From time to time, our working capital will reflect a surplus, while at other times it will reflect a deficit. This fluctuation is not unusual. We believe we have adequate availability under our credit facility and liquidity available to meet our working capital requirements. Year Ended December 31, (In thousands) 2011 2010 2009 Cash Flows Provided by Operating Activities $ 501,839 $ 484,911 $ 614,052 Cash Flows Used in Investing Activities (487,620 ) (613,741 ) (531,027 ) Cash Flows Provided by / (Used in) Financing Activities (40,257 ) 144,621 (70,968 ) Net Increase / (Decrease) in Cash and Cash Equivalents $ (26,038 ) $ 15,791 $ 12,057 Operating Activities Key components impacting net operating cash flows are commodity prices, production volumes and operating expenses. Net cash provided by operating activities in 2011 increased by $16.9 million over 2010. This increase was primarily due to increased operating income in 2011 as a result of higher operating revenues that outpaced the increase in operating expenses. This increase was offset by changes in working capital which decreased operating cash flows. The increase in operating revenues was primarily due to an increase in equivalent production partially offset by lower realized natural gas and crude oil prices. Equivalent production volumes increased by 44% for 2011 compared to 2010 as a result of higher natural gas and crude oil production. Average realized natural gas prices decreased by 36 Table of Contents 22% for 2011 compared to 2010. Average realized crude oil prices decreased by 8% compared to the same period. Net cash provided by operating activities in 2010 decreased by $129.1 million over 2009. This decrease was mainly due to a decrease in oil and gas revenues and higher operating and interest expense. Average realized natural gas prices decreased by 25% in 2010 compared to 2009 and average realized crude oil prices increased by 14% over the same period. Equivalent production volumes increased by 27% in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to higher natural gas and crude oil production. See "Results of Operations" for additional information relative to commodity price, production and operating expense movements. We are unable to predict future commodity prices and, as a result, cannot provide any assurance about future levels of net cash provided by operating activities. Realized prices may decline in future periods. Investing Activities The primary use of cash in investing activities was capital and exploration expenditures. We established the budget for these amounts based on our current estimate of future commodity prices and cash flows. Due to the volatility of commodity prices and new opportunities which may arise, our capital expenditures may be periodically adjusted during any given year. Cash flows used in investing activities decreased by $126.1 million from 2010 to 2011 and increased by $82.7 million from 2009 to 2010. The decrease from 2010 to 2011 was due to an increase of $160.1 million of proceeds from the sale of assets partially offset by an increase of $34.0 million in capital and exploration expenditures. The increase from 2009 to 2010 was due to an increase of $246.0 million in capital and exploration expenditures partially offset by an increase of $163.3 million of proceeds from the sale of assets. Financing Activities Cash flows used in financing activities increased by $184.9 million from 2010 to 2011. This was primarily due to a decrease in borrowings of $195.0 million, partially offset by a decrease in cash paid for capitalized debt issuance costs of $12.8 million. At December 31, 2011, we had $188.0 million of borrowings outstanding under our unsecured credit facility at a weighted average interest rate of 4.9% and $711.0 million available for future borrowing. Cash flows provided by financing activities increased by $215.6 million from 2009 to 2010. This was primarily due to an increase in borrowings of $420.0 million, partially offset by an increase in repayments of debt of $188.0 million, an increase in cash paid for capitalized debt issuance costs by a total of $3.4 million and a decrease of $13.7 million in the tax benefit associated with stock based compensation. In December 2010, we completed a private placement of $175.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured fixed rate notes with a weighted average interest rate of 5.58%, consisting of amounts due in January 2021, 2023 and 2026. In September 2010, we amended and restated our revolving credit facility (credit facility) to increase the available credit line to $900 million with an accordion feature allowing us to increase the available credit line to $1.0 billion, if any one or more of the existing banks or new banks agree to provide such increased commitment amount, and to extend the term to September 2015. The available credit line is subject to adjustment on the basis of the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves (as determined by the banks based on our reserve reports and engineering reports) and certain other assets and the outstanding principal balance of our senior notes. 37 Table of Contents The amended facility provided for an initial $1.5 billion borrowing base. Effective April 1, 2011, the lenders under our revolving credit facility approved an increase in our borrowing base from $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion as part of the annual redetermination under the terms of the credit facility. Our plan to sell certain oil and gas properties located in Colorado, Utah and Wyoming triggered an interim redetermination of our borrowing base and the $1.7 billion borrowing base was reaffirmed by the lenders effective September 27, 2011. In June 2010, we amended the agreements governing our senior notes to amend the required asset coverage ratio (the present value of our proved reserves plus working capital to debt) contained in the agreements. The amendment also changed the ratio for maximum calculated indebtedness to borrowing base (as defined in the credit facility agreement). We strive to manage our debt at a level below the available credit line in order to maintain borrowing capacity. Our credit facility includes a covenant limiting our total debt. Management believes that, with internally generated cash, existing cash on hand and availability under our credit facility, we have the capacity to finance our spending plans and maintain our strong financial position. Capitalization Information about our capitalization is as follows: December 31, (Dollars in thousands) 2011 2010 Debt(1) $ 950,000 $ 975,000 Stockholders Equity $ 2,104,768 $ 1,872,700 Total Capitalization $ 3,054,768 $ 2,847,700 Debt to Capitalization 31 % 34 % Cash and Cash Equivalents $ 29,911 $ 55,949 (1)Includes $188.0 million and $213.0 million of borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2011, we paid dividends of $12.5 million ($0.06 per share) on our common stock. A regular dividend has been declared for each quarter since we became a public company in 1990. Capital and Exploration Expenditures On an annual basis, we generally fund most of our capital and exploration activities, excluding any significant oil and gas property acquisitions, with cash generated from operations and, when necessary, borrowings under our credit facility. We budget these capital expenditures based on our projected cash flows for the year. 38  Table of Contents The following table presents major components of our capital and exploration expenditures: Year Ended December 31, (In thousands) 2011 2010 2009 Capital Expenditures Drilling and Facilities $ 780,673 $ 654,153 $ 401,143 Leasehold Acquisitions 71,134 130,675 145,681 Acquisitions 801 394 Pipeline and Gathering 7,378 54,811 32,861 Other 9,840 8,368 9,506 869,025 848,808 589,585 Exploration Expense 36,447 42,725 50,784 Total $ 905,472 $ 891,533 $ 640,369 We plan to drill approximately 120 to 130 gross wells in 2012 compared with 161 gross wells drilled in 2011. This 2012 drilling program includes between $750 and $790 million in total capital and exploration expenditures, down from $905.5 million in 2011. This decrease is primarily due to decreased drilling activity as a result of lower commodity prices. We will continue to assess the natural gas and crude oil price environment and our liquidity position and may increase or decrease our capital and exploration expenditures accordingly. Contractual Obligations Our material contractual obligations include long term debt, interest on long term debt, gas transportation agreements, drilling rig commitments, hydraulic fracturing services commitments and operating leases. We have no off balance sheet debt or other similar unrecorded obligations. A summary of our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2011 are set forth in the following table: Payments Due by Year (In thousands) Total 2012 2013 to 2014 2015 to 2016 2017 & Beyond Long Term Debt $ 950,000 $ $ 75,000 $ 208,000 $ 667,000 Interest on Long Term Debt(1) 392,802 60,163 109,285 89,464 133,890 Gas Transportation Agreements(2) 1,853,329 84,285 237,327 244,726 1,286,991 Drilling Rig Commitments(2) 45,881 19,766 26,115 Hydraulic Fracturing Services Commitments(2) 82,207 82,207 Operating Leases(2) 18,635 5,656 9,902 3,077 Total Contractual Obligations $ 3,342,854 $ 252,077 $ 457,629 $ 545,267 $ 2,087,881 (1)Interest payments have been calculated utilizing the fixed rates of our $762.0 million long term debt outstanding at December 31, 2011. Interest payments on our revolving credit facility were calculated by assuming that the December 31, 2011 outstanding balance of $188.0 million will be outstanding through the September 2015 maturity date. A constant interest rate of 4.9% was assumed, which was the December 31, 2011 weighted average interest rate. Actual results will differ from these estimates and assumptions. (2)For further information on our obligations under gas transportation agreements, drilling rig commitments, hydraulic fracturing services commitments and operating leases, see Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 39 Table of Contents Amounts related to our asset retirement obligations are not included in the above table given the uncertainty regarding the actual timing of such expenditures. The total amount of asset retirement obligations at December 31, 2011 was $60.1 million, down from $72.3 million at December 31, 2010. This decrease is primarily due to $12.1 million of liabilities divested, $3.6 million in downward revisions of previous estimates and $1.2 million in liabilities settled, partially offset by $3.3 million in accretion expense during 2011 and $1.5 million of liabilities incurred. See Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details. Potential Impact of Our Critical Accounting Policies Readers of this document and users of the information contained in it should be aware of how certain events may impact our financial results based on the accounting policies in place. Our most significant policies are discussed below. Successful Efforts Method of Accounting We follow the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas producing activities. Acquisition costs for proved and unproved properties are capitalized when incurred. Exploration costs, including geological and geophysical costs, the costs of carrying and retaining unproved properties and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed. Development costs, including costs to drill and equip development wells and successful exploratory drilling costs to locate proved reserves are capitalized. Oil and Gas Reserves The process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is inherently imprecise, and the reserve data included in this document are only estimates. The process relies on interpretations of available geologic, geophysical, engineering and production data. The extent, quality and reliability of this technical data can vary. The process also requires certain economic assumptions, some of which are mandated by the SEC, such as oil and gas prices. Additional assumptions include drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes and availability of funds. Any significant variance in the interpretations or assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of our reserves. Our reserves have been prepared by our petroleum engineering staff and audited by Miller & Lents, Ltd., independent petroleum engineers, who in their opinion determined the estimates presented to be reasonable in the aggregate. For more information regarding reserve estimation, including historical reserve revisions, refer to the Supplemental Oil and Gas Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Our rate of recording DD&A expense is dependent upon our estimate of proved and proved developed reserves, which are utilized in our unit of production method calculation. If the estimates of proved reserves were to be reduced, the rate at which we record DD&A expense would increase, reducing net income. Such a reduction in reserves may result from lower market prices, which may make it uneconomic to drill for and produce higher cost fields. A five percent positive or negative revision to proved reserves throughout the Company would decrease or increase the DD&A rate by approximately ($0.05) to $0.06 per Mcfe. Revisions in significant fields may individually affect our DD&A rate. It is estimated that a positive or negative reserve revision of 10% in one of our most productive fields would have a ($0.05) to $0.06 per Mcfe impact on our total DD&A rate. These estimated impacts are based on current data, and actual events could require different adjustments to our DD&A rate. In addition, a decline in proved reserve estimates may impact the outcome of our impairment test under Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 360, "Property, Plant, and Equipment." Due to the inherent imprecision of the reserve estimation process, risks associated with the operations of proved 40 Table of Contents producing properties and market sensitive commodity prices utilized in our impairment analysis, management cannot determine if an impairment is reasonably likely to occur in the future. Carrying Value of Oil and Gas Properties We evaluate our oil and gas properties for impairment on a field by field basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an assets carrying amount may not be recoverable. We compare expected undiscounted future cash flows to the net book value of the asset. If the future undiscounted expected cash flows, based on our estimate of future crude oil and natural gas prices, operating costs and anticipated production from proved reserves are lower than the net book value of the asset, the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value. Commodity pricing is estimated by using a combination of assumptions management uses in its budgeting and forecasting process as well as historical and current prices adjusted for geographical location and quality differentials, as well as other factors that management believes will impact realizable prices. In the event that commodity prices remain low or continue to decline, there could be a significant revision in the future. Fair value is calculated by discounting the future cash flows. The discount factor used is based on rates utilized by market participants that are commensurate with the risks inherent in the development and production of the underlying natural gas and crude oil. Costs attributable to our unproved properties are not subject to the impairment analysis described above; however, a portion of the costs associated with such properties is subject to amortization based on past drilling and exploration experience and average property lives. Average property lives are determined on a geographical basis and based on the estimated life of unproved property leasehold rights. Historically, the average property life in each of the geographical areas has not significantly changed and generally range from three to five years. The commodity price environment may impact the capital available for exploration projects as well as development drilling. We have considered these impacts when determining the amortization rate of our undeveloped acreage, especially in exploratory areas. If the average unproved property life decreases or increases by one year, the amortization would increase by approximately $23.8 million or decrease by approximately $15.6 million, respectively, per year. As these properties are developed and reserves are proven, the remaining capitalized costs are subject to depreciation and depletion. If the development of these properties is deemed unsuccessful, the capitalized costs related to the unsuccessful activity is expensed in the year the determination is made. The rate at which the unproved properties are written off depends on the timing and success of our future exploration and development program. Natural gas prices have decreased from an average price of $4.39 per Mmbtu in 2010 to an average price of $4.04 per Mmbtu in 2011. Natural gas prices were $3.36 per Mmbtu in December 2011 and have continued to decline to $2.68 per Mmbtu in February 2012. Natural gas prices represent the first of the month Henry Hub index price per Mmbtu. Oil prices have increased from an average price of $77.32 per barrel in 2010 to an average price of $94.01 per barrel in 2011. Any further decline in natural gas prices or quantities could result in an impairment of proved oil and gas properties. Asset Retirement Obligation The majority of our asset retirement obligation (ARO) relates to the plugging and abandonment of oil and gas wells and to a lesser extent meter stations, pipelines, processing plants and compressors. We record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred, with the associated asset retirement cost capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related long lived asset. The recognition of an asset retirement obligation requires management to make assumptions that include estimated plugging and abandonment costs, timing of settlements, inflation rates and discount rate. In periods subsequent to initial measurement, the asset retirement 41 Table of Contents cost is allocated to expense using a systematic and rational method over the assets useful life, while increases in the discounted ARO liability resulting from the passage of time (accretion expense) are reflected as depreciation, depletion and amortization expense. Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities We follow the accounting prescribed in ASC 815. Under ASC 815, the fair value of each derivative instrument is recorded as either an asset or liability on the balance sheet. At the end of each quarterly period, these instruments are marked to market. The gain or loss on the change in fair value is recorded as Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, a component of equity, to the extent that the derivative instrument is designated as a hedge and is effective. The ineffective portion, if any, of the change in the fair value of derivatives designated as hedges and the change in fair value of derivatives not qualifying as hedges are recorded currently in earnings as a component of Natural Gas and Crude Oil and Condensate revenue in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. The fair value of our derivative instruments are measured based on quotes from the Companys counterparties. Such quotes have been derived using valuation models that consider various inputs including current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments, quoted forward prices for natural gas and crude oil, volatility factors and interest rates, such as a LIBOR curve for a similar length of time as the derivative contract term as applicable. These estimates are verified using relevant NYMEX futures contracts or are compared to multiple quotes obtained from counterparties for reasonableness. The Company measured the nonperformance risk of its counterparties by reviewing credit default swap spreads for the various financial institutions in which it has derivative transactions. In times where we have net derivative contract liabilities, our nonperformance risk is evaluated using a market credit spread provided by our bank. Employee Benefit Plans Our costs of long term employee benefits, particularly pension and postretirement benefits, are incurred over long periods of time, and involve many uncertainties over those periods. The net periodic benefit cost attributable to current periods is based on several assumptions about such future uncertainties, and is sensitive to changes in those assumptions. It is managements responsibility, often with the assistance of independent experts, to select assumptions that in its judgment represent best estimates of those uncertainties. It also is managements responsibility to review those assumptions periodically to reflect changes in economic or other factors that affect those assumptions. Significant assumptions used to determine our projected pension obligation and related costs include discount rates, expected return on plan assets, and rate of compensation increases, while the assumptions used to determine our postretirement benefit obligation and related costs include discount rates and health care cost trends. See Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a full discussion of our employee benefit plans. Stock Based Compensation We account for stock based compensation under a fair value based method of accounting prescribed under ASC 718. Under the fair value method, compensation cost is measured at the grant date and remeasured each reporting period for liability classified awards based on the fair value of an award and is recognized over the service period, which is usually the vesting period. To calculate the fair value, either a binomial or Black Scholes valuation model may be used. The use of these models requires significant judgment with respect to expected life, volatility and other factors. Stock based compensation cost for all types of awards is included in General and Administrative expense in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. See Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a full discussion of our stock based compensation. 42 Table of Contents Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In May 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2011 04, "Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs." The amendments in this update generally represent clarifications of Topic 820, but also include some instances where a particular principle or requirement for measuring fair value or disclosing information about fair value measurements has changed. This update results in common principles and requirements for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements in accordance with U.S. GAAP and IFRS. The amendments in this update are to be applied prospectively. The amendments are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011. Early application is not permitted. We do not expect this guidance to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011 05, "Presentation of Comprehensive Income." This update was amended in December 2011 by ASU No. 2011 12, "Deferral of the Effective Date for Amendments to the Presentation of Reclassifications of Items Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in Accounting Standards Update No. 2011 05." This update defers only those changes in update 2011 05 that relate to the presentation of reclassification adjustments. All other requirements in update 2011 05 are not affected by this update, including the requirement to report comprehensive income either in a single continuous financial statement or in two separate but consecutive financial statements. ASU No. 2011 05 and 2011 12 are effective for fiscal years (including interim periods) beginning after December 15, 2011. We do not expect this guidance to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In December 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011 11, "Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities." The amendments in this update require enhanced disclosures around financial instruments and derivative instruments that are either (1) offset in accordance with either ASC 210 20 45 or ASC 815 10 45 or (2) subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement, irrespective of whether they are offset in accordance with either ASC 210 20 45 or ASC 815 10 45. An entity should provide the disclosures required by those amendments retrospectively for all comparative periods presented. The amendments are effective during interim and annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013. We do not expect this guidance to have any impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. OTHER ISSUES AND CONTINGENCIES Regulations. Our operations are subject to various types of regulation by federal, state and local authorities. See "Regulation of Oil and Natural Gas Exploration and Production," "Natural Gas Marketing, Gathering and Transportation," "Federal Regulation of Petroleum" and "Environmental Regulations" in the "Other Business Matters" section of Item 1 for a discussion of these regulations. Restrictive Covenants. Our ability to incur debt and to make certain types of investments is subject to certain restrictive covenants in our various debt instruments. Among other requirements, our revolving credit agreement and our senior notes specify a minimum annual coverage ratio of operating cash flow to interest expense for the trailing four quarters of 2.8 to 1.0 and an asset coverage ratio of the present value of proved reserves plus working capital to debt of 1.75 to 1.0. Our revolving credit agreement also requires us to maintain a current ratio of 1.0 to 1.0. At December 31, 2011, we were in compliance in all material respects with all restrictive covenants on both the revolving credit agreement and senior notes. In the unforeseen event that we fail to comply with these covenants, we may apply for a temporary waiver with the lender, which, if granted, would allow us a period of time to remedy the situation. 43 Table of Contents Operating Risks and Insurance Coverage. Our business involves a variety of operating risks. See "Risk Factors We face a variety of hazards and risks that could cause substantial financial losses" in Item 1A. In accordance with customary industry practice, we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these risks and losses. The occurrence of any of these events not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations. The costs of these insurance policies are somewhat dependent on our historical claims experience and also the areas in which we operate. Commodity Pricing and Risk Management Activities. Our revenues, operating results, financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital depend substantially on prevailing prices for natural gas and oil. Declines in oil and gas prices may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity, ability to obtain financing and operating results. Lower oil and gas prices also may reduce the amount of oil and gas that we can produce economically. Historically, oil and gas prices and markets have been volatile, with prices fluctuating widely, and they are likely to continue to be volatile. Depressed prices in the future would have a negative impact on our future financial results. In particular, substantially lower prices would significantly reduce revenue and could potentially trigger an impairment under ASC 360, "Property, Plant, and Equipment." Because our reserves are predominantly natural gas, changes in natural gas prices may have a more significant impact on our financial results. The majority of our production is sold at market responsive prices. Generally, if the related commodity index falls, the price that we receive for our production will also decline. Therefore, the amount of revenue that we realize is partially determined by factors beyond our control. However, management may mitigate this price risk on all or a portion of our anticipated production with the use of derivative financial instruments. Most recently, we have used financial instruments such as collar and swap arrangements to reduce the impact of declining prices on our revenue. Under both arrangements, there is also a risk that the movement of index prices may result in our inability to realize the full benefit of an improvement in market conditions. Forward Looking Information The statements regarding future financial and operating performance and results, market prices, future hedging activities, and other statements that are not historical facts contained in this report are forward looking statements. The words "expect," "project," "estimate," "believe," "anticipate," "intend," "budget," "plan," "forecast," "predict," "may," "should," "could," "will" and similar expressions are also intended to identify forward looking statements. Such statements involve risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, market factors, market prices (including geographic basis differentials) of natural gas and oil, results for future drilling and marketing activity, future production and costs, electronic, cyber or physical security breaches and other factors detailed herein and in our other Securities and Exchange Commission filings. See "Risk Factors" in Item 1A for additional information about these risks and uncertainties. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual outcomes may vary materially from those indicated. 44 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 2011 and 2010 Compared We reported net income for 2011 of $122.4 million, or $0.59 per share. During 2010, we reported net income of $103.4 million, or $0.50 per share. Net income increased in 2011 by $19.0 million, primarily due to increased operating revenues, partially offset by increased operating expenses, decreased gain on sale of assets and increased income tax and interest expenses. Operating revenues increased by $116.8 million largely due to increased natural gas and crude oil and condensate revenues, partially offset by a decrease in brokered natural gas revenues. Operating expenses increased by $33.4 million between periods primarily due to increases in transportation and gathering expenses, general and administrative expenses, depreciation, depletion and amortization and direct operations, partially offset by a decrease in impairment of oil and gas properties and lower brokered natural gas cost, taxes other than income and exploration expense. Revenue, Price and Volume Variances Below is a discussion of revenue, price and volume variances.

(2)These prices include the realized impact of derivative instrument settlements, which increased the price by $1.01 per Bbl in 2011 and by $22.31 per Bbl in 2010. 45  Table of Contents Natural Gas Revenues The increase in Natural Gas revenues of $83.6 million, excluding the impact of the unrealized losses discussed above, is primarily due to increased production, partially offset by lower realized natural gas prices. The increased production is primarily due to increased production associated with our Marcellus Shale drilling program in northeast Pennsylvania, partially offset by decreases in production primarily in east and south Texas due to normal production declines, the sale of oil and gas properties in Colorado, Utah and Wyoming and a shift from gas to oil projects. Crude Oil and Condensate Revenues The increase in Crude Oil and Condensate revenues of $46.9 million is primarily due to increased production, partially offset by lower realized oil prices. The increase in production is primarily due to our drilling program in the Eagle Ford oil shale in south Texas, partially offset by lower production in east Texas due to decreased activity. Brokered Natural Gas Revenue and Cost Year Ended December 31, Variance Price and Volume Variances (In thousands) 2011 2010 Amount Percent Brokered Natural Gas Sales Sales Price ($/Mcf) $ 4.97 $ 5.41 $ (0.44 ) (8 )% $ (4,533 ) Volume Brokered (Mmcf) x 10,303 x 12,072 (1,769 ) (15 )% (9,558 ) Brokered Natural Gas Revenues (In thousands) $ 51,190 $ 65,281 $ (14,091 ) Brokered Natural Gas Purchases Purchase Price ($/Mcf) $ 4.25 $ 4.68 $ (0.43 ) (9 )% $ 4,353 Volume Brokered (Mmcf) x 10,303 x 12,072 (1,769 ) (15 )% 8,279 Brokered Natural Gas Cost (In thousands) $ 43,834 $ 56,466 $ 12,632 Brokered Natural Gas Margin (In thousands) $ 7,356 $ 8,815 $ (1,459 ) The decreased brokered natural gas margin of $1.5 million is primarily a result of a decrease in brokered volumes coupled with a decrease in the sales price that slightly outpaced the decrease in purchase price.

The primary reasons for this fluctuation are as follows: Brokered Natural Gas Cost decreased by $12.6 million from 2010 to 2011. See the preceding table titled "Brokered Natural Gas Revenue and Cost" for further analysis. Direct Operations increased $7.8 million largely due to increased operating costs primarily driven by increased production. Contributing to the increase are higher workover and environmental and regulatory costs associated with the remediation of certain wells in northeast Pennsylvania as a result of the PaDEP consent order and settlement agreement. Offsetting these increases were lower lease maintenance, subsurface lease maintenance and plugging and abandonment costs in 2011 compared to 2010 coupled with lower compression expenses primarily due to the sale of our gathering system in northeast Pennsylvania in the fourth quarter of 2010. Transportation and Gathering increased by $54.3 million primarily due to the commencement of various firm transportation and gathering arrangements in 2011, primarily in northeast Pennsylvania. Taxes Other Than Income decreased $10.3 million due to decreased production taxes as a result of tax refunds and credits received in 2011 on qualifying wells, lower ad valorem tax expense due to lower natural gas prices and property values and lower franchise tax expense. Exploration decreased $6.3 million due to lower geophysical and geological costs primarily due to a reduction in the acquisition of seismic data, partially offset by higher dry hole costs in 2011 related to an exploratory dry hole in Montana. Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization increased by $16.1 million, of which $29.8 million was due to increased depreciation and depletion from increased capital spending and higher equivalent production volumes offset by a lower DD&A rate of $1.64 per Mcfe for 2011 compared to $2.12 per Mcfe for 2010 and a $1.4 million increase in accretion of asset retirement obligations. The increase in depletion and depreciation was partially offset by a decrease in amortization of unproved properties of $15.1 million primarily due to a decrease in amortization rates due to a shift in our drilling and development activities. 47 Table of Contents Impairment of Oil and Gas Properties decreased by $40.9 million from 2011 to 2010 due to the impairment of two south Texas fields recognized as a result of continued price declines and limited activity and the impairment of drilling and service equipment in 2010. There were no impairments in 2011. General and Administrative increased by $25.5 million primarily due to an increase in stock based compensation expense of $25.1 million primarily associated with the mark to market of the liability portion of our performance shares as a result of our higher average stock price for the month of December 2011 compared to the average stock price for the month of December 2010. Higher incentive compensation and fringe benefits also contributed to the increase. These increases are partially offset by lower legal and professional costs associated with the PaDEP consent order and settlement agreement executed in 2010. Gain / (Loss) on Sale of Assets During 2011, we recognized a gain of $34.2 million from the sale of oil and gas properties in east Texas and an aggregate gain of $29.2 million related to the sale of various other assets as part of our ongoing asset portfolio management program. During 2010, we recognized a gain of $49.3 million from the sale of our Pennsylvania gathering infrastructure, $40.7 million from the sale of our investment in Tourmaline and an aggregate gain of $16.3 million related to the sale of various other oil and gas properties and other assets during the year. Interest Expense, Net Interest Expense and Other increased by $3.7 million in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to an increase in the weighted average effective interest rate on the credit facility, which increased to approximately 4.1% during the 2011 compared to approximately 3.8% during 2010, partially offset by a decrease in weighted average borrowings under our credit facility based on average daily balances of $317.7 million during 2011 compared to average daily balances of $340.4 million during 2010. In addition, in December 2010, we issued $175 million aggregate principal amount of 5.58% weighted average fixed rate notes, which increased interest expense recognized in 2011. Income Tax Expense Income Tax Expense increased by $17.7 million in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to increased pretax income and a slightly higher effective tax rate. The effective tax rates for 2011 and 2010 were 48.0% and 47.9%, respectively. The effective tax rate was slightly higher primarily due to an increase in our state rates used in establishing deferred income taxes mainly due to a continued shift in our state apportionment factors to higher rate states, primarily Pennsylvania, as a result of our continued focus on development of our Marcellus shale properties. 2010 and 2009 Compared We reported net income for 2010 of $103.4 million, or $0.50 per share. During 2009, we reported net income of $148.3 million, or $0.72 per share. Net income decreased in 2010 by $45.0 million, primarily due to increased operating expenses, income tax and interest expenses and decreased operating revenues partially offset by increased gain on sale of assets. Operating revenues decreased by $30.0 million largely due to decreases in natural gas and brokered natural gas revenues, partially offset by an increase in crude oil and condensate revenues. Operating expenses increased by $95.4 million between periods due primarily to increases in depreciation, depletion and amortization, impairment of oil and gas properties and other assets, general and administrative expense, transportation and 48 Table of Contents gathering and direct operations. These increases were partially offset by decreases in brokered natural gas cost, taxes other than income and exploration expense.

(2)These prices include the realized impact of derivative instrument settlements, which increased the price by $22.31 per Bbl in 2010 and by $28.85 per Bbl in 2009. Natural Gas Revenues The decrease in Natural Gas revenue of $31.6 million, excluding the impact of the unrealized losses discussed above, is due primarily to the decrease in realized natural gas prices, decreased production in east and south Texas associated with normal production declines, delays in completions and a shift from gas to oil projects, as well as the sale of our Canadian properties in April 2009. Partially offsetting these decreases was an increase in natural gas production in the northeast Pennsylvania associated with increased drilling and the start up of a portion of the Lathrop compressor station in the Marcellus shale at the end of the second quarter of 2010. Crude Oil and Condensate Revenues The $9.2 million increase in crude oil and condensate revenues is primarily due to an increase in realized crude oil prices and an increase in crude oil production in the Eagle Ford shale in south Texas and the Pettet formation production in east Texas. These increases are partially offset by lower 49 Table of Contents production in West Virginia and northeast Pennsylvania as well as the sale of our Canadian properties in April 2009.

The primary reasons for this fluctuation are as follows: Brokered Natural Gas Cost decreased by $10.6 million from 2009 to 2010. See the preceding table titled "Brokered Natural Gas Revenue and Cost" for further analysis. Direct Operations expenses increased by $5.7 million primarily due to lease maintenance expense and plug and abandonment costs in northeast Pennsylvania related to plugging and abandoning three vertical wells in accordance with the PaDEPs Second Modified Consent Order. Transportation and Gathering costs increased by $5.3 million primarily due to the commencement of various firm transportation and gathering arrangements in 2010 primarily in northeast Pennsylvania. Taxes Other Than Income decreased by $6.8 million primarily due to decreased production and ad valorem taxes due to lower natural gas prices and property values partially offset by increased business and occupational taxes and franchise taxes. Exploration expense decreased by $8.1 million primarily due to lower dry hole costs as a result of drilling one dry hole in 2010 compared to two dry holes in 2009. The decrease was partially offset by higher geophysical and geological expenses associated with seismic purchases related to our Marcellus, Eagle Ford and Haynesville shale properties during 2010. Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization increased by $75.8 million primarily due to increased depreciation and depletion from increased capital spending and higher equivalent production volumes, partially offset by a lower DD&A rate of $2.12 per Mcfe for 2010 compared to $2.14 per Mcfe in 2009. Amortization of unproved properties increased $17.6 million primarily due to increased unproved leasehold costs in northeast Pennsylvania and the Eagle Ford oil shale in south Texas in late 2009 and continuing into 2010. Impairment of Oil and Gas Properties and Other Assets increased by $23.3 million from 2009 to 2010. Impairments in 2010 consisted of a $35.8 million impairment of two south Texas fields due to continued price declines and limited activity and a $5.1 million impairment related to drilling and service equipment. Impairments in 2009 consisted of a $17.6 million impairment of two fields in Colorado and south Texas due to lower well performance. 51 Table of Contents General and Administrative expenses increased by $10.8 million primarily due to a $9.9 million increase in legal expenses primarily related to the December 2010 PaDEP consent order and settlement agreement, ongoing litigation and related legal fees, a $8.3 million increase in pension expense primarily due to termination and amendment of our pension plans and a $2.4 million increase in incentive compensation. These increases were partially offset by an $8.5 million decrease in stock compensation expense primarily due to prior year awards that fully vested in February 2010 and a reduction in average stock price for the month of December 2010 compared to the average stock price for the month of December 2009. Gain / (Loss) on Sale of Assets During 2010, we recognized a gain of $49.3 million from the sale of our Pennsylvania gathering infrastructure, $40.7 million from the sale of our investment in Tourmaline and an aggregate gain of $16.3 million related to the sale of various other oil and gas properties and other assets during the year. During 2009, we recognized a $16.0 million loss on sale of assets primarily due to the sale of our Canadian properties, partially offset by a $12.7 million gain on sale of assets related to the sale of oil and gas properties in West Virginia. Interest Expense, Net Interest expense, net increased by $9.0 million from 2009 to 2010 primarily due to an increase in weighted average borrowings under our credit facility based on daily balances of approximately $340.4 million during 2010 compared to approximately $166.0 million during 2009, and to a lesser extent to the $175.0 million of debt we issued in December 2010. The weighted average effective interest rate on the credit facility decreased to approximately 3.8% during 2010 compared to approximately 4.0% during 2009. Interest expense in 2010 also includes a make whole premium payment of $2.8 million associated with the early payment of $75.0 million of the 7.33% fixed rate notes that were due in July 2011. Income Tax Expense Income tax expense increased by $20.2 million due to a higher effective tax rate offset by a decrease in our pre tax income. The effective tax rates for 2010 and 2009 were 47.9% and 33.6%, respectively. The effective tax rate was higher primarily due to an increase in our state rates used in establishing deferred income taxes mainly due to a shift in our state apportionment factors to higher rate states, primarily in Pennsylvania, as a result of our increased focus on development of our Marcellus shale properties.  ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market Risk Our primary market risk is exposure to oil and natural gas prices. Realized prices are mainly driven by worldwide prices for oil and market prices for North American natural gas production. Commodity prices can be volatile and unpredictable. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activity Our hedging strategy is designed to reduce the risk of price volatility for our production in the natural gas and crude oil markets. A hedging committee that consists of members of senior management oversees our hedging activity. Our hedging arrangements apply to only a portion of our production and provide only partial price protection. These hedging arrangements limit the benefit to 52 Table of Contents us of increases in prices, but offer protection in the event of price declines. Further, if our counterparties defaulted, this protection might be limited as we might not receive the benefits of the hedges. Please read the discussion below as well as Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a more detailed discussion of our hedging arrangements. Periodically, we enter into derivative commodity instruments to hedge our exposure to price fluctuations on natural gas and crude oil production. Our credit agreement restricts our ability to enter into commodity hedges other than to hedge or mitigate risks to which we have actual or projected exposure or as permitted under our risk management policies and not subjecting us to material speculative risks. All of our derivatives are used for risk management purposes and are not held for trading purposes. As of December 31, 2011, we had 37 derivative contracts open: 23 natural gas price swap arrangements, six natural gas basis swaps arrangements, three crude oil price swap arrangements and five natural gas collar arrangements. During 2011, we entered into 31 new derivative contracts covering anticipated natural gas and crude oil production for 2011, 2012, and 2013. As of December 31, 2011, we had the following outstanding commodity derivatives: Commodity and Derivative Type Weighted Average Contract Price Volume Contract Period Net Unrealized Gain / (Loss) (In thousands) Derivatives Designated as Hedging Instruments Natural Gas Swaps $5.22 per Mcf 95,998 Mmcf Jan. 2012 Dec. 2012 178,550 Natural Gas Collars $6.20 Ceiling/ $5.15 Floor per Mcf 17,729 Mmcf Jan. 2013 Dec. 2013 21,429 Crude Oil Swaps $98.28 per Bbl 732 Mbbl Jan. 2012 Dec. 2012 (387 ) $ 199,592 Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments Natural Gas Basis Swaps $(0.27) per Mcf 17,042 Mmcf Jan. 2012 Dec. 2012 (3,107 ) $ 196,485 The amounts set forth under the net unrealized gain / (loss) column in the tables above represent our total unrealized derivative position at December 31, 2011 and exclude the impact of nonperformance risk of $1.4 million. Nonperformance risk was primarily evaluated by reviewing credit default swap spreads for the various financial institutions in which we have derivative transactions, while our non performance risk is evaluated using a market credit spread provided by our bank. From time to time, we enter into natural gas and crude oil swap and collar agreements with counterparties to hedge price risk associated with a portion of our production. These cash flow hedges are not held for trading purposes. Under these price swaps, we receive a fixed price on a notional quantity of natural gas or crude oil in exchange for paying a variable price based on a market based index, such as the NYMEX gas and crude oil futures. Under the collar agreements, if the index price rises above the ceiling price, we pay the counterparty. If the index price falls below the floor price, the counterparty pays us. We had natural gas price swaps covering 74.9 Bcf, or 42%, of our 2011 natural gas production at an average price of $5.30 per Mcf. We had one crude oil swap covering 275 Mbbl, or 20%, of our 2011 crude oil production, at an average price of $106.20 per Bbl. During 2011, crude oil collars covered 365 Mbbl, or 26% of total crude oil production, at an average price of $90.88 per Bbl. We are exposed to market risk on derivative instruments to the extent of changes in market prices of natural gas and crude oil. However, the market risk exposure on these derivative contracts is 53 Table of Contents generally offset by the gain or loss recognized upon the ultimate sale of the commodity. Although notional contract amounts are used to express the volume of natural gas agreements, the amounts that can be subject to credit risk in the event of non performance by third parties are substantially smaller. We do not anticipate any material impact on our financial results due to non performance by third parties. Our primary derivative contract counterparties are Bank of America, Bank of Montreal, BNP Paribas, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan. The preceding paragraphs contain forward looking information concerning future production and projected gains and losses, which may be impacted both by production and by changes in the future market prices of energy commodities. See "Forward Looking Information" for further details. Fair Market Value of Financial Instruments The estimated fair value of financial instruments is the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged currently between willing parties. The carrying amounts reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheet for cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable approximate fair value due to the short term maturities of these instruments. The fair value of long term debt is the estimated cost to acquire the debt, including a credit spread for the difference between the issue rate and the period end market rate. The credit spread is our default or repayment risk. The credit spread (premium or discount) is determined by comparing our fixed rate notes and credit facility to new issuances (secured and unsecured) and secondary trades of similar size and credit statistics for both public and private debt. The fair value of all of the fixed rate notes and the credit facility is based on interest rates currently available to us. We use available market data and valuation methodologies to estimate the fair value of debt. The carrying amounts and fair values of long term debt are as follows: December 31, 2011 December 31, 2010 (In thousands) Carrying Amount Estimated Fair Value Carrying Amount Estimated Fair Value Long Term Debt $ 950,000 $ 1,082,531 $ 975,000 $ 1,100,830 54  Table of Contents
