Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto in Item 8 below. The following discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements and estimates that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. Factors that could cause or contribute to differences from estimates include those discussed under "Cautionary Statement" and "Risk Factors" contained in Item 1A above. We operate on a 52/53 week fiscal year ending on the Friday closest to September 30. For ease of presentation, September 30 is utilized consistently throughout Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations to represent the fiscal year end date. 2011, 2010 and 2009 were all 52 week fiscal years. All date references contained herein relate to our fiscal year unless otherwise stated. As discussed in Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the Rollmet product line, formerly included within the Commercial Systems segment, has been accounted for as a discontinued operation for all periods presented and therefore certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. Unless otherwise noted, disclosures pertain to our continuing operations. OVERVIEW AND OUTLOOK We benefit from a diversified and balanced business, serving both commercial and government markets. This diversification and balance was an important attribute that helped support the performance of our Company during 2011. While our Government Systems business saw a modest revenue decline this year, our Commercial Systems business achieved a 13 percent increase in sales and a 290 basis point increase in segment operating margins. The reduction in Government Systems sales during 2011 was primarily due to the adverse impact of a change in government spending priorities and the lingering effects from the delay in ratification of the 2011 U.S. Department of Defense Appropriations Bill. In response to the challenging market conditions and projected decrease in 2012 sales for our Government Systems business, we redeployed resources and implemented a restructuring plan which, along with other cost savings initiatives, will better align our resources with this new economic environment. Our Commercial Systems business realized revenue growth from increased sales of our avionics systems to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) for new commercial and business aircraft. This business also benefited from increased aftermarket sales to customers who remain focused on increasing the efficiency of their aircraft. A continued focus on operating efficiency, strong incremental margin performance from our Commercial Systems business, higher share repurchases and lower tax expense drove a 15 percent increase in diluted earnings per share, which includes an after tax gain of $17 million resulting from the divestiture of a non core product line and an after tax charge of $17 million related to certain restructuring and asset impairment charges. We generated the following results for 2011: sales of $4.81 billion diluted earnings per share of $4.06 operating cash flow of $657 million invested in research and development (R&D) at 18.8 percent of sales We believe our Company has proven its ability to both react quickly to changing business conditions and to execute its business plans. Our fundamental strategies continue to serve us well: the balance between our commercial and government businesses; the diversification of our customer base and product offerings; the integration of our business through our shared service operating model; our focus on innovation through R&D. BalanceWe feel our business is characterized by its balance, in terms of market segment, geographic regions and product and customer sales mix. We strive to maintain a balance between our Government and Commercial Systems businesses, believing that the segments are complementary to one another. DiversificationOur business derives its revenue streams from a large number of customers, products, solutions, geographic regions and markets. Our Government Systems business executes against numerous programs every year for a variety of customers, including the U.S. Department of Defense, state and local governments, other government agencies, civil agencies, defense contractors and foreign ministries of defense. Our Commercial Systems business serves customers ranging from the worlds largest aircraft manufacturers to individual aircraft owners within the general aviation marketplace. This diversification of revenue sources enables us to pursue numerous growth opportunities as business conditions vary across our portfolios. 17 IntegrationWe have a highly integrated business reliant upon a shared services operating platform. The integrated nature of our business allows us to leverage product and service capabilities across our segments in a manner we believe is unique in our industry. This integration is evidenced by our product and technology centers of excellence in areas such as displays, communication, navigation and surveillance, through which we apply our core competencies to solutions in both Government and Commercial Systems. InnovationA well funded and comprehensive R&D program is a foundational aspect of our Company. Our focus on developing unique solutions to our customers needs is evidenced by the large investment we dedicate towards R&D programs. It is this spending profile that has allowed us to successfully pursue and capture customer programs and that will continue to be the growth engine for our Company. Looking forward to 2012, we believe the strong revenue growth expected in our Commercial Systems business should more than offset the modest decline anticipated in our Government Systems business. Despite the revenue decline that is expected to continue in Government Systems, we believe diluted earnings per share will increase at more than three times the rate of overall revenue growth. We expect to achieve this growth from incremental margins on higher anticipated Commercial Systems sales, continued improvements in operating efficiency and enhanced share repurchases funded through cash flow from operations and the incurrence of approximately $250 million of debt in 2012. Highlights of our 2012 earnings guidance are as follows: total sales in the range of $4.9 billion to $5.0 billion, or about a 2 percent to 4 percent increase over 2011 diluted earnings per share in the range of $4.40 to $4.60 cash provided by operating activities in the range of $625 million to $725 million capital expenditures of about $150 million total company and customer funded R&D expenditures of about $900 million, or about 18 percent of total sales See the following sections for further discussion of 2011 and anticipated 2012 results of operations. For additional disclosure on segment operating earnings see Note 25 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 below. Please also see our Risk Factors and Cautionary Statement in Item 1A of this Form 10 K. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following management discussion and analysis of results of operations is based on reported financial results for 2009 through 2011 and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto in Item 8 below. As discussed in Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the Rollmet product line, formerly included within the Commercial Systems segment, has been accounted for as a discontinued operation for all periods presented and certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. Unless otherwise noted, disclosures pertain to our continuing operations. 18 Consolidated Financial Results Sales (dollars in millions) 2011 2010 2009 U.S. $ 3,356 $ 3,284 $ 3,039 Non U.S.(1) 1,450 1,347 1,389 Total $ 4,806 $ 4,631 $ 4,428 Percent increase 4 % 5 % (1) Sales are attributed to geographic region based on country of destination. Sales for 2011 compared to 2010 Total sales increased $175 million, or 4 percent, in 2011 compared to 2010, primarily due to a $223 million increase in Commercial Systems sales partially offset by a $48 million reduction in Government Systems sales. Incremental sales from acquisitions, principally the December 2009 acquisition of AR Group, Inc. (Air Routing), contributed $15 million, or less than 1 percentage point of revenue growth. A more detailed discussion of sales by segment in 2011 and 2010 is found in the Government Systems and Commercial Systems Financial Results sections below. Domestic sales increased $72 million, or 2 percent, in 2011 compared to 2010, primarily attributable to higher Commercial Systems sales to Boeing and increased sales of our aftermarket products and services to commercial airlines and other domestic customers, including incremental service sales from the Air Routing acquisition, partially offset by lower sales to the U.S. Government resulting from the adverse market conditions described in the Government Systems sales section below. Non U.S. sales increased by $103 million, or 8 percent, in 2011 compared to 2010, primarily due to the combined impact of higher Commercial Systems sales to non U.S. business OEMs such as Bombardier and increased aftermarket revenues to commercial customers outside the U.S. Sales for 2010 compared to 2009 Total sales increased $203 million, or 5 percent, in 2010 compared to 2009, primarily due to a $282 million increase in Government Systems sales partially offset by a $79 million reduction in Commercial Systems sales. Incremental sales from the May 2009 acquisition of DataPath, the December 2009 acquisition of Air Routing and the November 2008 acquisition of SEOS Group Limited (SEOS), contributed a total of $209 million in revenue, or 5 percentage points of revenue growth. A more detailed discussion of sales by segment in 2010 and 2009 is found in the Government Systems and Commercial Systems Financial Results sections below. Domestic sales increased $245 million, or 8 percent, in 2010 compared to 2009, primarily attributable to sales growth in our Government Systems segment driven by higher product and service sales from the DataPath acquisition and increased sales to the U.S. Government. In addition, higher Commercial Systems sales to Boeing and incremental service sales from the Air Routing acquisition were partially offset by decreased sales to domestic business jet OEMs. Non U.S. sales decreased by $42 million, or 3 percent, in 2010 compared to 2009, primarily due to lower Commercial Systems sales impacted by reduced production rates at non U.S. business and regional jet OEMs, partially offset by incremental sales to regions outside the U.S. from the DataPath and SEOS acquisitions. Cost of Sales (dollars in millions) 2011 2010 2009 Total cost of sales $ 3,427 $ 3,353 $ 3,118 Percent of total sales 71.3 % 72.4 % 70.4 % Cost of sales consists of all costs incurred to design and manufacture our products and includes R&D, raw material, labor, facility, product warranty, depreciation, amortization and other related expenses. 19 Cost of sales for 2011 compared to 2010 Total cost of sales increased $74 million, or 2 percent, in 2011 compared to 2010, primarily due to the following: $59 million increase resulted from the $175 million of net sales growth discussed in the Commercial Systems and Government Systems Financial Results sections below $27 million increase was attributable to higher employee incentive compensation expenses. For 2011, $66 million of employee incentive compensation expense was included in cost of sales. For 2010, $39 million of employee incentive compensation expense was included in cost of sales $26 million increase resulted from the restructuring and asset impairment charges recorded in 2011 which were classified within cost of sales, as discussed in Note 24 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements the above items were partially offset by a $31 million reduction to cost of sales attributable to lower defined benefit pension expense. As discussed in the Retirement Plans section below, the reduction in pension expense was primarily due to a change in the period of time over which actuarial gains and losses are amortized. For 2011, pension income reduced cost of sales by $18 million, compared to $13 million of pension expense included within cost of sales for 2010 Cost of sales for 2010 compared to 2009 Total cost of sales increased $235 million, or 8 percent, in 2010 compared to 2009, primarily due to the following: incremental product and service cost of sales from the DataPath, Air Routing and SEOS acquisitions totaling $146 million $45 million increase attributable to higher employee incentive compensation expenses. For 2010, $39 million of employee compensation expense was included in cost of sales. For 2009, no employee incentive compensation was awarded. In addition, a favorable adjustment to reduce cost of sales by $6 million occurred during 2009 resulting from lower than expected compensation payments made to employees in 2009 for incentive awards earned in 2008 $32 million increase attributable to higher defined benefit pension expense. As discussed in the Retirement Plans section below, the increase in pension expense was primarily due to the unfavorable impact of a decrease in the discount rate used to measure our U.S. pension expense from 7.60 percent in 2009 to 5.47 percent in 2010. For 2010, $13 million of pension expense was included within cost of sales, compared to $19 million of pension income during 2009 $19 million benefit due to the absence of restructuring and asset impairment charges recorded in 2009 primarily related to the closure of our facility in San Jose, California the remaining variance was primarily related to a $68 million increase in cost of sales associated with the organic sales growth in Government Systems, partially offset by a $37 million net reduction in other cost of sales that was largely driven by the lower organic Commercial Systems sales volume. See the Government Systems and Commercial Systems Financial Results sections below for further discussion 20 R&D expense is included as a component of cost of sales and is summarized as follows: (dollars in millions) 2011 2010 2009 Customer funded: Government Systems $ 460 $ 437 $ 413 Commercial Systems 90 79 80 Total customer funded 550 516 493 Company funded: Government Systems 116 115 104 Commercial Systems 239 230 251 Total company funded 355 345 355 Total research and development expense $ 905 $ 861 $ 848 Percent of total sales 18.8 % 18.6 % 19.0 % Customer funded R&D expenditures are incurred pursuant to contractual arrangements and are typically accounted for as contract costs within cost of sales with the reimbursement accounted for as a sale in accordance with the percentage of completion method of accounting. As discussed in Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, customer funded R&D expense also includes amortization of pre production engineering costs. This amortization totaled $15 million, $15 million and $7 million for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Company funded R&D expense consists primarily of payroll related expenses of employees engaged in R&D activities, engineering related product materials and equipment and subcontracting costs. Total R&D expense increased $44 million from 2010 to 2011. The customer funded portion of R&D expense increased $34 million from 2010 to 2011, primarily due to a $23 million increase within Government Systems that was largely attributable to effort on new development programs such as the KC 46A Tanker, E 6 special mission aircraft and the Common Range Integrated Instrumentation System (CRIIS) programs. An additional $11 million increase resulted from Commercial Systems, driven by increased effort on various business and regional jet platforms. The $10 million increase in company funded R&D was primarily within Commercial Systems and was largely driven by increased effort towards development of next generation avionics for business aircraft and incremental effort related to our content on the Boeing 747 8 aircraft. Total R&D expense increased $13 million from 2009 to 2010. The customer funded portion of R&D expense increased $23 million from 2009 to 2010, primarily due to a $24 million increase within Government Systems from customer funded development efforts on a European fixed wing aircraft program and a public safety vehicle electronics integration program. The increase in customer funded R&D was partially offset by a $10 million decrease in company funded R&D. Commercial Systems company funded R&D decreased $21 million, primarily from lower spending as certain projects neared completion and the timing of other efforts were delayed as we continued to manage our cost structure and adjust to market demands. This decrease was partially offset by an $11 million increase in company funded R&D expense within Government Systems, primarily related to the DataPath acquisition and increased spending on other programs. Looking forward to 2012, total R&D expense is expected to be approximately $900 million, or about 18 percent of anticipated total Company sales. We expect customer funded R&D within Government Systems to decrease as a result of recent program terminations. We expect this decrease to be partially offset by an increase in company funded R&D within Commercial Systems as we continue to apply our recently certified Pro Line Fusion architecture to certain next generation flight decks for business aircraft. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (dollars in millions) 2011 2010 2009 Selling, general and administrative expenses $ 533 $ 476 $ 457 Percent of total sales 11.1 % 10.3 % 10.3 % Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses consist primarily of personnel, facility and other expenses related to employees not directly engaged in manufacturing or R&D activities. These activities include marketing and business development, finance, legal, information technology and other administrative and management functions. 21 Total SG&A expenses increased $57 million, or 12 percent, in 2011 compared to 2010, primarily due to the following: $29 million from higher employee incentive compensation costs and merit pay increases $18 million increase resulting from the combined impact of pursuing international business opportunities (including the opening and staffing of new offices in Paris, China and the Middle East), higher bid and proposal costs and an increase in other selling costs and activities $3 million of incremental SG&A expense from acquisitions, primarily Air Routing Total SG&A expenses increased $19 million, or 4 percent, in 2010 compared to 2009, primarily due to the following: $49 million increase due to the combined impact of incremental SG&A expense from the DataPath, Air Routing and SEOS acquisitions, and higher employee incentive compensation costs $30 million decrease in SG&A expense primarily comprised of reductions in employee headcount and other cost savings Interest Expense (in millions) 2011 2010 2009 Interest expense $ 19 $ 20 $ 18 Interest expense decreased by $1 million in 2011 compared to 2010. Interest expense increased by $2 million in 2010 compared to 2009, primarily due to a full year of interest expense associated with the $300 million of long term debt issued May 6, 2009. See Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 below for more detail regarding outstanding debt. Other Income, Net (in millions) 2011 2010 2009 Other income, net $ (28 ) $ (14 ) $ (23 ) For additional information regarding the fluctuations in Other income, net, see Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 below. Income Tax Expense from Continuing Operations (dollars in millions) 2011 2010 2009 Income tax expense $ 240 $ 239 $ 269 Effective income tax rate 28.1 % 30.0 % 31.4 % The effective income tax rate differed from the U.S. statutory tax rate as detailed below: 2011 2010 2009 Statutory tax rate 35.0 % 35.0 % 35.0 % State and local income taxes 1.1 0.8 0.7 Research and development credit (4.7 ) (1.2 ) (2.2 ) Domestic manufacturing deduction (1.9 ) (1.1 ) (1.3 ) Tax settlements (0.4 ) (2.4 ) Other (1.0 ) (1.1 ) (0.8 ) Effective income tax rate 28.1 % 30.0 % 31.4 % The difference between our effective income tax rate in 2011 and the statutory tax rate is primarily due to the tax benefits derived from the Federal Research and Development Tax Credit (Federal R&D Tax Credit), which provides a tax benefit on certain incremental R&D expenditures, and the Domestic Manufacturing Deduction under Section 199 (DMD), which provides a tax benefit on U.S. based manufacturing. 22 The effective income tax rate in 2011 decreased from 2010 primarily due to the retroactive reinstatement of the Federal R&D Tax Credit which had previously expired on December 31, 2009. On December 17, 2010, the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization and Job Creation Act of 2010 was enacted which reinstated and extended the Federal R&D Tax Credit from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2011 and reduced our 2011 effective income tax rate by about 2 percent. The effective income tax rate in 2010 decreased from 2009 primarily due to the favorable impact of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) completing its examination of the taxable years ended September 30, 2006 and 2007, partially offset by differences in the availability of the Federal R&D Tax Credit which expired December 31, 2009. The effective income tax rates for 2011, 2010 and 2009 include a tax benefit related to the DMD. The DMD tax benefit available in 2010 and 2009 was being phased in by statute and was therefore lower than the full DMD tax benefit which became effective beginning in fiscal year 2011. Management believes a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets is not necessary because it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will be fully realized, except for $14 million of deferred tax assets which have been fully reserved related to foreign net operating losses in Sweden and the United Kingdom which are not subject to expirations. Net Income and Diluted Earnings Per Share (in millions, except per share amounts) 2011 2010 2009 Income from continuing operations $ 615 $ 557 $ 589 Percent of sales 12.8 % 12.0 % 13.3 % Income from discontinued operations, net of taxes 19 4 5 Net income $ 634 $ 561 $ 594 Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations $ 3.94 $ 3.50 $ 3.70 Diluted earnings per share from discontinued operations 0.12 0.02 0.03 Diluted earnings per share $ 4.06 $ 3.52 $ 3.73 Weighted average diluted common shares 156.1 159.2 159.4 Net income for 2011 increased 13 percent to $634 million from net income of $561 million for 2010. Diluted earnings per share increased 15 percent to $4.06 for 2011 compared to $3.52 for 2010. Net income for 2011 includes a $17 million gain ($27 million before income taxes) from the divestiture of the Rollmet product line and also includes a $17 million charge ($27 million before income taxes) related to certain restructuring and asset impairment charges discussed in Note 24 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The increase in net income and diluted earnings per share was primarily the result of higher earnings from Commercial Systems as discussed in the Commercial Systems Financial Results section below, partially offset by a reduction in Government Systems earnings as discussed in the Government Systems Financial Results section below. The impact of the 2011 restructuring and asset impairment charge was included in income from continuing operations while the gain on sale of the divested Rollmet business was included in discontinued operations. The increase in diluted earnings per share was greater than the increase in net income due to the positive impact of our share repurchase program. Net income for 2010 decreased 6 percent to $561 million from net income of $594 million for 2009. Diluted earnings per share decreased 6 percent to $3.52 for 2010 compared to $3.73 for 2009. The decrease in net income and diluted earnings per share was primarily the result of higher expense from increased pension and employee incentive compensation costs and lower earnings from reduced Commercial Systems sales volume as discussed in the Commercial Systems Financial Results section. These items were partially offset by higher earnings from increased Government Systems sales volume as discussed in the Government Systems Financial Results section, a reduction to the effective income tax rate as discussed in the Income Taxes section and the absence of restructuring and asset impairment charges which occurred in 2009. The 2009 restructuring and asset impairment charge primarily related to the closure of a facility in San Jose, California and totaled $14 million after income taxes, or $21 million before income taxes. 23 Segment Financial Results Government Systems Overview and Outlook Our Government Systems business provides avionics, communication products, surface solutions and navigation products to the U.S. Department of Defense, state and local governments, other government agencies, civil agencies, defense contractors and foreign ministries of defense around the world. These systems, products and services support airborne (fixed and rotary wing), ground and shipboard applications. The short and long term performance of our Government Systems business is affected by a number of factors, including the amount and prioritization of defense spending by the U.S. and non U.S. governments, which is generally based on the security environment and underlying political landscape resulting from budget deficits. We expect global baseline defense budgets to be constrained as we move into fiscal year 2012. We also anticipate our government customers will have reduced procurement budgets and the available funding for R&D will decline. Factors driving this decline include reductions in supplemental appropriations that are expected to put further pressure on procurement budgets, as well as the adverse impact resulting from program cancellations and the potential for further cuts to the U.S. Department of Defense budget caused by the Deficit Reduction Act and a volatile political landscape. In this market environment, we continue to believe high priority military transformation initiatives and customer demand for cost effective solutions to modernize and extend the life of current systems or to replace systems returning from deployment will lead to funding support for our military communications and electronics equipment. Risks affecting future performance of our Government Systems business include, but are not limited to: potential impact of geopolitical and economic events overall funding and prioritization of the U.S. and non U.S. defense budgets delayed, reduced or canceled funding for programs we have won our ability to win new business, successfully develop products and execute on programs pursuant to contractual requirements We expect Government Systems sales to decrease by low single digits in 2012 compared to 2011, driven primarily by the following: $75 million reduction from lower production rates for legacy global positioning system (GPS) products as troop deployments wind down in Afghanistan and Iraq $60 million unfavorable impact from three programs that were terminated by the U.S. government for convenience during 2011 lower Joint Tactical Radio System program revenue for the Ground Mobile Radio variant fewer deliveries of iForce public safety vehicle systems The majority of the unfavorable items above are anticipated to be experienced in the first half of fiscal year 2012. We expect the above items to be partially offset by sales growth experienced over the full year in the following areas: tanker and transport avionics fighter avionics and services hardware for international targeting integration systems simulation and training systems 24 We project Government Systems 2012 segment operating margins will be comparable to the 21.0 percent segment operating margin reported in 2011 as the benefits of restructuring actions and a more favorable contract mix should offset the adverse impact of lower revenue. For additional disclosure on Government Systems segment results see Note 25 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 below. Government Systems Sales The following table presents Government Systems sales by product category: (dollars in millions) 2011 2010 2009 Avionics $ 1,434 $ 1,389 $ 1,315 Communication products 698 749 541 Surface solutions 377 408 370 Navigation products 304 315 353 Total $ 2,813 $ 2,861 $ 2,579 Percent increase (decrease) (2 )% 11 % Beginning in 2011, product category sales for Government Systems are delineated based upon differences in the underlying product technologies and markets served. Government Systems sales for the years ended September 30, 2010 and 2009 have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. Government Systems Sales for 2011 compared to 2010 Avionics sales increased $45 million, or 3 percent, in 2011 compared to 2010, primarily due to the following: $69 million increase resulting from the combined impact of low rate initial production sales on an E 6 special mission aircraft program and development effort on the recently awarded KC 46A Tanker program $43 million increase from higher rotary wing avionics sales on various platforms the above items were partially offset by a $66 million reduction in sales from the completion of the KC 135 Global Air Traffic Management program Communication products sales decreased $51 million, or 7 percent, in 2011 compared to 2010, primarily due to a $60 million net reduction in satellite communication program revenues, driven by the combined impact of a recently completed upgrade program and the adverse impact of delayed funding authorizations from the U.S. Government. Surface solutions sales decreased $31 million, or 8 percent, in 2011 compared to 2010, primarily due to the following: $63 million reduction attributable to the combined impact of two programs that were terminated for convenience by the U.S. Government and lower sales of soldier system optronics products that were adversely impacted by delayed funding authorizations from the U.S. Government $13 million decrease resulting from lower deliveries of iForce public safety vehicle systems the above items were partially offset by $48 million of increased development revenues for the Common Range Integrated Instrumentation System program Navigation products sales decreased $11 million, or 3 percent, in 2011 compared to 2010, primarily due to lower sales of GPS based products. Government Systems Sales for 2010 compared to 2009 Avionics sales increased $74 million, or 6 percent, in 2010 compared to 2009, primarily due to a $66 million increase in tanker / transport and special mission program revenues, due primarily to the combined impact of non U.S. program wins to upgrade fixed wing aircraft and higher revenues on KC 135 programs. 25 Communication products sales increased $208 million, or 38 percent, in 2010 compared to 2009, primarily due to the following: incremental sales from the May 2009 DataPath acquisition contributed $172 million, or 32 percentage points of the growth $20 million increase related to higher sales from deliveries of satellite radio units for certain mission system programs Surface solutions sales increased $38 million, or 10 percent, in 2010 compared to 2009, primarily due to the following: $54 million increase to revenue from initial deliveries of iForce public safety vehicle systems partially offset by a $19 million reduction in sales for a military ground modernization development program Navigation products sales decreased $38 million, or 11 percent, in 2010 compared to 2009, primarily due to a $36 million reduction in revenue from lower sales of GPS products as production rates were reduced in accordance with U.S. Department of Defense fielding requirements. Government Systems Segment Operating Earnings (dollars in millions) 2011 2010 2009 Segment operating earnings $ 592 $ 606 $ 602 Percent of sales 21.0 % 21.2 % 23.3 % Government Systems Operating Earnings for 2011 compared to 2010 Government Systems operating earnings were $592 million, or 21.0 percent of sales, for 2011 compared to operating earnings of $606 million, or 21.2 percent of sales, for 2010. The $14 million decrease in Government Systems operating earnings was primarily due to the following: $18 million reduction attributable to an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses driven by higher employee incentive compensation costs and merit pay increases as discussed in the SG&A section above $48 million reduction in sales volume discussed in the Government Systems Sales section above resulted in a $31 million reduction to costs and lower operating earnings of $17 million the above items were partially offset by a $21 million net benefit to operating earnings resulting from the combined impact of lower pension costs, as discussed in the Retirement Plans section below, and a $7 million reduction in warranty expenses primarily attributable to a favorable adjustment recorded in 2011 to reduce warranty reserves Government Systems operating earnings as a percent of sales were relatively flat from 2010 to 2011. Government Systems Operating Earnings for 2010 compared to 2009 Government Systems operating earnings were $606 million, or 21.2 percent of sales, for 2010 compared to operating earnings of $602 million, or 23.3 percent of sales, for 2009. The $4 million increase in Government Systems operating earnings was primarily due to the following: $282 million increase in sales volume discussed in the Government Systems Sales section above resulted in a $219 million increase to costs and incremental operating earnings of $63 million $14 million benefit to operating earnings resulted from lower warranty expense. The reduction in warranty expense was primarily due to the combined impact of a favorable adjustment recorded in 2010 to reduce warranty reserves for certain tanker transport aircraft programs and the absence of unfavorable charges which occurred in 2009 related to retrofits of fielded product. During 2010, net warranty expense for the Government Systems segment was $1 million compared to $15 million during 2009 26 $62 million reduction in operating earnings attributable to the combined impact of a $44 million increase in employee incentive compensation costs and an $18 million increase in pension expense as discussed in the Cost of Sales section above. For 2010, employee incentive compensation costs and defined benefit pension expense were $41 million and $8 million, respectively. For 2009, employee incentive compensation and defined benefit pension income benefited operating earnings by $3 million and $10 million, respectively $11 million reduction in operating earnings related to higher company funded R&D expense, as explained in the Cost of Sales section above The decline in Government Systems operating earnings as a percent of sales during 2010 compared to 2009 was primarily due to higher employee incentive compensation, pension and company funded R&D expenses explained above and lower margin acquisition revenues, partially offset by the reduction in warranty expense. Commercial Systems Overview and Outlook Our Commercial Systems business supplies aviation electronics systems, products and services to customers located throughout the world. The customer base is comprised of OEMs of commercial air transport, business and regional aircraft, commercial airlines and business aircraft operators. The near and long term performance of our Commercial Systems business is impacted by general worldwide economic health, commercial airline flight hours, corporate profits and the financial condition of airlines worldwide. We are experiencing positive trends in the commercial markets that we serve. Our air transport OEM customers enter fiscal year 2012 with a strong backlog and recent order activity that has prompted further increases in their planned aircraft production rates. We expect the strength of our positions on these platforms to benefit us in 2012. The planned production rate increases by the air transport OEMs also represent a positive sign that airlines expect to see continued favorable traffic trends as we move into 2012. Additionally, the market for new business jets has begun to recover with some increased demand and build rates anticipated for certain high end and mid sized aircraft classes. Demand for business aircraft at the low end of the market continues to lag as buyers remain cautious to commit capital towards the purchase of new aircraft. We expect deliveries of business and regional jets in 2012 to increase as compared to 2011. We expect a favorable commercial aftermarket environment due to continued increases in air transport passenger traffic, business jet utilization and airline capacity. The entry into service of the Boeing 787 and 747 8 aircraft is expected to drive additional demand for our aftermarket products and services as airlines provision initial spares in anticipation of aircraft delivery. Additionally, stronger airline and corporate profitability is expected to drive increases in demand for our retrofit and spare products. Risks to the Commercial Systems business include, among other things: turbulence in global economic and financial markets could have a significant impact on demand for air travel, airline demand for new aircraft and the availability of financing for new aircraft occurrence of an unexpected geopolitical event, or pandemic, that could have a significant impact on demand for air travel and airline demand for new aircraft potential negative impact that fuel prices could have on the profitability of airline and other aircraft operator customers our ability to develop products and execute on programs pursuant to contractual requirements development and market acceptance of our products and systems potential adverse impact from delays in aircraft production rate schedules at the OEMs, including delays in the entry into service date for new aircraft We expect Commercial Systems sales to increase by low double digits in 2012 compared to 2011, primarily due to the following: sales to aircraft OEMs are expected to increase in the low teens as a result of the entry into service and ramp up in production of the Boeing 787 and 747 8 and the Bombardier Global and Gulfstream G280 aircraft, as well as planned production rate increases across both air transport and business jet manufacturers 27 aftermarket sales are expected to experience growth in the low teens due to continued increases in air transport passenger traffic and business jet utilization, as well as increased retrofit and initial sparing activities in the air transport market as airlines take delivery of next generation aircraft the above items are expected to be partially offset by an estimated reduction of $20 million in sales of Wide body in flight entertainment (IFE) products and services due to our decision in 2005 to cease investing in this product area We project Commercial Systems 2012 operating margins will expand by approximately 250 basis points above the 19.1 percent reported in 2011, driven primarily by the anticipated revenue increase. For additional disclosure on Commercial Systems segment results see Note 25 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 below. Commercial Systems Sales The following table presents Commercial Systems sales by product category and type of product or service: (dollars in millions) 2011 2010 2009 Air transport aviation electronics: Original equipment $ 499 $ 439 $ 365 Aftermarket 431 380 388 Wide body in flight entertainment products and services 119 145 191 Total air transport aviation electronics 1,049 964 944 Business and regional aviation electronics: Original equipment 557 466 605 Aftermarket 387 340 300 Total business and regional aviation electronics 944 806 905 Total $ 1,993 $ 1,770 $ 1,849 Percent increase (decrease) 13 % (4 )% Commercial Systems Sales for 2011 compared to 2010 Total air transport aviation electronics sales increased $85 million, or 9 percent, in 2011 compared to 2010, primarily due to the following: air transport OEM sales increased $60 million, or 14 percent, primarily from higher product deliveries to Boeing across multiple platforms, including Boeing 787 aircraft, and increased development effort on avionics packages for the new Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China, Ltd. (COMAC) C919 narrowbody aircraft air transport aftermarket sales increased $51 million, or 13 percent, primarily related to a $27 million increase in service and support sales and higher aftermarket hardware revenues of $24 million, driven by initial deliveries of spares for Boeing 747 8 aircraft and higher spare part sales to various airline customers as they restocked their inventories Wide body IFE sales decreased $26 million, or 18 percent, due to the Companys strategic decision announced in 2005 to cease investment in this product area. Wide body IFE relates to sales of twin aisle IFE products and systems to customers in the air transport aviation electronics market and also includes related revenue from wide body service and support activities. Previously, revenues from Wide body IFE service and support activities were included in air transport aftermarket sales. For 2010 and 2009, $95 million and $106 million, respectively, was reclassified out of air transport aftermarket sales and into Wide body IFE products and services in order to conform to the current period presentation 28 Total business and regional aviation electronics sales increased $138 million, or 17 percent, in 2011 compared to 2010, primarily due to the following: business and regional OEM sales increased $91 million, or 20 percent, primarily due to $64 million of higher sales to Bombardier for Bombardier Global and Challenger 300 aircraft and $14 million of higher avionics sales to Cessna resulting from our new position on the CJ 4 aircraft business and regional aftermarket sales increased $47 million, or 14 percent. Service and support revenues accounted for $17 million of the increase, driven by improved aircraft utilization. Higher spare parts revenues and increased sales of equipment for simulators primarily contributed an additional $18 million. The remaining increase of $12 million was primarily related to incremental sales from the Air Routing and CTA acquisitions Commercial Systems Sales for 2010 compared to 2009 Total air transport aviation electronics sales increased $20 million, or 2 percent, in 2010 compared to 2009, primarily due to the following: air transport OEM sales increased $74 million, or 20 percent, primarily from higher sales to Boeing across multiple platforms as sales in 2009 were adversely impacted by Boeings labor strike and resulting inventory rationalization air transport aftermarket sales decreased $8 million, or 2 percent, due primarily to lower sales of retrofits and spares Wide body IFE sales decreased $46 million, or 24 percent Total business and regional aviation electronics sales decreased $99 million, or 11 percent, in 2010 compared to 2009, primarily due to the following: business jet OEM sales decreased $127 million, or 27 percent, primarily due to lower business jet OEM production rates regional jet OEM sales decreased $12 million, or 10 percent, primarily due to depressed regional jet OEM production rates at Bombardier, partially offset by higher customer funded development programs incremental revenue from the Air Routing acquisition contributed $28 million to business and regional aviation electronics aftermarket sales organic business and regional aftermarket sales increased $12 million, or 4 percent, primarily due to a $9 million increase in service revenues from improved aircraft utilization Commercial Systems Segment Operating Earnings (dollars in millions) 2011 2010 2009 Segment operating earnings $ 381 $ 287 $ 344 Percent of sales 19.1 % 16.2 % 18.6 % Commercial Systems Operating Earnings for 2011 compared to 2010 Commercial Systems operating earnings increased $94 million, or 33 percent, for 2011 compared to 2010, primarily due to the following: $223 million sales increase discussed in the Commercial Systems sales section above resulted in a $109 million increase in costs and incremental operating earnings of $114 million $18 million benefit to operating earnings related to a change in estimate recorded in 2011 to reduce the provision for certain customer incentives 29 the above items were partially offset by a $29 million reduction to operating earnings attributable to an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as discussed in the SG&A section above an additional $9 million reduction to operating earnings resulted from higher company funded R&D expense, as explained in the Cost of Sales section above The increase in Commercial Systems operating earnings as a percent of sales during 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily due to the incremental earnings from higher sales and the favorable impact of the adjustment to customer incentive reserves, partially offset by higher SG&A and company funded R&D expenses. Commercial Systems Operating Earnings for 2010 compared to 2009 Commercial Systems operating earnings decreased $57 million, or 17 percent, for 2010 compared to 2009, primarily due to the following: $79 million reduction in sales volume explained in the Commercial Systems Sales section above resulted in a $36 million decrease to operating earnings and a $43 million decrease to costs $42 million reduction in operating earnings attributable to the combined impact of a $29 million increase in employee incentive compensation costs and a $13 million increase in pension expense as discussed in the Cost of Sales section above. For 2010, employee incentive compensation costs and defined benefit pension expenses were $26 million and $5 million, respectively. For 2009, employee incentive compensation and defined benefit pension income benefited operating earnings by $3 million and $8 million, respectively $21 million benefit to operating earnings due to lower company funded R&D expense, as explained in the Cost of Sales section above The decline in Commercial Systems operating earnings as a percent of sales during 2010 compared to 2009 was primarily due to the lower sales volume and higher employee incentive compensation and pension expenses, partially offset by the reduction in company funded R&D expenses noted above and lower SG&A from headcount reductions and other cost savings. General Corporate, Net General corporate expenses that are not allocated to our business segments are included in General corporate, net. These costs are included within SG&A expense and Other Income, net on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. General corporate, net is summarized as follows: (in millions) 2011 2010 2009 General corporate, net $ 48 $ 54 $ 31 General corporate, net expense decreased $6 million during 2011 as compared to 2010 primarily due to a $13 million decrease in defined benefit pension expense that is described in the Retirement Plans section below, partially offset by a $7 million increase in certain selling, general and administrative costs, including employee incentive compensation, as discussed in the SG&A section above. General corporate, net expense increased $23 million during 2010 as compared to 2009 primarily due to the combined impact of a $6 million increase in employee incentive compensation and a $13 million increase in defined benefit pension expenses. For 2010, the combined amount of employee incentive compensation and pension cost included within General corporate, net was $18 million. For 2009, a favorable adjustment to an employee incentive compensation reserve resulted in a $1 million benefit to General corporate, net while pension expense was zero. 30 Retirement Plans Net benefit expense (income) for pension benefits and other retirement benefits are as follows: (in millions) 2011 2010 2009 Pension benefits $ (16 ) $ 26 $ (18 ) Other retirement benefits 10 5 4 Net benefit expense (income) $ (6 ) $ 31 $ (14 ) Pension Benefits In 2003, we amended our U.S. qualified and non qualified pension plans covering all salary and hourly employees not covered by collective bargaining agreements to discontinue benefit accruals for salary increases and services rendered after September 30, 2006. Concurrently, we replaced this benefit by supplementing our existing defined contribution savings plan to include an additional Company contribution effective October 1, 2006. The supplemental contribution to our existing defined contribution savings plan was $39 million, $34 million and $36 million for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Defined benefit pension expense (income) for the years ended September 30, 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $(16) million, $26 million and $(18) million, respectively. The decrease in pension expense in 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily due to the change in amortization period of actuarial gains and losses from 11 years in 2010 to 28 years in 2011. The higher pension expense in 2010 compared to 2009 was primarily due to the unfavorable impact of a decrease in the discount rate used to measure pension expense from 7.60 percent in 2009 to 5.47 percent in 2010. During 2011, the funded status of our pension plans went from a deficit of $1,185 million at September 30, 2010 to a deficit of $1,407 million at September 30, 2011, primarily due to a decrease in the discount rate used to measure our U.S. pension obligations from 4.85 percent at September 30, 2010 to 4.43 percent at September 30, 2011. In addition, the funded status was adversely impacted by a reduction in plan assets during 2011. During 2010, the funded status of our pension plans went from a deficit of $1,040 at September 30, 2009 to a deficit of $1,185 million at September 30, 2010, primarily due to a decrease in the discount rate used to measure our U.S. pension obligations from 5.47 percent at September 30, 2009 to 4.85 percent at September 30, 2010, partially offset by an increase in plan assets driven by improved market returns in 2010. We expect defined benefit pension income of $12 million in 2012, compared to $16 million of pension income in 2011. The expected $4 million reduction in pension income from 2011 to 2012 is primarily due to an increase in the amortization of net actuarial losses driven by the unfavorable impact of low discount rates and declines in asset values over recent years, partially offset by lower interest costs due to the decrease in the discount rate used to calculate pension expense. Our objective with respect to the funding of our pension plans is to provide adequate assets for the payment of future benefits. Pursuant to this objective, we will fund our pension plans as required by governmental regulations and may consider discretionary contributions as conditions warrant. We believe our strong financial position continues to provide us the opportunity to make contributions to our pension fund without inhibiting our ability to pursue strategic investments. In October 2011, subsequent to our 2011 year end, we made a $47 million contribution to our U.S. qualified pension plan. We plan to contribute an additional $63 million in 2012 for a total $110 million contribution, which we anticipate will fully satisfy the minimum statutory funding requirements for 2012. Any additional future contributions necessary to satisfy the minimum statutory funding requirements are dependent upon actual plan asset returns and interest rates. We may elect to make additional discretionary contributions during 2012 to further improve the funded status of this plan. Contributions to our non U.S. plans and our U.S. non qualified plan are expected to total $13 million in 2012. 31 Other Retirement Benefits We have historically provided retiree medical and life insurance benefits to substantially all of our employees. We have undertaken two major actions over the past several years with respect to these benefits that have lowered both the current and future costs of providing these benefits: in July of 2002, the pre 65 and post 65 retiree medical plans were amended to discontinue benefits for employees hired after September 30, 2006 and establish a fixed Company contribution. Additional premium contributions will be required from participants for all costs in excess of this fixed contribution amount. This amendment eliminated the risk to us related to health care cost escalations for retiree medical benefits going forward as additional contributions will be required from retirees for all costs in excess of our fixed contribution amount as a result of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, we amended our retiree medical plans on June 30, 2004 to discontinue post 65 prescription drug coverage effective January 1, 2008. Post 65 retirees have the option of receiving these benefits through Medicare. We believe the Medicare prescription drug benefit is generally better than the benefit that was provided by our discontinued post 65 drug plan Other retirement benefits expense for the years ended September 30, 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $10 million, $5 million and $4 million, respectively. We expect other retirement benefits expense of approximately $18 million in 2012. FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flow Summary Our ability to generate significant cash flow from operating activities coupled with our expected ability to access the credit markets enables us to execute our growth strategies and return value to our shareowners. The timing of our cash inflows is historically heavily weighted towards the second half of our fiscal year, particularly to our fourth quarter. We expect this trend to continue in the future. During 2011, we made $113 million of pension plan contributions and also made significant cash expenditures aimed at future growth and enhanced shareowner value, as shown below: $328 million of cash payments for share repurchases $152 million of capital expenditures $148 million of dividend payments $17 million related to the acquisitions of Blue Ridge Simulation, Inc. and Computing Technologies for Aviation, Inc. Operating Activities (in millions) 2011 2010 2009 Cash provided by operating activities $ 657 $ 711 $ 633 The $54 million decrease in cash provided by operating activities in 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily due to the following: Payments for inventory and other operating costs increased $237 million to $3,878 million in 2011 compared to $3,641 million in 2010. The increase was primarily due to increased costs associated with the higher sales volume in 2011 discussed in the Results of Operations section above and an increase in inventory, primarily driven by: (i) higher pre production engineering costs, as explained in greater detail within the Critical Accounting Policies section below, and resulting from increased effort on programs such as the Airbus A350, various Bombardier platforms in the business jet market, and several international rotary and fixed wing programs within Government Systems (ii) higher inventory resulting from the adverse impact of delayed funding authorizations from the U.S. Government, an increase to accommodate a transitional period of relocating certain production effort to other existing facilities, and increased component parts purchased to mitigate supply chain risks in light of the earthquake and tsunami in Japan 32 payments for employee incentive pay increased $71 million in 2011 compared to 2010. Incentive pay is expensed in the year it is incurred and paid in the first fiscal quarter of the following year. During 2011, $71 million was paid for employee incentive pay costs incurred during 2010. No incentive pay costs were incurred for the full year 2009; accordingly, there was no 2010 payment for incentive pay the above items were partially offset by an increase in cash receipts from customers of $212 million to $4,799 million in 2011 compared to $4,587 million in 2010, primarily due to the higher sales volume in 2011 as discussed in the Results of Operations section above and higher collections of receivables from customers, including higher progress payments received in advance of revenue recognition payments for income taxes decreased $29 million to $96 million in 2011 compared to $125 million in 2010 primarily due to the timing of cash tax payments related to the retroactive extension of the Federal R&D Tax credit The $78 million increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2010 compared to 2009 was primarily due to the following: payments for employee incentive pay decreased $113 million in 2010 compared to 2009. Incentive pay is expensed in the year it is incurred and paid in the first fiscal quarter of the following year. During 2009, $113 million was paid for employee incentive pay costs incurred during 2008. No incentive pay costs were incurred for the full year 2009; accordingly, there was no 2010 payment for incentive pay cash receipts from customers increased $58 million to $4,587 million in 2010 compared to $4,529 million in 2009, primarily due to the higher sales volume in 2010 as discussed in the Results of Operations section above and higher advances from government related contracts for financing of inventory payments for income taxes decreased $32 million to $125 million in 2010 compared to $157 million in 2009 primarily due to lower estimated taxable income in 2010 pension contributions decreased $29 million in 2010 compared to 2009 the above items were partially offset by a $182 million increase in payments for inventory and other operating costs to $3,641 million in 2010 compared to $3,459 million in 2009. The increase was primarily due to increased costs associated with the higher sales volume in 2010 discussed in the Results of Operations section above and inventory purchases for anticipated production volume In 2012 cash provided by operating activities is expected to be in the range of $625 million to $725 million. The projected range of cash provided by operating activities accommodates a $110 million expected contribution to our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan and a projected $130 million net increase in pre production engineering costs. We expect a majority of the projected 2012 operating cash flow to be generated in the second half of our fiscal year. Investing Activities (in millions) 2011 2010 2009 Cash used for investing activities $ (92 ) $ (232 ) $ (302 ) The $140 million reduction in cash used for investing activities in 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily due to the following: in 2011 we received $44 million in proceeds from the divestiture of the Rollmet business and $14 million in proceeds from the disposition of property compared to $1 million received from the disposition of property in 2010 in 2011 we acquired Blue Ridge Simulation, Inc. and Computing Technologies for Aviation, Inc. for $17 million compared to the 2010 acquisition of Air Routing for $91 million we received $20 million from the sale of a short term investment of excess cash in Germany in 2011 which was purchased for $21 million in 2010 the above items were partially offset by a $43 million increase in property additions in 2011 compared to 2010 in addition, we entered into an agreement with Bombardier, Inc. in April 2011 to provide them $237 million of cash on a short term basis in connection with their Global Vision aircraft program. Bombardier repaid the amount in full in June of 2011, in accordance with the terms of our agreement 33 The $70 million reduction in cash used for investing activities in 2010 compared to 2009 was primarily due to the following: in 2010 we acquired Air Routing for $91 million compared to the 2009 acquisitions of DataPath and SEOS for $146 million $44 million reduction in property additions in 2010 compared to 2009 the above items were partially offset by $21 million of short term investments purchased in 2010 by a non U.S. subsidiary Financing Activities (in millions) 2011 2010 2009 Cash used for financing activities $ (471 ) $ (279 ) $ (275 ) The $192 million increase in cash used for financing activities in 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily due to the following: cash repurchases of common stock increased $145 million to $328 million in 2011 from $183 million in 2010 repayment of short term borrowings increased by $24 million in 2011 as short term debt of $24 million outstanding at the end of 2010 was repaid during 2011 cash proceeds from stock option exercises decreased $16 million to $22 million in 2011 from $38 million in 2010 The $4 million increase in cash used for financing activities in 2010 compared to 2009 was primarily due to the following: cash repurchases of common stock increased $30 million to $183 million in 2010 from $153 million in 2009 the above item was mostly offset by changes in other financing activities, including higher cash proceeds and tax benefits from stock option exercises Share Repurchase Program Strong cash flow from operations provided funds for repurchasing our common stock under our share repurchase program as follows: (in millions, except per share amounts) 2011 2010 2009 Amount of share repurchases $ 322 $ 182 $ 156 Number of shares repurchased 5.5 3.2 3.9 Weighted average price per share $ 58.50 $ 57.50 $ 40.01 Approximately $0 and $2 million of the 2011 and 2010 share repurchases reflected in the table above are included within accounts payable at September 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and are reflected as a non cash transaction in our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. 34 Dividends We declared and paid cash dividends of $148 million, $151 million and $152 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Based on our current dividend policy, we will pay quarterly cash dividends which, on an annual basis, will equal $0.96 per share. We expect to fund dividends using cash generated from operations. The declaration and payment of future dividends is at the sole discretion of the Board of Directors. Financial Condition and Liquidity We have historically maintained a capital structure characterized by conservative levels of debt outstanding that enables us sufficient access to credit markets. When combined with our ability to generate strong levels of cash flow from our operations, this capital structure provides the strength and flexibility necessary to pursue strategic growth opportunities and to return value to our shareowners. A comparison of key elements of our financial condition as of September 30, 2011 and 2010 are as follows: September 30 (dollars in millions) 2011 2010 Cash and cash equivalents $ 530 $ 435 Short term investments 20 Short term debt (24 ) Long term debt, net (528 ) (525 ) Net debt (1) $ 2 $ (94 ) Total equity $ 1,528 $ 1,486 Debt to total capitalization (2) 26 % 27 % Net debt to total capitalization (3) % 6 % (1) Calculated as total of short term and long term debt, net (Total debt), less cash and cash equivalents and short term investments (2) Calculated as Total debt divided by the sum of Total debt plus Total equity (3) Calculated as Net debt divided by the sum of Net debt plus Total equity We primarily fund our contractual obligations, capital expenditures, small to medium sized acquisitions, dividends and share repurchases from cash generated from operating activities. Approximately half of our cash and cash equivalents resides at non U.S. locations and may not be readily accessible for use in the U.S. due to potential adverse income tax implications and other statutory limitations. Due to the fluctuations of cash flows, we supplement our internally generated cash flow from time to time by issuing short term commercial paper. Under our commercial paper program, we may sell up to $850 million face amount of unsecured short term promissory notes in the commercial paper market. The commercial paper notes have maturities of not more than 364 days from the date of issuance. At September 30, 2011, there were no short term commercial paper borrowings outstanding. The maximum amount of short term borrowings outstanding during 2011 was $345 million and was primarily the result of borrowings to fund a $237 million cash advance we provided to Bombardier, Inc. in April 2011 that was repaid in full in June 2011, in accordance with the terms of our agreement with Bombardier. We provided the cash advance to Bombardier to assist them by offsetting some delays they experienced in receiving customer advance payments on their Global Vision aircraft program. At September 30, 2010, there were no outstanding short term commercial paper borrowings. In the event our access to the commercial paper markets is impaired, we have access to an $850 million Revolving Credit Facility through a network of banks that matures in 2016, with options to further extend the term for up to two one year periods and or increase the aggregate principal amount up to $1.2 billion. These options are subject to the approval of the lenders. Our only financial covenant under the Revolving Credit Facility requires that we maintain a consolidated debt to total capitalization ratio of not greater than 60 percent, excluding the accumulated other comprehensive loss equity impact related to defined benefit retirement plans. Our debt to total capitalization ratio at September 30, 2011 based on this financial covenant was 15 percent. We had no borrowings at September 30, 2011 under our Revolving Credit Facility. In addition, alternative sources of liquidity could include funds available from the issuance of equity securities, debt securities and potential asset securitization strategies. We have a shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to which we can publicly offer and sell securities from time to time. This shelf registration covers an unlimited amount of debt securities, common stock and preferred stock or warrants that may be offered in one or more offerings on terms to be determined at the time of sale. To date, we have not raised capital through the issuance of equity securities as we prefer to use debt financing to lower our overall cost of capital and increase our return on shareowners equity. To fund share repurchases, we plan to incur $250 million of additional debt in 2012. 35 Credit ratings are a significant factor in determining our ability to access short term and long term financing as well as the cost of such financing in terms of interest rates. Our strong credit ratings have enabled continued access to both short and long term credit markets. If our credit ratings were to be adjusted downward by the rating agencies, the implications of such actions could include impairment or elimination of our access to credit markets and an increase in the cost of borrowing. The following is a summary of our credit ratings as of September 30, 2011: Credit Rating Agency Short Term Rating Long Term Rating Outlook Fitch Ratings F1 A Stable Moodys Investors Service P 1 A1 Stable Standard & Poors A 1 A Stable We were in compliance with all debt covenants at September 30, 2011 and September 30, 2010. Off balance Sheet Arrangements As of September 30, 2011, other than operating leases, we had no material off balance sheet arrangements, including guarantees, retained or contingent interests in assets transferred to unconsolidated entities, derivative instruments indexed to our stock and classified in shareowners equity on our Consolidated Statement of Financial Position or variable interests in entities that provide financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to our Company. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes certain of our contractual obligations as of September 30, 2011, as well as when these obligations are expected to be satisfied: Payments Due by Period Less than 1 3 4 5 (in millions) Total 1 Year Years Years Thereafter Long term debt $ 500 $ $ 200 $ $ 300 Interest on long term debt 145 25 43 32 45 Non cancelable operating leases 226 60 83 39 44 Purchase obligations: Purchase orders 987 830 126 6 25 Purchase contracts 121 48 63 4 6 Total $ 1,979 $ 963 $ 515 $ 81 $ 420 Interest payments under long term debt obligations exclude the potential effects of the related interest rate swap contracts. See Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 below. We lease certain office and manufacturing facilities as well as certain machinery and equipment under various lease contracts with terms that meet the accounting definition of operating leases. Our commitments under these operating leases, in the form of non cancelable future lease payments, are not reflected as a liability on our Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. Purchase obligations include purchase orders and purchase contracts. Purchase orders are executed in the normal course of business and may or may not be cancelable. Purchase contracts include agreements with suppliers under which there is a commitment to buy a minimum amount of products or pay a specified amount regardless of actual need. Generally, items represented in purchase obligations are not reflected as liabilities on our Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. 36 The table excludes obligations with respect to pension and other post retirement benefit plans (see Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 below). We plan to contribute $110 million to our U.S. qualified pension plan in 2012, which will fully satisfy the minimum statutory funding requirements for 2012. In October 2011, subsequent to fiscal year end, $47 million of this amount was contributed to the plan. For years beyond 2012, the actual amounts required to be contributed to our U.S. qualified pension plan are dependent upon, among other things, interest rates and underlying asset returns. Due to the current uncertainty of the amounts used to compute our expected pension plan funding, we believe it is not practicable to reasonably estimate such future funding for periods in excess of one year. With the exception of certain bargaining unit plans, payments due under other post retirement benefit plans are funded as the expenses are incurred. In addition, the table excludes liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits, which totaled $100 million at September 30, 2011, as we cannot reasonably estimate the ultimate timing of cash settlements to the respective taxing authorities (see Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 below). The following table reflects certain of our commercial commitments as of September 30, 2011: Amount of Commitment Expiration by Period Total Amount Less than 1 3 4 5 (in millions) Committed 1 Year Years Years Thereafter Letters of credit* $ 74 $ 59 $ 13 $ 2 $ * See Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 below for a discussion of letters of credit. In addition to the obligations disclosed above, we occasionally enter into Offset agreements, required by certain customers in some non U.S. countries, as a condition to obtaining contract awards for our products and services. These agreements, which generally extend over several years, are customary in our industry and are designed to enhance the social and economic environment of the country in which our customers operate. These commitments may be satisfied through activities that do not require us to use cash, including transfer of technology, providing manufacturing and other consulting support to in country projects, strategic alliances and transactions conducted by third parties (e.g., our vendors). These agreements may also be satisfied through our use of cash for activities such as placement of direct work or vendor orders for supplies and or services, building or leasing facilities for in country operations, in country employment of a non U.S. countrys citizen and other forms of assistance in the applicable country. The Offset rules and regulations, as well as the underlying contracts, may differ from one country to another. We typically do not commit to Offset agreements until contract awards for our products or services are definitive. Should we be unable to meet the Offset obligations we may be subject to contractual penalties, and our chances of receiving additional business from the applicable customers could be reduced or, in certain cases, eliminated. We historically have not been required to pay material penalties related to Offset obligations and are currently in compliance with our Offset commitments. At September 30, 2011, we had outstanding Offset obligations totaling approximately $437 million that extend through 2021. The amounts ultimately applied against our Offset requirements are based on negotiations with the customer and the cost to fulfill the obligation is typically only a fraction of the original obligation above. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS For information related to recently issued accounting standards, see Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 below. ENVIRONMENTAL For information related to environmental claims, remediation efforts and related matters, see Note 22 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 below. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The preparation of our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect our financial condition and results of operations that are reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements as well as the related disclosure of assets and liabilities contingent upon future events. Understanding the critical accounting policies discussed below and related risks is important in evaluating our financial condition and results of operations. We believe the following accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are critical to our financial condition and results of operations as they involve a significant use of management judgment on matters that are inherently uncertain. If actual results differ significantly from managements estimates, there could be a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Management regularly discusses the identification and development of these critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. 37 Accounting for Long Term Contracts A substantial portion of our sales to government customers and certain of our sales to commercial customers are made pursuant to long term contracts requiring development and delivery of products over several years and often contain fixed price purchase options for additional products. Certain of these contracts are accounted for under the percentage of completion method of accounting. Sales and earnings under the percentage of completion method are recorded either as products are shipped under the units of delivery method (for production effort), or based on the ratio of actual costs incurred to total estimated costs expected to be incurred related to the contract under the cost to cost method (for development effort). The percentage of completion method of accounting requires management to estimate the profit margin for each individual contract and to apply that profit margin on a uniform basis as sales are recorded under the contract. The estimation of profit margins requires management to make projections of the total sales to be generated and the total costs that will be incurred under a contract. These projections require management to make numerous assumptions and estimates relating to items such as the complexity of design and related development costs, performance of subcontractors, availability and cost of materials, labor productivity and cost, overhead and capital costs and manufacturing efficiency. These contracts often include purchase options for additional quantities and customer change orders for additional or revised product functionality. Sales and costs related to profitable purchase options are included in our estimates only when the options are exercised while sales and costs related to unprofitable purchase options are included in our estimates when exercise is determined to be probable. Sales related to change orders are included in profit estimates only if they can be reliably estimated and collectability is reasonably assured. Purchase options and change orders are accounted for either as an integral part of the original contract or separately depending upon the nature and value of the item. Anticipated losses on contracts are recognized in full in the period in which losses become probable and estimable. Estimates of profit margins for contracts are typically reviewed by management on a quarterly basis. Assuming the initial estimates of sales and costs under a contract are accurate, the percentage of completion method results in the profit margin being recorded evenly as revenue is recognized under the contract. Changes in these underlying estimates due to revisions in sales and cost estimates, the combining of contracts or the exercise of contract options may result in profit margins being recognized unevenly over a contract as such changes are accounted for on a cumulative basis in the period estimates are revised. Significant changes in estimates related to accounting for long term contracts may have a material effect on our results of operations in the period in which the revised estimate is made. Program Investments We defer certain pre production engineering costs in Inventories, net and record up front sales incentives in Intangible Assets (collectively referred to as Program Investments). These Program Investments are amortized over their estimated useful lives, up to a maximum of 15 years. Estimated useful lives are limited to the amount of time we are virtually assured to earn revenues through a contractually enforceable right included in long term supply arrangements with our customers. This provides the best matching of expense over the related period of benefit. The following provides an overview of the Program Investments: September 30 (in millions) 2011 2010 Pre production engineering costs $ 446 $ 320 Up front sales incentives 173 142 Total Program Investments $ 619 $ 462 38 We defer the cost of certain pre production engineering costs incurred during the development phase of a program in connection with long term supply arrangements that contain contractual guarantees for reimbursement from customers. These customer guarantees generally take the form of a minimum order quantity with quantified reimbursement amounts if the minimum order quantity is not taken by the customer. These costs are deferred in Inventories, net to the extent of the contractual guarantees and are amortized over their estimated useful lives, up to 15 years, using a units of delivery method. This amortization expense is included as a component of cost of sales, within customer funded research and development expense. Amortization is based on our expectation of delivery rates on a program by program basis and begins when we start recognizing revenue as we deliver equipment for the program. The estimated useful life is limited to the amount of time we are virtually assured to earn revenues through a contractually enforceable right included in long term supply arrangements with our customers. Pre production engineering costs in excess of the contractual guarantee, and costs incurred pursuant to supply arrangements that do not contain customer guarantees for reimbursement, are expensed as incurred. We also provide up front sales incentives prior to delivering products or performing services to certain commercial customers in connection with sales contracts. Up front sales incentives are recorded as a customer relationship intangible asset and are amortized over the period we have received a contractually enforceable right related to the incentives, up to 15 years, using a units of delivery method. Amortization is based on our expectation of delivery rates on a program by program basis. Amortization begins when we start recognizing revenue as we deliver equipment for the program. Up front sales incentives consisting of cash payments or customer account credits are amortized as a reduction of sales, whereas incentives consisting of free products are amortized as cost of sales. Risks inherent in recovering the value of our Program Investments include, but are not limited to, the following: changes in market conditions may affect product sales under a program. In particular, the commercial aerospace market has been historically cyclical and subject to downturns during periods of weak economic conditions, which could be prompted or exacerbated by political or other domestic or international events bankruptcy or other significant financial difficulties of our customers our ability to produce products could be impacted by the performance of subcontractors, the availability of specialized materials and other production risks We evaluate the carrying amount of Program Investments for recovery at least annually or when potential indicators of impairment exist, such as a change in the estimated number of products to be delivered under a program. No impairment charges related to Program Investments were recorded in 2011, 2010 or 2009. While we believe our Program Investments are recoverable over time, the cancellation of a program by a customer would represent the most significant impairment factor related to Program Investments. Due to the long term nature of the procurement cycle and the significant investment required to bring a program to market in the aerospace and defense industry, we believe the likelihood of a customer abruptly canceling a program is remote. We also evaluate our amortization of Program Investments quarterly based on our expectation of delivery rates on a program by program basis. The impact of changes in expected delivery rates on the Program Investments amortization is adjusted as needed on a prospective basis. There were no significant changes in the rate of Program Investment amortization and no significant cumulative adjustments recorded in 2011, 2010 and 2009. Amortization expense for pre production engineering costs and up front sales incentives for 2011, 2010 and 2009 was as follows: (in millions) 2011 2010 2009 Amortization of pre production engineering $ 15 $ 15 $ 7 Amortization of up front sales incentives 6 4 3 Total amortization of Program Investments $ 21 $ 19 $ 10 39 As disclosed in Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the weighted average amortization period for pre production engineering costs is approximately 10 years. As disclosed in Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the weighted average amortization period for up front sales incentives is approximately 9 years. Anticipated amortization expense for Program Investments for fiscal years 2012 and beyond is summarized below: (in millions) 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Thereafter Anticipated amortization expense for pre production engineering costs $ 26 $ 33 $ 42 $ 52 $ 48 $ 245 Anticipated amortization expense for up front sales incentives 11 11 16 19 17 99 Total anticipated amortization for Program Investments $ 37 $ 44 $ 58 $ 71 $ 65 $ 344 Pre production engineering costs comprise 37 percent of our total Inventory balance at September 30, 2011, compared to 32 percent in the prior year. Pre production engineering costs have increased $126 million from September 30, 2010 to September 30, 2011, attributable to a $106 million increase within Commercial Systems and an additional $20 million increase within Government Systems. Additionally, Up front sales incentives to Commercial Systems customers increased $31 million from September 30, 2010 to September 30, 2011. This recent growth in our Program Investments was driven primarily by the expanded market share our Company successfully captured over the past several years. Commercial Systems has secured positions on several key platforms in the air transport market, including the Boeing 787, Boeing 747 8 and Airbus A350. In the business and regional jet market, our Pro Line Fusion avionics system has been selected by customers around the globe, including Bombardier, Embraer, Gulfstream, and Mitsubishi. Our customers have provided us a contractual guarantee for reimbursement on several of these new programs; as such, our capitalized pre production engineering costs have increased for these programs as the Company continues development efforts. Our Government Systems business has also contributed to the recent growth in pre production engineering costs, as we begin to ramp up efforts on several international rotary and fixed wing programs that we recently won. We expect the long term supply arrangements resulting from these recent program wins to deliver significant revenues and profits to us over the next several years, continuing over the life of the aircraft platforms (which can range from ten to twenty years); as such, we believe our Program Investments are recoverable. We expect the balance of our capitalized Program Investment costs will continue to increase over the next several years, through at least fiscal year 2014. We primarily fund our Program Investments with cash generated from operating activities. Looking forward to 2012, we expect cash provided by operating activities to be in the range of $625 million to $725 million. This guidance accommodates an anticipated $130 million increase in pre production engineering costs (net of amortization), primarily attributable to Commercial Systems effort on the Airbus A350 and across multiple Bombardier platforms. Income Taxes At the end of each quarterly reporting period, we estimate an effective income tax rate that is expected to be applicable for the full fiscal year. The estimate of our effective income tax rate involves significant judgments resulting from uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations across many jurisdictions, implementation of tax planning strategies and estimates as to the jurisdictions where income is expected to be earned. These estimates may be further complicated by new laws, new interpretations of existing laws and rulings by taxing authorities. Due to the subjectivity and complex nature of these underlying issues, our actual effective income tax rate and related tax liabilities may differ from our initial estimates. Differences between our estimated and actual effective income tax rates and related liabilities are recorded in the period they become known or as our estimates are revised based on additional information. The resulting adjustment to our income tax expense could have a material effect on our results of operations in the period the adjustment is recorded. A one percentage point change in our effective income tax rate would change our annual income from continuing operations by approximately $9 million. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for tax carryforwards and the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and income tax purposes. The future realization of our deferred tax assets ultimately depends on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character (for example, ordinary income or capital gains) within the carryback and carryforward periods available under the tax law and, to a lesser extent, our ability to execute successful tax planning strategies. Management believes it is more likely than not that the current and long term deferred tax assets will be realized through the reduction of future taxable income, except for deferred tax assets which have been fully reserved and relate to foreign net operating losses. A change in the ability of our operations to continue to generate future taxable income, or our ability to implement desired tax planning strategies, could affect our ability to realize the future tax deductions underlying our net deferred tax assets, and require us to provide a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets. The recognition of a valuation allowance would result in a reduction to net income and if significant, could have a material impact on our effective tax rate, results of operations and financial position in any given period. 40 As part of the determination of our tax liability, management exercises considerable judgment in evaluating tax positions taken by us in determining the income tax provision and establishes reserves for tax contingencies in accordance with the Income Taxes topic of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. See Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 below for further detail regarding unrecognized tax benefits, deferred taxes and the factors considered in evaluating deferred tax asset realization. Goodwill As of September 30, 2011, we had $780 million of goodwill related to various business acquisitions. We perform impairment tests on goodwill on an annual basis during the second quarter of each fiscal year, or on an interim basis if events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that impairment has occurred. Goodwill is potentially impaired if the carrying value of the reporting unit that contains the goodwill exceeds its estimated fair value. The fair values of our reporting units are determined using a combination of an income approach, which estimates fair value based upon future discounted cash flows, and a market approach, which estimates fair value using market multiples, ratios and valuations of a set of comparable public companies within our industry. The valuation methodology and underlying financial information that is used to estimate the fair value of our reporting units requires significant judgments to be made by management. These judgments include, but are not limited to, the long term projections of future financial performance and the selection of appropriate discount rates used to present value future cash flows. Our five year strategic operating plan serves as the basis for these valuations and represents our best estimate of future business conditions in our industry as well as our ability to compete. Discount rates are determined based upon the weighted average cost of capital for a set of comparable companies adjusted for risks associated with our different operations. Our goodwill impairment tests that were performed in the second quarter of 2011, 2010 and 2009 yielded no impairments. In addition, based upon the results of our 2011 impairment testing, none of our reporting units were at risk of their carrying value of net assets exceeding their respective fair value. If there were a significant downturn in our business, we could incur a goodwill impairment. Warranty Accrued liabilities are recorded on our Consolidated Statement of Financial Position to reflect our contractual obligations relating to warranty commitments to our customers. We provide warranty coverage of various lengths and terms to our customers depending on standard offerings and negotiated contractual agreements. We record an estimate for warranty expense at the time of sale based on historical warranty return rates and repair costs. We believe our primary source of warranty risk relates to extended warranty terms. As shown in Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 below, the carrying amount of accrued product warranty costs has declined $78 million from a balance of $226 million at September 30, 2008, to a balance of $148 million at September 30, 2011. This trend is driven by a variety of factors. Within Commercial Systems, sales declined in 2009 and 2010, resulting in a lower provision for product warranty expenses. In addition, a primary source of warranty risk for Commercial Systems in the past related to sales of wide body in flight entertainment products and systems. As discussed in the Commercial Systems Results of Operations section above, sales related to Wide body IFE have declined significantly over the past several years due to the Companys previously announced decision to cease investing in this product area. As sales volumes related to Wide body IFE continue to decline and warranty periods on these legacy products expire, our warranty reserve balance has also been reduced. Product reliability improvements have also favorably impacted incurred warranty costs within Commercial Systems, contributing to a lower warranty reserve. The remaining decrease in our accrued warranty balance is primarily attributable to certain favorable adjustments recorded by Government Systems in 2011 and 2010 to reduce warranty reserves for changes in estimate, as discussed in the Government Systems Results of Operations section above. 41 Should future warranty experience differ materially from our historical experience, we may be required to record additional warranty liabilities which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows in the period in which these additional liabilities are required. Pension Benefits We historically provided retirement benefits to most of our employees in the form of defined benefit pension plans. Accounting standards require the cost of providing these pension plans be measured on an actuarial basis. These accounting standards will generally reduce, but not eliminate, the volatility of pension expense as actuarial gains and losses resulting from both normal year to year changes in valuation assumptions and the differences from actual experience are deferred and amortized. The application of these accounting standards requires management to make numerous assumptions and judgments that can significantly affect these measurements. Critical assumptions made by management in performing these actuarial valuations include the selection of discount rates and expectations on the future rate of return on pension plan assets. Discount rates are used to determine the present value of our pension obligations and also affect the amount of pension expense recorded in any given period. We estimate this discount rate based on the rates of return of high quality, fixed income investments with maturity dates that reflect the expected time horizon that benefits will be paid (see Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 below). Changes in the discount rate could have a material effect on our reported pension obligations and would also impact the related pension expense. The expected rate of return is our estimate of the long term earnings rate on our pension plan assets and is based upon both historical long term actual and expected future investment returns considering the current investment mix of plan assets. Differences between the actual and expected rate of return on plan assets can impact our expense for pension benefits. Holding all other factors constant, the estimated impact on 2011 pension income and pension benefit obligation for our U.S. plans caused by hypothetical changes to key assumptions is as follows: (in millions) Change in Assumption Assumption 25 Basis Point Increase 25 Basis Point Decrease $92 pension projected benefit $95 pension projected benefit Pension obligation discount rate obligation decrease obligation increase $6 decrease to pension Expected long term rate of return on plan assets $6 additional pension income income As disclosed in Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 below, beginning in 2011, actuarial gains and losses (including those resulting from a change in the pension obligation discount rate) are amortized over the expected future life expectancy of inactive participants, or about 28 years. In 2010, actuarial gains and losses were amortized over the average remaining service period of active participants, or about 11 years. This change in pension amortization period was the primary factor impacting the $42 million decrease in pension expense from 2010 to 2011. This change in amortization period also resulted in our pension expense (income) being less sensitive to changes in the discount rate assumption. An increase or decrease of 25 basis points in the pension obligation discount rate would impact 2011 pension income by less than $1 million. Inventory Valuation Reserves Inventory valuation reserves are recorded in order to report inventories at the lower of cost or market value on our Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. The determination of inventory valuation reserves requires management to make estimates and judgments on the future salability of inventories. Valuation reserves for excess, obsolete and slow moving inventory are estimated by comparing the inventory levels of individual parts to both future sales forecasts or production requirements and historical usage rates in order to identify inventory that is unlikely to be sold above cost. Other factors that management considers in determining these reserves include overall market conditions and other inventory management initiatives. Management can generally react to reduce the likelihood of severe excess and slow moving inventory issues by changing purchasing behavior, although abrupt changes in market conditions can limit our ability to react quickly. Management believes its primary source of risk for excess and obsolete inventory is derived from life time buy inventory. Life time buy inventory consists of inventory that is typically no longer being produced by our vendors but for which we purchase multiple years of supply in order to meet production and service requirements over the life span of a product. Total life time buy inventory on hand at September 30, 2011 was $97 million. 42 Excluding pre production engineering costs and progress payments, we had $878 million of gross inventory on hand at September 30, 2011 with $93 million of inventory valuation reserves. Although management believes these reserves are adequate, any abrupt changes in market conditions may require us to record additional inventory valuation reserves which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which these additional reserves are required. Pre production engineering costs are discussed in the "Program Investments" section of our Critical Accounting Policies above. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. Interest Rate Risk In addition to using cash provided by normal operating activities, we utilize a combination of short term and long term debt to finance operations. Our operating results and cash flows are exposed to changes in interest rates that could adversely affect the amount of interest expense incurred and paid on debt obligations in any given period. In addition, changes in interest rates can affect the fair value of our debt obligations. Such changes in fair value are only relevant to the extent these debt obligations are settled prior to maturity. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk by maintaining an appropriate mix of fixed and variable rate debt and when considered necessary, we may employ financial instruments in the form of interest rate swaps to help meet this objective. At September 30, 2011, we had $200 million of 4.75 percent fixed rate long term debt obligations outstanding with a carrying value of $200 million and a fair value of $215 million. In November 2003 we converted $100 million of this fixed rate debt to floating rate debt bearing interest at six month LIBOR less .075 percent by executing receive fixed, pay variable interest rate swap contracts. At September 30, 2011, we also had $300 million of 5.25 percent fixed rate long term debt obligations outstanding with a carrying value of $299 million and a fair value of $350 million. In January 2010 we converted $150 million of this fixed rate debt to floating rate debt based on six month LIBOR plus 1.235 percent. A hypothetical 10 percent increase or decrease in average market interest rates would have decreased or increased the fair value of our long term fixed rate debt, exclusive of the effects of the interest rate swap contracts, by $4 million and $5 million, respectively. The fair value of the $250 million notional value of interest rate swap contracts was a $29 million net asset at September 30, 2011. A hypothetical 10 percent increase or decrease in average market interest rates would decrease or increase the fair value of our interest rate swap contracts by $1 million and $1 million, respectively. At September 30, 2011, we had no short term commercial paper borrowings outstanding. Our results of operations are affected by changes in market interest rates related to variable rate debt. Inclusive of the effect of the interest rate swaps, a hypothetical 10 percent increase or decrease in average market interest rates would not have a material effect on our operations or cash flows. For more information related to outstanding debt obligations and derivative financial instruments, see Notes 11, 18 and 19 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 below. Foreign Currency Risk We transact business in various foreign currencies which subjects our cash flows and earnings to exposure related to changes to foreign currency exchange rates. We attempt to manage this exposure through operational strategies and the use of foreign currency forward exchange contracts (foreign currency contracts). All foreign currency contracts are executed with banks we believe to be creditworthy and are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries. The majority of our non functional currency firm and anticipated receivables and payables are hedged using foreign currency contracts. It is our policy not to manage exposure to net investments in non U.S. subsidiaries or enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. Notional amounts of outstanding foreign currency forward exchange contracts were $502 million and $404 million at September 30, 2011 and September 30, 2010, respectively. Notional amounts are stated in U.S. dollar equivalents at spot exchange rates at the respective dates. Principal currencies that are hedged include the European euro, British pound sterling and Japanese yen. The duration of foreign currency contracts is generally five years or less. The net fair value of these foreign currency contracts was a net asset of $1 million at September 30, 2011 and September 30, 2010. A 10 percent increase or decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar against all currencies would decrease or increase the fair value of our foreign currency contracts at September 30, 2011 by $6 million. For more information related to outstanding currency forward exchange contracts, see Notes 18 and 19 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 below. 43
