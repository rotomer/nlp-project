Item 7.Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto in Item 8 below. The following discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements and estimates that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. Factors that could cause or contribute to differences from estimates include those discussed under "Cautionary Statement" and "Risk Factors" contained in Item 1A above.We operate on a 52/53 week fiscal year ending on the Friday closest to September 30. For ease of presentation, September 30 is utilized consistently throughout Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations to represent the fiscal year end date. 2012, 2011 and 2010 were all 52 week fiscal years. All date references contained herein relate to our fiscal year unless otherwise stated.As discussed in Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the Rollmet product line, formerly included within the Commercial Systems segment, has been accounted for as a discontinued operation for all periods presented and therefore certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. Unless otherwise noted, disclosures pertain to our continuing operations.OVERVIEW AND OUTLOOK We have a diversified and balanced business, serving both government and commercial markets. Both of these businesses faced challenges during 2012. In Government Systems, a downturn in U.S. defense spending contributed to the eight percent reduction in sales. In Commercial Systems, we experienced strong growth in the air transport market, while sales to the business aviation market were impacted by the bankruptcy of one of our business jet manufacturing customers. The seven percent increase in Commercial Systems revenues during 2012 was not enough to offset the reduction in our defense business, as total Company sales declined two percent for the year. Despite the revenue decline, earnings per share from continuing operations increased five percent and both businesses improved segment operating margins over 2011, with Commercial Systems posting a 150 basis point increase from the prior year and Government Systems posting a 90 basis point increase from the prior year.As part of our continued response to these challenges we recorded a restructuring charge to reduce our cost structure and position us for improved performance in 2013 and beyond. We also exercised the flexibility of our balance sheet during 2012 and issued $250 million of 3.10 percent fixed rate debt. We used the proceeds from this debt, supplemented by available cash on hand, to repurchase approximately 13 million shares of common stock during the year, reducing our outstanding share count by 7 percent from 2011. In addition, in April 2012 our Board of Directors approved a 25 percent increase to our quarterly cash dividend paid on common stock, raising the amount to $0.30 per share. We generated the following results for 2012:sales of $4.73 billiondiluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $4.15operating cash flow of $534 millioncapital expenditures of $138 millionLooking forward to 2013, we anticipate the following: total sales in the range of $4.6 billion to $4.7 billiondiluted earnings per share from continuing operations in the range of $4.30 to $4.50cash provided by operating activities in the range of $500 million to $600 millioncapital expenditures of about $140 million18Our Company remains financially strong and looking out over the next three to five years, we believe we are well positioned to take advantage of improved market conditions when they arrive. In Government Systems, we expect U.S. military budgets to eventually stabilize and we continue to enhance our international strategies and adjust our infrastructure when necessary. In Commercial Systems, we have key positions on several air transport platforms with Boeing and Airbus and expect to benefit from strong order backlogs for these aircraft. In the business and regional jet market, we have expanded our market share over the past several years, winning positions on a variety of aircraft with customers around the globe, including Bombardier, Embraer and Gulfstream. We believe our Company has a proven ability both to react quickly to changing business conditions and to execute its business plans. Our fundamental strategies continue to serve us well: the balance between our commercial and government businesses; the diversification of our customer base and product offerings; our focus on innovation through R&D; and the integration of our business through our shared service operating model.BalanceWe feel our business is characterized by its balance, in terms of market segment, geographic regions and product and customer sales mix. We strive to maintain a balance between our Government and Commercial Systems businesses, believing that the segments are complementary to one another. Over the past three years, we have restored some of the balance between our business segments, as about 55 percent of our sales were attributable to the Government Systems business in 2012, compared to 62 percent in 2010. Looking forward to 2013, we expect this trend to continue as we anticipate Commercial Systems to account for nearly half of our revenues. DiversificationOur business derives its revenue streams from a large number of customers, products, solutions, geographic regions and markets. Our Government Systems business executes against numerous programs every year for a variety of customers, including the U.S. Department of Defense, state and local governments, other government agencies, civil agencies, defense contractors and foreign ministries of defense. Our Commercial Systems business serves customers ranging from the worlds largest aircraft manufacturers and airlines to individual aircraft owners within the general aviation marketplace. This diversification of revenue sources enables us to pursue numerous growth opportunities as business conditions vary across our portfolios.InnovationA well funded and comprehensive R&D program is a foundational aspect of our Company. Our focus on developing unique solutions to address our customers needs is evidenced by the large investment we dedicate towards R&D programs. This investment in R&D has allowed us to develop new systems, products and software solutions for our customers which will continue to be the growth engine for our Company.IntegrationWe have a highly integrated business reliant upon a shared service operating platform. Under our shared service operating model, certain functions and processes are utilized for the benefit of the entire organization. The integrated nature of our business also allows us to leverage product and service capabilities across our segments in a manner we believe is unique in our industry. This integration is evidenced by our product and technology centers of excellence in areas such as displays, communication, navigation and surveillance, through which we apply our core competencies to solutions in both Government and Commercial Systems. Our cost structure includes substantial investments in company funded R&D expense, leased facility and equipment costs and other non variable items such as depreciation and amortization of intangible assets. By applying common tools and systems across our businesses, we can better manage our fixed cost structure and maximize our R&D investments as technological advancements developed by one side of our business may be shared with the other. One of the key metrics that we often use to describe changes in operating income for each segment is the incremental (or reduced) earnings derived from higher (or lower) sales volumes. Similarly, the variable gross margin derived from these incremental (or reduced) earnings is often used to describe changes in operating margins (computed as segment operating earnings as a percent of segment sales). By leveraging the fixed costs present in our shared service operating model, we typically can deliver higher earnings on incremental sales volumes as variable gross margins for our core products and services in Commercial Systems tend to be approximately 40 to 50 percent. Variable gross margins in our Government Systems business can often approximate those realized in Commercial Systems, as a significant portion of Government Systems revenues are derived from firm fixed price contracts with commercial terms. The variable gross margin realized by Government Systems on cost reimbursable contracts and early stage development programs, however, tends to be lower. We calculate our variable gross margin as segment sales less direct cost of sales, which includes direct materials, labor and applicable overhead allocations. Other components of cost of sales, such as company funded R&D expense are excluded from variable gross margins. In this regard, variable gross margins are typically in excess of total segment operating margins, as total segment operating earnings contemplate all segment costs, including company funded R&D expense and selling, general and administrative costs. 19See the following sections for further discussion of 2012 and anticipated 2013 results of operations. For additional disclosure on segment operating earnings see Note 24 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 below. Please also see our Risk Factors and Cautionary Statement in Item 1A of this Form 10 K.RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following management discussion and analysis of results of operations is based on reported financial results for 2010 through 2012 and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto in Item 8 below.As discussed in Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the Rollmet product line, formerly included within the Commercial Systems segment, has been accounted for as a discontinued operation for all periods presented and certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. Unless otherwise noted, disclosures pertain to our continuing operations.Consolidated Financial Results Sales(in millions) 2012 2011 2010U.S. $3,169 $3,356 $3,284Non U.S.(1) 1,557 1,450 1,347Total $4,726 $4,806 $4,631Percent increase (decrease) (2)% 4% (1)Sales are attributed to geographic region based on the location of our customers.Sales for 2012 compared to 2011Total sales decreased $80 million, or 2 percent, primarily due to a $222 million reduction in Government Systems sales, partially offset by a $142 million increase in Commercial Systems sales. Refer to a detailed discussion of sales by segment in 2012 and 2011 in the Government Systems and Commercial Systems Financial Results sections below.Domestic sales decreased $187 million, or 6 percent, primarily due to lower sales to the U.S. Government resulting from the adverse market conditions described in the Government Systems sales section below, and a reduction in sales to a domestic business jet manufacturer, Hawker Beechcraft, who declared bankruptcy in 2012. This reduction was partially offset by higher sales to Boeing across various platforms and increased sales of aftermarket products and services to commercial airlines and other domestic customers, as discussed in the Commercial Systems sales section below. Non U.S. sales increased by $107 million, or 7 percent, as sales to non U.S. aircraft manufacturers like Airbus and Bombardier increased and aftermarket revenues to commercial customers outside the U.S. were higher. This increase was partially offset by a reduction in Government Systems sales resulting from lower sales to foreign ministries of defense. Sales for 2011 compared to 2010Total sales increased $175 million, or 4 percent, primarily due to a $223 million increase in Commercial Systems sales partially offset by a $48 million reduction in Government Systems sales. Incremental sales from acquisitions, principally the December 2009 acquisition of AR Group, Inc. (Air Routing), contributed $15 million, or less than 1 percentage point of revenue growth. A more detailed discussion of sales by segment in 2011 and 2010 is found in the Government Systems and Commercial Systems Financial Results sections below.Domestic sales increased $72 million, or 2 percent, primarily attributable to higher Commercial Systems sales to Boeing and increased sales of our aftermarket products and services to commercial airlines and other domestic customers, including incremental service sales from the Air Routing acquisition, partially offset by lower sales to the U.S. Government resulting from the adverse market conditions described in the Government Systems sales section below. 20Non U.S. sales increased by $103 million, or 8 percent, primarily due to the combined impact of higher Commercial Systems sales to non U.S. business original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) such as Bombardier and increased aftermarket revenues to commercial customers outside the U.S.Cost of Sales (in millions) 2012 2011 2010Total cost of sales $3,324 $3,427 $3,353Percent of total sales 70.3% 71.3% 72.4%Cost of sales consists of all costs incurred to design and manufacture our products and includes R&D, raw material, labor, facility, product warranty, depreciation, amortization and other related expenses.Cost of sales for 2012 compared to 2011Total cost of sales decreased $103 million, or 3 percent, primarily due to the following:$44 million decrease in cost of sales resulting from the $80 million reduction in sales volume, as discussed in the Government Systems and Commercial Systems Financial Results sections below$56 million reduction from lower employee incentive compensation costs$35 million reduction in company funded R&D expense, as explained belowabove items were partially offset by $12 million increase from higher restructuring and asset impairment charges recorded in 2012 as compared to 2011. For 2012, $38 million of restructuring and asset impairment charges were classified within cost of sales, compared to $26 million in 2011, as discussed in Note 23 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements$20 million increase primarily attributable to the $11 million increase in warranty cost detailed in Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and higher retirement benefit expenses, as described in the Retirement Plans section below The decrease in cost of sales as a percent of revenues was primarily attributable to the lower employee incentive compensation costs and reduction in company funded R&D expense.Cost of sales for 2011 compared to 2010Total cost of sales increased $74 million, or 2 percent, primarily due to the following:$59 million increase resulted from the $175 million of net sales growth discussed in the Commercial Systems and Government Systems Financial Results sections below$27 million increase was attributable to higher employee incentive compensation expenses $26 million increase resulted from the restructuring and asset impairment charges recorded in 2011 which were classified within cost of sales, as discussed in Note 23 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statementsabove items were partially offset by a $31 million reduction to cost of sales attributable to lower defined benefit pension expense, as discussed in the Retirement Plans section below The decrease in cost of sales as a percent of revenues was primarily due to a favorable change in sales mix resulting from higher Commercial Systems sales and lower Government Systems revenue.21Research and development expenseR&D expense is included as a component of cost of sales and is summarized as follows: (in millions) 2012 2011 2010Customer funded: Government Systems $420 $460 $437Commercial Systems 83 90 79Total customer funded 503 550 516Company funded: Government Systems 82 116 115Commercial Systems 238 239 230Total company funded 320 355 345Total research and development expense $823 $905 $861Percent of total sales 17.4% 18.8% 18.6%We make significant investments in research and development to allow our customers to benefit from the latest technological advancements. Total research and development expense is comprised of both company funded and customer funded R&D expenditures. Customer funded R&D expenditures are incurred pursuant to contractual arrangements and are typically accounted for as contract costs within cost of sales with the reimbursement accounted for as a sale in accordance with the percentage of completion method of accounting. Company funded R&D expenditures relate to the development of new products and the improvement of existing products and are expensed as incurred, as disclosed in Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Company funded R&D expense consists primarily of payroll related expenses of employees engaged in R&D activities, engineering related product materials and equipment and subcontracting costs. In addition to the R&D expenditures shown in the table above, we defer the cost of certain pre production engineering effort incurred during the development phase of programs when the customer has provided us a long term supply arrangement and a contractual guarantee for reimbursement. Refer to the Research and Development section found in Item 1 and the Critical Accounting Policies section found in Item 7 below for further discussion of our incremental investments in pre production engineering effort. Total R&D expense decreased $82 million from 2011 to 2012. The customer funded portion of R&D expense decreased $47 million from 2011 to 2012. Government Systems accounted for $40 million of this decrease, as certain development programs were terminated for convenience by the U.S. Government and spending on other programs slowed during a transition out of the development phase into production. The $35 million decrease in company funded R&D was also driven by Government Systems and was attributable to the completion of development effort for networked communication, airborne communication and navigation products, as well as savings realized from our previously announced decision to cease further discretionary investments in the public safety vehicle product line. Total R&D expense increased $44 million from 2010 to 2011. The customer funded portion of R&D expense increased $34 million from 2010 to 2011, primarily due to a $23 million increase within Government Systems that was largely attributable to effort on new development programs such as the KC 46A Tanker, E 6 special mission aircraft and the Common Range Integrated Instrumentation System (CRIIS) programs. An additional $11 million increase resulted from Commercial Systems, driven by increased effort on various business and regional jet platforms. The $10 million increase in company funded R&D was primarily within Commercial Systems and was largely driven by increased effort towards development of next generation avionics for business aircraft and incremental effort related to our content on the Boeing 747 8 aircraft.Looking forward to 2013, total R&D expense is expected to be approximately $800 million. We expect a reduction in customer funded R&D expense, primarily within Government Systems, and anticipate company funded R&D expenditures to be relatively flat when compared to 2012. In addition, we expect a $210 million net increase in pre production engineering costs during 2013. Refer to additional discussion of pre production engineering costs in the Critical Accounting Policies section found in Item 7 below.22Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (in millions) 2012 2011 2010Selling, general and administrative expenses $543 $533 $476Percent of total sales 11.5% 11.1% 10.3%Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses consist primarily of personnel, facility and other expenses related to employees not directly engaged in manufacturing or R&D activities. These activities include marketing and business development, finance, legal, information technology and other administrative and management functions.Total SG&A expenses increased $10 million, or 2 percent, in 2012 compared to 2011, primarily due to the following:$29 million due to higher bad debt expense resulting from the customer bankruptcies described in Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statementspartially offset by a $19 million reduction from lower employee incentive compensation and other savings attributable to headcount reduction and restructuring actionsTotal SG&A expenses increased $57 million, or 12 percent, in 2011 compared to 2010, primarily due to the following:$29 million from higher employee incentive compensation costs and merit pay increases$18 million increase resulting from the combined impact of pursuing international business opportunities (including the opening and staffing of new offices internationally), higher bid and proposal costs and an increase in other selling costs and activities$3 million of incremental SG&A expense from acquisitions, primarily Air RoutingInterest Expense(in millions) 2012 2011 2010Interest expense $27 $19 $20Interest expense increased by $8 million in 2012 compared to 2011, primarily due to additional interest expense associated with the $250 million of long term debt issued in November of 2011. See Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 below for more detail regarding outstanding debt.

This increase was partially offset by the favorable impact in 2012 of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) completing its examination of the taxable years ended September 30, 2008 and 2009. The effective income tax rate in 2011 decreased from 2010 primarily due to the retroactive reinstatement of the Federal R&D Tax Credit which had previously expired on December 31, 2009. On December 17, 2010, the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization and Job Creation Act of 2010 was enacted which reinstated and extended the Federal R&D Tax Credit from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2011 and reduced our 2011 effective income tax rate by about 2 percent.The effective income tax rates for 2012, 2011 and 2010 include a tax benefit related to the DMD. The DMD tax benefit available in 2010 was being phased in by statute and was therefore lower than the full DMD tax benefit which became effective beginning in fiscal year 2011.Net Income and Diluted Earnings Per Share (in millions, except per share amounts) 2012 2011 2010Income from continuing operations $609 $615 $557Percent of sales 12.9% 12.8% 12.0% Income from discontinued operations, net of taxes 19 4Net income $609 $634 $561 Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations $4.15 $3.94 $3.50Diluted earnings per share from discontinued operations 0.12 0.02Diluted earnings per share $4.15 $4.06 $3.52 Weighted average diluted common shares 146.8 156.1 159.2Net income for 2012 decreased 4 percent to $609 million from net income of $634 million for 2011. Diluted earnings per share increased 2 percent to $4.15 for 2012 compared to $4.06 for 2011. The rate of increase in diluted earnings per share benefited from the positive impact of our share repurchase program.Net income and earnings per share for 2012 includes a $38 million charge, or $0.26 per share, attributable to the net restructuring and asset impairment charges described in Note 23 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Net income and earnings per share for 2011 includes a $17 million gain ($0.11 per share) from the divestiture of the Rollmet product line and also includes an offsetting charge of $17 million ($0.11 per share) related to restructuring actions. 24Net income and earnings per share for 2012 benefited from higher earnings in Commercial Systems as discussed in the Commercial Systems Financial Results section below. This benefit was partially offset by higher income tax expense, as explained in the Income Tax section above, and the reduction in Government Systems segment earnings described in the Government Systems Financial Results section below.Net income for 2011 increased 13 percent to $634 million from net income of $561 million for 2010. Diluted earnings per share increased 15 percent to $4.06 for 2011 compared to $3.52 for 2010. Net income and earnings per share for 2011 includes a $17 million gain ($0.11 per share) from the divestiture of the Rollmet product line and also includes an offsetting charge of $17 million ($0.11 per share) related to certain restructuring and asset impairment charges discussed in Note 23 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The increase in net income and diluted earnings per share was primarily the result of higher earnings from Commercial Systems as discussed in the Commercial Systems Financial Results section below, partially offset by a reduction in Government Systems earnings as discussed in the Government Systems Financial Results section below. The impact of the 2011 restructuring and asset impairment charge was included in income from continuing operations while the gain on sale of the divested Rollmet product line was included in discontinued operations. The increase in diluted earnings per share was greater than the increase in net income due to the positive impact of our share repurchase program.Segment Financial ResultsGovernment SystemsOverview and OutlookOur Government Systems business provides avionics, communication products, surface solutions and navigation products to the U.S. Department of Defense, other ministries of defense, other government agencies and defense contractors around the world. These systems, products and services support airborne (fixed and rotary wing), ground and shipboard applications. The short and long term performance of our Government Systems business is affected by a number of factors, including the amount and prioritization of defense spending by the U.S. and non U.S. governments, which is generally based on the security environment and underlying political landscape resulting from budget deficits.In August 2011, Congress enacted the Budget Control Act of 2011 which imposes spending caps and certain reductions in security spending over a ten year period through 2021. Absent additional Congressional action, further budget cuts (or sequestration) as outlined in the Budget Act will be implemented on January 3, 2013. If the sequestration process is implemented in January 2013 as currently mandated, there could be a significant adverse impact to our Company and to the defense industry in general.Further, in years when the U.S. Government does not complete its budget process before the end of its fiscal year (September 30), government operations typically are funded through a continuing resolution that authorizes agencies of the U.S. Government to continue to operate, but does not authorize new spending initiatives. During periods covered by continuing resolutions (or until the regular appropriation bills are passed), we may experience delays in procurement of products and services which can adversely impact our results of operations and cause variability in the timing of revenue between periods.Our fiscal year 2013 guidance for Government Systems incorporates the anticipated impact of sequestration. We expect Government Systems revenues to decrease by approximately 10 percent in 2013 as compared to 2012, with about half of the year over year decline resulting from the impact of sequestration. The remaining expected net decline is primarily driven by:approximately $100 million reduction resulting from programs transitioning out of the development phase, with full scale production not expected to occur until after 2013lower product deliveries of our Defense Advanced GPS Receivers and satellite communication terminalsdelays in the Eurofighter Tranche III and reductions from lower sales of joint helmet mounted cueing systems for military fixed wing aircraft items above are expected to be partially offset by increased deliveries of Joint Tactical Radio SystemManpack radios and Firestorm targeting systems and higher sales on tanker/transport aircraft platformsWe project Government Systems 2013 segment operating margins to be approximately 21 percent, as the benefits from restructuring actions and other cost reduction initiatives should mostly offset the adverse impact from lower revenue.25Risks affecting future performance of our Government Systems business include:overall funding and prioritization of the U.S. and non U.S. defense budgets, including unanticipated impacts of sequestration and other provisions of the Budget Control Act of 2011 that are set to be implemented in January 2013delayed, reduced or canceled funding for programs we have won potential impact of geopolitical and economic eventsour ability to execute to our internal performance plans and cost reduction initiativesour ability to win new business, successfully develop products and execute on programs pursuant to contractual requirementsFor additional disclosure on Government Systems segment results see Note 24 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 below.Government Systems Sales The following table presents Government Systems sales by product category: (in millions) 2012 2011 2010Avionics $1,476 $1,434 $1,389Communication products 652 698 749Surface solutions 226 377 408Navigation products 237 304 315Total $2,591 $2,813 $2,861Percent (decrease) (8)% (2)% Beginning in 2011, we began presenting sales for Government Systems based upon differences in the underlying product technologies and markets served. Government Systems sales for the year ended September 30, 2010 have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.Government Systems Sales for 2012 compared to 2011Avionics sales increased $42 million, or 3 percent, primarily due to the following:$80 million increase resulting from the combined impact of development effort on the KC 46A, KC 10 and KC 390 tanker programs$49 million increase in sales on the Saudi F 15 fighter program partially offset by reductions to revenue of $87 million, primarily attributable to decreased sales for the KC 135 Global Air Traffic Management program and lower deliveries on C 17 transport, CH 53 rotary wing and P 3 special mission aircraftCommunication products sales decreased $46 million, or 7 percent, primarily due to the following:$21 million reduction due to the completion of a program to provide transportable cellular capabilities in Afghanistan $21 million decrease resulting from the combined impact of a program termination for Ground Mobile Radios and reduced funding authorizations on the U.S. Department of Defense FAB T (Family of Advanced Beyond Line of Sight terminals) initiative26Surface solutions sales decreased $151 million, or 40 percent, primarily due to the following:$52 million reduction attributable to the combined impact of two programs that were terminated for convenience by the U.S. Government during 2011$52 million decrease resulting from the combined impact of fewer deliveries of iForce public safety vehicle systems as we exited this product line and a reduction in Joint Precision Approach and Landing System program revenues as it transitions from development into productionremaining decrease of $47 million was due to a variety of items, including fewer deliveries of soldier optronics products and a decline in electronic warfare solution program revenuesNavigation products sales decreased $67 million, or 22 percent, primarily due to an $81 million reduction in revenue from fewer deliveries of our Defense Advanced GPS Receiver products as troop deployments wind down in Afghanistan and Iraq.Government Systems Sales for 2011 compared to 2010Avionics sales increased $45 million, or 3 percent, primarily due to the following:$69 million increase resulting from the combined impact of low rate initial production sales on an E 6 special mission aircraft program and development effort on the recently awarded KC 46A Tanker program$43 million increase from higher rotary wing avionics sales on various platformsabove items were partially offset by a $66 million reduction in sales from the completion of the KC 135 Global Air Traffic Management program Communication products sales decreased $51 million, or 7 percent, primarily due to a $60 million net reduction in satellite communication program revenues, driven by the combined impact of a recently completed upgrade program and the adverse impact of delayed funding authorizations from the U.S. Government.Surface solutions sales decreased $31 million, or 8 percent, primarily due to the following:$63 million reduction attributable to the combined impact of two programs that were terminated for convenience by the U.S. Government and lower sales of soldier system optronics products that were adversely impacted by delayed funding authorizations from the U.S. Government$13 million decrease resulting from lower deliveries of iForce public safety vehicle systemsabove items were partially offset by $48 million of increased development revenues for the Common Range Integrated Instrumentation System programNavigation products sales decreased $11 million, or 3 percent, primarily due to lower sales of GPS based products.Government Systems Segment Operating Earnings (in millions) 2012 2011 2010Segment operating earnings $568 $592 $606Percent of sales 21.9% 21.0% 21.2%27Government Systems Operating Earnings for 2012 compared to 2011Government Systems operating earnings were $568 million, or 21.9 percent of sales, for 2012 compared to operating earnings of $592 million, or 21.0 percent of sales, for 2011. The $24 million decrease in Government Systems operating earnings was primarily due to the following:$222 million reduction in sales discussed in the Government Systems sales section above resulted in a $137 million decrease to costs and a reduction to earnings of $85 million. The variable gross margin of 38 percent reflects the absence of higher margin hardware sales for Navigation products that occurred last yearpartially offset by a $34 million benefit to operating earnings resulting from lower company funded R&D expense, as explained in the Cost of Sales section aboveremaining variance of $27 million was primarily attributable to a benefit from lower employee headcount and incentive compensation costs, partially offset by higher warranty expense and an increase in employee medical and retirement benefit costs, as explained in the Cost of Sales section aboveThe increase in Government Systems operating earnings as a percent of sales was driven by the decline in company funded R&D expense and lower employee incentive compensation costs, partially offset by the adverse impact of lower sales. Government Systems Operating Earnings for 2011 compared to 2010Government Systems operating earnings were $592 million, or 21.0 percent of sales, for 2011 compared to operating earnings of $606 million, or 21.2 percent of sales, for 2010. The $14 million decrease in Government Systems operating earnings was primarily due to the following:$18 million reduction attributable to an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses driven by higher employee incentive compensation costs and merit pay increases as discussed in the SG&A section above $48 million reduction in sales volume discussed in the Government Systems Sales section above resulted in a $31 million reduction to costs and lower operating earnings of $17 million, at a variable gross margin of 35 percent above items were partially offset by a $21 million net benefit to operating earnings resulting from the combined impact of lower pension costs, as discussed in the Retirement Plans section below, and a $7 million reduction in warranty expenses primarily attributable to a favorable adjustment recorded in 2011 to reduce warranty reserves Government Systems operating earnings as a percent of sales were relatively flat from 2010 to 2011. Commercial SystemsOverview and OutlookOur Commercial Systems business supplies aviation electronics systems, products and services to customers located throughout the world. The customer base is comprised of OEMs of commercial air transport, business and regional aircraft, commercial airlines and business aircraft operators. The near and long term performance of our Commercial Systems business is impacted by general worldwide economic health, commercial airline flight hours, corporate profits and the financial condition of airlines worldwide.We expect Commercial Systems sales to increase by about 7 percent in 2013 compared to 2012, primarily due to the following:sales to aircraft OEMs are expected to increase by high single digits across both the air transport and business and regional markets. Sales to air transport aircraft OEMs should benefit from anticipated production rate increases for the Boeing 787 aircraft and other legacy Boeing and Airbus aircraft. Business and regional jet OEM sales should also improve as the result of modest production rate increases across most OEM customersaftermarket sales for 2013 are expected to increase by low double digits. The sales increase is expected to be driven by initial revenue from airspace mandates, business jet cockpit upgrades and higher service and support revenue across both market segments28partially offset by an expected decrease of approximately 15 percent in sales of wide body in flight entertainment (IFE) products and services due to our decision in 2005 to cease investing in this product area. Wide body IFE relates to sales of twin aisle IFE products and systems to customers in the air transport market and also includes related revenue from wide body service and support activitiesWe expect the majority of the anticipated sales growth for Commercial Systems to occur in the second half of fiscal year 2013. This is primarily driven by year over year comparability issues with the timing of spares revenues on Boeing 787 aircraft, the lack of Hawker Beechcraft jet deliveries in 2013 and a concentration of anticipated mandate and retrofit activity towards the latter part of our fiscal 2013. We project Commercial Systems 2013 operating margins will expand by approximately 200 basis points above the 20.6 percent reported in 2012, driven primarily by the anticipated revenue increase. Risks to the Commercial Systems business include:turbulence in global economic and financial markets could have a significant impact on demand for air travel, airline demand for new aircraft and the availability of financing for new aircraftoccurrence of an unexpected geopolitical event, including terrorism or a pandemic, that could have a significant impact on demand for air travel and airline demand for new aircraftpotential negative impact that fuel prices could have on the profitability of airline and other aircraft operator customersour ability to develop products and execute on programs pursuant to contractual requirementsdevelopment and market segment acceptance of our products and systemspotential adverse impact from delays or reductions in OEM aircraft production, including delays in the entry into service date for new aircraft For additional disclosure on Commercial Systems segment results see Note 24 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 below.Commercial Systems Sales The following table presents Commercial Systems sales by product category and type of product or service: (in millions) 2012 2011 2010Air transport aviation electronics: Original equipment $574 $499 $439Aftermarket 474 431 380Wide body in flight entertainment 91 119 145Total air transport aviation electronics 1,139 1,049 964Business and regional aviation electronics: Original equipment 582 557 466Aftermarket 414 387 340Total business and regional aviation electronics 996 944 806Total $2,135 $1,993 $1,770Percent increase 7% 13% 29Commercial Systems Sales for 2012 compared to 2011Total air transport aviation electronics sales increased $90 million, or 9 percent, primarily due to the following:air transport OEM sales increased $75 million, or 15 percent, driven primarily by higher sales to Boeing and Airbus as they increased aircraft production rates across various platforms, including the Boeing 787 and 737 aircraft and the Airbus A320air transport aftermarket sales increased $43 million, or 10 percent. The increase was driven by higher spares revenues of $19 million, primarily for new Boeing 787 and 747 8 aircraft, and a $22 million increase in retrofit and service and support activitiesWide body IFE sales decreased $28 million, or 24 percent, due to the Companys strategic decision announced in 2005 to cease investment in this product area Total business and regional aviation electronics sales increased $52 million, or 6 percent, primarily due to the following:business and regional OEM sales increased $25 million, or 4 percent, primarily related to a $62 million increase in product deliveries for Bombardier Global, Cessna Citation and Gulfstream aircraft. This was partially offset by net reductions of $37 million, including a $27 million reduction in sales to Hawker Beechcraft who filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in May 2012, and lower sales to regional jet aircraft manufacturers as production rates declined for certain aircraftbusiness and regional aftermarket sales increased $27 million, or 7 percent, driven by the combined impact of higher retrofit and service and support activities. Retrofit sales increased as customers upgraded aircraft systems in order to gain operational efficiencies, improve performance and modernize the cabin Commercial Systems Sales for 2011 compared to 2010 Total air transport aviation electronics sales increased $85 million, or 9 percent, primarily due to the following:air transport OEM sales increased $60 million, or 14 percent, primarily from higher product deliveries to Boeing across multiple platforms, including Boeing 787 aircraft, and increased development effort on avionics packages for the new Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China, Ltd. (COMAC) C919 narrowbody aircraft air transport aftermarket sales increased $51 million, or 13 percent, primarily related to a $27 million increase in service and support sales and higher aftermarket hardware revenues of $24 million, driven by initial deliveries of spares for Boeing 747 8 aircraft and higher spare part sales to various airline customers as they restocked their inventories Wide body IFE sales decreased $26 million, or 18 percent, due to the Companys strategic decision announced in 2005 to cease investment in this product area Total business and regional aviation electronics sales increased $138 million, or 17 percent, primarily due to the following:business and regional OEM sales increased $91 million, or 20 percent, primarily due to $64 million of higher sales to Bombardier for Bombardier Global and Challenger 300 aircraft and $14 million of higher avionics sales to Cessna resulting from our new position on the CJ 4 aircraftbusiness and regional aftermarket sales increased $47 million, or 14 percent. Service and support revenues accounted for $17 million of the increase, driven by improved aircraft utilization. Higher spare parts revenues and increased sales of equipment for simulators primarily contributed an additional $18 million. The remaining increase of $12 million was primarily related to incremental sales from Air Routing and CTA acquisitions30Commercial Systems Segment Operating Earnings (in millions) 2012 2011 2010Segment operating earnings $440 $381 $287Percent of sales 20.6% 19.1% 16.2%Commercial Systems Operating Earnings for 2012 compared to 2011Commercial Systems operating earnings increased $59 million, or 15 percent, primarily due to the following:incremental earnings from higher sales volume totaled $61 million, at a variable gross margin of 43 percent, which reflects the impact of lower margins on our Boeing 787 program revenuespartially offset by a $10 million reduction to operating earnings due to the absence of favorable adjustments recorded in the prior year to reduce certain customer incentive reserves remaining variance of $8 million is primarily comprised of a net benefit from lower employee incentive compensation costs, partially offset by a $5 million bad debt charge recorded in the third quarter of fiscal year 2012 and higher warranty, employee medical and retirement benefit costs, as explained in the Cost of Sales section aboveThe increase in Commercial Systems operating earnings as a percent of sales was primarily due to the incremental earnings from higher sales volume. Commercial Systems Operating Earnings for 2011 compared to 2010Commercial Systems operating earnings increased $94 million, or 33 percent, primarily due to the following:$223 million sales increase discussed in the Commercial Systems sales section above resulted in a $109 million increase in costs and incremental operating earnings of $114 million, at a variable gross margin of 51 percent$18 million benefit to operating earnings related to a change in estimate recorded in 2011 to reduce the provision for certain customer incentivesabove items were partially offset by a $29 million reduction to operating earnings attributable to an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as discussed in the SG&A section above additional $9 million reduction to operating earnings resulted from higher company funded R&D expense, as explained in the Cost of Sales section aboveThe increase in Commercial Systems operating earnings as a percent of sales was primarily due to the incremental earnings from higher sales and the favorable impact of the adjustment to customer incentive reserves, partially offset by higher SG&A and company funded R&D expenses. General Corporate, Net General corporate expenses that are not allocated to our business segments are included in General corporate, net. These costs are included within Cost of sales, SG&A and Other Income, net on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. General corporate, net is summarized as follows:(in millions) 2012 2011 2010General corporate, net $42 $48 $54General corporate, net expense decreased $6 million during 2012 as compared to 2011 primarily due to a reduction in employee incentive compensation costs, as discussed in the SG&A section above. 31General corporate, net expense decreased $6 million during 2011 as compared to 2010 primarily due to a $13 million decrease in defined benefit pension expense that is described in the Retirement Plans section below, partially offset by a $7 million increase in certain SG&A costs, including employee incentive compensation, as discussed in the SG&A section above. Retirement PlansNet benefit expense (income) for pension benefits and other retirement benefits are as follows: (in millions)2012 2011 2010Pension benefits$(13) $(16) $26Other retirement benefits18 10 5Net benefit expense (income)$5 $(6) $31Pension BenefitsIn 2003, we amended our U.S. qualified and non qualified pension plans covering all salary and hourly employees not covered by collective bargaining agreements to discontinue benefit accruals for salary increases and services rendered after September 30, 2006. Concurrently, we replaced this benefit by supplementing our existing defined contribution savings plan to include an additional Company contribution effective October 1, 2006. The supplemental contribution to our existing defined contribution savings plan was $41 million, $39 million and $34 million for 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.Defined benefit pension expense (income) for the years ended September 30, 2012, 2011 and 2010 was $(13) million, $(16) million and $26 million, respectively. Pension costs did not change significantly in 2012 compared to 2011. The lower pension expense in 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily due to the change in amortization period of actuarial gains and losses. In 2010, we amortized actuarial gains and losses over the average remaining service period of active participants, or about 11 years. Beginning in 2011, the amortization of such amounts changed to over the expected future life expectancy of inactive participants, or about 28 years. This change in amortization period was attributable to the fact that almost all of the plans participants are now considered inactive due to the discontinuance of benefit accruals for most employees, as described above. During 2012, the funded status of our pension plans went from a deficit of $1,407 million at September 30, 2011 to a deficit of $1,466 million at September 30, 2012. This was primarily due to the adverse impact of a decrease in the discount rate used to measure our U.S. pension obligations from 4.43 percent at September 30, 2011 to 3.56 percent at September 30, 2012, partially offset by an increase in plan assets driven by improved market returns in 2012. During 2011, the funded status of our pension plans went from a deficit of $1,185 million at September 30, 2010 to a deficit of $1,407 million at September 30, 2011, primarily due to a decrease in the discount rate used to measure our U.S. pension obligations from 4.85 percent at September 30, 2010 to 4.43 percent at September 30, 2011. In addition, the funded status was adversely impacted by a reduction in plan assets during 2011.We expect defined benefit pension expense of $7 million in 2013, compared to $13 million of pension income in 2012. The expected $20 million increase in pension costs from 2012 to 2013 is primarily due to a decrease in our expected long term return on plan assets assumption, from 8.75 percent in 2012 to 8.25 percent in 2013. The higher anticipated pension cost for 2013 is also adversely impacted by an increase in the amortization of net actuarial losses, which are the result of declining discount rates over the past few years. Our objective with respect to the funding of our pension plans is to provide adequate assets for the payment of future benefits. Pursuant to this objective, we will fund our pension plans as required by governmental regulations and may consider discretionary contributions as conditions warrant. We believe our strong financial position continues to provide us the opportunity to make contributions to our pension fund without inhibiting our ability to pursue strategic investments.In October 2012, subsequent to our 2012 year end, we made a $55 million contribution to our U.S. qualified pension plan. We plan to contribute an additional $55 million in 2013 for a total $110 million contribution, which we anticipate will fully satisfy the minimum statutory funding requirements for 2013. Any additional future contributions necessary to satisfy the minimum statutory funding requirements are dependent upon actual plan asset returns and interest rates. We may elect to make additional discretionary contributions during 2013 to further improve the funded status of this plan. Contributions to our non U.S. plans and our U.S. non qualified plan are expected to total $14 million in 2013.32Other Retirement BenefitsWe have historically provided retiree medical and life insurance benefits to substantially all of our employees. We have undertaken two major actions over the past several years with respect to these benefits that have lowered both the current and future costs of providing these benefits:in July of 2002, the pre 65 and post 65 retiree medical plans were amended to discontinue benefits for employees hired after September 30, 2006 and establish a fixed Company contribution. Additional premium contributions will be required from participants for all costs in excess of this fixed contribution amount. This amendment eliminated the risk to us related to health care cost escalations for retiree medical benefits going forward as additional contributions will be required from retirees for all costs in excess of our fixed contribution amountas a result of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, we amended our retiree medical plans on June 30, 2004 to discontinue post 65 prescription drug coverage effective January 1, 2008. Post 65 retirees have the option of receiving these benefits through Medicare. We believe the Medicare prescription drug benefit is generally better than the benefit that was provided by our discontinued post 65 drug planOther retirement benefits expense for the years ended September 30, 2012, 2011 and 2010 was $18 million, $10 million and $5 million, respectively. We expect other retirement benefits expense of approximately $15 million in 2013. FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITYCash Flow SummaryOur ability to generate significant cash flow from operating activities coupled with our expected ability to access the credit markets enables us to execute our growth strategies and return value to our shareowners. The timing of our cash inflows is historically heavily weighted towards the second half of our fiscal year, particularly to our fourth quarter. We expect this trend to continue in the future. During 2012, we exercised the flexibility of our balance sheet and issued $250 million of 3.10 percent fixed rate unsecured debt. We used the proceeds from this debt, supplemented by available cash on hand, to make significant cash expenditures aimed at future growth and enhanced shareowner value, as shown below:$714 million of cash payments for share repurchases$138 million of capital expenditures$157 million of dividend paymentsIn addition, we also made $126 million of pension plan contributions. Operating Activities (in millions) 2012 2011 2010Cash provided by operating activities $534 $657 $711The $123 million decrease in cash provided by operating activities in 2012 compared to 2011 was primarily due to the following:cash receipts from customers decreased by $114 million to $4,685 million in 2012 compared to $4,799 million in 2011, primarily due to the lower sales volume in 2012 as discussed in the Results of Operations section above and lower collections of receivables from customers, partially offset by higher progress payments received in advance of revenue recognitionpayments for income taxes increased $112 million to $208 million in 2012 compared to $96 million in 2011 due to the differences in the timing of cash tax payments resulting from the retroactive extension of the Federal R&D tax credit 33that benefited the prior year and the expiration of the Federal R&D tax credit that increased cash payments in the current yearpayments for employee incentive pay increased $62 million. Incentive pay is expensed in the year it is incurred and paid in the first fiscal quarter of the following year. During 2012, $133 million was paid for employee incentive pay costs incurred during 2011 as compared to $71 million paid in 2011 for employee incentive pay costs incurred during 2010above items were partially offset by a decrease in payments for inventory and other operating costs of $206 million to $3,672 million in 2012 compared to $3,878 million in 2011. The decrease was primarily due to lower costs associated with the lower sales volume in 2012 discussed in the Results of Operations section aboveThe $54 million decrease in cash provided by operating activities in 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily due to the following:payments for inventory and other operating costs increased $237 million to $3,878 million in 2011 compared to $3,641 million in 2010. The increase was primarily due to increased costs associated with the higher sales volume in 2011 discussed in the Results of Operations section above and an increase in inventory, primarily driven by: higher pre production engineering costs resulting from increased effort on programs such as the Airbus A350, various Bombardier platforms in the business jet market, and several international rotary and fixed wing programs within Government Systems additional increases to inventory resulting from the adverse impact of delayed funding authorizations from the U.S. Government, an increase to accommodate a transitional period of relocating certain production effort to other existing facilities and higher purchases of component parts to mitigate supply chain risks after the earthquake and tsunami in Japanpayments for employee incentive pay increased $71 million. Incentive pay is expensed in the year it is incurred and paid in the first fiscal quarter of the following year. During 2011, $71 million was paid for employee incentive pay costs incurred during 2010. No incentive pay costs were incurred for the full year 2009; accordingly, there was no 2010 payment for incentive payabove items were partially offset by an increase in cash receipts from customers of $212 million to $4,799 million in 2011 compared to $4,587 million in 2010, primarily due to the higher sales volume in 2011 as discussed in the Results of Operations section above and higher collections of receivables from customers, including higher progress payments received in advance of revenue recognitionpayments for income taxes decreased $29 million to $96 million in 2011 compared to $125 million in 2010 primarily due to the timing of cash tax payments related to the retroactive extension of the Federal R&D Tax creditIn 2013 cash provided by operating activities is expected to be in the range of $500 million to $600 million. The projected range of cash provided by operating activities accommodates a $110 million expected contribution to our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan and a projected $210 million net increase in pre production engineering costs. We expect a majority of the projected 2013 operating cash flow to be generated in the second half of our fiscal year.Investing Activities (in millions) 2012 2011 2010Cash used for investing activities $(129) $(92) $(232)The $37 million increase in cash used for investing activities in 2012 compared to 2011 was primarily due to the following:cash proceeds received from the dispositions of property and businesses decreased by $44 million. The majority of this decrease is due to the absence of the Rollmet divestiture which occurred in 2011the absence of proceeds of $20 million in 2011 from the sale of a short term investment at a non U.S. subsidiary34partially offset by:lower payments for the acquisition of businesses of $17 million. In 2012, there were no business acquisitions as compared to $17 million in payments in 2011 for the acquisitions of Blue Ridge Simulation, Inc. and Computing Technologies for Aviation, Inc. a $14 million decrease in capital expendituresThe $140 million reduction in cash used for investing activities in 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily due to the following:in 2011 we received $44 million in proceeds from the divestiture of the Rollmet business and $14 million in proceeds from the disposition of property compared to $1 million received from the disposition of property in 2010in 2011 we acquired Blue Ridge Simulation, Inc. and Computing Technologies for Aviation, Inc. for $17 million compared to the 2010 acquisition of Air Routing for $91 millionwe received $20 million from the sale of a short term investment at a non U.S. subsidiary in 2011 which was purchased for $21 million in 2010above items were partially offset by a $43 million increase in property additionsFinancing Activities(in millions) 2012 2011 2010Cash used for financing activities $(594) $(471) $(279)The $123 million increase in cash used for financing activities in 2012 compared to 2011 was primarily due to the following:cash repurchases of common stock increased $386 million to $714 million in 2012 from $328 million in 2011partially offset by:net proceeds of $247 million from the issuance of long term debt in November of 2011absence of a $24 million repayment of short term debt at a non U.S. subsidiary that occurred during 2011The $192 million increase in cash used for financing activities in 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily due to the following:cash repurchases of common stock increased $145 million to $328 million in 2011 from $183 million in 2010repayment of short term borrowings increased by $24 million in 2011 as short term debt of $24 million outstanding at the end of 2010 was repaid during 2011 cash proceeds from stock option exercises decreased $16 million to $22 million in 2011 from $38 million in 2010Share Repurchase ProgramCash flow from operations and the issuance of $250 million of 3.10 percent fixed rate debt in 2012 provided funds for repurchasing our common stock under our share repurchase program as follows:(in millions, except per share amounts) 2012 2011 2010Amount of share repurchases $723 $322 $182Number of shares repurchased 13.3 5.5 3.2Weighted average price per share $54.41 $58.50 $57.5035Approximately $16 million and $0 of the 2012 and 2011 share repurchases reflected in the table above are included within accounts payable at September 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively, and are reflected as a non cash transaction in our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.DividendsWe declared and paid cash dividends of $157 million, $148 million and $151 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Based on our current dividend policy, we will pay quarterly cash dividends which, on an annual basis, will equal $1.20 per share. We expect to fund dividends using cash generated from operations. The declaration and payment of future dividends is at the sole discretion of the Board of Directors.Financial Condition and LiquidityWe have historically maintained a capital structure characterized by conservative levels of debt outstanding that enables us sufficient access to credit markets. When combined with our ability to generate strong levels of cash flow from our operations, this capital structure provides the strength and flexibility necessary to pursue strategic growth opportunities and to return value to our shareowners. A comparison of key elements of our financial condition as of September 30, 2012 and 2011 are as follows: September 30(in millions)2012 2011Cash and cash equivalents$335 $530Long term debt, net(779) (528)Net debt (1)$(444) $2Total equity$1,264 $1,528Debt to total capitalization (2)38% 26 %Net debt to total capitalization (3)26% %(1)Calculated as total of long term debt, net (Total debt), less cash and cash equivalents (2)Calculated as Total debt divided by the sum of Total debt plus Total equity(3)Calculated as Net debt divided by the sum of Net debt plus Total equityWe primarily fund our contractual obligations, capital expenditures, small to medium sized acquisitions, dividends and share repurchases from cash generated from operating activities. As of September 30, 2012, approximately 75 percent of our cash and cash equivalents resides at non U.S. locations and may not be readily accessible for use in the U.S. due to potential adverse income tax implications and other statutory limitations. Due to the fluctuations of cash flows, we supplement our internally generated cash flow from time to time by issuing short term commercial paper. Under our commercial paper program, we may sell up to $850 million face amount of unsecured short term promissory notes in the commercial paper market. The commercial paper notes have maturities of not more than 364 days from the date of issuance. At September 30, 2012 and September 30, 2011, there were no short term commercial paper borrowings outstanding. The maximum amount of short term borrowings outstanding during 2012 was $330 million and the maximum amount outstanding during 2011 was $345 million.In the event our access to the commercial paper markets is impaired, we have access to an $850 million Revolving Credit Facility through a network of banks that matures in 2016, with options to further extend the term for up to two one year periods and or increase the aggregate principal amount up to $1.2 billion. These options are subject to the approval of the lenders. Our only financial covenant under the Revolving Credit Facility requires that we maintain a consolidated debt to total capitalization ratio of not greater than 60 percent, excluding the accumulated other comprehensive loss equity impact related to defined benefit retirement plans. Our debt to total capitalization ratio at September 30, 2012 based on this financial covenant was 21 percent. We had no borrowings at September 30, 2012 under our Revolving Credit Facility.36In addition, alternative sources of liquidity could include funds available from the issuance of equity securities, debt securities and potential asset securitization strategies. To date, we have not raised capital through the issuance of equity securities as we prefer to use debt financing to lower our overall cost of capital and increase our return on shareowners equity. Credit ratings are a significant factor in determining our ability to access short term and long term financing as well as the cost of such financing in terms of interest rates. Our strong credit ratings have enabled continued access to both short and long term credit markets. If our credit ratings were to be adjusted downward by the rating agencies, the implications of such actions could include impairment or elimination of our access to credit markets and an increase in the cost of borrowing. The following is a summary of our credit ratings as of September 30, 2012: Credit Rating Agency Short Term Rating Long Term Rating OutlookFitch Ratings F1 A StableMoodys Investors Service P 1 A1 NegativeStandard & Poors A 1 A StableWe were in compliance with all debt covenants at September 30, 2012 and September 30, 2011.Off balance Sheet ArrangementsAs of September 30, 2012, other than operating leases, we had no material off balance sheet arrangements, including guarantees, retained or contingent interests in assets transferred to unconsolidated entities, derivative instruments indexed to our stock and classified in shareowners equity on our Consolidated Statement of Financial Position or variable interests in entities that provide financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to our Company.Contractual ObligationsThe following table summarizes certain of our contractual obligations as of September 30, 2012, as well as when these obligations are expected to be satisfied.

See Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 below.We lease certain office and manufacturing facilities as well as certain machinery and equipment under various lease contracts with terms that meet the accounting definition of operating leases. Our commitments under these operating leases, in the form of non cancelable future lease payments, are not reflected as a liability on our Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.Purchase obligations include purchase orders and purchase contracts. Purchase orders are executed in the normal course of business and may or may not be cancelable. Purchase contracts include agreements with suppliers under which there is a commitment to buy a minimum amount of products or pay a specified amount regardless of actual need. Generally, items represented in purchase obligations are not reflected as liabilities on our Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.The table excludes obligations with respect to pension and other post retirement benefit plans (see Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 below). We plan to contribute $110 million to our U.S. qualified pension plan in 2013, which will fully satisfy the minimum statutory funding requirements for 2013. In October 2012, subsequent to fiscal year 37end, $55 million of this amount was contributed to the plan. For years beyond 2013, the actual amounts required to be contributed to our U.S. qualified pension plan are dependent upon, among other things, interest rates and underlying asset returns. With the exception of certain bargaining unit plans, payments due under other post retirement benefit plans are funded as the expenses are incurred. In addition, the table excludes liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits, which totaled $42 million at September 30, 2012, as we cannot reasonably estimate the ultimate timing of cash settlements to the respective taxing authorities (see Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 below).The following table reflects certain of our commercial commitments as of September 30, 2012: Amount of Commitment Expiration by Period(in millions) TotalAmountCommitted Less than1 Year 1 3Years 4 5Years ThereafterLetters of credit* $71 $57 $13 $1 $* See Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 below for a discussion of letters of credit.In addition to the obligations disclosed above, we occasionally enter into offset agreements, required by certain customers in some non U.S. countries, as a condition to obtaining contract awards for our products and services. These agreements, which generally extend over several years, are customary in our industry and are designed to enhance the social and economic environment of the country in which our customers operate. These commitments may be satisfied through activities that do not require us to use cash, including transfer of technology, providing manufacturing and other consulting support to in country projects, strategic alliances and transactions conducted by third parties (e.g., our vendors). These agreements may also be satisfied through our use of cash for activities such as placement of direct work or vendor orders for supplies and or services, building or leasing facilities for in country operations, in country employment of a non U.S. countrys citizens and other forms of assistance in the applicable country. The offset rules and regulations, as well as the underlying contracts, may differ from one country to another. We typically do not commit to offset agreements until contract awards for our products or services are definitive. Should we be unable to meet the offset obligations we may be subject to contractual penalties, and our chances of receiving additional business from the applicable customers could be reduced or, in certain cases, eliminated. We historically have not been required to pay material penalties related to offset obligations and are currently in compliance with our offset commitments.At September 30, 2012, we had outstanding offset obligations totaling approximately $237 million that extend through 2021. The amounts ultimately applied against our offset requirements are based on negotiations with the customer and the cost to fulfill the obligation is typically only a fraction of the original obligation above.

We believe the following accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are critical to our financial condition and results of operations as they involve a significant use of management judgment on matters that are inherently uncertain. If actual results differ significantly from managements estimates, there could be a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Management regularly discusses the identification and development of these critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.Accounting for Long Term ContractsA substantial portion of our sales to government customers and certain of our sales to commercial customers are made pursuant to long term contracts requiring development and delivery of products over several years and often contain fixed price purchase options for additional products. Certain of these contracts are accounted for under the percentage of completion method of accounting. Sales and earnings under the percentage of completion method are recorded either as products are shipped under the units of delivery method (for production effort), or based on the ratio of actual costs incurred to total estimated costs expected to be incurred related to the contract under the cost to cost method (for development effort). Approximately 20 percent of our sales are accounted for under the percentage of completion method of accounting. The percentage of completion method of accounting requires management to estimate the profit margin for each individual contract and to apply that profit margin on a uniform basis as sales are recorded under the contract. The estimation of profit margins requires management to make projections of the total sales to be generated and the total costs that will be incurred under a contract. These projections require management to make numerous assumptions and estimates relating to items such as the complexity of design and related development costs, performance of subcontractors, availability and cost of materials, labor productivity and cost, overhead and capital costs and manufacturing efficiency. These contracts often include purchase options for additional quantities and customer change orders for additional or revised product functionality. Sales and costs related to profitable purchase options are included in our estimates only when the options are exercised while sales and costs related to unprofitable purchase options are included in our estimates when exercise is determined to be probable. Sales related to change orders are included in profit estimates only if they can be reliably estimated and collectability is reasonably assured. Purchase options and change orders are accounted for either as an integral part of the original contract or separately depending upon the nature and value of the item. Anticipated losses on contracts are recognized in full in the period in which losses become probable and estimable.Estimates of profit margins for contracts are typically reviewed by management on a quarterly basis. Assuming the initial estimates of sales and costs under a contract are accurate, the percentage of completion method results in the profit margin being recorded evenly as revenue is recognized under the contract. Changes in these underlying estimates due to revisions in sales and cost estimates, the combining of contracts or the exercise of contract options may result in profit margins being recognized unevenly over a contract as such changes are accounted for on a cumulative basis in the period estimates are revised. Cumulative catch up adjustments resulting from changes in estimates did not have a material effect on our results of operations during the years ended September 30, 2012, 2011 or 2010. Program InvestmentsWe defer certain pre production engineering costs in Inventories, net and record up front sales incentives in Intangible Assets (collectively referred to as Program Investments). These Program Investments are amortized over their estimated useful lives, up to a maximum of 15 years. Estimated useful lives are limited to the amount of time we are virtually assured to earn revenues through a contractually enforceable right included in long term supply arrangements with our customers. This provides the best matching of expense over the related period of benefit. The following provides an overview of the Program Investments: September 30(in millions) 2012 2011Pre production engineering costs $569 $446Up front sales incentives 186 173Total Program Investments $755 $619We defer the cost of certain pre production engineering costs incurred during the development phase of a program in connection with long term supply arrangements that contain contractual guarantees for reimbursement from customers. These customer guarantees generally take the form of a minimum order quantity with quantified reimbursement amounts if the 39minimum order quantity is not taken by the customer. These costs are deferred in Inventories, net to the extent of the contractual guarantees and are amortized over their estimated useful lives using a units of delivery method, up to 15 years. This amortization expense is included as a component of cost of sales. Amortization is based on our expectation of delivery rates on a program by program basis and begins when we start recognizing revenue as we deliver equipment for the program. The estimated useful life is limited to the amount of time we are virtually assured to earn revenues through a contractually enforceable right included in long term supply arrangements with our customers. Pre production engineering costs in excess of the contractual guarantee, and costs incurred pursuant to supply arrangements that do not contain customer guarantees for reimbursement, are expensed as incurred.We also provide up front sales incentives prior to delivering products or performing services to certain commercial customers in connection with sales contracts. Up front sales incentives are recorded as a customer relationship intangible asset and are amortized using a units of delivery method over the period we have received a contractually enforceable right related to the incentives, up to 15 years. Amortization is based on our expectation of delivery rates on a program by program basis. Amortization begins when we start recognizing revenue as we deliver equipment for the program. Up front sales incentives consisting of cash payments or customer account credits are amortized as a reduction of sales, whereas incentives consisting of free products are amortized as cost of sales.Risks inherent in recovering the value of our Program Investments include, but are not limited to, the following:changes in market conditions may affect product sales under a program. In particular, the commercial aerospace market has been historically cyclical and subject to downturns during periods of weak economic conditions, which could be prompted or exacerbated by political or other domestic or international eventsbankruptcy or other significant financial difficulties of our customersour ability to produce products could be impacted by the performance of subcontractors, the availability of specialized materials and other production risksAs of September 30, 2012, Intangible assets include $14 million of up front sales incentives related to Hawker Beechcraft, Inc., who declared bankruptcy in 2012. We currently estimate this balance to be recoverable. We evaluate the carrying amount of Program Investments for recovery at least annually or when potential indicators of impairment exist, such as a change in the estimated number of products to be delivered under a program. No impairment charges related to Program Investments were recorded in 2012, 2011 or 2010. While we believe our Program Investments are recoverable over time, the cancellation of a program by a customer would represent the most significant impairment factor related to Program Investments. Due to the long term nature of the procurement cycle and the significant investment required to bring a program to market in the aerospace and defense industry, we believe the likelihood of a customer abruptly canceling a program is remote. We also evaluate our amortization of Program Investments quarterly based on our expectation of delivery rates on a program by program basis. The impact of changes in expected delivery rates on the Program Investments amortization is adjusted as needed on a prospective basis. There were no significant changes in the rate of Program Investment amortization and no significant cumulative adjustments recorded in 2012, 2011 and 2010.Amortization expense for pre production engineering costs and up front sales incentives for 2012, 2011 and 2010 was as follows:(in millions)2012 2011 2010Amortization of pre production engineering$18 $15 $15Amortization of up front sales incentives9 6 4Total amortization of Program Investments$27 $21 $1940As disclosed in Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the weighted average amortization period for pre production engineering costs is approximately ten years. As disclosed in Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the weighted average amortization period for up front sales incentives is approximately nine years. Anticipated amortization expense for Program Investments for fiscal years 2013 and beyond is summarized below: (in millions)2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 ThereafterAnticipated amortization expense for pre production engineering costs$26 $42 $59 $70 $77 $295Anticipated amortization expense for up front sales incentives8 14 20 26 22 96Total anticipated amortization for Program Investments$34 $56 $79 $96 $99 $391Pre production engineering costs comprise 43 percent of our total Inventory balance at September 30, 2012, compared to 37 percent in the prior year. Pre production engineering costs increased $123 million from September 30, 2011 to September 30, 2012. The majority of this increase was attributable to a $104 million increase within Commercial Systems, driven by increased spending on programs with Bombardier and Airbus. The remaining increase of $19 million was within Government Systems. Additionally, up front sales incentives to Commercial Systems customers increased $13 million from September 30, 2011 to September 30, 2012. Growth in our Program Investments continues to be driven by the expanded market share our Company successfully captured over the past several years. Commercial Systems has secured positions on several key platforms in the air transport market, including the Boeing 787, Boeing 747 8 and Airbus A350. In the business and regional jet market, our Pro Line Fusion avionics system has been selected by customers around the globe, including Bombardier, Embraer and Gulfstream. Our customers have provided us a contractual guarantee for reimbursement on several of these programs; as such, our capitalized pre production engineering costs have increased for these programs as the Company continues development efforts. Our Government Systems business has also contributed to the growth in pre production engineering costs, as we ramp up efforts on several international rotary and fixed wing programs that we recently won. We expect the long term supply arrangements resulting from these recent program wins to deliver significant revenues and profits to us over the next several years, continuing over the life of the aircraft platforms (which can range from ten to twenty years); as such, we believe our Program Investments are recoverable. We expect the balance of our capitalized Program Investment costs will continue to increase over the next several years. Looking forward to 2013, we expect pre production engineering costs to increase approximately $210 million, primarily within Commercial Systems. We primarily fund our Program Investments with cash generated from operating activities. Our 2013 guidance for cash provided by operating activities accommodates the anticipated increase in pre production engineering costs. Income TaxesAt the end of each quarterly reporting period, we estimate an effective income tax rate that is expected to be applicable for the full fiscal year. The estimate of our effective income tax rate involves significant judgments resulting from uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations across many jurisdictions, implementation of tax planning strategies and estimates as to the jurisdictions where income is expected to be earned. These estimates may be further complicated by new laws, new interpretations of existing laws and rulings by taxing authorities. Due to the subjectivity and complex nature of these underlying issues, our actual effective income tax rate and related tax liabilities may differ from our initial estimates. Differences between our estimated and actual effective income tax rates and related liabilities are recorded in the period they become known or as our estimates are revised based on additional information. The resulting adjustment to our income tax expense could have a material effect on our results of operations in the period the adjustment is recorded. A one percentage point change in our effective income tax rate would change our annual income from continuing operations by approximately $9 million.Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for tax carryforwards and the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and income tax purposes. The future realization of our deferred tax assets ultimately depends on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character (for example, ordinary income or capital gains) within the carryback and carryforward periods available under the tax law and, to a lesser extent, our ability to execute successful tax planning strategies. Management believes it is more likely than not that the current and long term deferred tax assets will be realized through the reduction of future taxable income, except for deferred tax assets which have been fully reserved and primarily relate to foreign net operating losses. A change in the ability of our 41operations to continue to generate future taxable income, or our ability to implement desired tax planning strategies, could affect our ability to realize the future tax deductions underlying our net deferred tax assets, and require us to provide a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets. The recognition of a valuation allowance would result in a reduction to net income and if significant, could have a material impact on our effective tax rate, results of operations and financial position in any given period.As part of the determination of our tax liability, management exercises considerable judgment in evaluating tax positions taken by us in determining the income tax provision and establishes reserves for tax contingencies in accordance with the Income Taxes topic of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. See Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 below for further detail regarding unrecognized tax benefits, deferred taxes and the factors considered in evaluating deferred tax asset realization.GoodwillAs of September 30, 2012, we had $780 million of goodwill related to various business acquisitions. We perform impairment tests on goodwill on an annual basis during the second quarter of each fiscal year, or on an interim basis if events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that impairment has occurred.Goodwill is potentially impaired if the carrying value of the reporting unit that contains the goodwill exceeds its estimated fair value. The fair values of our reporting units are determined using a combination of an income approach, which estimates fair value based upon future discounted cash flows, and a market approach, which estimates fair value using market multiples, ratios and valuations of a set of comparable public companies within our industry.The valuation methodology and underlying financial information that is used to estimate the fair value of our reporting units requires significant judgments to be made by management. These judgments include, but are not limited to, the long term projections of future financial performance and the selection of appropriate discount rates used to present value future cash flows. Our five year strategic operating plan serves as the basis for these valuations and represents our best estimate of future business conditions in our industry as well as our ability to compete. Discount rates are determined based upon the weighted average cost of capital for a set of comparable companies adjusted for risks associated with our different operations. Our goodwill impairment tests that were performed in the second quarter of 2012, 2011 and 2010 yielded no impairments. In addition, based upon the results of our 2012 impairment testing, none of our reporting units were at risk of their carrying value of net assets exceeding their respective fair value. If there were a significant downturn in our business, we could incur a goodwill impairment.WarrantyAccrued liabilities are recorded on our Consolidated Statement of Financial Position to reflect our contractual obligations relating to warranty commitments to our customers. We provide warranty coverage of various lengths and terms to our customers depending on standard offerings and negotiated contractual agreements. We record an estimate for warranty expense at the time of sale based on historical warranty return rates and repair costs. We believe our primary source of warranty risk relates to extended warranty terms. As shown in Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 below, the carrying amount of accrued product warranty costs has declined $91 million from a balance of $217 million at September 30, 2009, to a balance of $126 million at September 30, 2012. This trend is driven by a variety of factors. Approximately $40 million of the decline from 2009 to 2012 is attributable to the Commercial Systems business. A primary source of warranty risk for Commercial Systems in the past related to sales of wide body in flight entertainment products and systems. As discussed in the Commercial Systems Results of Operations section above, sales related to Wide body IFE have declined significantly over the past several years due to the Companys previously announced decision to cease investing in this product area. As sales volumes related to Wide body IFE continue to decline and warranty periods on these legacy products expire, our warranty reserve balance has also been reduced. Product reliability improvements have also favorably impacted incurred warranty costs within Commercial Systems, contributing to a lower warranty reserve.The remaining decrease in our accrued warranty balance from 2009 to 2012 is primarily attributable to certain favorable adjustments recorded by Government Systems in 2012, 2011 and 2010 to reduce warranty reserves for changes in estimate, as shown in Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 below. These reductions were driven by the completion of certain Government Systems programs that no longer require a warranty and a favorable impact from lower than anticipated repair costs across various product areas.42Should future warranty experience differ materially from our historical experience, we may be required to record additional warranty liabilities which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows in the period in which these additional liabilities are required.Pension BenefitsWe historically provided retirement benefits to most of our employees in the form of defined benefit pension plans. Accounting standards require the cost of providing these pension plans be measured on an actuarial basis. These accounting standards will generally reduce, but not eliminate, the volatility of pension expense as actuarial gains and losses resulting from both normal year to year changes in valuation assumptions and the differences from actual experience are deferred and amortized. The application of these accounting standards requires management to make numerous assumptions and judgments that can significantly affect these measurements. Critical assumptions made by management in performing these actuarial valuations include the selection of discount rates and expectations on the future rate of return on pension plan assets.Discount rates are used to determine the present value of our pension obligations and also affect the amount of pension expense recorded in any given period. We estimate this discount rate based on the rates of return of high quality, fixed income investments with maturity dates that reflect the expected time horizon that benefits will be paid (see Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 below). Changes in the discount rate could have a material effect on our reported pension obligations and would also impact the related pension expense.The expected rate of return is our estimate of the long term earnings rate on our pension plan assets and is based upon both historical long term actual and expected future investment returns considering the current investment mix of plan assets. Differences between the actual and expected rate of return on plan assets can impact our expense for pension benefits. In 2013, we are reducing our expected rate of return on plan assets by 50 basis points, down to 8.25 percent from the 8.75 percent used in 2012. This reduction in our expected rate of return assumption will serve to increase pension costs in 2013. Holding all other factors constant, the estimated impact on 2012 pension income and pension benefit obligation for our U.S. plans caused by hypothetical changes to key assumptions is as follows: (in millions) Change in AssumptionAssumption 25 Basis Point Increase 25 Basis Point DecreasePension obligation discount rate $105 pension projected benefit obligation decrease $108 pension projected benefit obligation increaseExpected long term rate of return on plan assets $6 additional pension income $6 decrease to pension incomeAs disclosed in Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 below, beginning in 2011, actuarial gains and losses (including those resulting from a change in the pension obligation discount rate) are amortized over the expected future life expectancy of inactive participants, or about 28 years. In 2010, actuarial gains and losses were amortized over the average remaining service period of active participants, or about 11 years. This change in pension amortization period was the primary factor impacting the $42 million decrease in pension expense from 2010 to 2011. This change in amortization period also resulted in our pension expense (income) being less sensitive to changes in the discount rate assumption. An increase or decrease of 25 basis points in the pension obligation discount rate would impact 2012 pension income by less than $2 million. Inventory Valuation ReservesInventory valuation reserves are recorded in order to report inventories at the lower of cost or market value on our Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. The determination of inventory valuation reserves requires management to make estimates and judgments on the future salability of inventories. Valuation reserves for excess, obsolete and slow moving inventory are estimated by comparing the inventory levels of individual parts to both future sales forecasts or production requirements and historical usage rates in order to identify inventory that is unlikely to be sold above cost. Other factors that management considers in determining these reserves include overall market conditions and other inventory management initiatives. Management can generally react to reduce the likelihood of severe excess and slow moving inventory issues by changing purchasing behavior, although abrupt changes in market conditions can limit our ability to react quickly.43Management believes its primary source of risk for excess and obsolete inventory is derived from life time buy inventory. Life time buy inventory consists of inventory that is typically no longer being produced by our vendors but for which we purchase multiple years of supply in order to meet production and service requirements over the life span of a product. Total life time buy inventory on hand at September 30, 2012 was $100 million.Excluding pre production engineering costs and progress payments, we had $851 million of gross inventory on hand at September 30, 2012 with $86 million of inventory valuation reserves. Although management believes these reserves are adequate, any abrupt changes in market conditions may require us to record additional inventory valuation reserves which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which these additional reserves are required. Pre production engineering costs are discussed in the "Program Investments" section of our Critical Accounting Policies above.Item 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.Interest Rate RiskIn addition to using cash provided by normal operating activities, we utilize a combination of short term and long term debt to finance operations. Our operating results and cash flows are exposed to changes in interest rates that could adversely affect the amount of interest expense incurred and paid on debt obligations in any given period. In addition, changes in interest rates can affect the fair value of our debt obligations. Such changes in fair value are only relevant to the extent these debt obligations are settled prior to maturity. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk by maintaining an appropriate mix of fixed and variable rate debt and when considered necessary, we may employ financial instruments in the form of interest rate swaps to help meet this objective.At September 30, 2012, we had $200 million of 4.75 percent fixed rate long term debt obligations outstanding with a carrying value of $200 million and a fair value of $210 million. In November 2003 we converted $100 million of this fixed rate debt to floating rate debt bearing interest at six month LIBOR less .075 percent by executing receive fixed, pay variable interest rate swap contracts. At September 30, 2012, we also had $300 million of 5.25 percent fixed rate long term debt obligations outstanding with a carrying value of $299 million and a fair value of $363 million. In January 2010 we converted $150 million of this fixed rate debt to floating rate debt based on six month LIBOR plus 1.235 percent. Finally, at September 30, 2012, we had $250 million of 3.10 percent fixed rate unsecured long term debt with a carrying value of $249 million and a fair value of $264 million.A hypothetical 10 percent increase or decrease in average market interest rates would have decreased or increased the fair value of our long term fixed rate debt, exclusive of the effects of the interest rate swap contracts, by $7 million. The fair value of the $250 million notional value of interest rate swap contracts was a $31 million net asset at September 30, 2012. A hypothetical 10 percent increase or decrease in average market interest rates would decrease or increase the fair value of our interest rate swap contracts by $1 million. Our results of operations are affected by changes in market interest rates related to variable rate debt. Inclusive of the effect of the interest rate swaps, a hypothetical 10 percent increase or decrease in average market interest rates would not have a material effect on our operations or cash flows. For more information related to outstanding debt obligations and derivative financial instruments, see Notes 10, 17 and 18 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 below.Foreign Currency RiskWe transact business in various foreign currencies which subjects our cash flows and earnings to exposure related to changes to foreign currency exchange rates. We attempt to manage this exposure through operational strategies and the use of foreign currency forward exchange contracts (foreign currency contracts). All foreign currency contracts are executed with banks we believe to be creditworthy and are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries. The majority of our non functional currency firm and anticipated receivables and payables are hedged using foreign currency contracts. It is our policy not to manage exposure to net investments in non U.S. subsidiaries or enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. Notional amounts of outstanding foreign currency forward exchange contracts were $393 million and $502 million at September 30, 2012 and September 30, 2011, respectively. Notional amounts are stated in U.S. dollar equivalents at spot exchange rates at the respective dates. Principal currencies that are hedged include the European euro, British pound sterling and Japanese yen. The duration of foreign currency contracts is generally five years or less. The net fair value of these foreign currency contracts was a net asset of $2 million and $1 million at September 30, 2012 and September 30, 2011, respectively. A 10 percent increase or decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar against all currencies would decrease or increase the fair value of our foreign currency contracts at September 30, 2012 by $8 million. For more information related to outstanding currency forward exchange contracts, see Notes 17 and 18 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 below.44
