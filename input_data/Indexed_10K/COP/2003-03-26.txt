RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CONOCO AND PHILLIPS MERGER On August 30, 2002, Conoco Inc. (Conoco) and Phillips Petroleum Company (Phillips) combined their businesses by merging with wholly owned subsidiaries of a new company named ConocoPhillips (the merger). The merger was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. Although the business combination of Conoco and Phillips was a merger of equals, generally accepted accounting principles required that one of the two companies in the transaction be designated as the acquirer for accounting purposes. Phillips was designated as the acquirer based on the fact that its former common stockholders initially held more than 50 percent of the ConocoPhillips common stock after the merger. Because Phillips was designated as the acquirer, its operations and results are presented in this annual report for all periods prior to the close of the merger. From the merger date forward, the operations and results of ConocoPhillips reflect the combined operations of the two companies. As a condition of the merger, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) required that the company divest specified Conoco and Phillips assets, the most significant of which were Phillips Woods Cross, Utah, refinery and associated motor fuel marketing operations; Conocos Commerce City, Colorado, refinery and related crude oil pipelines and Phillips Colorado motor fuel marketing operations. All assets and operations that are required by the FTC to be divested are included in Corporate and Other as discontinued operations. Included in the results of discontinued operations in 2002 was a $69 million after tax charge for the write down to fair value of the Phillips operations to be disposed. Because the Conoco assets to be disposed of were recorded at fair value in the purchase price allocation, no further write downs were required. Discontinued operations also include other, non FTC mandated assets held for sale. See Note 4 Discontinued Operations in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information, including a complete list of assets required by the FTC to be divested. As a result of the merger, the company implemented a restructuring program in September 2002 to capture the synergies of combining Phillips and Conoco by eliminating redundancies, consolidating assets, and sharing common services and functions across regions. The restructuring program that was implemented in September 2002 is expected to be completed by the end of February 2004 and, through December 31, 36 2002, approximately 2,900 positions worldwide, most of which are in the United States, had been identified for elimination. Of this total, 775 employees were terminated by December 31, 2002. Associated with implementation of the restructuring program, ConocoPhillips accrued $770 million for merger related restructuring and work force reduction liabilities in 2002. These liabilities primarily represent estimated termination payments and related employee benefits associated with the reduction in positions. These liabilities include $337 million related to Conoco operations, which was reflected in the purchase price allocation as an assumed liability, and $422 million ($253 million after tax) related to Phillips operations that was charged to selling, general and administrative, and production and operating expenses; and $11 million before tax included in discontinued operations. Of the above accruals, $598 million related primarily to severance benefits. Payments will be made to former Conoco and Phillips employees under each companys respective severance plans. During 2002, payments of $223 million were made, resulting in a year end 2002 severance accrual balance of $375 million. Also related to the merger and recorded in 2002 was a $246 million write off of acquired in process research and development costs related to Conocos natural gas to liquids and other technologies. In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 4, "Applicability of FASB Statement No. 2 to Business Combinations Accounted for by the Purchase Method," value assigned to research and development activities in the purchase price allocation that have no alternative future use should be charged to expense at the date of the consummation of the combination. The $246 million charge was recorded in the Emerging Businesses segment and was the same on both a before tax and after tax basis. ConocoPhillips also accrued $22 million, after tax, in 2002 for change in control costs associated with seismic contracts as a result of the merger. The expense was recorded in Corporate and Other and did not impact exploration expenses. In addition, the 2002 net loss also included transition costs of $36 million, bringing total after tax merger related costs to $557 million. See Note 3 Merger of Conoco and Phillips in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the merger. CONSOLIDATED RESULTS Millions of Dollars Years Ended December 31 2002 2001 2000 Income from continuing operations $ 714 1,611 1,848 Income (loss) from discontinued operations (993) 32 14 Extraordinary items (16) (10) Cumulative effect of accounting changes 28 Net income (loss) $ (295) 1,661 1,862 37 A summary of the companys net income (loss) by business segment follows: Millions of Dollars Years Ended December 31 2002 2001 2000 Exploration and Production (E&P) $ 1,749 1,699 1,945 Midstream 55 120 162 Refining and Marketing (R&M) 143 397 238 Chemicals (14) (128) (46) Emerging Businesses (310) (12) Corporate and Other* (1,918) (415) (437) Net income (loss) $ (295) 1,661 1,862 *Includes income (loss) from discontinued operations of: $ (993) 32 14 2002 vs. 2001 ConocoPhillips incurred a net loss of $295 million in 2002, compared with net income of $1,661 million in 2001. The decrease was primarily attributable to recognizing impairments and loss accruals totaling $1,077 million after tax associated with the companys retail and wholesale marketing operations that were classified as discontinued operations in late 2002, as well as merger related costs totaling $557 million after tax. Also negatively impacting results for 2002 were asset impairments totaling $192 million after tax, lower refining margins, lower natural gas sales prices, decreased equity earnings from Duke Energy Field Services, LLC (DEFS), and higher interest expenses. These factors were partially offset by improved results from Chemicals and higher production volumes in E&P after the merger. 2001 vs. 2000 ConocoPhillips net income was $1,661 million in 2001, an 11 percent decline from net income of $1,862 million in 2000. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower crude oil and natural gas liquids prices and lower results from the Chemicals business, partially offset by improved petroleum products margins, as well as the acquisition of Tosco Corporation (Tosco) in September 2001. See Note 6 Acquisition of Tosco Corporation in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the acquisition. Also contributing to the lower results in 2001 was a decrease in the amount of gains on asset sales, compared with 2000, partially offset by lower property impairments in 2001. INCOME STATEMENT ANALYSIS 2002 vs. 2001 In addition to the merger discussed previously, ConocoPhillips closed on the $7 billion acquisition of Tosco on September 14, 2001. Together, these transactions significantly increased operating revenues, purchase costs, operating expenses and other income statement line items. See Note 3 Merger of Conoco and Phillips and Note 6 Acquisition of Tosco Corporation in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 38 Sales and other operating revenues increased 128 percent in 2002. The increase was primarily attributable to increased product sales volumes due to the impact of the Tosco acquisition and the merger. These items were partially offset by lower natural gas sales prices in 2002 compared with 2001. Equity in earnings of affiliates increased 537 percent in 2002. In addition to equity earnings from affiliates acquired in the merger for the last four months of 2002, equity earnings from Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC (CPChem) improved in 2002 as a result of improved margins. Partially offsetting these items were lower earnings in 2002 from DEFS and Merey Sweeny, L.P. (MSLP). DEFS decline was primarily attributable to higher operating expenses, gas imbalance adjustments, and lower natural gas liquids prices, while MSLPs decline was mainly due to lower crude oil light heavy differentials. Other income increased 94 percent in 2002, mainly the result of a favorable revaluation and settlement of long term incentive performance units held by former senior Tosco executives, as well as additional interest income following the merger. During 2002, the company recorded gains totaling $59 million before tax, as the incentive performance units were marked to market each reporting period and eventually settled. See Note 6 Acquisition of Tosco Corporation in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. Purchased crude oil and products increased 176 percent in 2002. The increase reflects higher purchase volumes of crude oil and petroleum products resulting from the Tosco acquisition and the merger. Production and operating expenses increased 89 percent in 2002, while selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 171 percent. Both increases were primarily attributable to the Tosco acquisition and the merger. In conjunction with the merger, ConocoPhillips wrote off $246 million of acquired in process research and development costs related to Conocos natural gas to liquids and other technologies to production and operating expenses in 2002. ConocoPhillips also expensed $135 million in merger related costs to production and operating expenses and $379 million to SG&A expenses in 2002. Exploration expenses increased 93 percent in 2002. The increase reflects the merger, a $77 million leasehold impairment of deepwater Block 34, offshore Angola, and dry hole costs of $161 million in 2002, compared with $48 million in 2001. Depreciation, depletion and amortization increased 65 percent in 2002, compared with 2001. The increase was primarily the result of an increased depreciable base of properties, plants and equipment following the merger and the Tosco acquisition. During 2002, ConocoPhillips recorded property impairments totaling $49 million in connection with the sale of its Point Arguello assets, offshore California; two fields in the U.K. North Sea; and its interest in a non producing field in Alaska. Impairment of tradenames ($102 million) was also recognized in the statement of operations in 2002. Property impairments recorded in 2001 consisted primarily of a $23 million impairment of the Siri field, offshore Denmark. See Note 10 Impairments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Taxes other than income taxes increased 153 percent in 2002, compared with 2001. The increase reflects higher excise taxes due to higher petroleum products sales and increased property and payroll taxes following the merger and the Tosco acquisition. Environmental liabilities assumed in acquisitions and mergers are recorded as liabilities at discounted amounts i.e. the total future estimated cost is determined, then discounted back to current dollars using a time value of money concept. Over time the liability is increased by accretion to reflect the time value of 39 money. Accretion on discounted liabilities increased 214 percent in 2002, reflecting the impact of the environmental liabilities assumed in the Tosco acquisition and the merger. Interest expense increased 67 percent in 2002, mainly due to higher debt levels following the Tosco acquisition and the merger. Foreign currency losses of $24 million were recorded in 2002, compared with losses of $11 million in 2001. Preferred dividend requirements decreased in 2002, reflecting the redemption of $300 million of preferred securities in May 2002. The companys effective tax rate from continuing operations in 2002 was 67 percent, compared with 51 percent in 2001. The increase in the effective tax rate in 2002 was primarily the result of the write off of in process research and development costs without a corresponding tax benefit and a higher proportion of income in higher tax rate jurisdictions. Losses from discontinued operations were $993 million in 2002, compared with income of $32 million in 2001. The 2002 amount includes after tax impairments and loss accruals. See Note 4 Discontinued Operations in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 2001 vs. 2000 On March 31, 2000, ConocoPhillips and Duke Energy Corporation contributed their midstream gas gathering, processing and marketing businesses to DEFS. Effective July 1, 2000, ConocoPhillips and ChevronTexaco Corporation contributed their chemicals businesses, excluding ChevronTexacos Oronite business, to CPChem. Both of these joint ventures are being accounted for using the equity method of accounting, which significantly affects how these operations are reflected in ConocoPhillips consolidated statement of operations. Under the equity method of accounting, ConocoPhillips share of a joint ventures net income is recorded in a single line item on the statement of operations: "Equity in earnings of affiliates." Correspondingly, the other income statement line items (for example, operating revenues, operating costs, etc.) include activity related to these operations only up to the effective dates of the joint ventures. Sales and other operating revenues increased 12 percent in 2001, primarily due to the Tosco acquisition and increased crude oil production. These items were partially offset by the use of equity method accounting for the DEFS and CPChem joint ventures, as well as a reduction in revenues attributable to certain non core assets sold at year end 2000. Equity in earnings of affiliated companies decreased 64 percent in 2001. In the 2001 period, ConocoPhillips incurred a before tax equity loss from its investment in CPChem of $240 million. ConocoPhillips equity earnings related to DEFS were higher in 2001, as a result of a full years activity in 2001, compared with only nine months in 2000. Equity earnings in 2001 benefited from a full years operations at MSLP, a 50 percent owned equity company that owns and operates the coker unit at the Sweeny, Texas, refinery. Other income decreased 59 percent in 2001, primarily attributable to lower net gains on asset sales in 2001 compared with 2000. Total costs and expenses increased 16 percent in 2001, compared with 2000. The increase was mainly the result of the Tosco acquisition, as well as a full years ownership of the companys Alaskan E&P operations that were acquired in April 2000. These items were partially offset by the use of equity method accounting for the DEFS and CPChem joint ventures, and lower crude oil acquisition costs at the companys refineries. 40 SEGMENT RESULTS E&P 2002 2001 2000 Millions of Dollars NET INCOME Alaska $ 870 866 829 Lower 48 286 476 559 United States 1,156 1,342 1,388 International 593 357 557 $1,749 1,699 1,945 Dollars Per Unit AVERAGE SALES PRICES Crude oil (per barrel) United States $23.83 23.57 28.83 International 25.14 24.16 28.42 Total consolidated 24.38 23.77 28.65 Equity affiliates 18.41 12.36 Worldwide 24.07 23.74 28.65 Natural gas lease (per thousand cubic feet) United States 2.75 3.56 3.47 International 2.79 2.60 2.56 Total consolidated 2.77 3.23 3.13 Equity affiliates 2.71 Worldwide 2.77 3.23 3.13 AVERAGE PRODUCTION COSTS PER BARREL OF OIL EQUIVALENT United States $ 5.66 5.52 5.27 International 3.99 2.70 2.85 Total consolidated 4.94 4.60 4.29 Equity affiliates 4.38 2.74 Worldwide 4.92 4.60 4.29 FINDING AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS PER BARREL OF OIL EQUIVALENT United States $ 7.46 5.15 2.78 International* 5.09 6.80 1.17 Worldwide* 5.57 5.97 2.41 *Includes ConocoPhillips share of equity affiliates Millions of Dollars WORLDWIDE EXPLORATION EXPENSES General administrative; geological and geophysical; and lease rentals $ 285 207 168 Leasehold impairment 146 51 39 Dry holes 161 48 91 $ 592 306 298 41 2002 2001 2000 Thousands of Barrels Daily OPERATING STATISTICS Crude oil produced Alaska 331 339 207 Lower 48 40 34 34 United States 371 373 241 Norway 157 117 114 United Kingdom 39 19 25 Canada 13 1 6 Other areas 67 51 51 Total consolidated 647 561 437 Equity affiliates 35 2 682 563 437 Natural gas liquids produced Alaska 24 25 19 Lower 48 8 1 1 United States 32 26 20 Norway 6 5 5 United Kingdom 2 2 2 Canada 4 1 Other areas 2 2 1 46 35 29 Millions of Cubic Feet Daily Natural gas produced* Alaska 175 177 158 Lower 48 928 740 770 United States 1,103 917 928 Norway 171 130 136 United Kingdom 424 178 214 Canada 165 18 83 Other areas 180 92 33 Total consolidated 2,043 1,335 1,394 Equity affiliates 4 2,047 1,335 1,394 *Represents quantities available for sale. Excludes gas equivalent of natural gas liquids shown above. Thousands of Barrels Daily Mining operations Syncrude produced 8 2002 vs. 2001 Net income from ConocoPhillips E&P segment increased 3 percent in 2002. Although E&P benefited from four months of increased production volumes in 2002 following the merger, this was mostly offset by lower natural gas sales prices, higher exploration expenses, and the unfavorable $24 million impact of a tax law change in the United Kingdom. ConocoPhillips average worldwide crude oil sales price was 42 $24.07 per barrel in 2002, a 1 percent increase over $23.74 in 2001. The companys average worldwide natural gas price in 2002 was $2.77 per thousand cubic feet, a 14 percent decrease from $3.23 in 2001. However, natural gas prices trended upward during 2002, with the companys December 2002 worldwide price averaging $3.51 per thousand cubic feet. ConocoPhillips proved reserves at year end 2002 were 7.81 billion barrels of oil equivalent, a 52 percent increase over 5.13 billion barrels at year end 2001. The increase was attributable to the merger. 2001 vs. 2000 Net income from ConocoPhillips E&P segment decreased 13 percent in 2001, as the positive impact of increased crude oil production was more than offset by lower crude oil prices, and, to a lesser extent, lower natural gas production due mainly to asset dispositions in Canada. Benefiting 2000 net income was higher net gains on asset sales than in 2001. ConocoPhillips average worldwide crude oil sales price was $23.74 per barrel in 2001, a 17 percent decrease from $28.65 in 2000. Natural gas prices began 2001 at historically high levels, but trended lower during the remainder of the year, with the companys December 2001 average price at $2.34 per thousand cubic feet. ConocoPhillips proved reserves at year end 2001 were 5.13 billion barrels of oil equivalent, a 2 percent increase over 5.02 billion barrels at year end 2000. U.S. E&P 2002 vs. 2001 Net income from the companys U.S. E&P operations decreased 14 percent in 2002. Although net income for 2002 benefited from four months of increased production volumes following the merger, this was more than offset by lower natural gas prices, lower production volumes in Alaska, and higher dry hole costs. The companys U.S. average natural gas price in 2002 was 23 percent lower than 2001. However, natural gas prices trended upward during 2002, with the companys December 2002 average U.S. price at $3.66 per thousand cubic feet. The companys U.S. crude oil production decreased slightly in 2002, while natural gas production increased 20 percent. The increase in natural gas production was mainly due to four months of production from fields acquired in the merger. The merger impact on total crude oil production was offset by lower production in Alaska, which experienced normal field declines, along with operating interruptions at the Prudhoe Bay field during the year. With a full years combined production from both Conoco and Phillips operations, the company expects that its total U.S. oil and gas production volumes will increase in 2003 over those of 2002. ConocoPhillips fourth quarter production volumes, which included a full period of combined operations, averaged 426,000 barrels per day of liquids and 1,548 million cubic feet per day of natural gas. 2001 vs. 2000 Net income from the companys U.S. E&P operations decreased 3 percent in 2001, compared with 2000. The 2001 results reflect a 55 percent increase in crude oil production, due to a full years production from the Alaska operations acquired in April 2000, as well as increased production due to the startup of the Alpine field in Alaska in December 2000. The benefit of increased crude oil production was offset by 43 lower U.S. crude oil prices, which declined 18 percent in 2001. U.S. natural gas production declined slightly in 2001, reflecting field declines and asset dispositions. Benefiting 2000 net income was a net gain on asset sales of $44 million most of which was related to the disposition of the companys coal and lignite operations. International E&P 2002 vs. 2001 Net income from the companys international E&P operations increased 66 percent in 2002. The improvement reflects four months of increased production volumes following the merger. However, 2002 net income included a $24 million deferred tax charge related to tax law changes in the United Kingdom. In April 2002, the U.K. government announced proposed changes to corporate tax laws specifically impacting the oil and gas industry and production from the U.K. sector of the North Sea. The proposed changes became law in July 2002. A 10 percent supplementary charge to corporation taxes is now assessed on profits, which is expected to be partially offset by the elimination of royalties and an increase in first year deduction allowances for capital investments. Net income in 2002 also included a $77 million leasehold impairment of deepwater Block 34, offshore Angola, due to an unsuccessful exploratory well in the block, along with higher dry hole charges. The companys international crude oil production increased 64 percent in 2002, while natural gas production increased 126 percent. The increases were mainly due to the addition of four months of production from fields acquired in the merger. With a full years combined production from both Conoco and Phillips operations, the company expects that its total international oil and gas production volumes will increase in 2003 over those of 2002. ConocoPhillips fourth quarter production volumes, which included a full period of combined operations, averaged 585,000 barrels per day of liquids and 1,994 million cubic feet per day of natural gas. 2001 vs. 2000 Net income from ConocoPhillips international E&P operations decreased 36 percent in 2001. The decrease was primarily the result of lower crude oil and natural gas production volumes, as well as lower crude oil prices. Additionally, after tax foreign currency gains of $2 million were included in international E&Ps net income in 2001, compared with losses of $10 million in 2000. Net income in 2000 included a net gain on property dispositions of $118 million related to the disposition of the Zama area fields in Canada, partially offset by an $86 million impairment of the Ambrosio field in Venezuela. International crude oil production declined 3 percent in 2001, mainly due to lower production in the U.K. North Sea, Venezuela and Canada, partly offset by increased production from Norway and Nigeria. Canadian and Venezuelan crude oil production declined relative to 2000 due to asset dispositions. Production in the U.K. North Sea decreased on normal field declines. Production from Norway improved in 2001 due to improved processing reliability and well workovers, while Nigerian production increased on development activities and higher quotas. International natural gas production declined 10 percent in 2001, primarily the result of the Canadian asset dispositions and lower U.K. North Sea output noted above, partially offset by higher production in Nigeria and new natural gas production from offshore western Australia. 44 MIDSTREAM 2002 2001 2000 Millions of Dollars NET INCOME $ 55 120 162 Dollars Per Barrel AVERAGE SALES PRICES U.S. natural gas liquids* Consolidated $19.07 Equity 15.92 18.77 21.83** Thousands of Barrels Daily OPERATING STATISTICS Natural gas liquids extracted 156 120 131*** Natural gas liquids fractionated 133 108 158 *Based on index prices from the Mont Belvieu and Conway market hubs that are weighted by natural gas liquids component and location mix. **Estimate based on ConocoPhillips first quarter realized price and DEFS index price for the remainder of the year. ***Based on a weighted average of ConocoPhillips volumes in the first quarter of 2000, and ConocoPhillips share of DEFS volumes for the remainder of 2000. 2002 vs. 2001 ConocoPhillips Midstream segment consists of the companys 30.3 percent interest in Duke Energy Field Services, LLC (DEFS), as well as company owned natural gas gathering and processing operations and natural gas liquids fractionation and marketing businesses. Net income from the Midstream segment decreased 54 percent in 2002. The decrease was primarily due to lower results from DEFS, which experienced a decline in natural gas liquids prices, increased costs for gas imbalance accruals and other adjustments, and higher operating expenses. These items were partially offset by the benefit of four months results from operations acquired in the merger. Included in the Midstream segments net income in 2002 was a benefit of $35 million, representing the amortization of the basis difference between the book value of ConocoPhillips contribution to DEFS and its 30.3 percent equity interest in DEFS. The corresponding amount for 2001 was $36 million. See Note 8 Investments and Long Term Receivables, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the basis difference. 2001 vs. 2000 Net income from the Midstream segment decreased 26 percent in 2001, primarily the result of a 14 percent decline in natural gas liquids prices. In addition, the Midstream segments results were affected by the lack of interest charges in the first quarter of 2000 prior to the formation of DEFS. DEFS incurs interest expense in connection with financing incurred upon formation to fund cash distributions to the parent entities. Prior to the formation of DEFS, the Midstream segment did not have interest expense. Included in the Midstream segments net income in 2001 was a benefit of $36 million, representing the amortization of the basis difference between the book value of ConocoPhillips contribution to DEFS and its 30.3 percent equity interest in DEFS. The corresponding amount for 2000 was $27 million. 45 R&M 2002 2001 2000 Millions of Dollars NET INCOME United States $ 138 395 209 International 5 2 29 $ 143 397 238 Dollars Per Gallon U.S. AVERAGE SALES PRICES* Automotive gasoline Wholesale $ .96 .83 .92 Retail 1.03 1.01 1.07 Distillates wholesale .77 .78 .88 *Excludes excise taxes Thousands of Barrels Daily OPERATING STATISTICS Refining operations* United States Rated crude oil capacity** 1,829 732 335 Crude oil runs 1,661 686 303 Capacity utilization (percent) 91% 94 90 Refinery production 1,847 795 365 International Rated crude oil capacity** 195 22 Crude oil runs 152 20 Capacity utilization (percent) 78% 91 Refinery production 164 19 Worldwide Rated crude oil capacity** 2,024 754 335 Crude oil runs 1,813 706 303 Capacity utilization (percent) 90% 94 90 Refinery production 2,011 814 365 Petroleum products sales volumes*** United States Automotive gasoline 1,147 465 267 Distillates 392 170 107 Aviation fuels 185 78 41 Other products 372 220 50 2,096 933 465 International 162 10 43 2,258 943 508 *2002 includes ConocoPhillips share of equity affiliates. **Weighted average crude oil capacity for the period, including the refineries acquired in the Tosco acquisition in September 2001 and the refineries acquired as a result of the merger. Actual capacity at year end 2002 and 2001 was 2,166 thousand and 1,656 thousand barrels per day, respectively, in the United States and 440 thousand and 72 thousand barrels per day, respectively, internationally. ***Excludes spot market sales. 46 2002 vs. 2001 Net income from the R&M segment declined 64 percent in 2002, reflecting lower refining margins, along with an $84 million after tax impairment of a tradename and leasehold improvements of certain retail sites. See Note 10 Impairments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these impairments. The R&M earnings for 2002 included four months results from operations acquired in the merger, as well as the impact of a full years results from Tosco operations, while the 2001 results included Tosco operations for only the last three and one half months of 2001. Worldwide crude oil refining capacity utilization was 90 percent in 2002, compared with 94 percent in 2001. The companys refineries produced 2,011,000 barrels per day of petroleum products in 2002, compared with 814,000 barrels per day in 2001. The increase reflects a full year of operations for refineries acquired in the Tosco acquisition and four months of operations for the refineries acquired in the merger. 2001 vs. 2000 Net income from the R&M segment increased 67 percent in 2001. On September 14, 2001, ConocoPhillips closed on the acquisition of Tosco. This transaction significantly increased the size of ConocoPhillips R&M segment and benefited 2001 results. In addition to the Tosco acquisition, R&Ms net income benefited from higher gasoline and distillates margins, particularly during the second quarter of 2001. Negatively affecting R&M results for the year were higher utility costs at the companys refineries, resulting from higher natural gas prices experienced in the first half of 2001. Worldwide crude oil refining capacity utilization was 94 percent in 2001, compared with 90 percent in 2000. The companys refineries produced 814,000 barrels per day of petroleum products in 2001, compared with 365,000 barrels per day in 2000. The increase reflects the Tosco acquisition. U.S. R&M 2002 vs. 2001 Net income from U.S. R&M operations declined 65 percent in 2002. The decrease was primarily due to lower refining margins, particularly in the Midcontinent and Gulf Coast regions, along with an $84 million after tax impairment of a tradename and leasehold improvements of certain retail sites. See Note 10 Impairments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these impairments. These items were partially offset by increased production and sales volumes as a result of the Tosco acquisition and the merger. Net income for 2002 included four months from operations acquired in the merger, and a full year of Tosco operations, while the 2001 results included Tosco operations for only three and one half months. Results for 2001 included a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle that increased R&M net income by $26 million. Effective January 1, 2001, ConocoPhillips changed its method of accounting for the costs of major maintenance turnarounds from the accrue in advance method to the expense as incurred method. Also included in 2001 was a $27 million write down of inventories to market value. The crude oil capacity utilization rate for ConocoPhillips U.S. refineries was 91 percent in 2002, compared with 94 percent in 2001. The lower utilization rate in 2002 reflects increased maintenance turnaround activity in 2002, the impact of tropical storms on the companys Gulf Coast refineries in the third quarter of 2002, and the impact of the loss of Venezuelan crude oil supply in the fourth quarter. 47 2001 vs. 2000 Net income from the R&M segments U.S. operations increased 89 percent in 2001, compared with 2000. On September 14, 2001, ConocoPhillips closed on the acquisition of Tosco. This transaction significantly increased the size of ConocoPhillips U.S. R&M operations and benefited 2001 net income. In addition to the Tosco acquisition, R&Ms earnings benefited from higher gasoline and distillates margins, particularly during the second quarter of 2001, and the accounting change discussed above. Negatively affecting R&M results for the year were higher utility costs at the companys refineries, resulting from higher natural gas prices experienced in the first half of 2001, as well as a $27 million write down of inventories to market value. The Sweeny refinerys 2001 net income benefited from the coker unit that was started up in late 2000. The coker unit allows for the processing of heavier, lower cost crude oil, which reduced crude oil purchase costs and contributed to the improved gasoline and distillates margins experienced during 2001. ConocoPhillips U.S. refineries (including those acquired in the Tosco acquisition since the acquisition date) processed an average of 686,000 barrels per day of crude oil in 2001, yielding a 94 percent capacity utilization rate. This compares with 303,000 barrels per day and a utilization rate of 90 percent in 2000. The Tosco acquisition accounted for 378,000 barrels per day in 2001. International R&M 2002 vs. 2001 Net income from international R&M operations increased $3 million in 2002, reflecting the impact of the merger, which added one wholly owned and five joint venture international refineries. A substantial part of ConocoPhillips international R&M results are related to its Humber refinery in the United Kingdom, which had a 232,000 barrel per day crude oil processing capacity at December 31, 2002. This refinery was shut down for an extended period of time during the fourth quarter due to a power outage and subsequent downtime, which negatively impacted international R&Ms 2002 results. The crude oil capacity utilization rate for ConocoPhillips international refineries was 78 percent in 2002, compared with 91 percent in 2001. The lower utilization rate in 2002 reflects the extended shutdown at the Humber refinery noted above. 2001 vs. 2000 Net income from the R&M segments international operations decreased 93 percent in 2001, compared with 2000, reflecting the late 2000 disposition of the companys 50 percent interest in a refinery in Teesside, England. This was partially offset by the addition of the Whitegate refinery in Ireland as part of the Tosco acquisition in September 2001. 48 CHEMICALS 2002 2001 2000 Millions of Dollars NET LOSS $ (14) (128) (46) Millions of Pounds OPERATING STATISTICS Production* Ethylene 3,217 3,291 3,574 Polyethylene 2,004 1,956 2,230 Styrene 887 456 404 Normal alpha olefins 592 563 293 *Production volumes for periods after July 1, 2000, include ConocoPhillips 50 percent share of Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC. 2002 vs. 2001 ConocoPhillips Chemicals segment consists of its 50 percent equity investment in CPChem, which was formed when the company and ChevronTexaco combined their worldwide chemicals businesses in July 2000. The Chemicals segment incurred a net loss of $14 million in 2002, compared with a net loss of $128 million in 2001. The worldwide chemicals industry experienced an economic downturn beginning in the second half of 2000, and these difficult conditions remained present through 2001 and 2002. The downturn has been marked by decreased product demand and low product margins across key product lines. The smaller net loss in 2002 was primarily the result of higher margins due to lower operating expenses, feedstock costs and energy prices, partially offset by decreased sales prices. A fire caused the shutdown of styrene production at CPChems St. James, Louisiana, facility in February 2001. Production was restored in October 2001. Production volumes for other major product lines were comparable between 2002 and 2001. The net loss in 2001 included several asset retirements and impairments totaling $84 million after tax because of depressed economic conditions. A developmental reactor at the Houston Chemical Complex in Pasadena, Texas, was retired; property impairments were recorded on two polyethylene reactors at the Orange chemical plant in Orange, Texas; an ethylene unit was retired at the Sweeny complex in Old Ocean, Texas; an equity affiliate of CPChem recorded a property impairment related to a polypropylene facility; property impairments were taken on the manufacturing facility in Puerto Rico; and the benzene and cyclohexane units at the Puerto Rico facility were retired. In addition, the valuation allowance on the Puerto Rico facilitys deferred tax asset related to its net operating losses was increased in 2001 so that the deferred tax assets were fully offset by valuation allowances. Partially offsetting these impairments was a business interruption insurance settlement recorded by CPChem and a favorable deferred tax adjustment, related to the tax basis of its investment, recorded by ConocoPhillips that resulted from an impairment related to the Puerto Rico facility, together totaling $57 million after tax. 49 2001 vs. 2000 The Chemicals segment incurred a net loss of $128 million in 2001, compared with a net loss of $46 million in 2000. Global conditions for the chemicals and plastics industry were extremely difficult in 2001. Worldwide economic slowdowns, including a recessionary economy in the United States, led to decreased product demand and low product margins across many key product lines. CPChems results were negatively affected by low ethylene, polyethylene and aromatics margins, as well as lower ethylene and polyethylene production. In addition to low margins and production volumes, 2001 contained interest charges incurred by CPChem that were not present in the first six months of 2000 prior to the formation of CPChem. The difficult marketing environment led to several asset retirements and impairments being recorded by CPChem in 2001. Partially offsetting these impairments was a business interruption insurance settlement recorded by CPChem and a favorable deferred tax adjustment recorded by ConocoPhillips that resulted from the Puerto Rico facility impairment, together totaling $57 million after tax. The net loss in 2000 included ConocoPhillips share of a property impairment that CPChem recorded in the fourth quarter related to its Puerto Rico facility. The impairment was required due to the deteriorating outlook for future paraxylene market conditions and a shift in strategic direction at the facility. In addition, a valuation allowance was recorded against a related deferred tax asset. Combined, these two items resulted in a non cash $180 million after tax charge to CPChems earnings. ConocoPhillips share was $90 million. EMERGING BUSINESSES Millions of Dollars 2002 2001 2000 NET LOSS Carbon fibers $ (15) Fuels technology (16) (12) Gas to liquids (273) Power generation and other (6) $ (310) (12) 2002 vs. 2001 The Emerging Businesses segment includes the development of new businesses beyond the companys traditional operations. Emerging Businesses include carbon fibers, natural gas to liquids technology, fuels technology and power generation. Prior to the merger, this segment only included Phillips fuels technology business. The Emerging Businesses segment posted a net loss of $310 million in 2002, compared with a net loss of $12 million in 2001. Results for 2002 included a $246 million write off of acquired in process research and development costs related to Conocos natural gas to liquids and other technologies. In accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 4, "Applicability of FASB Statement No. 2 to Business Combinations Accounted for by the Purchase Method," value assigned to research and development activities in the purchase price allocation that have no alternative future use should be charged to expense at the date of the consummation of the combination. The $246 million charge was the same on both a before tax and after 50 tax basis, as there was no tax basis to the assigned value prior to its write off. The increased number of developing businesses after the merger also contributed to the larger losses in 2002. ConocoPhillips announced in February 2003 that it will shut down its carbon fibers project, as a result of market, operating and technology uncertainties. At the time of the merger, the company identified these uncertainties facing the carbon fibers project and initiated a strategic update for the new management of the company. In early 2003, the strategic update was completed and management made the decision to shut down the project. In the preliminary purchase price allocation, the company valued the carbon fibers technology at an amount equal to the plant construction costs. In the first quarter of 2003, the company will reduce the preliminary purchase price allocation associated with this project and accrue for shutdown, severance and other related costs that will result in a corresponding net increase in goodwill of $125 million. 2001 vs. 2000 In 2001, the Emerging Businesses segment included the companys development of new fuels technologies. Prior to 2001, these activities were not separately identifiable, and were included in the R&M segment. CORPORATE AND OTHER Millions of Dollars 2002 2001 2000 NET LOSS Net interest $ (396) (262) (278) Corporate general and administrative expenses (173) (114) (87) Discontinued operations (993) 32 14 Merger related costs (307) Other (49) (71) (86) $(1,918) (415) (437) 2002 vs. 2001 Net interest represents interest expense, net of interest income and capitalized interest. Net interest increased 51 percent in 2002, mainly due to higher debt levels following the Tosco acquisition and the merger of Conoco and Phillips. Corporate general and administrative expenses increased 52 percent in 2002, primarily due to the impact of the merger. In addition, 2002 also included higher benefit related costs, primarily from the accelerated vesting of awards under certain long term compensation plans that occurred at the time of stockholder approval of the merger. Losses from discontinued operations were $993 million in 2002, compared with income of $32 million in 2001. The 2002 amount included after tax impairments and loss accruals of $1,077 million associated with the assets held for sale. See Note 4 Discontinued Operations in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the impairments and loss accruals, as well as a description of the assets included in discontinued operations. 51 Merger related costs in 2002 included restructuring accruals of $252 million, primarily related to work force reduction charges; change in control costs associated with seismic contracts totaling $22 million; and other transition costs of $33 million. Other merger related costs of $250 million were recorded by the operating segments, bringing total merger related costs to $557 million after tax. The category "Other" consists primarily of items not directly associated with the operating segments on a stand alone basis, including captive insurance operations, certain foreign currency gains and losses, the tax impact of consolidations, and dividends on the preferred securities of the Phillips 66 Capital Trusts I and II. Results from Other were improved in 2002 primarily due to more favorable foreign currency transactions, and a favorable revaluation and settlement of certain long term incentive units that were converted into Phillips performance units held by former senior Tosco executives, none of whom are employees of ConocoPhillips. Included in 2002 and 2001 were extraordinary losses on the early retirement of debt totaling $16 million and $10 million, respectively. 2001 vs. 2000 Corporate and Other net loss decreased 5 percent in 2001, compared with 2000, primarily due to lower net interest expense and improved results from discontinued operations partially offset by higher staff costs, contributions, corporate advertising and corporate transportation costs. 52 CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY FINANCIAL INDICATORS Millions of Dollars Except as Indicated 2002 2001 2000 Current ratio .9 1.3 .8 Total debt repayment obligations due within one year $ 849 44 262 Total debt $19,766 8,654 6,884 Mandatorily redeemable preferred securities of trust subsidiaries $ 350 650 650 Other minority interests $ 651 5 1 Common stockholders equity $29,517 14,340 6,093 Percent of total debt to capital* 39% 37 51 Percent of floating rate debt to total debt 12% 20 17 *Capital includes total debt, mandatorily redeemable preferred securities, other minority interests and common stockholders equity. Expected new accounting rules in 2003 likely will cause mandatorily redeemable preferred securities to be presented as a liability. The increase in ConocoPhillips debt to capital ratio from December 31, 2001, to December 31, 2002, resulted primarily from the merger. In addition to $12 billion of Conoco debt assumed, purchase accounting required the debt to be recorded at fair value at the time of the merger, increasing total debt by an additional $565 million. SIGNIFICANT SOURCES OF CAPITAL During 2002, cash of $4,969 million was provided by operating activities, an increase of $1,407 million from 2001. Cash provided by operating activities before changes in working capital increased $54 million compared with 2001, primarily due to higher dividends from equity affiliates, higher crude oil prices and higher crude oil and natural gas volumes, offset by lower natural gas prices, lower refining margins, higher interest expenses and merger related costs. Positive working capital changes of $1,184 million were primarily due to an increase in accounts payable, an increase in taxes and other accruals and a decrease in inventories, partially offset by increased receivables. Discontinued operations provided $202 million of operating cash flows in 2002, an increase of $169 million compared to 2001. The increase in 2002 was primarily due to 2002 including a full year of cash flow from a portion of assets acquired in the Tosco acquisition that are now included in discontinued operations. During 2002, cash and cash equivalents increased $165 million. In addition to the cash provided by operating activities, $815 million was received from the sale of various ConocoPhillips assets; including the sale of exploration and production assets in the Netherlands, assets in Canada and propane terminal assets at Jefferson City, Missouri, and East St. Louis, Illinois. Funds were used to support the companys ongoing capital expenditures program, repay debt and pay dividends. In October 2002, ConocoPhillips Board of Directors declared a dividend of $.40 per share, payable December 2, 2002, which represented an 11 percent increase in the quarterly dividend. To meet its liquidity requirements, including funding its capital program, paying dividends and repaying debt, the company looks to a variety of funding sources, primarily cash generated from operating activities. By the end of 2004, however, the company anticipates raising funds of $3 billion to $4 billion, of which approximately $600 million had been raised as of December 31, 2002, from the sale of assets, including those assets required by the FTC to be sold. In December 2002, ConocoPhillips entered into an agreement to sell its Woods Cross refinery and associated marketing assets, subject to state and federal regulatory approvals. Also in December 2002, the company committed to and initiated a plan to sell a substantial portion of its U.S. company owned retail sites. 53 While the stability of the companys cash flows from operating activities benefits from geographic diversity and the effects of upstream and downstream integration, the companys operating cash flows remain exposed to the volatility of commodity crude oil and natural gas prices and downstream margins, as well as periodic cash needs to finance tax payments and crude oil, natural gas and petroleum product purchases. The companys primary funding source for short term working capital needs is a $4 billion commercial paper program, a portion of which may be denominated in euros (limited to euro 3 billion), supported by $4 billion in revolving credit facilities. Commercial paper maturities are generally kept within 90 days. At December 31, 2002, ConocoPhillips had $1,517 million of commercial paper outstanding, of which $206 million was denominated in foreign currencies. Effective October 15, 2002, ConocoPhillips entered into two new revolving credit facilities to replace the previously existing $2.5 billion Conoco credit facilities, and also amended and restated a prior Phillips revolving credit facility to include ConocoPhillips as a borrower. The company now has a $2 billion 364 day revolving credit facility expiring on October 14, 2003, and two revolving credit facilities totaling $2 billion expiring in October 2006. There were no outstanding borrowings under any of these facilities at December 31, 2002. These credit facilities support the companys $4 billion commercial paper program. ConocoPhillips Norwegian subsidiary has two $300 million revolving credit facilities that expire in June 2004, under which no borrowings were outstanding as of December 31, 2002. In addition to the bank credit facilities, ConocoPhillips sells certain credit card and trade receivables to two Qualifying Special Purpose Entities (QSPEs) in revolving period securitization arrangements. These arrangements provide for ConocoPhillips to sell, and the QSPEs to purchase, certain receivables and for the QSPEs to then issue beneficial interests of up to $1.5 billion to five bank sponsored entities. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, the company had sold accounts receivable of $1.3 billion and $940 million, respectively. The receivables sold have been sufficiently isolated from ConocoPhillips to qualify for sales treatment. All five bank sponsored entities are multi seller conduits with access to the commercial paper market and purchase interests in similar receivables from numerous other companies unrelated to ConocoPhillips. ConocoPhillips has no ownership in any of the bank sponsored entities and has no voting influence over any bank sponsored entitys operating and financial decisions. As a result, ConocoPhillips does not consolidate any of these entities. Beneficial interests retained by ConocoPhillips in the pool of receivables held by the QSPEs are subordinate to the beneficial interests issued to the bank sponsored entities and were measured and recorded at fair value based on the present value of future expected cash flows estimated using managements best estimates concerning the receivables performance, including credit losses and dilution discounted at a rate commensurate with the risks involved to arrive at present value. These assumptions are updated periodically based on actual credit loss experience and market interest rates. ConocoPhillips also retains servicing responsibility related to the sold receivables. The fair value of the servicing responsibility approximates adequate compensation for the servicing costs incurred. ConocoPhillips retained interest in the sold receivables at December 31, 2002 and 2001, was $1.3 billion and $450 million, respectively. Under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, the QSPEs are not consolidated by ConocoPhillips. ConocoPhillips retained interest in sold receivables is reported on the balance sheet in accounts and notes receivable. See Note 13 Sales of Receivables in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. On October 9, 2002, ConocoPhillips issued $2 billion of senior unsecured debt securities, consisting of $400 million 3.625% notes due 2007, $1 billion 4.75% notes due 2012, and $600 million 5.90% notes due 2032. The $1,980 million net proceeds of the offering were used to reduce commercial paper, to retire Conocos $500 million floating rate notes due October 15, 2002, and for general corporate purposes. 54 Moodys Investor Service has assigned a rating of A3 on ConocoPhillips senior long term debt; and Standard and Poors and Fitch have assigned a rating of A . ConocoPhillips does not have any ratings triggers on any of its corporate debt that would cause an automatic event of default in the event of a downgrade of ConocoPhillips debt rating and thereby impacting ConocoPhillips access to liquidity. In the event that ConocoPhillips credit were to deteriorate to a level that would prohibit ConocoPhillips from accessing the commercial paper market, ConocoPhillips would still be able to access funds under its $4.6 billion revolving credit facilities. Based on ConocoPhillips year end commercial paper balance of $1.5 billion, ConocoPhillips had access to $3.1 billion in borrowing capacity as of December 31, 2002, after repaying all outstanding commercial paper, which provides ample liquidity to cover any needs that its businesses may require to cover daily operations. OTHER FINANCING AND OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS During 1996 and 1997, ConocoPhillips formed two statutory business trusts, Phillips 66 Capital I and Phillips 66 Capital II. The company owns all of the common securities of the trusts and the trusts are consolidated by the company. The trusts exist for the sole purpose of issuing preferred securities to outside investors, and investing the proceeds thereof in an equivalent amount of subordinated debt securities of ConocoPhillips. The two trusts were established to raise funds for general corporate purposes. The subordinated debt securities of ConocoPhillips held by the trusts are eliminated in consolidation. The $300 million of 8.24% Trust Originated Preferred Securities issued by Phillips 66 Capital Trust I became callable, at par, $25 per share, during May 2001. On May 31, 2002, ConocoPhillips redeemed all of its outstanding subordinated debt securities held by the Trust, which triggered the redemption of the $300 million of trust preferred securities at par value, $25 per share. The redemption was funded by the issuance of commercial paper. The remaining $350 million of mandatorily redeemable preferred trust securities issued by Phillips 66 Capital Trust II are mandatorily redeemable in 2037, when the subordinated debt securities of ConocoPhillips held by the trust are required to be repaid. The mandatorily redeemable preferred securities are presented in the mezzanine section of the balance sheet. See Note 17 Preferred Stock and Other Minority Interests in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. ConocoPhillips also had outstanding, at December 31, 2002, $645 million of equity held by minority interest owners, which provide a preferred return to those minority interest holders. In 1999, Conoco formed Conoco Corporate Holdings L.P. by contributing an office building and four aircraft. The limited partner interest was sold to Highlander Investors L.L.C. for $141 million, which represented an initial net 47 percent interest. Highlander is entitled to a cumulative annual priority return on its investment of 7.86 percent. The net minority interest in Conoco Corporate Holdings was $141 million at December 31, 2002, and is mandatorily redeemable in 2019 or callable without penalty beginning in the fourth quarter of 2004. In 2001, Conoco and Cold Spring Finance S.a.r.l. formed Ashford Energy Capital S.A. through the contribution of cash and a Conoco subsidiary promissory note. Cold Spring Finance S.a.r.l. held a $504 million net minority interest in Ashford Energy at December 31, 2002, and is entitled to a cumulative annual preferred return on its investment, based on three month LIBOR rates plus 1.27 percent. The preferred return at December 31, 2002, was 2.70 percent. These minority interests are presented in the mezzanine section of the balance sheet. See Note 17 Preferred Stock and Other Minority Interests in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities," and later in 2003, the FASB is expected to issue Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 149, "Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Liabilities and Equity." The company is evaluating these new pronouncements to determine whether the amounts currently presented in the mezzanine section of the balance sheet will be required to be presented as debt or as equity 55 on the balance sheet. See Note 27 New Accounting Standards and Note 28 Variable Interest Entities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. The company leases ocean transport vessels, drillships, tank railcars, corporate aircraft, service stations, computers, office buildings, certain refining equipment, and other facilities and equipment. Prior to the acquisition of Tosco and the merger, the company had in place leasing arrangements for tankers, corporate aircraft and the construction of various retail marketing outlets. At December 31, 2002, approximately $730 million had been utilized under those arrangements, which is the total capacity available. At the time the company acquired Tosco, Tosco had in place previously arranged leasing arrangements for various retail stations and two office buildings in Tempe, Arizona. At December 31, 2002, approximately $1.3 billion had been utilized under those arrangements, which is the total capacity available. In addition, at the time of the merger, Conoco had in place leasing arrangements for certain refining equipment, two drillships, and various retail marketing outlets. At December 31, 2002, approximately $370 million had been utilized under those arrangements. Several of the above leasing arrangements are with special purpose entities (SPEs) that are third party trusts established by a trustee and funded by financial institutions. Other than those leasing arrangements, ConocoPhillips has no other direct or indirect relationship with the trusts or their investors. Each SPE from which ConocoPhillips leases assets is funded by at least 3 percent substantive, unaffiliated third party, residual equity capital investment, which is at risk during the entire term of the lease. Changes in market interest rates do have an impact on the periodic amount of lease payments. ConocoPhillips has various purchase options to acquire the leased assets from the SPEs at the end of the lease term, but those purchase options are not required to be exercised by ConocoPhillips under any circumstances. If ConocoPhillips does not exercise its purchase option on a leased asset, the company does have guaranteed residual values, which are due at the end of the lease terms, but those guaranteed amounts would be reduced by the fair market value of the leased assets returned. These various leasing arrangements meet all requirements under generally accepted accounting principles to be treated as operating leases. However, in January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities," which will require consolidation in July 2003 of certain SPEs that were created prior to January 31, 2003, and which are still in existence at June 15, 2003. The company is evaluating the new Interpretation to determine whether the assets and debt of the leasing arrangements would be consolidated. See Note 28 Variable Interest Entities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. If the company is required to consolidate all of these entities, the assets of the entities and debt of approximately $2.4 billion would be required to be included in the consolidated financial statements. The companys maximum exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with the entities would be the debt of the entity less the fair value of the assets at the end of the lease terms. Of the $2.4 billion debt that would be consolidated, approximately $1.5 billion is associated with a major portion of the companys owned retail stores that the company has announced it plans to sell. As a result of the planned divestiture, the company plans to exercise purchase option provisions during 2003 and terminate various operating leases involving approximately 900 store sites and two office buildings. In addition, see Note 4 Discontinued Operations in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for details regarding the provisions for losses and penalties recorded in the fourth quarter, 2002 for the planned divestiture. Depending upon the timing of the companys exercise of these purchase options, and the determination of whether or not the lessor entities in these operating leases are variable interest entities requiring consolidation in 2003, some or all of these lessor entities could become consolidated subsidiaries of the company prior to the exercise of the purchase options and termination of the leases. See Note 14 Guarantees and Note 19 Non Mineral Leases in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 56 During 2000, ConocoPhillips contributed its midstream gas gathering, processing and marketing business and its worldwide chemicals business to joint ventures with Duke Energy Corporation and ChevronTexaco Corporation, as successor to Chevron Corporation (ChevronTexaco), respectively, forming DEFS and CPChem, respectively. ConocoPhillips owns 30.3 percent of DEFS and 50 percent of CPChem, accounting for its interests in both companies using the equity method of accounting. The capital and financing programs of both of these joint venture companies are intended to be self funding. DEFS supplies a substantial portion of its natural gas liquids to ConocoPhillips and CPChem under a supply agreement that continues until December 31, 2014. This purchase commitment is on an "if produced, will purchase" basis so it has no fixed production schedule, but has been, and is expected to be, a relatively stable purchase pattern over the term of the contract. Natural gas liquids are purchased under this agreement at various published market index prices, less transportation and fractionation fees. DEFS also purchases raw natural gas from ConocoPhillips E&P operations. ConocoPhillips and CPChem have multiple supply and purchase agreements in place, ranging in initial terms from four to 15 years, with extension options. These agreements cover sales and purchases of refined products, solvents, and petrochemical and natural gas liquids feedstocks, as well as fuel oils and gases. Delivery quantities vary by product, ranging from zero to 100 percent of production capacity at a particular refinery, most at the buyers option. All products are purchased and sold under specified pricing formulas based on various published pricing indexes, consistent with terms extended to third party customers. In the second quarter of 2001, ConocoPhillips and its co venturers in the Hamaca project secured approximately $1.1 billion in a joint debt financing for their heavy crude oil project in Venezuela. The Export Import Bank of the United States provided a guarantee supporting a 17 year term $628 million bank facility. The joint venture also arranged a $470 million 14 year term commercial bank facility for the project. Total debt of $947 million was outstanding under these credit facilities at December 31, 2002. ConocoPhillips, through the joint venture, holds a 40 percent interest in the Hamaca project, which is operated on behalf of the co venturers by Petrolera Ameriven. The proceeds of these joint financings are being used to partially fund the development of the heavy oil field and the construction of pipelines and a heavy oil upgrader. The remaining necessary funding will be provided by capital contributions from the co venturers on a pro rata basis to the extent necessary to successfully complete construction. Once completion certification is achieved, the joint project financings will become non recourse with respect to the co venturers and the lenders under those facilities can then look only to the Hamaca projects cash flows for payment. MSLP is a limited partnership in which ConocoPhillips and PDVSA each own an indirect 50 percent interest. During 1999, MSLP issued $350 million of 8.85 percent bonds due 2019 that ConocoPhillips and PDVSA are joint and severally liable for under a construction completion guarantee. The bond proceeds were used to fund construction of a coker, vacuum unit and related facilities at the ConocoPhillips Sweeny refinery plus certain improvements to existing facilities at the same location. MSLP owns and operates the coker and vacuum unit and, in the third quarter of 2000, began processing long residue produced from the Venezuelan Merey crude oil delivered under a supply agreement that ConocoPhillips has with PDVSA. MSLP charges ConocoPhillips a fee to process the long residue through the vacuum unit and coker. This is the partnerships primary source of revenue. If completion certification is not attained by 2004, the full debt is due. Upon completion certification, the 8.85 percent bonds become non recourse to the two MSLP partners and the bondholders can then look only to MSLP cash flows for payment. 57 ConocoPhillips purchased the improvements to existing facilities from MSLP for a price equal to the cost of construction and MSLP provided seller financing. Terms of financing provide for 240 monthly payments of principal and interest commencing September 2000 with interest accruing at a 7 percent annual rate. The principal balance due on the seller financing was $131 million at December 31, 2002, and is included as long term debt in ConocoPhillips balance sheet. MSLP pays a monthly access fee to ConocoPhillips for the use of the improvements to the refinery. The access fee equals the monthly principal and interest paid by ConocoPhillips to purchase the improvements from MSLP. To the extent the access fee is not paid by MSLP, ConocoPhillips is not obligated to make payments for the improvements. During the first quarter of 2002, MSLP issued $25 million of tax exempt bonds due 2021. This issuance, combined with similar bonds MSLP issued in 1998, 2000, and 2001, bring the total outstanding to $100 million. As a result of the companys support as a primary obligor of a 50 percent share of these MSLP financings, $50 million and $38 million of long term debt is included in ConocoPhillips balance sheet at December 31, 2002, and December 31, 2001, respectively. ConocoPhillips has transactions with many unconsolidated affiliates. Equity affiliate sales and services to ConocoPhillips amounted to $1,545 million in 2002, $1,110 million in 2001 and $1,347 million in 2000. Equity affiliate purchases from ConocoPhillips totaled $1,554 million in 2002, $935 million in 2001 and $1,573 million in 2000. These agreements were not the result of arms length negotiations. However, ConocoPhillips believes that these contracts are generally at values that are similar to those that could be negotiated with independent third parties.

ConocoPhillips capital spending for continuing operations for the three year period ending December 31, 2002, totaled $9.4 billion, excluding the purchase of ARCOs Alaskan businesses in 2000. The companys spending was primarily focused on the growth of its E&P business, with more than 79 percent of total spending for continuing operations in this segment. On March 31, 2000, ConocoPhillips contributed the gas gathering, processing and marketing portion of its then Midstream business to DEFS. On July 1, 2000, ConocoPhillips contributed its Chemicals business to CPChem. The capital programs of these joint venture companies are intended to be self funding. Including approximately $400 million in capitalized interest and $200 million that will be funded by minority interests in the Bayu Undan gas export project, ConocoPhillips Board of Directors (Board) has approved $6.5 billion for capital projects and investments for continuing operations in 2003, a 48 percent increase over 2002 capital spending of $4.4 billion. The company plans to direct approximately 75 percent of its 2003 capital budget to E&P and about 17 percent to R&M. The remaining budget will be allocated toward emerging businesses, mainly power generation, and general corporate purposes, with a significant majority related to global integration of systems. Forty one percent of the budget is targeted for projects in the United States. In addition to the above budget, ConocoPhillips expects to spend about $300 million to exercise purchase options for retail stores and office buildings, which are currently within various lease arrangements. 60 E&P Capital spending for continuing operations for E&P during the three year period ending December 31, 2002, totaled $7.5 billion. The expenditures over the three year period supported several key exploration and development projects including: o National Petroleum Reserve Alaska (NPR A) and satellite field prospects on Alaskas North Slope; o the Hamaca heavy oil project in Venezuelas Orinoco Oil Belt; o the Peng Lai 19 3 discovery in Chinas Bohai Bay and additional Bohai Bay appraisal and satellite field prospects; o the Kashagan field in the north Caspian Sea, offshore Kazakhstan; o the Jade, Clair and CMS3 developments in the United Kingdom; o the Bayu Undan gas recycle project in the Timor Sea; o acquisition of deepwater exploratory interests in Angola, Nigeria, Brazil, and the U.S. Gulf of Mexico; o fields in Vietnam; o Canadian conventional oil and gas projects, as well as expansion of the Syncrude project; and o fields in Indonesia. Capital expenditures for construction of the Endeavour Class tankers and an additional interest in the Trans Alaska Pipeline System were also included in the E&P segment. ConocoPhillips has contracted to build, for approximately $200 million each, five double hulled Endeavour Class tankers for use in transporting Alaskan crude oil to the U.S. West Coast. During 2001, the Polar Endeavour, the first Endeavour Class tanker, entered service. The second tanker, the Polar Resolution, entered service in May 2002. The third tanker, the Polar Discovery, was christened on April 13, 2002, and is expected to enter service in 2003. ConocoPhillips expects to add a new Endeavour Class tanker to its fleet each year through 2005, allowing the company to retire older ships and cancel non operated charters. In 2002, the company and its co venturers drilled or participated in 69 development wells at the Alaska Prudhoe Bay field. Also, new equipment was added to increase the efficiency of the fields existing water flood. At the Kuparuk field, 14 new development wells were added, and the Drill Site 3S (Palm) was installed earlier in the year. Production at Palm began in the fourth quarter. At Alpine, nine new development wells were added. Other capital spending at Alpine included facility improvements. During the fourth quarter of 2001, heavy crude oil production began from the Hamaca project in Venezuelas Orinoco Oil Belt. Construction of an upgrader to convert heavy crude into a 26 degree API synthetic crude continues. Completion of the upgrader is expected in 2004. ConocoPhillips owns a 61 40 percent equity interest in the Hamaca project. ConocoPhillips other heavy oil project, Petrozuata, incurred no significant capital expenditures in 2002. In addition to the Hamaca development and Petrozuata, ConocoPhillips submitted a Declaration of Commerciality to the Venezuelan government on the Corocoro oil discovery in the fourth quarter of 2002. Development approval is expected in the first half of 2003, with expenditures to follow later in the year. In 2002, development activities continued on the companys Peng Lai 19 3 discovery in Block 11/05 in Chinas Bohai Bay with production beginning late in the fourth quarter of 2002. Technical design activities for the second phase of development continued during 2002. In 2002, ConocoPhillips and its co venturers, in conjunction with the government of the Republic of Kazakhstan, declared the Kashagan field on the Kazakhstan shelf in the north Caspian Sea to be commercial. This declaration of commerciality enabled preparation of a development plan for the field. Drilling of the first of five planned appraisal wells was successfully completed in early 2002. Evaluation of test results continues on the second and third wells, drilling operations continue on the fourth, and testing continues on the fifth of these appraisal wells. In May 2002, ConocoPhillips, along with the other remaining co venturers, completed the acquisition of proportionate interests of other co venturers rights, which increased ConocoPhillips ownership interest from 7.14 percent to 8.33 percent. In October 2002, ConocoPhillips and its co venturers announced a new hydrocarbon discovery in the Kazakhstan sector of the Caspian Sea. An initial test well, the Kalamkas 1, flowed oil. This well is located adjacent to the Kashagan field. In 2002, development of ConocoPhillips Jade field, in the U.K. sector of the North Sea, continued with first production occurring in February 2002. A second production well was successfully drilled and began producing during the second quarter of 2002. In the second half of the year, two more production wells were completed and began producing. ConocoPhillips is the operator and holds a 32.5 percent interest in Jade. An exploration well was spudded late in 2002 and drilling operations are continuing into 2003. In September 2002, ConocoPhillips began production from the Hawksley field in the southern sector of the U.K. North Sea. The Hawksley discovery well, 44/17a 6y, was completed in July 2002 in one of five natural gas reservoirs currently being developed by ConocoPhillips as a single, unitized project. The other reservoirs are McAdam, Murdoch K, Boulton, and Watt. Collectively, they are known as CMS3 due to their utilization of the production and transportation facilities of the ConocoPhillips operated Caister Murdoch system (CMS). ConocoPhillips is the operator of CMS3 and holds a 59.5 percent interest. ConocoPhillips $1.9 billion gross Bayu Undan gas recycle project activities continued in the Timor Sea during 2002. This involved the drilling of future production wells from the wellhead platform and the installation of the platform jackets and all in field flowlines. Fabrication and assembly of two large platform decks continues in Korea, as does work on the multi product floating, storage and offtake vessel (FSO). At year end, the project was approximately 69 percent complete. During mid 2003, the decks and FSO will be installed with first gas and commissioning commencing in the third quarter of 2003. Liquid sales will commence in early 2004 with production ramp up occurring during the first six months of 2004. Activity associated with the Bayu Undan gas export project, including a pipeline to Darwin and a liquefied natural gas plant, currently is focused on preparation of approval documentation and project design. Construction is expected to start in early 2003, following the Timor Sea Treaty ratification by Australia. ConocoPhillips direct interest in the unitized Bayu Undan field was 55.9 percent at year end 2002. A further 8.25 percent interest was held through Petroz N.L., in which the company had an 89.7 percent stock ownership at year end. ConocoPhillips has effective voting control over the pipeline and liquefied natural gas plant component of the gas export project and thus plans to consolidate that part of the Bayu Undan project and present the other venturers as minority interests. 62 In 2002, ConocoPhillips continued pursuing the goal of increasing its presence in high potential deepwater areas. ConocoPhillips was the high bidder in the central Gulf of Mexico sale for the Lorien prospect located in Green Canyon Block 199 and was officially awarded the block in 2002. In Brazil, ConocoPhillips acquired joint venture partners for its two deepwater blocks and purchased additional seismic data. Plans for 2003 include the purchase of additional seismic data and the further evaluation of the two blocks prospects. In May 2002, initial results showed that the first exploratory well drilled in Block 34, offshore Angola, was a dry hole. In view of this information, ConocoPhillips reassessed the fair value of the remainder of the block and determined that its investment in the block was impaired by $77 million, both before and after tax. Further technical analysis of the results of this first well continues. The second of three commitment wells in this block is scheduled for drilling in 2003. ConocoPhillips entered into a production sharing contract on Oil Prospecting Lease (OPL) 318, deepwater Nigeria, on June 14, 2002, where ConocoPhillips is operator with 50 percent interest. The acquisition of 3 D seismic data on OPL 318 is planned to begin in 2003, with the first exploratory well expected to be drilled in the fourth quarter of 2004. In the third quarter of 2002, production began from two new wellhead platforms in the Block 15 2 Rang Dong field in Vietnam. These additional platforms increased production from the field from under 6,800 to over 12,400 net barrels per day at year end 2002. In Canada, total capital expended in 2002 was $136 million. Capital spending for conventional oil and gas properties was $75 million and Syncrude expansion continued with $54 million expended. In addition, the Mackenzie Delta/Parsons Lake project efforts focused on gaining pipeline regulatory approval and acquiring seismic data. ConocoPhillips continued with the development of key gas fields in the Natuna Sea in Indonesia. Total spending on Block B gas development in the last four months of 2002 was $101 million, including investment in the Belanak floating, production, storage and offtake vessel and wellhead platform, plus wells and pipeline infrastructure required for the newly commenced gas sales to Petronas Malaysia. ConocoPhillips acquired a 14 percent interest in PT Transportasi Gas Indonesia (TGI) in 2002. The primary assets of TGI are the Grissik Duri pipeline, which has been in operation since 1998, and the Grissik Singapore pipeline that is currently under construction with a completion date expected in late 2003. Total funding in 2002 was $54 million, which includes acquisition cost and capital expenditures. Other capital spending for E&P during the three year period ended December 31, 2002, supported: o the Eldfisk waterflood development in Norway; o the acquisition and development of coalbed methane and conventional gas prospects and producing properties in the U.S. Lower 48; and o North Sea prospects in the U.K. and Norwegian sectors, plus other Atlantic Margin wells in the United Kingdom, Greenland and the Faroe Islands. 63 2003 Capital Budget E&Ps 2003 capital budget for continuing operations is $4.9 billion, 50 percent higher than actual expenditures in 2002. Thirty percent of E&Ps 2003 capital budget is planned for the United States. Of that, 47 percent is slated for Alaska. ConocoPhillips has budgeted $461 million for worldwide exploration capital activities in 2003, with 28 percent of that amount, $131 million allocated for the United States. More than $41 million of the U.S. total will be directed toward the exploration program in Alaska, where wells are planned in the NPR A and other locations on the North Slope. Outside the United States, significant exploration expenditures are planned in Kazakhstan, Venezuela, the United Kingdom and Norway. The company plans to spend about $700 million in 2003 for its Alaskan operations. Large capital projects include the ongoing construction of three Endeavour Class tankers; development of the Meltwater, Palm and West Sak fields in the Greater Kuparuk area; development of the Borealis field in the Greater Prudhoe Bay area; as well as the exploratory activity discussed above. In the Lower 48, capital expenditures will be focused on exploration and continued development of the companys acreage positions in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, South Texas, the San Juan Basin, the Permian Basin, and the Texas Panhandle. Major deepwater developments include Magnolia, K2, and the Princess fields, while exploration continues using the drillship Pathfinder. E&P is directing $3.4 billion of its 2003 capital budget to international projects. The majority of these funds will be directed to developing major long term projects, including the Bayu Undan liquids development and gas recycling project in the Timor Sea, the Hamaca heavy oil project and Corocoro development in Venezuela, additional development of oil and gas reserves in offshore Block B and onshore South Sumatra blocks in Indonesia, Blocks 15 1 and 15 2 in Vietnam, and Bohai Bay in China. In addition, funds will be used to expand the companys positions in the U.K. and Norwegian sectors of the North Sea, Syncrude operations in western Canada and to develop the Surmont heavy oil project in Canada, and the Kashagan field in the Caspian Sea. Costs incurred for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000, relating to the development of proved undeveloped oil and gas reserves were $1,631 million, $1,423 million, and $857 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2002, estimated future development costs relating to the development of proved undeveloped oil and gas reserves for the years 2003 through 2005 were projected to be $1,815 million, $939 million, and $539 million, respectively. R&M Capital spending for continuing operations for R&M during the three year period ending December 31, 2002, was primarily for refinery upgrade projects to improve product yields, to meet new environmental standards, to improve the operating integrity of key processing units, and to install advanced process control technology, as well as for safety projects. Key significant projects during the three year period included: o construction of a polypropylene plant at the Bayway refinery in New Jersey; o construction on a fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) unit at the Ferndale, Washington, refinery; 64 o expansion of the alkylation unit at the Los Angeles refinery; o completion of a coker and continuous catalytic reformer at the companys Sweeny, Texas, refinery; o capacity expansion and debottlenecking projects at the Borger, Texas, refinery; o completion of a commercial S Zorb Sulfur Removal Technology (S Zorb) unit at the Borger refinery; o an expansion of capacity in the Seaway crude oil pipeline; and o installation of advanced central control buildings and technologies at the Sweeny and Borger facilities. Total capital spending for continuing operations for R&M for the three year period was $1.5 billion, representing approximately 16 percent of ConocoPhillips total capital spending for continuing operations. During 2002, construction continued on two major projects: a polypropylene plant at the Bayway refinery in Linden, New Jersey, and an FCC unit at the Ferndale, Washington, refinery. The Bayway polypropylene plant will utilize propylene feedstock from the Bayway refinery to make up to 775 million pounds per year of polypropylene. The plant became operational in March 2003. The FCC unit at Ferndale is expected to be fully operational in the second quarter of 2003 and will enable the refinery to significantly improve gasoline production per barrel of crude input. In 2002, ConocoPhillips made investments to improve its ability to meet regulatory "clean fuels" requirements throughout its refining system. The company plans to spend approximately $400 million per year for the next two years on clean fuels projects in the United States and already is well ahead of regulatory mandates for producing clean fuel in Europe. In 2002, ConocoPhillips completed a large continuous pilot plant demonstrating S Zorb for diesel, began construction of an S Zorb gasoline unit at its Ferndale, Washington, refinery, and announced its sixth licensing agreement for the use of S Zorb for gasoline and second licensing agreement for the use of S Zorb for diesel. The S Zorb process significantly reduces sulfur content in gasoline or diesel fuel for meeting new government regulations. In 2002, a major expansion of the alkylation unit at the Los Angeles refinery was completed and as a result, production of non MTBE (methyl tertiary butyl ether) gasoline has increased. 2003 Capital Budget R&Ms 2003 capital budget for continuing operations is $1.1 billion, a 35 percent increase over spending of $840 million in 2002. Domestic spending is expected to consume about 80 percent of the R&M budget. The company plans to direct about $750 million of the R&M capital budget to domestic refining, of which about 45 percent of the expenditures are related to clean fuels, safety and environmental projects. Domestic marketing, transportation and specialty businesses expect to spend about $130 million, with the remaining budget to fund projects in the companys international refining and marketing businesses in Europe and the Asia Pacific region. 65 EMERGING BUSINESSES Capital spending for Emerging Businesses during 2002 was primarily for construction of the Immingham combined heat and power cogeneration plant near the companys Humber refinery in the United Kingdom. Additional investments were made at a domestic power plant in Orange, Texas, and at the companys carbon fibers plant in Ponca City, Oklahoma. Emerging Businesses 2003 capital budget of $248 million is primarily dedicated to the continued construction of the Immingham combined heat and power cogeneration plant. CONTINGENCIES LEGAL AND TAX MATTERS ConocoPhillips accrues for contingencies when a loss is probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated. Based on currently available information, the company believes that it is remote that future costs related to known contingent liability exposures will exceed current accruals by an amount that would have a material adverse impact on the companys financial statements. All significant litigation arising from the June 23, 1999, flash fire that occurred in a reactor vessel at the K Resin styrene butadiene copolymer (SBC) plant at the Houston Chemical Complex has now been resolved. On March 27, 2000, an explosion and fire occurred at the K Resin SBC plant due to the overpressurization of an out of service butadiene storage tank. One employee was killed and several individuals, including employees of both ConocoPhillips and its contractors, were injured. Additionally, individuals who were allegedly in the area of the Houston Chemical Complex at the time of the incident have claimed they suffered various personal injuries due to exposure to the event. The wrongful death claim and the claims of the most seriously injured workers have been resolved. Currently, there are eight lawsuits pending on behalf of approximately 100 primary plaintiffs. Under the indemnification provisions of subcontracting agreements with Zachry and Brock Maintenance, Inc., ConocoPhillips sought indemnification from these subcontractors with respect to claims made by their employees. Although that plant was contributed to CPChem under the Contribution Agreement, ConocoPhillips retains liability for damages arising out of the incident. ENVIRONMENTAL ConocoPhillips and each of its various businesses are subject to the same numerous international, federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations as are other companies in the petroleum exploration and production; and refining, marketing and transportation of crude oil and refined products businesses. The most significant of these environmental laws and regulations include, among others, the: o Federal Clean Air Act, which governs air emissions; o Federal Clean Water Act, which governs discharges to water bodies; o Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), which imposes liability on generators, transporters, and arrangers of hazardous substances at sites where hazardous substance releases have occurred or are threatened to occur; 66 o Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), which governs the treatment, storage, and disposal of solid waste; o Federal Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA90) under which owners and operators of onshore facilities and pipelines, lessees or permittees of an area in which an offshore facility is located, and owners and operators of vessels are liable for removal costs and damages that result from a discharge of oil into navigable waters of the United States; o Federal Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act (EPCRA) which requires facilities to report toxic chemical inventories with local emergency planning committees and responses departments; o Federal Safe Drinking Water Act which governs the disposal of wastewater in underground injections wells; and o U.S. Department of the Interior regulations, which relate to offshore oil and gas operations in U.S. waters and impose liability for the cost of pollution cleanup resulting from the lessees operations and potential liability for pollution damages. These laws and their implementing regulations set limits on emissions and, in the case of discharges to water, establish water quality limits. They also, in most cases, require permits in association with new or modified operations. These permits can require an applicant to collect substantial information in connection with the application process, which can be expensive and time consuming. In addition, there can be delays associated with notice and comment periods and the agencys processing of the application. Many of the delays associated with the permitting process are beyond the control of the applicant. Many states and foreign countries where ConocoPhillips operates also have, or are developing, similar environmental laws and regulations governing the same types of activities. While similar, in some cases these regulations may impose additional, or more stringent, requirements that can add to the cost and difficulty of marketing or transporting products across state and international borders. The ultimate financial impact arising from environmental laws and regulations is neither clearly known nor easily determinable as new standards, such as air emission standards, water quality standards and stricter fuel regulations, continue to evolve. However, environmental laws and regulations are expected to continue to have an increasing impact on ConocoPhillips operations in the United States and in most of the countries in which the company operates. Notable areas of potential impacts include air emission compliance and remediation obligations in the United States. Under the Clean Air Act, the EPA has promulgated a number of stringent limits on air emissions and established a federally mandated operating permit program. Violations of the Clean Air Act are enforceable with civil and criminal sanctions. The EPA has also promulgated specific rules governing the sulfur content of gasoline, known generically as the "Tier II Sulfur Rules," which become applicable to ConocoPhillips gasoline as early as 2004. The company is implementing a compliance strategy for meeting the requirements, including the use of ConocoPhillips proprietary technology known as S Zorb. The company expects to use a combination of technologies to achieve compliance with these rules and has made preliminary estimates of its cost of compliance. These costs will be included in future budgeting for refinery compliance. The EPA has also promulgated sulfur content rules for highway diesel fuel that become applicable in 2006. ConocoPhillips is currently developing and testing an S Zorb system for removing sulfur from diesel fuel. It is anticipated that S Zorb will be used as part of ConocoPhillips strategy for complying with these rules. Because the company is still evaluating and developing capital strategies for compliance with the rule, ConocoPhillips cannot provide precise cost estimates at this time, but will do so and report these compliance costs as required by law. 67 Additional areas of potential air related impacts to ConocoPhillips are the proposed revisions to the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) and the Kyoto Protocol. In July 1997, the EPA promulgated more stringent revisions to the NAAQS for ozone and particulate matter. Since that time, final adoption of these revisions has been the subject of litigation (American Trucking Association, Inc. et al. v. United States Environmental Protection Agency) that eventually reached the U.S. Supreme Court during fall 2000. In February 2001, the U.S. Supreme Court remanded this matter, in part, to the EPA to address the implementation provisions relating to the revised ozone NAAQS. If adopted, the revised NAAQS could result in substantial future environmental expenditures for ConocoPhillips. In 1997, an international conference on global warming concluded an agreement, known as the Kyoto Protocol, which called for reductions of certain emissions that contribute to increases in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. The United States has not ratified the treaty codifying the Kyoto Protocol but may in the future. In addition, other countries where ConocoPhillips has interests, or may have interests in the future, have made commitments to the Kyoto Protocol and are in various stages of formulating applicable regulations. It is not, however, possible to accurately estimate the costs that could be incurred by ConocoPhillips to comply with such regulations, but such expenditures could be substantial. ConocoPhillips also is subject to certain laws and regulations relating to environmental remediation obligations associated with current and past operations. Such laws and regulations include CERCLA and RCRA and their state equivalents. Remediation obligations include cleanup responsibility arising from petroleum releases from underground storage tanks located at numerous past and present ConocoPhillips owned and or operated petroleum marketing outlets throughout the United States. Federal and state laws require that contamination caused by such underground storage tank releases be assessed and remediated to meet applicable standards. In addition to other cleanup standards, many states have adopted cleanup criteria for MTBE for both soil and groundwater. MTBE standards continue to evolve, and future environmental expenditures associated with the remediation of MTBE contaminated underground storage tank sites could be substantial. RCRA requires permitted facilities to undertake an assessment of environmental conditions at the facility. If conditions warrant, ConocoPhillips may be required to remediate contamination caused by prior operations. In contrast to CERCLA, which is often referred to as "Superfund," the cost of corrective action activities under the RCRA corrective action program typically is borne solely by ConocoPhillips. Over the next decade, ConocoPhillips anticipates that significant ongoing expenditures for RCRA remediation activities may be required, but such annual expenditures for the near term are not expected to vary significantly from the range of such expenditures the company has experienced over the past few years. Longer term, expenditures are subject to considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly. ConocoPhillips from time to time receives requests for information or notices of potential liability from the EPA and state environmental agencies alleging that we are a potentially responsible party under CERCLA or an equivalent state statute. On occasion, ConocoPhillips also has been made a party to cost recovery litigation by those agencies or by private parties. These requests, notices and lawsuits assert potential liability for remediation costs at various sites that typically are not owned by ConocoPhillips but allegedly contain wastes attributable to the companys past operations. As of December 31, 2001, the company reported it had been notified of potential liability under CERCLA at 29 sites around the United States. The company also had been notified of potential liability under comparable state laws at 11 sites around the United States. At August 30, 2002, the date of the merger, Conoco had been notified of potential liability under CERCLA and comparable state laws at 24 sites around the United States. At seven of these sites, both Conoco and the company had been notified of potential liability. The resulting total for ConocoPhillips was 57 sites. At December 31, 2002, ConocoPhillips had resolved three of these 68 sites and received four new notices of potential liability, leaving approximately 58 sites where ConocoPhillips has been notified of potential liability. For most Superfund sites, ConocoPhillips potential liability will be significantly less than the total site remediation costs because the percentage of waste attributable to ConocoPhillips versus that attributable to all other potentially responsible parties is relatively low. Although liability of those potentially responsible is generally joint and several for federal sites and frequently so for state sites, other potentially responsible parties at sites where ConocoPhillips is a party typically have had the financial strength to meet their obligations, and where they have not, or where potentially responsible parties could not be located, ConocoPhillips share of liability has not increased materially. Many of the sites at which the company is potentially responsible are still under investigation by the EPA or the state agencies concerned. Prior to actual cleanup, those potentially responsible normally assess site conditions, apportion responsibility and determine the appropriate remediation. In some instances, ConocoPhillips may have no liability or attain a settlement of liability. Actual cleanup costs generally occur after the parties obtain EPA or equivalent state agency approval. There are relatively few sites where ConocoPhillips is a major participant, and neither the cost to ConocoPhillips of remediation at those sites nor such cost at all CERCLA sites in the aggregate is expected to have a material adverse effect on the competitive or financial condition of ConocoPhillips. Expensed environmental costs were $546 million in 2002 and are expected to be approximately $687 million in 2003 and $717 million in 2004. Capitalized environmental costs were $325 million in 2002 and are expected to be approximately $638 million and $718 million in 2003 and 2004, respectively. Remediation Accruals ConocoPhillips accrues for remediation activities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and reasonable estimates of the liability can be made. These accrued liabilities are not reduced for potential recoveries from insurers or other third parties and are not discounted (except, if assumed in a purchase business combination, such costs are recorded on a discounted basis). Many of these liabilities result from CERCLA, RCRA and similar state laws that require the company to undertake certain investigative and remedial activities at sites where it conducts, or once conducted, operations or at sites where ConocoPhillips generated waste was disposed. The accrual also includes a number of sites identified by ConocoPhillips that may require environmental remediation, but which are not currently the subject of CERCLA, RCRA or state enforcement activities. If applicable, undiscounted receivables are accrued for probable insurance or other third party recoveries. In the future, ConocoPhillips may incur significant costs under both CERCLA and RCRA. Considerable uncertainty exists with respect to these costs, and under adverse changes in circumstances, potential liability may exceed amounts accrued as of December 31, 2002. Remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site, depending on the mix of unique site characteristics, evolving remediation technologies, diverse regulatory agencies and enforcement policies, and the presence or absence of potentially liable third parties. Therefore, it is difficult to develop reasonable estimates of future site remediation costs. At December 31, 2002, ConocoPhillips balance sheet included a total environmental accrual of $743 million, compared with $439 million at December 31, 2001, an increase of $304 million, primarily resulting from the merger. The majority of these expenditures are expected to be incurred within the next 30 years. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing and as with other companies engaged in similar businesses, environmental costs and liabilities are inherent in ConocoPhillips operations and products, and there can be no assurance that material costs and liabilities will not be incurred. However, ConocoPhillips currently 69 does not expect any material adverse effect upon its results of operations or financial position as a result of compliance with environmental laws and regulations. OTHER ConocoPhillips has deferred tax assets related to certain accrued liabilities, alternative minimum tax credits, and loss carryforwards. Valuation allowances have been established for certain foreign and state net operating loss carryforwards that reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that will, more likely than not, be realized. Uncertainties that may affect the realization of these assets include tax law changes and the future level of product prices and costs. Based on the companys historical taxable income, its expectations for the future, and available tax planning strategies, management expects that the net deferred tax assets will be realized as offsets to reversing deferred tax liabilities and as reductions in future taxable income. The alternative minimum tax credit can be carried forward indefinitely to reduce the companys regular tax liability. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS There are a number of new FASB Statements of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) and Interpretations that ConocoPhillips implemented either in December 2002 or January 2003, as required: SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations;" SFAS No. 145, "Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections;" SFAS No. 146, "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities;" SFAS No. 148, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure;" Interpretation No. 45, "Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others;" and Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities." In addition, in 2003, the FASB is expected to issue SFAS No. 149, "Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Liabilities and Equity." For additional information about these, see Note 27 New Accounting Standards in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which is incorporated herein by reference. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to select appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. See Note 1 Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for descriptions of the companys major accounting policies. Certain of these accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is a reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts would have been reported under different conditions, or if different assumptions had been used. OIL AND GAS ACCOUNTING Accounting for oil and gas exploratory activity is subject to special accounting rules that are unique to the oil and gas industry. The acquisition of geological and geophysical seismic information, prior to the discovery of proved reserves, is expensed as incurred, similar to accounting for research and development costs. However, leasehold acquisition costs and exploratory well costs are capitalized on the balance sheet, pending determination of whether proved oil and gas reserves have been discovered on the prospect. 70 Property Acquisition Costs For individually significant leaseholds, management periodically assesses for impairment based on exploration and drilling efforts to date. For leasehold acquisition costs that individually are relatively small, management exercises judgment and determines a percentage probability that the prospect ultimately will fail to find proved oil and gas reserves and pools that leasehold information with others in the geographic area. For prospects in areas that have had limited, or no, previous exploratory drilling, the percentage probability of ultimate failure is normally judged to be quite high. This judgmental percentage is multiplied by the leasehold acquisition cost, and that product is divided by the contractual period of the leasehold to determine a periodic leasehold impairment charge that is reported in exploration expense. This judgmental probability percentage is reassessed and adjusted throughout the contractual period of the leasehold based on favorable or unfavorable exploratory activity on the leasehold or on adjacent leaseholds, and leasehold impairment amortization expense is adjusted prospectively. By the end of the contractual period of the leasehold, the impairment probability percentage will have been adjusted to 100 percent if the leasehold is expected to be abandoned, or will have been adjusted to zero percent if there is an oil or gas discovery that is under development. See the supplemental Oil and Gas Operations disclosures about Costs Incurred and Capitalized Costs for more information about the amounts and geographic locations of costs incurred in acquisition activity, and the amounts on the balance sheet related to unproved properties. Exploratory Costs For exploratory wells, drilling costs are temporarily capitalized, or "suspended," on the balance sheet, pending a judgmental determination of whether potentially economic oil and gas reserves have been discovered by the drilling effort. This judgment usually is made within two months of the completion of the drilling effort, but can take longer, depending on the complexity of the geologic structure. Accounting rules require that this judgment be made at least within one year of well completion. If a judgment is made that the well did not encounter potentially economic oil and gas quantities, the well costs are expensed as a dry hole and are reported in exploration expense. Exploratory wells that are judged to have discovered potentially economic quantities of oil and gas and that are in areas where a major capital expenditure (e.g., a pipeline or offshore platform) would be required before production could begin, and where the economic viability of that major capital expenditure depends upon the successful completion of further exploratory work in the area, remain capitalized on the balance sheet as long as additional exploratory appraisal work is under way or firmly planned. For complicated offshore exploratory discoveries, it is not unusual to have exploratory wells remain suspended on the balance sheet for several years while the company performs additional appraisal drilling and seismic work on the potential oil and gas field. Unlike leasehold acquisition costs, there is no periodic impairment assessment of suspended exploratory well costs. Management continuously monitors the results of the additional appraisal drilling and seismic work and expenses the suspended well costs as dry holes when it judges that the potential field does not warrant further exploratory efforts in the near term. See the supplemental Oil and Gas Operations disclosures about Costs Incurred and Capitalized Costs for more information about the amounts and geographic locations of costs incurred in exploration activity and the amounts on the balance sheet related to unproved properties, as well as the Wells In Progress disclosure for the number and geographic location of wells not yet declared productive or dry. Proved Oil and Gas Reserves Engineering estimates of the quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves in oil and gas fields are inherently imprecise and represent only approximate amounts because of the subjective judgments involved in developing such information. Despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates, accounting rules require supplemental disclosure of "proved" oil and gas reserve estimates due to the importance of these estimates to better understanding the perceived value and future cash flows of a companys oil and gas operations. The judgmental estimation of proved oil and gas reserves is also important to the income statement because the proved oil and gas reserve estimate for a field serves as the 71 denominator in the unit of production calculation of depreciation, depletion and amortization of the capitalized costs for that field. There are several authoritative guidelines regarding the engineering criteria that have to be met before estimated oil and gas reserves can be designated as "proved." The companys reservoir engineering department has policies and procedures in place that are consistent with these authoritative guidelines. The company has qualified and experienced internal engineering personnel who make these estimates. Proved reserve estimates are updated annually and take into account recent production and seismic information about each field. Also, as required by authoritative guidelines, the estimated future date when a field will be permanently shut in for economic reasons is based on an extrapolation of oil and gas prices and operating costs prevalent at the balance sheet date. This estimated date when production will end affects the amount of estimated recoverable reserves. Therefore, as prices and cost levels change from year to year, the estimate of proved reserves also changes. Canadian Syncrude Reserves Canadian Syncrude proven reserves cannot be measured precisely. Reserve estimates of Canadian Syncrude are based on subjective judgments involving geological and engineering assessments of in place crude bitumen volume, the mining plan, historical extraction recovery and upgrading yield factors, installed plant operating capacity and operating approval limits. The reliability of these estimates at any point in time depends on both the quality and quantity of the technical and economic data and the efficiency of extracting the bitumen and upgrading it into a light sweet crude oil. Despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates, these estimates are used in determining depreciation expense. IMPAIRMENT OF ASSETS Long lived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in the future cash flows expected to be generated by an asset group. If, upon review, the sum of the undiscounted pretax cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset group, the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value. Individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes based on a judgmental assessment of the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets generally on a field by field basis for exploration and production assets, at an entire complex level for downstream assets, or at a site level for retail stores. Because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for long lived assets, the fair value usually is based on the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates commensurate with the risks involved in the asset group. The expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are based on judgmental assessments of future production volumes, prices and costs, considering all available information at the date of review. See Note 10 Impairments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. DISMANTLEMENT, REMOVAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS Under various contracts, permits and regulations, the company has material legal obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore the land or seabed at the end of operations at production sites. The largest asset removal obligations facing ConocoPhillips involve removal and disposal of offshore oil and gas platforms around the world, and oil and gas production facilities and pipelines in Alaska. The estimated undiscounted costs, net of salvage values, of dismantling and removing these facilities are accrued, using primarily the unit of production method, over the productive life of the asset. Estimating the future asset removal costs necessary for this accounting calculation is difficult. Most of these removal obligations are many years in the future and the contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what removal practices and criteria will have to be met when the removal event actually occurs. Asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing, as well as political, environmental, safety and public relations considerations. See Note 11 Accrued Dismantlement, Removal and Environmental Costs in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 72 BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS Purchase Price Allocation Accounting for the acquisition of a business requires the allocation of the purchase price to the various assets and liabilities of the acquired business. For most assets and liabilities, purchase price allocation is accomplished by recording the asset or liability at its estimated fair value. The most difficult estimations of individual fair values are those involving properties, plants and equipment and identifiable intangible assets. The company uses all available information to make these fair value determinations and, for major business acquisitions, typically engages an outside appraisal firm to assist in the fair value determination of the acquired long lived assets. The company has, if necessary, up to one year after the acquisition closing date to finish these fair value determinations and finalize the purchase price allocation. Intangible Assets and Goodwill In connection with the acquisition of Tosco Corporation on September 14, 2001, and the merger on August 30, 2002, the company recorded material intangible assets for tradenames, air emission permit credits, and permits to operate refineries. These intangible assets were determined to have indefinite useful lives and so are not amortized. This judgmental assessment of an indefinite useful life has to be continuously evaluated in the future. If, due to changes in facts and circumstances, management determines that these intangible assets then have definite useful lives, amortization will have to commence at that time on a prospective basis. As long as these intangible assets are judged to have indefinite lives, they will be subject to periodic lower of cost or market tests, which requires managements judgment of the estimated fair value of these intangible assets. See Note 6 Acquisition of Tosco Corporation, Note 3 Merger of Conoco and Phillips, and Note 10 Impairments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Also in connection with the acquisition of Tosco and the merger, the company recorded a material amount of goodwill. Under the accounting rules for goodwill, this intangible asset is not amortized. Instead, goodwill is subject to annual reviews for impairment based on a two step accounting test. The first step is to compare the estimated fair value of any reporting units within the company that have recorded goodwill with the recorded net book value (including the goodwill) of the reporting unit. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is higher than the recorded net book value, no impairment is deemed to exist and no further testing is required that year. If, however, the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is below the recorded net book value, then a second step must be performed to determine the amount of the goodwill impairment to record, if any. In this second step, the estimated fair value from the first step is used as the purchase price in a hypothetical new acquisition of the reporting unit. The various purchase business combination rules are followed to determine a hypothetical purchase price allocation for the reporting units assets and liabilities. The residual amount of goodwill that results from this hypothetical purchase price allocation is compared with the recorded amount of goodwill for the reporting unit, and the recorded amount is written down to the hypothetical amount if lower. Because quoted market prices for the companys reporting units are not available, management has to apply judgment in determining the estimated fair value of its reporting units for purposes of performing the first step of this periodic goodwill impairment test. Management uses all available information to make these fair value determinations and may engage an outside appraisal firm for assistance. In addition, if the first test step is not met, further judgment has to be applied in determining the fair values of individual assets and liabilities for purposes of the hypothetical purchase price allocation. Again, management has to use all available information to make these fair value determinations and may engage an outside appraisal firm for assistance. At year end 2002, the estimated fair values of the companys domestic refining and marketing reporting units, excluding those acquired in the merger and those included in discontinued operations, were more than 10 percent higher than the recorded net book values (including the Tosco goodwill) of the reporting units. However, a lower fair value estimate in the future could result in impairment of the remaining $2.4 billion 73 of Tosco goodwill. The allocation of goodwill attributable to the ConocoPhillips merger to reporting units, and its sensitivity to future impairment, will occur after the final allocation of the purchase price in 2003. INVENTORY VALUATION Prior to the acquisition of Tosco in September 2001 and the merger in August 2002, the companys inventories on the last in, first out (LIFO) cost basis were predominantly reflected on the balance sheet at historical cost layers established many years ago, when price levels were much lower. Therefore, prior to 2001, the companys LIFO inventories were relatively insensitive to current price level changes. However, the acquisition of Tosco and the merger added LIFO cost layers that were recorded at replacement cost levels prevalent in late September 2001 and August 2002, respectively. As a result, the companys LIFO cost inventories are now much more sensitive to lower of cost or market impairment write downs, whenever price levels fall. ConocoPhillips recorded a LIFO inventory lower of cost or market impairment in the fourth quarter of 2001 due to a crude oil price deterioration. While crude oil is not the only product in the companys LIFO pools, its market value is a major factor in lower of cost or market calculations. The company estimates that additional impairments could occur if a 60 percent/40 percent blended average of West Texas Intermediate/Brent crude oil prices falls below $21.75 per barrel at a reporting date. The determination of replacement cost values for the lower of cost or market test uses objective evidence, but does involve judgment in determining the most appropriate objective evidence to use in the calculations. PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS Determination of the projected benefit obligations for the companys defined benefit pension and postretirement plans are important to the recorded amounts for such obligations on the balance sheet and to the amount of benefit expense in the income statement. This also impacts the required company contributions into the plans. The actuarial determination of projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements involves judgment about uncertain future events, including estimated retirement dates, salary levels at retirement, mortality rates, lump sum election rates, rates of return on plan assets, future health care cost trend rates, and rates of utilization of health care services by retirees. Due to the specialized nature of these calculations, the company engages outside actuarial firms to assist in the determination of these projected benefit obligations. For Employee Retirement Income Security Act qualified pension plans, the actuary exercises fiduciary care on behalf of plan participants in the determination of the judgmental assumptions used in determining required company contributions into plan assets. Due to differing objectives and requirements between financial accounting rules and the pension plan funding regulations promulgated by governmental agencies, the actuarial methods and assumptions for the two purposes differ in certain important respects. Ultimately, the company will be required to fund all promised benefits under pension and postretirement benefit plans not funded by plan assets or investment returns, but the judgmental assumptions used in the actuarial calculations significantly affect periodic financial statements and funding patterns over time. Benefit expense is particularly sensitive to the discount rate and return on plan assets assumptions. A 1 percent decrease in the discount rate would increase annual benefit expense by $79 million, while a 1 percent decrease in the return on plan assets assumption would increase annual benefit expense by $21 million. OUTLOOK As a condition to the merger, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) required that both Conoco and Phillips divest certain assets. In the fourth quarter of 2002, the propane terminal assets at Jefferson City, Missouri, and East St. Louis, Illinois, were sold and ConocoPhillips agreed to sell its Woods Cross business unit in Salt Lake City, Utah, plus associated assets. See Note 4 Discontinued Operations in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a list of the remaining assets held for sale. 74 In December 2002, ConocoPhillips committed to and initiated a plan to sell a substantial portion of its company owned retail sites. In connection with the anticipated sale, the company, in the fourth quarter, recorded charges totaling $1,412 million before tax, $1,008 million after tax, primarily related to the impairment of properties, plants and equipment; goodwill; intangible assets and provision for losses and penalties to unwind various lease arrangements. The company expects to complete the sale of the sites in 2003. In December of 2002, political unrest in Venezuela caused economic and other disruptions which shut down most oil production in Venezuela, including the companys Petrozuata, Hamaca and Gulf of Paria operations. At ConocoPhillips Petrozuata joint venture, operations were closed down on December 15, 2002, due to shortages of hydrogen and natural gas (required for processing and fuel). Prior to the disruptions, Petrozuata was producing and processing approximately 120,000 gross (60,000 net) barrels of extra heavy crude oil per day. Similarly, the disruptions have impacted development production and construction progress at the Hamaca joint venture project. Construction of the Hamaca upgrader continues, although at a reduced rate. Difficulty in obtaining supplies has been the primary impediment. Production was shut in on December 6, 2002. Prior to the disruptions, Hamaca was producing approximately 55,000 gross (18,000 net) barrels of extra heavy crude per day. In addition, the crude oil produced by Petrozuata is used as feedstock for ConocoPhillips Lake Charles, Louisiana, refinery and a Venezuelan refinery operated by PDVSA. In December 2002, ConocoPhillips substituted about 1.2 million crude barrels for its Lake Charles refinery. At the companys Sweeny refinery, crude throughputs were reduced slightly due to short supply of Merey Venezuelan crude oil. Overall, there was minimum impact to net income; however, it could reduce net income $30 million to $50 million per month in 2003 as long as production at Petrozuata and Hamaca is shut in. Limited production began from Hamaca and Petrozuata in February 2003. On March 12, 2002, ConocoPhillips announced that it had signed a Heads of Agreement (LNG HOA) with The Tokyo Electric Power Company, Incorporated (TEPCO) and Tokyo Gas Co., Ltd. (Tokyo Gas) that would enable Phase II, which involves the export and sale of natural gas, of the Bayu Undan field development to proceed upon resolution of certain legal, regulatory and fiscal issues. The Timor Sea Treaty (Treaty) was ratified by Timor Leste (formerly East Timor) in December 2002 and by Australia in March 2003 and is subject to certain procedural events before it is fully effective. The Treaty will allow the issuance of new production sharing contracts to the existing contractors in the Bayu Undan unit, which when combined with the expected approval of the Development Plan and the expected enactment of certain Timor Leste legislation will provide the legal, regulatory and fiscal basis necessary to proceed with the gas project. Under the terms of the LNG HOA with TEPCO and Tokyo Gas, TEPCO and Tokyo Gas will purchase 3 million tons per year of liquefied natural gas (LNG) for a period of 17 years, utilizing natural gas from the Bayu Undan field. Shipments would begin in 2006, from an LNG facility near Darwin, Australia, utilizing ConocoPhillips Optimized Cascade liquefied natural gas process. In 2003, ConocoPhillips expects worldwide production of approximately 1.55 million barrels of oil equivalent per day from currently proved reserves. Improvements for the year are expected to come from the United Kingdom, Norway and China. These improvements will be offset by decreases in the U.S. Lower 48 and Canada as a result of the disposition of assets, as well as the impact of the disruptions in Venezuela. In R&M, crude oil throughputs in 2003 are expected to average approximately 2.5 million barrels per day. Crude oil and natural gas prices are subject to external factors over which the company has no control, such as global economic conditions, political events, demand growth, inventory levels, weather, competing fuels prices and availability of supply. Crude oil prices increased significantly during 2002 due to production restraint by major exporting countries serving to rebalance inventories, supply concerns resulting from Middle East tensions, tropical storms in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico temporarily shutting in oil 75 production and shipping, and the disruptions in Venezuela. Global oil demand is starting to recover on a year over year basis, compared with the declines that resulted from the U.S. recession and the events of September 11, 2001. However, the pace of improvement will depend on a continuation of the economic recovery in the United States and globally. Conflicts in oil producing countries and uncertainties surrounding the global economic recovery could keep prices volatile in 2003. U.S. natural gas prices strengthened considerably at the end of the third quarter and remained strong in the fourth quarter stemming from growing natural gas supply concerns, rising oil prices and an increased demand due to the weather. Supply concerns arose from the decline in domestic gas production and Canadian imports versus 2001, and tropical storms temporarily shutting in production in the Gulf of Mexico. Refining margins are subject to movements in the price of crude oil and other feedstocks, and the prices of petroleum products, which are subject to market factors over which the company has no control, such as the U.S. and global economies; government regulations; seasonal factors that affect demand, such as the summer driving months; and the levels of refining output and product inventories. Global refining margins remained depressed during much of 2002 due to weak oil demand, relatively high levels of gasoline and distillate inventories and strengthening crude prices, which increased feedstock costs. As a result of tropical storms in the Gulf of Mexico, industry refining crude oil runs were temporarily reduced, which caused product inventory draws in the United States and improved refining margins modestly. Refining and marketing margins can be expected to improve when the U.S. and global economies recover. CAUTIONARY STATEMENT FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE "SAFE HARBOR" PROVISIONS OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995 This annual report includes forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward looking statements can be identified by the words "expects," "anticipates," "intends," "plans," "projects," "believes," "estimates" and similar expressions. ConocoPhillips has based the forward looking statements relating to its operations on its current expectations, estimates and projections about ConocoPhillips and the industries in which it operates in general. ConocoPhillips cautions you that these statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that the company cannot predict. In addition, ConocoPhillips has based many of these forward looking statements on assumptions about future events that may prove to be inaccurate. Accordingly, ConocoPhillips actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what the company has expressed or forecast in the forward looking statements. Any differences could result from a variety of factors, including the following: o fluctuations in crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices, refining and marketing margins and margins for ConocoPhillips chemicals business; o changes in the business, operations, results and prospects of ConocoPhillips; o the operation and financing of ConocoPhillips midstream and chemicals joint ventures; o potential failure to realize fully or within the expected time frame the expected cost savings and synergies from the combination of Conoco and Phillips; o costs or difficulties related to the integration of the businesses of Conoco and Phillips, as well as the continued integration of businesses recently acquired by each of them; 76 o potential failure or delays in achieving expected reserve or production levels from existing and future oil and gas development projects due to operating hazards, drilling risks and the inherent uncertainties in predicting oil and gas reserves and oil and gas reservoir performance; o unsuccessful exploratory drilling activities; o failure of new products and services to achieve market acceptance; o unexpected cost increases or technical difficulties in constructing or modifying facilities for exploration and production projects, manufacturing or refining; o unexpected difficulties in manufacturing or refining ConocoPhillips refined products, including synthetic crude oil, and chemicals products; o lack of, or disruptions in, adequate and reliable transportation for ConocoPhillips crude oil, natural gas and refined products; o inability to timely obtain or maintain permits, comply with government regulations or make capital expenditures required to maintain compliance; o potential disruption or interruption of ConocoPhillips facilities due to accidents, political events or terrorism; o international monetary conditions and exchange controls; o liability for remedial actions, including removal and reclamation obligations, under environmental regulations; o liability resulting from litigation; o general domestic and international economic and political conditions, including armed hostilities and governmental disputes over territorial boundaries; o changes in tax and other laws or regulations applicable to ConocoPhillips business; and o inability to obtain economical financing for exploration and development projects, construction or modification of facilities and general corporate purposes. 77 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT MARKET RISK ConocoPhillips and certain of its subsidiaries hold and issue derivative contracts and financial instruments that expose cash flows or earnings to changes in commodity prices, foreign exchange rates or interest rates. The company may use financial and commodity based derivative contracts to manage the risks produced by changes in the prices of electric power, natural gas, and crude oil and related products, fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, or to exploit market opportunities. With the completion of the merger on August 30, 2002, the derivatives policy adopted during the third quarter of 2001 is no longer in effect; however, the ConocoPhillips Board of Directors has approved an "Authority Limitations" document that prohibits the use of highly leveraged derivatives or derivative instruments without sufficient liquidity for comparable valuations without approval from the Chief Executive Officer. The Authority Limitations document also authorizes the Chief Executive Officer to establish the maximum Value at Risk (VaR) limits for the company. Compliance with these limits is monitored daily. The function of the Risk Management Steering Committee, monitoring the use and effectiveness of derivatives, was assumed by the Chief Financial Officer for risks resulting from foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, and by the Executive Vice President of Commercial, a new position that reports to the Chief Executive Officer, for commodity price risk. ConocoPhillips Commercial Group manages commercial marketing, optimizes the commodity flows and positions of the company, monitors related risks of the companys upstream and downstream businesses, and selectively takes price risk to add value. Commodity Price Risk ConocoPhillips operates in the worldwide crude oil, refined product, natural gas, natural gas liquids, and electric power markets and is exposed to fluctuations in the prices for these commodities. These fluctuations can affect the companys revenues as well as the cost of operating, investing, and financing activities. Generally, the companys policy is to remain exposed to market prices of commodities; however, executive management may elect to use derivative instruments to hedge the price risk of the companys equity crude oil and natural gas production, as well as refinery margins. The ConocoPhillips Commercial Group uses futures, forwards, swaps, and options in various markets to optimize the value of the companys supply chain, which may move the companys risk profile away from market average prices to accomplish the following objectives: o Balance physical systems. In addition to cash settlement prior to contract expiration, exchange traded futures contracts may also be settled by physical delivery of the commodity, providing another source of supply to meet the companys refinery requirements or marketing demand; o Meet customer needs. Consistent with the companys policy to generally remain exposed to market prices, the company uses swap contracts to convert fixed price sales contracts, which are often requested by natural gas and refined product consumers, to a floating market price; o Manage the risk to the companys cash flows from price exposures on specific crude oil, natural gas, refined product and electric power transactions; and 78 o Enable the company to use the market knowledge gained from these activities to do a limited amount of trading not directly related to the companys physical business. For the 12 months ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, the gains or losses from this activity were not material to the companys cash flows or income from continuing operations. ConocoPhillips uses a VaR model to estimate the loss in fair value that could potentially result on a single day from the effect of adverse changes in market conditions on the derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments held or issued, including commodity purchase and sales contracts recorded on the balance sheet at December 31, 2002, as derivative instruments in accordance with SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," as amended. Using Monte Carlo simulation, a 95 percent confidence level and a one day holding period, the VaR for those instruments issued or held for trading purposes at December 31, 2002 and 2001, was $0.7 million at each year end. The VaR for instruments held for purposes other than trading at December 31, 2002 and 2001, was $2 million and $1.7 million, respectively. Interest Rate Risk The following tables provide information about the companys financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. The debt tables present principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates; the derivative table shows the notional quantities on which the cash flows will be calculated by swap termination date. Weighted average variable rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at the reporting date. The carrying amount of the companys floating rate debt approximates its fair value. The fair value of the fixed rate financial instruments is estimated based on quoted market prices. 79 Millions of Dollars Except as Indicated Mandatorily Redeemable Other Minority Interests and Debt Preferred Securities Expected Fixed Average Floating Average Fixed Average Maturity Rate Interest Rate Interest Rate Interest Date Maturity Rate Maturity Rate Maturity Rate YEAR END 2002 2003 $ 762 7.99% $ 706 2.60% $ % 2004 1,362 5.91 2005 1,169 8.49 2006 1,507 5.82 1,517 4.54 2007 613 4.88 Remaining years 10,740 6.95 691 6.02 491 7.96 Total $16,153 $ 2,914 $ 491 Fair value $17,930 $ 2,914 $ 516 Year End 2001 2002 $ 43 9.31% $ % $ % 2003 255 7.60 2004 6 7.02 2005 1,155 8.49 2006 246 7.61 1,081 7.06 Remaining years 5,134 7.99 625 6.86 650 8.11 Total $ 6,839 $ 1,706 $ 650 Fair value $ 7,469 $ 1,706 $ 662 Interest Rate Derivatives at December 31, 2002 Floating to Fixed Expected Maturity Date Notional Average Pay Rate Average Receive Rate 2003 $ 500 3.41% 2.56% 2004 2005 2006 166 5.85 4.76 2007 Remaining years Total $ 666 Fair value loss position $ 22 80 Foreign Currency Risk ConocoPhillips has foreign currency exchange rate risk resulting from operations in over 40 countries around the world. ConocoPhillips does not comprehensively hedge the exposure to currency rate changes, although the company may choose to selectively hedge exposures to foreign currency rate risk. Examples include firm commitments for capital projects, certain local currency tax payments and dividends, and cash returns from net investments in foreign affiliates to be remitted within the coming year. At December 31, 2002, ConocoPhillips had the following significant foreign currency derivative contracts: o approximately $194 million in foreign currency swaps hedging the companys European commercial paper program, with a fair value of $7.1 million; o approximately $536 million in foreign currency swaps hedging short term intercompany loans between U.K. subsidiaries and a U.S. subsidiary, with a fair value of $9 million; and o approximately $24 million in foreign currency swaps hedging the companys firm purchase and sales commitments for gasoline in Germany, with a negative fair value of $4 million. Although these swaps hedge exposures to fluctuations in exchange rates, the company elected not to utilize hedge accounting as allowed by SFAS No. 133. As a result, the change in the fair value of these foreign currency swaps is recorded directly in earnings. Assuming an adverse hypothetical 10 percent change in the December 31, 2002, exchange rates, the potential foreign currency remeasurement loss in non cash pretax earning from these swaps, intercompany loans, and commercial paper would be approximately $3 million. In addition to the intercompany loans discussed above, at December 31, 2002 and 2001, U.S. subsidiaries held long term sterling denominated intercompany receivables totaling $152 million and $191 million, respectively, due from a U.K. subsidiary. The U.K. subsidiary also held a dollar denominated long term receivable due from a U.S. subsidiary with no balance at December 31, 2002, and a $75 million balance at December 31, 2001. A Norwegian subsidiary held $198 million and $79 million of intercompany U.S. dollar denominated receivables due from its U.S. parent at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Also at year end 2001, a foreign subsidiary with the U.S. dollar as its functional currency owed a $9 million Norwegian kroner denominated payable to a Norwegian subsidiary. The potential foreign currency remeasurement gains or losses in non cash pretax earnings from a hypothetical 10 percent change in the year end 2002 and 2001 exchange rates from these intercompany balances were $35 million and $21 million, respectively.
