RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Merger of Conoco and Phillips On August 30, 2002, Conoco Inc. (Conoco) and Phillips Petroleum Company (Phillips) combined their businesses by merging with wholly owned subsidiaries of a new company named ConocoPhillips (the merger). The merger was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting, with Phillips designated as the acquirer for accounting purposes. Because Phillips was designated as the acquirer, its operations and results are presented in this annual report for all periods prior to the close of the merger. From the merger date forward, the operations and results of ConocoPhillips reflect the combined operations of the two companies. Business Environment and Executive Summary Our overall earnings depend primarily upon the profitability of our Exploration and Production (EP) and Refining and Marketing (RM) segments. Our earnings normally are less impacted by results from the Midstream, Chemicals and Emerging Businesses segments. Crude oil and natural gas prices, along with refining margins, play the most significant roles in our profitability. These prices and margins are driven by market factors over which we have no control. However, from a competitive perspective, there are other important factors that we must manage well to be successful, including: Operating our producing properties and refining and marketing operations safely, consistently and in an environmentally sound manner. Safety is our first priority and we are committed to protecting the health and safety of everyone who has a role in our operations. Consistently high utilization rates at our refineries, minimizing downtime in producing fields, and maximizing the development of our reserves all enable us to capture the value the market gives us in terms of prices and margins. Finally, our operations are conducted in a manner that emphasizes our environmental stewardship. 39 Table of Contents Controlling costs and expenses. Since we cannot control the prices of the commodity products we sell, keeping our operating and overhead costs low, within the context of our commitment to safety and environmental stewardship, is a top priority. We monitor these costs using various methodologies that are reported to senior management monthly, on both an absolute dollar basis and a per unit basis. Low operating and overhead costs are critical to maintaining competitive positions in our industries, as such, cost control is a component of our variable compensation programs. Selecting the appropriate projects in which to invest our capital dollars. We participate in capital intensive industries. As a result, we must often invest significant capital dollars to explore for new oil and gas fields, develop newly discovered fields, maintain existing fields, or continue to maintain and improve our refinery complexes. We invest in those projects that are expected to provide an adequate financial return on invested dollars. However, there are often long lead times from the time we make an investment to the time that investment is operational and begins generating financial returns. Our capital spending in 2003 totaled $6.2 billion, and we anticipate capital spending to be approximately $6.9 billion in 2004. Evaluating our asset portfolio. We continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire assets that will contribute to future growth at competitive prices. We also continually assess our assets to determine if any no longer fit our growth strategy and should be sold or otherwise disposed. This management of our asset portfolio is important to ensuring our long term growth and maintaining adequate financial returns. Hiring, developing and retaining a talented workforce. We want to attract, train, develop and retain individuals with the knowledge and skills to implement our business strategy and who support our values and ethics. Many of our key performance indicators are shown in the statistical tables provided at the beginning of our operating segment sections that follow. These include crude oil and natural gas prices and production, natural gas liquids prices, refining capacity utilization, and refinery output. We also use the return on capital employed measure. Other significant factors that can and or do affect our profitability include: Property and leasehold impairments. As mentioned above, we participate in capital intensive industries. At times, these investments become impaired when our reserve estimates are revised downward, when crude oil or natural gas prices decline significantly for long periods of time, or when a decision to dispose of an asset leads to a write down to fair market value. Also, at times we invest large amounts of money in exploration blocks which, if exploratory drilling proves unsuccessful, could lead to material impairment of leasehold values. Goodwill. As a result of recent mergers and acquisitions, we have a significant amount of goodwill on our balance sheet. Although our latest tests indicate that no goodwill impairment is currently required, future deterioration in market conditions could lead to goodwill impairments that would have a substantial negative affect on the companys profitability. Tax jurisdictions. As a global company, our operations are located in countries with different tax rates and fiscal structures. Accordingly, our overall effective tax rate can vary significantly between periods based on the mix of earnings within our global operations. 40 Table of Contents Segment Analysis The EP segments results are most closely linked to crude oil and natural gas prices. These are commodity products, the prices of which are subject to factors external to our company and over which we have no control. We benefited from favorable crude oil prices in 2003, which contributed significantly to what we view as strong results from this segment in 2003. For a discussion of factors impacting crude oil and natural gas prices in 2003, as well as our view of the potential movement of these prices into 2004, see the Outlook section. At year end 2003, we estimated that a $1 per barrel change in crude oil prices would have an estimated $170 million annual impact on net income. For natural gas, the corresponding impact is approximately $40 million for a 10 cent per thousand cubic feet price change. The Midstream segments results are most closely linked to natural gas liquids prices. The most important factor on the profitability of this segment is the results from our 30.3 percent equity investment in Duke Energy Field Services, LLC (DEFS). Higher natural gas liquids prices improved results from this segment in 2003. In early 2004, we approved the disposal of some of our non DEFS Midstream assets located in the Lower 48 states that are not associated with our EP operations. Refining margins, refinery utilization, cost control, and marketing margins primarily drive the RM segments results. Refining margins are subject to movements in the cost of crude oil and other feedstocks, and the sales prices for refined products, which are subject to market factors over which we have no control. Refining margins in 2003 were much improved over 2002, resulting in improved RM profitability. See the Outlook section for further discussion of refining margins in 2003 and our view of their potential movement into 2004. At year end 2003, we estimated that a 25 cent per barrel change in refining margins would have an estimated $125 million annual impact on net income. For wholesale marketing margins, the corresponding impact is approximately $100 million for a 1 cent per gallon margin change. Our refineries operated at 94 percent of rated capacity in 2003, and our goal in 2004 is to operate at about the same level. The Chemicals segment consists of our 50 percent interest in Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC (CPChem). The chemicals and plastics industry is mainly a commodity based industry where the margins for key products are based on market factors over which CPChem has little or no control. The chemicals and plastics industry has been in a cyclical downturn for the last several years. In this difficult market environment, CPChem has placed great emphasis on safety, cost control and managing its capacity utilization. In addition, CPChem is investing in feedstock advantaged areas in the Middle East with access to large, growing markets, such as Asia. With its low cost structure, we feel CPChem is well positioned to benefit from improved margins when the chemicals industry emerges from its downturn. The Emerging Businesses segment represents our investment in new technologies or businesses outside our normal scope of operations. We do not expect the results from this segment to be material to our consolidated results. However, the businesses in this segment allow us to support our primary segments by staying current on new technologies that could become important drivers of profitability in future years. At December 31, 2003, we had a debt to capital ratio of 34 percent. We have made a priority of using funds available after paying dividends and capital spending to reduce debt. We reduced our debt by $4.8 billion in 2003. We feel that by lowering our debt to capital ratio over the next several years to about 30 percent, we can improve our cost of capital and further position ourselves for growth opportunities in the future. 41 Table of Contents Consolidated Results Millions of Dollars Years Ended December 31 2003 2002 2001 Income from continuing operations $ 4,593 698 1,601 Income (loss) from discontinued operations 237 (993 ) 32 Cumulative effect of accounting changes (95 )* 28 Net income (loss) $ 4,735 (295 ) 1,661 * Includes a $107 million charge related to discontinued operations. A summary of the companys net income (loss) by business segment follows: Millions of Dollars Years Ended December 31 2003 2002 2001 Exploration and Production (EP) $ 4,302 1,749 1,699 Midstream 130 55 120 Refining and Marketing (RM) 1,272 143 397 Chemicals 7 (14 ) (128 ) Emerging Businesses (99 ) (310 ) (12 ) Corporate and Other* (877 ) (1,918 ) (415 ) Net income (loss) $ 4,735 (295 ) 1,661 * Includes income (loss) from discontinued operations. 2003 vs. 2002 Net income was $4,735 million in 2003, compared with a net loss of $295 million in 2002. The improved results in 2003 were primarily due to: Increased EP and RM production volumes as a result of the merger; Higher crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids prices in our EP segment; Improved refining and marketing margins in our RM segment; Lower impairments and lease loss accruals related to discontinued operations; and Lower merger related expenses in 2003, compared with 2002. See the Segment Results section for additional information on our EP and RM results, as well as our other reporting segments. 2002 vs. 2001 We incurred a net loss of $295 million in 2002, compared with net income of $1,661 million in 2001. The decrease was primarily attributable to recognizing impairments and loss accruals totaling $1,077 million after tax associated with our retail and wholesale marketing operations that were classified as discontinued operations in late 2002, as well as merger related costs totaling $557 million after tax. Also negatively impacting results for 2002 were other asset impairments totaling $192 million after tax, lower refining 42 Table of Contents margins, lower natural gas sales prices, decreased equity earnings from Duke Energy Field Services, LLC (DEFS), and higher interest expense. These factors were partially offset by improved results from Chemicals and higher production volumes in EP after the merger. Income Statement Analysis 2003 vs. 2002 The merger affects the comparability of the 2003 and 2002 periods. 2003 includes a full year of ConocoPhillips operations, while 2002 includes only four months of combined operations. Prior to August 30, 2002, our results reflect Phillips operations only. Accordingly, the merger significantly increased: Sales revenues and purchase costs due to higher volumes of products being bought and sold; Equity earnings due to an increased number of equity affiliates; Production and operating expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses due to the increased size and scope of operations following the merger, partially offset by lower merger related costs in 2003; Depreciation, depletion and amortization due to the increased depreciable asset base; Taxes other than income taxes due to higher gasoline sales, production volumes and property and payroll taxes; and Interest and debt expense due to higher debt levels following the merger. In addition to the merger impact, sales and other operating revenues and purchase costs increased because of higher prices for key products such as crude oil, natural gas, automotive gasoline and distillates. These are commodity products and their price levels are determined by market factors. Our share of earnings from affiliates acquired in the merger accounted for the majority of the increase in the equity earnings. Of these, the EP joint ventures in Canada (Petrovera) and Venezuela (Petrozuata), along with CFJ Properties in our RM segment, provided the largest equity earnings. On February 18, 2004, we sold our interest in the Petrovera joint venture. Of the equity affiliates held prior to the merger, our equity earnings from DEFS improved on higher natural gas liquids prices, and our earnings from Hamaca, an EP heavy oil joint venture in Venezuela, increased due to higher crude oil production. A higher net gain on asset sales was primarily responsible for the increase in other income in 2003. During 2003 we sold several EP operations that did not fit into our long term growth strategy. In addition, 2003 included gains attributable to insurance demutualization benefits. See the Corporate and Other section of Segment Results for additional information on these insurance benefits. Selling, general and administrative expenses in 2002 included a $246 million charge for the write off of in process research and development costs acquired in the merger. The absence of such a significant charge in the 2003 period reduced the impact of the merger on this line item. Property impairments increased by $75 million in 2003, compared with 2002. The 2003 impairments were recorded as a result of asset status changes from held for use to held for sale, producing properties that failed to meet recoverability tests, and tax law changes in Norway affecting asset removal costs. During 2002, property impairments were triggered by asset dispositions and the impairment of tradenames. See Note 12 Property Impairments, in the Notes to Financial Statements, for additional information. 43 Table of Contents Accretion on discounted liabilities increased $123 million in 2003, reflecting accretion expense on environmental liabilities assumed in the merger and discounted obligations associated with the retirement and removal of long lived assets that became effective January 1, 2003, with the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations. See Note 2 Changes in Accounting Principles, in the Notes to Financial Statements, for additional information on SFAS No. 143. In addition to the merger impact, interest and debt expense also increased in 2003 because of the adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, (FIN 46). The adoption of FIN 46 for variable interest entities involving synthetic leases and certain other financing structures, effective January 1, 2003, resulted in increased balance sheet debt, which resulted in higher interest expense in 2003. See Note 2 Changes in Accounting Principles, and Note 14 Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. During 2003, we recognized a $28 million gain on subsidiary equity transactions related to our EP Bayu Undan development in the Timor Sea. See Note 7 Subsidiary Equity Transactions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. Our effective tax rate in 2003 was 45 percent, compared with 67 percent in 2002. The lower effective tax rate in 2003 primarily was the result of a higher proportion of income in lower tax rate jurisdictions and the one time impact of tax law changes in certain international jurisdictions. Contributing to the higher effective tax rate in 2002 was a write off of in process research and development costs, as well as the partial impairment of an exploration prospect, both without corresponding tax benefits in 2002. Our discontinued operations had income of $237 million in 2003, compared with a net loss of $993 million in 2002. The net loss in 2002 reflected charges totaling $1,008 million after tax related to the impairment of properties, plants and equipment; goodwill; intangible assets; and provisions for losses associated with various operating lease commitments. For additional information about our discontinued operations, see Note 4 Discontinued Operations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We adopted SFAS No. 143 effective January 1, 2003, resulting in the recognition of a benefit of $145 million for the cumulative effect of this accounting change. Also effective January 1, 2003, we adopted FIN 46 for variable interest entities involving synthetic leases and certain other financing structures created prior to February 1, 2003. This resulted in a charge of $240 million for the cumulative effect of this accounting change. Together, these resulted in a net charge of $95 million. For additional information on these accounting changes, see Note 2 Changes in Accounting Principles, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 2002 vs. 2001 In addition to the merger of Conoco and Phillips on August 30, 2002, ConocoPhillips closed on the $7 billion acquisition of Tosco Corporation on September 14, 2001. Together, these transactions significantly increased operating revenues; equity earnings; other income; purchase costs; operating expenses; selling, general and administrative expenses; depreciation, depletion and amortization; taxes other than income taxes; accretion on discounted liabilities; and interest and debt expense in 2002, compared with 2001. 44 Table of Contents Restructuring Accruals As a result of the merger, we began a restructuring program in September 2002 to capture the benefits of combining Conoco and Phillips by eliminating redundancies, consolidating assets, and sharing common services and functions across regions. We expect the restructuring program to be completed by the end of the first quarter of 2004. From September 2002 through December 31, 2003, approximately 3,900 positions worldwide had been identified for elimination. Of this total, approximately 3,000 employees had been terminated by December 31, 2003. The information in Note 5 Restructuring, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is incorporated herein by reference.

Thousands of Barrels Daily Mining operations Syncrude produced 19 8 46 Table of Contents 2003 vs. 2002 The EP segment explores for and produces crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids on a worldwide basis. It also mines deposits of oil sands in Canada to extract the bitumen and upgrade it into a synthetic crude oil. At December 31, 2003, our EP operations were producing in the United States, the Norwegian and U.K. sectors of the North Sea, Canada, Nigeria, Venezuela, offshore Timor Lest in the Timor Sea, offshore Australia, offshore China, offshore the United Arab Emirates, offshore Vietnam, Russia, and Indonesia. Net income from the EP segment increased 146 percent in 2003, compared with 2002. The improvement reflects higher production volumes, primarily due to the merger; higher crude oil and natural gas prices; and an increased net gain on asset sales. These items were partially offset by higher production and operating expenses; depreciation, depletion and amortization; and taxes other than income taxes, all the result of the larger size and scope of our operations following the merger. In addition, 2003 included benefits of $233 million in our international EP operations from changes in income tax and site restoration laws, as well as an equity realignment of certain Australian operations. Also, the cumulative effect of the adoption of SFAS No. 143 and the adoption of FIN 46 for variable interest entities involving synthetic leases and certain other financing structures increased EPs net income by $142 million in 2003. Our average worldwide crude oil sales price was $27.47 per barrel in 2003, compared with $24.07 in 2002. We also benefited from higher natural gas prices in 2003, with our average worldwide price increasing from $2.77 per thousand cubic feet in 2002 to $4.07 in 2003. If crude oil and natural gas prices in 2004 do not remain at the historically strong levels experienced in 2003, EPs earnings will be negatively impacted in 2004. See the Outlook section for additional discussion of crude oil and natural gas prices. ConocoPhillips proved reserves at year end 2003 were 7.85 billion barrels of oil equivalent, a slight increase over 7.81 billion barrels at year end 2002. Our Canadian Syncrude mining operations had an additional 265 million barrels of proved oil sands reserves at the end of 2003, compared with 272 million barrels at year end 2002. 2002 vs. 2001 Net income from the EP segment increased 3 percent in 2002, compared with 2001. Although EP benefited from four months of increased production volumes in 2002 following the merger, this increase was mostly offset by lower natural gas sales prices, higher exploration expenses, and the unfavorable $24 million impact of a tax law change in the United Kingdom. Our average worldwide crude oil sales price was $24.07 per barrel in 2002, a 1 percent increase over $23.74 in 2001. Our average worldwide natural gas price in 2002 was $2.77 per thousand cubic feet, a 14 percent decrease from $3.23 in 2001. Our proved reserves at year end 2002 were 7.81 billion barrels of oil equivalent, a 52 percent increase over year end 2001s 5.13 billion barrels of oil equivalent. The increase was attributable to the merger. 47 Table of Contents U.S. EP 2003 vs. 2002 Net income from our U.S. EP operations increased 105 percent in 2003, compared with 2002. Net income from our Alaskan operations increased $575 million in 2003. The improvement in Alaska reflects higher crude oil prices, and a net $143 million benefit from the cumulative effect of adopting SFAS No. 143 and FIN 46, partially offset by slightly lower crude oil production volumes. The West Coast price of our Alaskan crude oil production increased 22 percent in 2003, from $23.75 per barrel in 2002 to $28.87 per barrel in 2003. Normal field declines and some operating interruptions in 2003 were mostly offset by increased production from the Borealis satellite field, the new Kuparuk Palm drill site, and Alpine, which enabled us to experience only a slight decrease in our Alaska crude oil production rate in 2003. Our EP Lower 48 net income increased $643 million in 2003, primarily because of increased natural gas production and sales prices, as well as, to a lesser extent, higher crude oil production and prices. U.S. Lower 48 natural gas prices increased 71 percent in 2003. Our increased production volumes in the Lower 48 mainly were the result of the merger, partially offset by the impact of asset dispositions. We continued our Lower 48/Gulf of Mexico asset rationalization program in 2003, which resulted in the sale of properties that did not fit into our long term growth strategy. As planned, we are exiting the shallow water areas of the Gulf of Mexico. The Lower 48 operations recognized a net $1 million charge from the cumulative effect of adopting SFAS No. 143 and FIN 46 effective January 1, 2003. 2002 vs. 2001 Net income from U.S. EP operations decreased 14 percent in 2002, compared with 2001. Although net income for 2002 benefited from four months of increased production volumes following the merger, this increase was more than offset by lower natural gas prices, lower production volumes in Alaska, and higher dry hole costs. Our U.S. average natural gas price in 2002 was 23 percent lower than in 2001. Our U.S. crude oil production decreased slightly in 2002, while natural gas production increased 20 percent. The increase in natural gas production was mainly due to four months of production from fields acquired in the merger. The merger impact on total crude oil production was offset by lower production in Alaska, which experienced normal field declines, along with operating interruptions at the Prudhoe Bay field. International EP 2003 vs. 2002 Net income from our international EP operations increased 225 percent in 2003, compared with 2002. Increased production volumes following the merger accounted for the majority of the earnings improvement. Higher crude oil and natural gas prices contributed to the remaining increase. International EPs production on a barrel of oil equivalent basis averaged 916,000 barrels per day in 2003, compared with 482,000 barrels per day in 2002. In addition, our Syncrude mining operations produced 19,000 barrels per day in 2003, compared with 8,000 barrels per day in 2002. Although the merger was the primary reason for the production increase, other items impacting our production rate in 2003 were: 48 Table of Contents The startup of the Grane field in the Norwegian North Sea in September 2003; A full years production from Phase I of the development of the Peng Lai 19 3 field in Chinas Bohai Bay; and The startup of production from the Phase I development of the Su Tu Den project in Vietnam late in the fourth quarter of 2003. Included in international EPs net income in 2003 was a net foreign currency transaction loss of $50 million, compared with a net loss of $34 million in 2002. International EPs net income in 2003 also was favorably impacted by the following items: In Norway, the Norway Removal Grant Act (1986) was repealed in the second quarter of 2003. Prior to its repeal, this Act required the Norwegian government to contribute to the cost of removing offshore oil and gas production facilities. Now, the co venturers in the facilities must fund all removal costs, but can deduct the removal costs, as incurred, under the Petroleum Tax Act, at the marginal tax rate in effect at the time of removal. These changes required us: to recognize an additional liability for the governments share, prior to repeal of the Act, of the future removal costs, with a corresponding increase in properties, plants and equipment (PPE); and to establish a net deferred tax asset for the temporary differences between the financial basis and tax basis of all of our Norwegian removal assets and liabilities. Some of the increases in PPE were on shut in fields, which led to immediate impairments of those properties. The overall impact on 2003 results was a net after tax benefit of $87 million. In the Timor Sea region, ConocoPhillips and its co venturers received final approvals from authorities to proceed with the natural gas development phase of the Bayu Undan project in the second quarter of 2003. This approval allowed a broad ownership interest re alignment among the co venturers to proceed, which included our sale of a 10 percent interest in the project and the issuance of equity by previously wholly owned subsidiaries. In addition, the ratification of the Australia/Timor Lest treaty lowered the companys deferred tax liability position. The net result of these events was an after tax benefit of $51 million in 2003. See Note 7 Subsidiary Equity Transactions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. In November 2003, the Canadian Parliament enacted federal tax rate reductions for oil and gas producers. As a result we recognized a $95 million benefit upon revaluation of our deferred tax liability in the fourth quarter. 2002 vs. 2001 Net income from international EP operations increased 66 percent in 2002. The improvement reflects four months of increased production volumes following the merger. However, 2002 net income included a $24 million deferred tax charge related to tax law changes in the United Kingdom. Net income in 2002 also included a $77 million leasehold impairment of deepwater Block 34, offshore Angola, due to an unsuccessful exploratory well in the block, along with higher dry hole charges. Our international crude oil production increased 64 percent in 2002, while natural gas production increased 126 percent. The increases were mainly due to the addition of four months of production from fields acquired in the merger. 49 Table of Contents Midstream 2003 2002 2001 Millions of Dollars Net Income* $ 130 55 120 *Includes DEFS related net income: $ 72 23 101 Dollars Per Barrel Average Sales Prices U.S. natural gas liquids* Consolidated $ 22.67 19.07 Equity 22.12 15.92 18.77 Thousands of Barrels Daily Operating Statistics Natural gas liquids extracted** 219 156 120 Natural gas liquids fractionated 167 133 108 * Based on index prices from the Mont Belvieu and Conway market hubs that are weighted by natural gas liquids component and location mix. ** Includes our share of equity affiliates. 2003 vs. 2002 The Midstream segment purchases raw natural gas from producers and gathers natural gas through extensive pipeline gathering systems. The natural gas is then processed to extract natural gas liquids from the raw gas stream. The remaining residue gas is marketed to electrical utilities, industrial users, and gas marketing companies. Most of the natural gas liquids are fractionated separated into individual components like ethane, butane and propane and marketed as chemical feedstock, fuel, or blendstock. Our Midstream segment consists of a 30.3 percent interest in Duke Energy Field Services, LLC (DEFS), as well as our other natural gas gathering and processing operations, and natural gas liquids fractionation and marketing businesses, primarily in the United States, Canada and Trinidad. Net income from the Midstream segment increased 136 percent in 2003, compared with 2002. The increase primarily was attributable to improved results from DEFS and the addition of midstream operations following the merger. DEFS results mainly increased because of higher natural gas liquids prices in 2003. In addition, DEFS results in 2002 included higher costs for gas imbalance adjustment accruals. Included in the Midstream segments 2003 net income was a basis difference benefit of $36 million, compared with $35 million in 2002, representing the amortization of the excess amount of our 30.3 percent equity interest in the net assets of DEFS over the book value of our investment in DEFS. 2002 vs. 2001 Net income from the Midstream segment decreased 54 percent in 2002, compared with 2001. The decrease was primarily due to lower results from DEFS, which experienced a decline in natural gas liquids prices, increased costs for gas imbalance accruals and other adjustments, and higher operating expenses. 50 Table of Contents These items were partially offset by the benefit of four months results from operations acquired in the merger. Included in the Midstream segments net income in 2002 was a benefit of $35 million, representing the amortization of the basis difference between the book value of ConocoPhillips contribution to DEFS and our 30.3 percent equity interest in DEFS. The corresponding amount for 2001 was $36 million. 51 Table of Contents RM 2003 2002 2001 Millions of Dollars Net Income United States $ 990 138 395 International 282 5 2 $ 1,272 143 397 Dollars Per Gallon U.S. Average Sales Prices* Automotive gasoline Wholesale $ 1.05 .96 .83 Retail 1.35 1.03 1.01 Distillates wholesale .92 .77 .78 * Excludes excise taxes.

Actual capacity at year end 2002 and 2001 was 2,166,000 and 1,656,000 barrels per day, respectively, in the United States and 440,000 and 72,000 barrels per day, respectively, internationally. 52 Table of Contents 2003 vs. 2002 The RM segments operations encompass refining crude oil and other feedstocks into petroleum products (such as gasoline, distillates and aviation fuels), buying and selling crude oil and refined products, and transporting, distributing and marketing petroleum products. RM has operations in the United States, Europe and Asia Pacific. Net income from our RM segment increased substantially in 2003, compared with 2002. The improved results primarily were due to significantly higher U.S. refining margins. The addition of refining and marketing assets in the merger also contributed to the higher 2003 earnings, as did increased wholesale gasoline margins. Partially offsetting the improvements was a net charge of $125 million for the cumulative effect of the adoption of FIN 46 for variable interest entities involving synthetic leases and certain other financing structures. Our refineries produced 2.7 million barrels per day of petroleum products in 2003, compared with 2.0 million barrels per day in 2002. The increase reflects the addition of production from refineries acquired in the merger. 2002 vs. 2001 Net income from the RM segment declined 64 percent in 2002, compared with 2001, reflecting lower refining margins, along with an $84 million after tax impairment of a tradename and leasehold improvements of certain retail sites. RM earnings for 2002 included four months results from operations acquired in the merger, as well as the impact of a full years results from Tosco operations, while the 2001 results included Tosco operations for only the last three and one half months of 2001. Worldwide crude oil refining capacity utilization was 90 percent in 2002, compared with 94 percent in 2001. Our refineries produced 2.0 million barrels per day of petroleum products in 2002, compared with 814,000 barrels per day in 2001. The increase reflects a full year of operations for refineries acquired in the Tosco acquisition and four months of operations for the refineries acquired in the merger. U.S. RM 2003 vs. 2002 Net income from our U.S. RM operations increased significantly in 2003, compared with 2002. The improved results mainly were due to significantly higher refining margins, particularly during the third quarter of 2003. Industry U.S. refining margins were strong in the third quarter of 2003 due to increased gasoline demand in August and an unusual number of refined product supply disruptions, including refinery outages in the Midwest caused by a major power blackout in August 2003. See the Outlook section for additional discussion of refining margins. We capitalized on the strong refining margins in the third quarter by running our U.S. refineries at a utilization rate of 96 percent during the quarter. However, this rate was negatively impacted by a fire at our Ponca City, Oklahoma, refinery during July that resulted in portions of the facility being shut down. The Ponca City refinerys throughput was restored in the fourth quarter of 2003 to levels achieved before the fire. 53 Table of Contents The addition of refining and marketing assets in the merger also contributed to the higher 2003 earnings, as did increased wholesale gasoline margins. Partially offsetting the margin improvements in 2003 was a net charge of $125 million for the cumulative effect of the adoption of FIN 46 for variable interest entities involving synthetic leases and certain other financing structures, along with higher utility costs. For the full year of 2003, our U.S. refineries ran at a crude oil capacity utilization rate of 96 percent, compared with 91 percent in 2002. The rate in 2002 was lowered by higher maintenance turnaround activity, the impact of tropical storms on our Gulf Coast refineries, and the loss of Venezuelan crude oil supply in the fourth quarter due to the economic and political instability in that country during the quarter. 2002 vs. 2001 Net income from U.S. RM operations declined 65 percent in 2002, compared with 2001. The decrease was primarily due to lower refining margins, particularly in the Midcontinent and Gulf Coast regions, along with an $84 million after tax impairment of a tradename and leasehold improvements of certain retail sites. These items were partially offset by increased production and sales volumes as a result of the Tosco acquisition and the merger. Net income for 2002 included four months of operations acquired in the merger, and a full year of Tosco operations, while the 2001 results included Tosco operations for only three and one half months. Effective January 1, 2001, we changed our method of accounting for the costs of major maintenance turnarounds from the accrue in advance method to the expense as incurred method. The cumulative effect of this change in accounting principle increased RM net income by $26 million. Also included in 2001 was a $27 million write down of inventories to market value. International RM 2003 vs. 2002 Net income from our international RM operations increased substantially in 2003, compared with 2002. The improvement was due to the larger size and scope of our international refining and marketing operations following the merger, along with higher international refining margins. Prior to the merger, our international RM operations consisted only of our Whitegate refinery in Ireland with a rated crude oil capacity of 72,000 barrels per day. The merger added one wholly owned and four joint venture refineries, with a rated crude oil capacity of 370,000 barrels per day. In addition, the merger added an extensive marketing network throughout Europe and Asia. Included in international RMs net income in 2003 was a net foreign currency gain of $18 million, compared with a net gain of $9 million in 2002. Our international crude oil capacity utilization rate was 87 percent in 2003, compared with 78 percent in 2002. The lower utilization rate in 2002 primarily was the result of the Humber refinery in the United Kingdom being shut down for an extended period of time in the fourth quarter due to a power outage and subsequent downtime. 2002 vs. 2001 Net income from international RM operations increased $3 million in 2002, compared with 2001, reflecting the impact of the merger. The Humber refinery was shut down for an extended period of time during the fourth quarter of 2002, which negatively impacted international RMs 2002 results. 54 Table of Contents Chemicals Millions of Dollars 2003 2002 2001 Net Income (Loss) $ 7 (14 ) (128 ) 2003 vs. 2002 The Chemicals segment consists of our 50 percent interest in Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC (CPChem), which we account for using the equity method of accounting. CPChem uses natural gas liquids and other feedstocks to produce petrochemicals such as ethylene, propylene, styrene, benzene, and paraxylene. These products are then marketed and sold, or used as feedstocks to produce plastics and commodity chemicals, such as polyethylene, polystyrene and cyclohexane. As the results in both years indicate, the chemicals industry continues to be challenged to effectively utilize capacity, manage costs and improve margins in a difficult economic environment. The worldwide chemicals industry experienced an economic downturn beginning in the second half of 2000, and the downturn continued through 2003. The downturn has led to excess production capacity in the industry and pressured margins on key products. The chemicals industry has also been impacted by high energy prices, which negatively impacts both utility and feedstock costs. 2002 vs. 2001 The Chemicals segment incurred a net loss of $14 million in 2002, compared with a net loss of $128 million in 2001. Higher margins in 2002 contributed to the improvement in results. Lower operating expenses, feedstock costs and energy prices in 2002 were partially offset by decreased sales prices. Due to depressed economic conditions in the chemicals industry, asset retirements and impairments totaling $84 million after tax were recognized by CPChem in 2001. A developmental reactor at the Pasadena Plastics Complex in Pasadena, Texas, was retired; accelerated depreciation was recognized by CPChem on two polyethylene reactors at the Orange chemical plant in Orange, Texas; an ethylene unit was retired at the Sweeny complex in Old Ocean, Texas; an equity affiliate of CPChem recorded a property impairment related to a polypropylene facility; property impairments were taken on the manufacturing facility in Puerto Rico; and the benzene and cyclohexane units at the Puerto Rico facility were retired. In addition, the valuation allowance on the Puerto Rico facilitys deferred tax asset related to its net operating losses was increased in 2001 so that the deferred tax assets were fully offset by valuation allowances. Partially offsetting these impairments and retirements was a business interruption insurance settlement recognized by CPChem, and a favorable deferred tax adjustment recorded by ConocoPhillips related to the Puerto Rico facility, together totaling $57 million after tax. 55 Table of Contents Emerging Businesses Millions of Dollars 2003 2002 2001 Net Loss Technology solutions $ (20 ) (16 ) (12 ) Gas to liquids (50 ) (273 ) Power (5 ) (3 ) Other (24 ) (18 ) $ (99 ) (310 ) (12 ) 2003 vs. 2002 The Emerging Businesses segment includes the development of new businesses outside our traditional operations. Emerging Businesses incurred a net loss of $99 million in 2003, compared with a net loss of $310 million in 2002. The net loss in 2003 was less than that in 2002 as a result of a $246 million write off of purchased in process research and development costs in the third quarter of 2002 related to Conocos natural gas to liquids and other technologies. In accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 4, Applicability of FASB Statement No. 2 to Business Combinations Accounted for by the Purchase Method, value assigned to research and development activities in the purchase price allocation that have no alternative future use are required to be charged to expense at the date of the consummation of the combination. The $246 million charge was the same on both a before tax and after tax basis, because there was no tax basis in the assigned value prior to its write off. 2002 vs. 2001 The Emerging Businesses segment posted a net loss of $310 million in 2002, compared with a net loss of $12 million in 2001. Results for 2002 included a $246 million write off of acquired in process research and development costs described above. The increased number of developing businesses after the merger also contributed to the larger losses in 2002.

Net interest increased 53 percent in 2003, compared with 2002. The increase in 2003 mainly was due to our higher debt levels following the merger, the impact of the adoption of FIN 46 for variable interest entities involving synthetic leases and certain other financing structures, and increased premiums on the early retirement of debt. The adoption of FIN 46 at January 1, 2003, increased debt, which resulted in higher interest expense. See Note 2 Changes in Accounting Principles, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. After tax corporate general and administrative expenses were the same in 2003 as in 2002. Expenses in 2003 were impacted by the merger, as well as the expensing of stock options. Beginning in 2003, on a prospective basis, we elected to use the fair value accounting method provided for under SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation. Offsetting these items were increased allocations of certain staff costs to the operating segments in 2003. The increased corporate allocations did not have a material impact on the operating segments results. Income from discontinued operations was $237 million in 2003, compared with a loss of $993 million in 2002. The net loss in 2002 reflects charges totaling $1,008 million after tax related to the impairment of properties, plants and equipment; goodwill; intangible assets; and provisions for losses associated with various operating lease commitments. For additional information about our discontinued operations, see Note 4 Discontinued Operations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. On an after tax basis, merger related costs were $223 million in 2003, compared with $307 million in 2002. Included in these costs were employee relocation expenses, transition labor costs, and other charges directly associated with the merger. The category Other consists primarily of items not directly associated with the operating segments on a stand alone basis, including certain foreign currency transaction gains and losses, and environmental costs associated with sites no longer in operation. Results from Other were improved in 2003 because of higher foreign currency transaction gains and an after tax gain of $34 million in the first quarter of 2003, representing beneficial interests we had in certain insurance companies as a result of the conversion of those companies from mutual companies to stock companies, a process known as demutualization. These beneficial interests arose from our prior purchase and ownership of various insurance policies and contracts issued by the mutual companies. Prior to the demutualizations, our mutual ownership interests in these insurance companies were not recognized because the ownership interests in the mutual companies were neither capable of valuation nor marketable. Included in Other in 2003 was a net foreign currency transaction gain of $67 million, after tax, compared with a net gain of $21 million in 2002. 2002 vs. 2001 Corporate and Others net loss was $1,918 million in 2002, compared with $415 million in 2001. The increased net loss in 2002 reflects losses from discontinued operations, primarily due to impairments, and merger related costs. Net interest expense and corporate general and administrative costs were also higher in 2002 due to the merger. 57 Table of Contents CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Financial Indicators Millions of Dollars Except as Indicated 2003 2002 2001 Current ratio .8 .9 1.3 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 9,356 4,978 3,559 Total debt repayment obligations due within one year $ 1,440 849 44 Total debt* $ 17,780 19,766 8,654 Mandatorily redeemable preferred securities of trust subsidiaries* $ 350 650 Other minority interests $ 842 651 5 Common stockholders equity $ 34,366 29,517 14,340 Percent of total debt to capital** 34 % 39 37 Percent of floating rate debt to total debt 17 % 12 20 * With the adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, effective January 1, 2003, the mandatorily redeemable preferred securities were removed from our balance sheet and effectively replaced with debt. ** Capital includes total debt, mandatorily redeemable preferred securities, other minority interests and common stockholders equity. To meet our liquidity requirements, including funding our capital program, paying dividends and repaying debt, we look to a variety of funding sources, primarily cash generated from operating activities. During 2003, available cash was used to support the companys ongoing capital expenditures program, repay debt and pay dividends. In October 2003, our Board of Directors (Board) declared a dividend of $.43 per share, payable December 1, 2003, which represented a 7.5 percent increase from the previous quarters dividend rate. Total dividends paid on our common stock in 2003 was $1.1 billion. During 2003, cash and cash equivalents increased $183 million to $490 million. Significant Sources of Capital Operating Activities During 2003, cash of $9,356 million was provided by operating activities, an increase of $4,378 million from 2002. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to: Higher crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices; Increased production as a result of the inclusion of Conoco activity for the full year; and Higher refining and marketing margins. In addition, working capital changes increased cash flow from operating activities $589 million in 2003, compared with an increase of $982 million in 2002. Cash from operating activities provided by discontinued operations amounted to $189 million, compared with $202 million in 2002. Asset Sales Following the merger, we initiated an asset disposition program to sell approximately $3 billion to $4 billion of assets by the end of 2004. Through year end 2003, we had sold approximately $3.4 billion of assets and raised our target to $4.5 billion by year end 2004. In February 2004, we sold our 46.7 percent interest in Petrovera Resources Limited, which primarily produced conventional heavy oil in Western Canada. Additional assets expected to be sold in 2004 are primarily related to our marketing 58 Table of Contents business. In addition, we are proceeding with plans to dispose of some of our non DEFS Midstream assets. During 2003, $2.7 billion was received from the sale of various assets, including the remaining assets required to be sold by the Federal Trade Commission as a result of the merger, a substantial portion of our U.S. retail marketing sites, and non strategic EP properties. Proceeds from these asset sales have been, and will be, used primarily to pay off debt. Commercial Paper and Credit Facilities While the stability of our cash flows from operating activities benefits from geographic diversity and the effects of upstream and downstream integration, our operating cash flows remain exposed to the volatility of commodity crude oil and natural gas prices and refining and marketing margins, as well as periodic cash needs to finance tax payments and crude oil, natural gas and petroleum product purchases. Our primary funding source for short term working capital needs is a $4 billion commercial paper program, a portion of which may be denominated in other currencies (limited to euro 3 billion equivalent). Commercial paper maturities are generally limited to 90 days. At December 31, 2003, we had $709 million of commercial paper outstanding, compared with $1,517 million of commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2002, of which $206 million was denominated in foreign currencies. Effective October 14, 2003, we entered into two new revolving credit facilities to replace our previously existing $2 billion 364 day facility that expired on that same date. The new revolving credit facilities consist of a $1.5 billion 364 day facility and a $500 million five year facility. We also have two revolving credit facilities totaling $2 billion expiring in October 2006. There were no outstanding borrowings under these facilities at December 31, 2003. These credit facilities support the companys $4 billion commercial paper program. In addition, one of our Norwegian subsidiaries has two $300 million revolving credit facilities that expire in June 2004, under which no borrowings were outstanding at December 31, 2003. Moodys Investor Service has maintained a rating of A3 on our senior long term debt; and Standard and Poors Rating Service and Fitch have maintained ratings of A . We do not have any ratings triggers on any of our corporate debt that would cause an automatic event of default in the event of a downgrade of our credit rating and thereby impact our access to liquidity. In the event that our credit rating deteriorated to a level that would prohibit us from accessing the commercial paper market, we would still be able to access funds under our $4.6 billion revolving credit facilities. Based on our year end commercial paper balance of $709 million, we had access to $3.9 billion in borrowing capacity as of December 31, 2003, which provides ample liquidity to cover daily operations. Shelf Registration In late 2002, we filed a universal shelf registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for various types of debt and equity securities. As a result, we have available to issue and sell a total of $5 billion of various types of securities under the universal shelf registration statement. Minority Interests At December 31, 2003, we had outstanding $842 million of equity held by minority interest owners, including a net minority interest of $496 million in Ashford Energy Capital S.A. and a $141 million net minority interest in Conoco Corporate Holdings L.P. In December 2001, in order to raise funds for general corporate purposes, Conoco and Cold Spring Finance S.a.r.l. formed Ashford Energy Capital S.A. through the contribution of a $1 billion Conoco subsidiary promissory note and $500 million cash by Cold Spring. Through its initial $500 million investment, Cold Spring is entitled to a cumulative annual preferred return based on three month LIBOR rates, plus 1.27 percent. The preferred return at December 31, 2003, was 2.48 percent. In 2008, and at each 10 year anniversary thereafter, Cold Spring may elect to 59 Table of Contents remarket their investment in Ashford, and if unsuccessful, could require ConocoPhillips to provide a letter of credit in support of Cold Springs investment, or in the event that such letter of credit is not provided, then cause the redemption of their investment in Ashford. Should ConocoPhillips credit rating fall below investment grade, Ashford would require a letter of credit to support $475 million of the term loans, as of December 31, 2003, made by Ashford to other ConocoPhillips subsidiaries. If the letter of credit is not obtained within 60 days, Cold Spring could cause Ashford to sell the ConocoPhillips subsidiary notes. At December 31, 2003, Ashford held $1.6 billion of ConocoPhillips subsidiary notes and $25 million in investments unrelated to ConocoPhillips. We report Cold Springs investment as a minority interest because it is not mandatorily redeemable and the entity does not have a specified liquidation date. Other than the obligation to make payment on the subsidiary notes described above, Cold Spring does not have recourse to our general credit. In 1999, in order to raise funds for general corporate purposes, Conoco formed Conoco Corporate Holdings L.P., contributing an office building and four aircraft to the partnership. Conoco Corporate Holdings L.P. is a limited life entity that must be liquidated in 2019. The limited partner interest was sold to Highlander Investors L.L.C. for $141 million, which represented an initial net 47 percent interest. Highlanders current investment in Conoco Corporate Holdings L.P. is 24.4 percent. Highlander is entitled to a cumulative annual priority return on its investment of 7.86 percent. The net minority interest in Conoco Corporate Holdings L.P. was $141 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002, and is callable without penalty beginning in the fourth quarter of 2004. Receivables Factoring At December 31, 2003 and 2002, we also had sold $226 million and $264 million, respectively, of receivables under factoring arrangements. We retained servicing responsibility for these sold receivables, which gives us certain benefits, the fair value of which approximates the fair value of the liability incurred for continuing to service the receivables. See Note 15 Sales of Receivables, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Receivables Monetization At December 31, 2002, certain credit card and trade receivables had been sold to two Qualifying Special Purpose Entities (QSPEs) in revolving period securitization arrangements. These arrangements provided for us to sell, and the QSPEs to purchase, certain receivables and for the QSPEs to then issue beneficial interests of up to $1.5 billion to five bank sponsored entities. All five bank sponsored entities are multi seller conduits with access to the commercial paper market and purchase interests in similar receivables from numerous other companies unrelated to us. We have no ownership interests, nor any variable interests, in any of the bank sponsored entities. As a result, we do not consolidate any of these entities. Furthermore, we do not consolidate the QSPEs because they meet the requirements of SFAS No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities, to be excluded from the consolidated financial statements of ConocoPhillips. During 2003, we purchased from the bank sponsored entities the senior interests of one of our two existing QSPEs and discontinued selling receivables to it. We have consolidated this QSPE since acquiring the senior interests. Also during 2003, the third party beneficial interest holders approved amendments to the other QSPE to increase the amount of third party beneficial interests that can be issued to $1.2 billion. These changes resulted in a net reduction of the maximum level of senior beneficial interests that can be issued to third party beneficial interest holders from $1.5 billion to $1.2 billion. At December 31, 2003 60 Table of Contents and 2002, we had sold accounts receivable of $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively. The receivables transferred to the QSPE meets the isolation requirements and other requirements of SFAS No. 140 to be accounted for as sales. Accordingly, receivables transferred to the QSPEs were accounted for as sales. We retain beneficial interests in this QSPE that are subordinate to the beneficial interests issued to the bank sponsored entities. These retained interests, which are reported on the balance sheet in accounts and notes receivable related parties, were $1.3 billion at both December 31, 2003 and 2002. We also retain servicing responsibility related to the sold receivables, which gives us certain benefits, the fair value of which approximates the fair value of the liability incurred for continuing to service the receivables. The carrying value of the subordinated beneficial interests approximates fair market value due to the short term of the underlying assets, which makes stress testing unnecessary. Preferred Stock During 1996 and 1997, we formed two statutory business trusts, Phillips 66 Capital I (Trust I) and Phillips 66 Capital II (Trust II), with ConocoPhillips owning all of the common securities of the trusts. The sole purpose of the trusts was to issue preferred securities to outside investors, investing the proceeds thereof in an equivalent amount of subordinated debt securities of ConocoPhillips. The two trusts were established to raise funds for general corporate purposes. On May 31, 2002, we redeemed all of the outstanding subordinated debt securities held by Trust I, which triggered the redemption of the $300 million of trust preferred securities of Trust I at par value, $25 per share. The redemption was funded by the issuance of commercial paper. At December 31, 2003, Trust II had $350 million of mandatorily redeemable preferred securities outstanding, whose sole asset was $361 million of ConocoPhillips subordinated debt securities, which bear interest at 8 percent. Distributions on the trust preferred securities are paid by the trust with funds from interest payments made by ConocoPhillips on the subordinated debt securities. We made interest payments in 2003 totaling $29 million. In addition, we have guaranteed the payment obligations of the trust on the trust preferred securities to the extent we have made interest payments on the subordinated debt securities. Prior to January 1, 2003, we consolidated Trust II and the mandatorily redeemable preferred securities were presented in the mezzanine section of the balance sheet. The subordinated debt securities and related income statement effects were eliminated in our consolidated financial statements. However, with the adoption of the provisions of FIN 46, effective January 1, 2003, we were required to deconsolidate Trust II, which had the effect of increasing debt by $361 million since the subordinated debt securities were no longer eliminated in consolidation, and removing the mandatorily redeemable preferred securities from our balance sheet. When we redeem the subordinated debt securities, Trust II is required to apply all the redemption proceeds to the immediate redemption of the preferred securities. See Note 2 Changes in Accounting Principles and Note 19 Preferred Stock and Other Minority Interests, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. Affiliated Companies As part of our normal ongoing business operations and consistent with normal industry practice, we invest in, and enter into, numerous agreements with other parties to pursue business opportunities, which share costs and apportion risks among the parties as governed by the agreements. At December 31, 2003, we were liable for certain contingent obligations under various contractual arrangements as described below. Hamaca: The Hamaca project involves the development of heavy oil reserves from the Orinoco Oil Belt. We own a 40 percent interest in the Hamaca project, which is operated by Petrolera Ameriven on behalf of the owners. The other participants in Hamaca are Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA) and ChevronTexaco Corporation. Our interest is held through a jointly owned 61 Table of Contents limited liability company, Hamaca Holding LLC, for which we use the equity method of accounting. Hamaca Holding LLC revenues for 2003 were approximately $284 million, expenses were approximately $143 million and cash provided by operating activities was approximately $143 million. We have a 57.1 percent non controlling ownership interest in Hamaca Holding LLC. In the second quarter of 2001, we, along with our co venturers in the Hamaca project, secured approximately $1.1 billion in a joint debt financing for our heavy crude oil project in Venezuela. The Export Import Bank of the United States provided a guarantee supporting a 17 year term $628 million bank facility. The joint venture also arranged a $470 million 14 year term commercial bank facility for the project. Total debt of $969 million was outstanding under these credit facilities at December 31, 2003. Of this amount, $388 million is recourse to ConocoPhillips. The proceeds of these joint financings are being used to primarily fund a heavy oil upgrader. The remaining necessary funding will be provided by capital contributions from the co venturers on a pro rata basis to the extent necessary to successfully complete construction. Once completion certification is achieved (required by October 1, 2005), the joint project financings will become non recourse with respect to the co venturers and the lenders under those facilities can then look only to the Hamaca projects cash flows for payment. Merey Sweeny L.P. (MSLP): MSLP is a limited partnership in which we and PDVSA each own an indirect 50 percent interest. During 1999, MSLP issued $350 million of 8.85 percent bonds due 2019 that we, along with PDVSA, are jointly and severally liable for under a construction completion guarantee. The bond proceeds were used to fund construction of a coker, vacuum unit and related facilities at our Sweeny, Texas, refinery, plus certain improvements to existing facilities at the same location. MSLP owns the coker and vacuum unit and, in the third quarter of 2000, began processing long residue produced from the Venezuelan Merey crude oil delivered under a supply agreement that we have with PDVSA. MSLP charges us a fee, which totaled approximately $145 million in 2003, to process the long residue through the vacuum unit and coker. This is the partnerships primary source of revenue. MSLP revenues for 2003 were approximately $162 million, expenses were approximately $140 million and cash provided by operating activities was approximately $31 million. If completion certification is not attained by June 18, 2004, the 8.85 percent bonds could be called and the bondholders would look to the two MSLP partners for repayment. MSLP is currently awaiting receipt of a permit for a new waste water pipeline and working to resolve issues in placing its insurance program, after which we expect to achieve completion certification in the second quarter of 2004. Upon completion certification, the 8.85 percent bonds become non recourse to the two MSLP partners and the bondholders can then look only to MSLP cash flows for payment. We purchased the improvements to existing facilities from MSLP for a price equal to the cost of construction, and MSLP provided seller financing. Terms of financing provide for 240 monthly payments of principal and interest commencing September 2000 with interest accruing at a 7 percent annual rate. The principal balance due on the seller financing was $131 million at December 31, 2003, and is included as long term debt in our balance sheet. MSLP pays a monthly access fee to us, which totaled approximately $20 million in 2003, for the use of the improvements to the refinery. The access fee equals the monthly principal and interest paid by us to purchase the improvements from MSLP. To the extent the access fee is not paid by MSLP, we are not obligated to make payments for the improvements. During the first quarter of 2002, MSLP issued $25 million of tax exempt bonds due 2021. This issuance, combined with similar bonds MSLP issued in 1998, 2000, and 2001, bring the total outstanding to $100 million. As a result of the companys support as a primary obligor of a 50 percent share of these MSLP financings, $50 million of long term debt is included in our balance sheet at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. 62 Table of Contents Other: At December 31, 2003, we had guarantees of approximately $340 million outstanding for our portion of other joint venture debt obligations, which have terms of up to 22 years. Included in these outstanding guarantees was $158 million associated with the Polar Lights Company joint venture in Russia. Payment will be required if a joint venture defaults on its debt obligations. Capital Requirements For information about our capital expenditures and investments, see Capital Spending below. Our balance sheet debt at December 31, 2003, was $17.8 billion. This reflects debt reductions of approximately $4.8 billion during 2003, including accounting changes that increased balance sheet debt approximately $2.8 billion as a result of the adoption of FIN 46. See Note 2 Changes in Accounting Principles and Note 14 Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. During 2003, we reduced our commercial paper balance outstanding from $1.5 billion at December 31, 2002, to $709 million at December 31, 2003. In 2003, we paid off the following notes and debt facilities as they were called or matured and funded the payments with cash from operating activities and proceeds from asset dispositions: $250 million 8.49% Notes due 2023, at 104.245 percent; $150 million 8.25% Mortgage Bonds due May 15, 2003; $250 million 7.92% Notes due in 2023, at 103.96 percent; $250 million 7.20% Notes due 2023, at 103.60 percent; $100 million 6.65% Notes that matured on March 1, 2003; $180 million SRW Cogeneration Limited Partnership note; $500 million Floating Rate Notes due April 15, 2003; $90 million Tosco Trust 2000 E 8.78% Senior Secured Notes due 2010; $245 million Tosco Trust 2000 E 8.58% Senior Secured Notes due 2010; $199 million Arctic Funding, Limited Partnership 6.85% Senior Secured Note due 2011; $100 million of floating rate aviation equipment lease obligations having a final maturity in 2004; $489 million of fixed and floating rate ocean vessel lease obligations having final maturities from 2004 to 2005; and $1,130 million of floating rate marketing lease obligations having maturities from 2003 to 2006. In October and November 2003, we executed certain interest rate swaps that had the effect of converting $1.5 billion of debt from fixed to floating rate. These swaps qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. Also during 2003, we issued $79.5 million of tax exempt bonds and assumed an additional amount of $20 million. 63 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our aggregate contractual fixed and variable obligations as of December 31, 2003: Millions of Dollars Payments Due by Period Up to 1 3 3 5 After At December 31, 2003 Total 1 Year Years Years 5 Years Debt obligations* $ 17,720 1,434 3,110 1,202 11,974 Capital lease obligations 60 6 12 38 4 Total debt 17,780 1,440 3,122 1,240 11,978 Operating lease obligations 3,073 471 810 619 1,173 Purchase obligations** 58,231 19,972 4,869 3,915 29,475 Other long term liabilities*** Asset retirement obligations 2,685 61 242 364 2,018 Accrued environmental costs 1,119 140 304 138 537 Total $ 82,888 22,084 9,347 6,276 45,181 * Total debt excluding capital lease obligations.

We anticipate the current liability of $2,676 million for accrued income and other taxes will be paid in the next year. We have other accrued tax liabilities whose resolution may not occur for several years, so it is not possible to determine the exact timing or amount of future payments. Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for tax purposes; (2) Pensions for the 2004 through 2008 time period, we expect to contribute an average of $400 million per year to our qualified and non qualified pension and postretirement medical plans in the United States and an average of $100 million per year to our non U.S. plans, which are expected to be in excess of required minimums in many cases. Our required minimum funding in 2004 is expected to be $95 million in the United States and $75 million outside the United States; (3) Severance we have expected severance payments of $109 million in 2004 and $3 million in 2005; and (4) Interest we anticipate payments of $1,046 million in 2004, $2,012 million for the period 2005 through 2006, $1,708 million for the period 2007 through 2008, and $8,955 million for the remaining years to total $13,721 million. 64 Table of Contents Capital Spending Capital Expenditures and Investments Millions of Dollars 2004 Budget 2003 2002 2001 EP United States Alaska $ 656 570 706 965 United States Lower 48 763 848 499 389 International 3,939 3,090 2,071 1,162 5,358 4,508 3,276 2,516 Midstream 10 10 5 RM United States 1,039 860 676 423 International 246 319 164 5 1,285 1,179 840 428 Chemicals 60 6 Emerging Businesses 62 284 122 Corporate and Other* 167 188 85 66 $ 6,882 6,169 4,388 3,016 United States $ 2,639 2,493 2,043 1,849 International 4,243 3,676 2,345 1,167 $ 6,882 6,169 4,388 3,016 Discontinued operations $ 224 97 69 * Excludes discontinued operations. Our capital spending for continuing operations for the three year period ending December 31, 2003, totaled $13.6 billion. Spending was primarily focused on the growth of our EP business, with 76 percent of total spending for continuing operations in this segment. The capital programs of DEFS, our gas gathering, processing and marketing joint venture company, and CPChem, our chemicals joint venture company, are intended to be self funding, and are not reflected in the amounts above. Including about $500 million in capitalized interest and $400 million that will be funded by minority interests in the Bayu Undan gas export project, our Board has approved $6.9 billion for capital projects and investments for continuing operations in 2004, a 12 percent increase over our 2003 capital spending of $6.2 billion. We plan to direct 78 percent of our 2004 capital budget to EP and 19 percent to RM. The remaining budget will be allocated toward emerging businesses, mainly power generation; and general corporate purposes, with a majority related to global integration of systems. Thirty eight percent of the budget is targeted for projects in the United States. EP Capital spending for continuing operations for EP during the three year period ending December 31, 2003, totaled $10.3 billion. The expenditures over the three year period supported several key exploration and development projects including: National Petroleum Reserve Alaska (NPR A) and satellite field prospects on Alaskas North Slope; 65 Table of Contents Magnolia development in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico; Canadian conventional oil and gas projects, the Surmont oil sands project and expansion of the Syncrude project; The Hamaca heavy oil project in Venezuelas Orinoco Oil Belt; The Jade, Clair, CMS3 and Britannia satellite developments in the United Kingdom; The Grane field and Ekofisk Area growth project in the Norwegian North Sea; The Kashagan field in the north Caspian Sea, offshore Kazakhstan; The Peng Lai 19 3 discovery in Chinas Bohai Bay and additional Bohai Bay appraisal and satellite field prospects; The Bayu Undan gas recycle and gas development projects in the Timor Sea; Blocks 15 1 and 15 2 in Vietnam; The Belanak and Suban projects in Indonesia; and Acquisition of deepwater exploratory interests in Angola, Nigeria, Brazil, and the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Capital expenditures for construction of our Endeavour Class tankers and an additional interest in the Trans Alaska Pipeline System were also included in the EP segment. We have contracted to build, for approximately $200 million each, five double hulled Endeavour Class tankers for use in transporting Alaskan crude oil to the U.S. West Coast. During 2001, the Polar Endeavour, the first Endeavour Class tanker, entered service. The second tanker, the Polar Resolution, entered service in May 2002 and the third tanker, the Polar Discovery, was delivered for service in September 2003. We expect to add a new Endeavour Class tanker to our fleet in both 2004 and 2005, allowing us to retire older ships and cancel non operated charters. In Alaska, we continued development drilling in the Kuparuk, Tabasco and West Sak fields in the Greater Kuparuk Area, Prudhoe Bay satellite fields and the Alpine field. In 2003, we, along with our co venturers, drilled or participated in 71 new development wells at Greater Prudhoe Bay, 17 new development wells at Greater Kuparuk and five development wells at Alpine. Also in 2003, funds were expended on the Alpine capacity expansion project that is expected to start up in the second half of 2004. In the Lower 48, we continued to explore and develop our acreage positions in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, South Texas, the San Juan Basin, the Permian Basin, and the Texas Panhandle. In the Gulf of Mexico, development drilling has been completed in the Magnolia and Princess Phase 1 fields. Sanction for the K2 project development is expected in the first quarter of 2004. Preliminary engineering for Princess Phase 2 and Ursa waterflood is expected to begin in the first quarter of 2004. Magnolias tension leg platform construction is ongoing and first production is expected prior to the end of 2004. In February 2003, we began drilling the Lorien exploration well on Block 199, which was declared a discovery in July. The well has been temporarily suspended pending evaluation of development alternatives. The Voss deepwater exploratory well drilled in Keathley Canyon Block 511 was declared dry in early 2003 and as required was charged against 2002 earnings. The Yorick deepwater exploratory well in Green Canyon Block 435 was declared a dry hole in late 2003. Onshore capital was focused on natural gas developments in the San Juan Basin of New Mexico and the Lobo Trend of South Texas. In addition, Lower 48 is pursuing select opportunities in its other producing basins. 66 Table of Contents In Canada, we continued with development of the Stage III expansion mining project in the Canadian province of Alberta, which is expected to increase our Canadian Syncrude production. The Aurora Train 2 project (the new mine) started up in late October 2003. The upgrader expansion project is expected to start up in the second half of 2005. In the fourth quarter of 2003, approval was obtained for our project in Surmont. Our ownership share is 43.5 percent. The Surmont lease covers over 200 square miles. This initial development project is designed to use steam assisted gravity drainage technology, with first oil production expected in 2006. In addition to these projects, we also are involved in conventional oil and gas properties in Canada. During the fourth quarter of 2001, we began production of heavy crude oil from the Hamaca project in Venezuelas Orinoco Oil Belt. Construction of an upgrader to convert heavy crude oil into a medium grade crude oil continues. Completion of the upgrader is expected by the end of 2004. We own a 40 percent equity interest in the Hamaca project. Our other heavy oil project in Venezuela, Petrozuata, incurred capital expenditures in 2003 associated with solids handling and restoration capacity projects, as well as ongoing drilling. In addition to the Hamaca and Petrozuata developments, we have an interest in the Corocoro oil discovery in Venezuelas Gulf of Paria West. In April 2003, Venezuelan authorities and co venturers approved Phase I of the development plan for the Corocoro field. We are the operator of the block. In September 2003, we acquired a 37.5 percent interest in the Gulf of Paria East Block. A portion of the Corocoro discovery extends onto this block. Our interest in the development is 32.2 percent. In February 2003, Venezuelan authorities granted a 35 year license to ChevronTexaco to appraise and develop Plataforma Deltana Block 2. ChevronTexaco selected us as their minority partner in accordance with the terms of the license, which was approved by the Venezuelan government in late 2003. We now have a 40 percent interest in the project. Plataforma Deltana Block 2 is located to the east of our Corocoro discovery. Block 2 already has a gas discovery on it, and additional drilling is planned for 2004. In Brazil, we added joint venture partners for our two deepwater blocks, BM ES 11 and BM PAMA 3, and purchased additional seismic data in 2002. In 2003, 3 D seismic results indicated the prospect for BM ES 11 was below expectations, leading to a write off of our leasehold investment and the initiation of plans to exit the block. Further evaluation of BM PAMA 3 is planned for 2004. In 2003, we continued with several development projects in the U.K. and Norwegian sectors of the North Sea, including the Clair field in the U.K. sector. We expect first production from Clair in late 2004. Late in the third quarter of 2003, we and our co venturers began oil production from the Grane field in the Norwegian North Sea. Net peak production from proved reserves of approximately 14,000 barrels per day is anticipated in 2005. We continued the development of the CMS3 area, a single unitized project, comprising five natural gas reservoirs in the southern sector of the U.K. North Sea. Collectively, the fields are known as CMS3 due to their utilization of the production and transportation facilities of our operated Caister Murdoch System (CMS). In September 2002, production commenced from the Hawksley field, followed in the fourth quarter by production at the Murdoch K field. During 2003, McAdam came onstream in the second quarter and Watt began in the fourth quarter. Drilling operations on the final reservoir, Boulton H, are ongoing in 2004. We are the operator of CMS3 and hold a 59.5 percent interest. In December 2003, our Board approved the development of the Britannia field satellites in the North Sea. A development plan has been submitted for government approval. These satellites are comprised of the Callanish and Brodgar fields. The Callanish field is an oil reservoir, and the Brodgar field is a gas 67 Table of Contents condensate reservoir with properties similar to those of Britannia. The fields are planned to be developed jointly via a bridge linked platform to Britannia, with production startup scheduled for 2007. We are the operator of both fields with an interest of 75 percent in Brodgar and 83.5 percent in Callanish. Elsewhere in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea, in 2003, we, along with our co venturers, approved a plan to further develop the Ekofisk Area to increase the recovery of oil and gas from the area by improving the areas processing capacity and reliability. The Ekofisk growth project consists of two interrelated components: the construction and installation of a new steel wellhead and process platform and an increase in capacity from existing facilities. We expect to complete and install the steel jacket in 2004 and the topsides early in the summer of 2005. Additional production from this development is anticipated to begin in the fall of 2005. We are modifying the existing Ekofisk Complex and four additional platforms to increase processing capacity. In 2002, we and our co venturers, in conjunction with the government of the Republic of Kazakhstan, declared the Kashagan field on the Kazakhstan shelf in the north Caspian Sea to be commercial. A development plan for the field was approved by the Republic of Kazakhstan in February 2004. Four of five planned appraisal wells on Kashagan had been successfully completed by the end of 2003. The fifth well is currently being tested. In May 2002, we along with the other remaining co venturers, completed the acquisition of proportionate interests of two co venturers rights, which increased our ownership interest from 7.14 percent to 8.33 percent. In October 2002, we and our co venturers announced a new hydrocarbon discovery in the Kazakhstan sector of the Caspian Sea. In 2003, a 3 D survey was carried out over the Kalamkas field and an initial appraisal well is planned for 2005. During 2003, we exercised our pre emptive rights related to B.G. Internationals sale of their share in the North Caspian License that includes the Kashagan field. The transaction is expected to close in 2004, at which time our interest in the license will increase from 8.33 percent to 10.19 percent. In November 2003, we and our co venturers announced the successful completion of the first offshore exploration wells on the Aktote and Kashagan Southwest prospects. These two wells are located in the Kazakhstan sector of the Caspian Sea in an area adjacent to the Kashagan field. Another exploration well, on the Kairan prospect, completed drilling in 2003 and will be tested in 2004. In late December 2002, we began production from Phase I of our Peng Lai 19 3 development located on Block 11/05 in Chinas Bohai Bay. During 2003, we continued with planning and design for Phase II of the Peng Lai 19 3 development, which includes multiple wellhead platforms, central processing facilities, and a floating storage and offloading facility. We are developing, in conjunction with Phase II, the Peng Lai 25 6 oil field, located three miles east of Peng Lai 19 3. We also drilled exploration wells on the Peng Lai 19 9 prospect and the Peng Lai 13 1 prospect, which resulted in two discoveries. The Peng Lai 19 9 1 well is located two miles east of the Peng Lai 19 3 oil field, and along with adjacent structures will be a part of the Phase II development. In the Timor Sea, we continued with development activities associated with the Bayu Undan gas recycle and gas development projects. We continued to drill future production wells and have installed all major facilities, including two production, processing and living quarters platforms and an unmanned production platform. A multi product floating, storage and offloading vessel was connected to the production facilities during the fourth quarter of 2003. First liquids production began in February 2004, and full capacity of 62,000 net barrels per day of condensate and natural gas liquids is anticipated to be reached in the third quarter of 2004. An average rate of 23,000 net barrels per day of combined condensate and natural gas liquids is expected for 2004. 68 Table of Contents We also have received approval of the gas development plan for the Bayu Undan project from the Timor Sea Designated Authority, concluded fiscal and legal provisions with the government of Timor Lest, and executed new production sharing contract (PSC) arrangements with the Designated Authority. The gas development project includes a liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant, including a pipeline to Darwin, Australia. The first LNG cargo from the 3.52 million ton per year facility is scheduled for delivery in early 2006. During the third quarter of 2003, construction of the LNG facility and the pipeline began. In June 2003, we sold what currently equates to a 10.08 percent interest in the unitized Bayu Undan field; purchased other interests that currently equate to a 2.65 percent interest in the field; sold a 43.3 percent interest in the Bayu Undan pipeline under construction; and sold a 43.3 percent interest in Darwin LNG Pty Ltd (owner of the LNG plant to be constructed). The net result is that we retain a 56.72 percent controlling interest in the integrated project. In Vietnams Block 15 1, the Su Tu Den Phase I (southwest area) development project was approved in December 2001 and production from this area began in late October 2003. We also are evaluating the commerciality of the Su Tu Vang fields and the northeast portion of the Su Tu Den field. In November 2003, we announced the completion of a successful exploratory well in the Su Tu Trang field in Block 15 1. Technical evaluation is in progress to assess the reservoir potential of the Su Tu Trang field. In the third quarter of 2002, we began production from two new wellhead platforms in the Block 15 2 Rang Dong field in Vietnam. During late 2003, field facilities were upgraded to include a utilities living quarters platform, and a central processing platform with facilities to enable gas lift, gas export and water injection. With the completion of these facilities, water injection is now possible on all three wellhead platforms and gas lift is possible on the N 1 and E 1 wellhead platforms. These facilities became operational in the fourth quarter of 2003. We continued with the appraisal and development of key gas fields in Indonesia. In 2003, we announced the successful test of the Suban 8 delineation well on the southwest flank of the Suban gas field, located in the Corridor PSC of South Sumatra. We also completed the successful test of the North Sumpal 1 well in the Sakakemang Block located in South Sumatra, and continued on the construction of the South Jambi gas project in the South Jambi B Block also located in South Sumatra. In addition, we continue to develop the offshore Belanak and other fields in the Block B PSC in the Natuna Sea, for which a floating production storage and offloading vessel is under construction. The vessel is expected to be completed in the first half of 2005. In May 2002, initial results showed that the first exploratory well drilled in Block 34, offshore Angola, was a dry hole. In view of this information, we reassessed the fair value of the remainder of the block and determined that our investment in the block was impaired by $77 million, both before and after tax. In December 2003, the second exploration well was drilled in Block 34, offshore Angola. The well encountered non commercial gas and was plugged and abandoned. In view of this information, we fully impaired our remaining investment in the block. In 2003, we obtained a 40 percent interest in Block 248 and a 20 percent interest in Block 214, both offshore Nigeria. First exploration drilling is planned for Block 248 in the second quarter of 2004. Other capital spending for EP during the three year period ended December 31, 2003, supported: The Eldfisk waterflood development in Norway; The Jade field development in the United Kingdom; The acquisition and development of coalbed methane and conventional gas prospects and producing properties in the U.S. Lower 48; and 69 Table of Contents North Sea prospects in the U.K. and Norwegian sectors, plus other Atlantic Margin wells in the United Kingdom, Greenland and the Faroe Islands. 2004 Capital Budget EPs 2004 capital budget for continuing operations is $5.4 billion, 19 percent higher than actual expenditures in 2003. Twenty six percent of EPs 2004 capital budget is planned for the United States, with 46 percent of that slated for Alaska. We have budgeted $628 million for worldwide exploration capital activities in 2004, with 17 percent of that amount, $106 million, allocated to the United States. Outside the United States, significant exploration expenditures are planned in Kazakhstan, Venezuela, the United Kingdom and Norway. We plan to spend $656 million in 2004 for our Alaskan operations. A majority of the capital spending will fund Prudhoe Bay, Greater Kuparuk and Western North Slope operations including additional work on the Alpine capacity expansion project, Orion and West Sak field developments construction of Endeavour Class tankers, and the exploratory activity discussed above. In the Lower 48, offshore capital expenditures will be focused on the continued development of the Magnolia, Ursa and Princess fields in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Onshore capital will focus primarily on developing natural gas reserves within core areas, such as the San Juan Basin of New Mexico and the Lobo Trend of South Texas. EP is directing $3.9 billion of its 2004 capital budget to international projects. The majority of these funds will be directed to developing major long term projects, including the Bayu Undan liquids and gas development projects in the Timor Sea; the Hamaca heavy oil project in Venezuela; additional development of oil and gas reserves in offshore Block B and onshore South Sumatra blocks in Indonesia; the second phase of Bohai Bay in China; projects in the Caspian region, including Baku Tbilisi Ceyhan pipeline; projects in Canada, including Syncrude, Surmont heavy oil and the Mackenzie Delta gas development; and the Qatargas 3 LNG facility in Qatar. In addition, funds will be used to expand the companys positions in the U.K. and Norwegian sectors of the North Sea. Costs incurred for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001, relating to the development of proved undeveloped oil and gas reserves were $2,002 million, $1,631 million, and $1,423 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2003, estimated future development costs relating to the development of proved undeveloped oil and gas reserves for the years 2004 through 2006 were projected to be $1,767 million, $1,111 million, and $659 million, respectively. RM Capital spending for continuing operations for RM during the three year period ending December 31, 2003, was primarily for refinery upgrade projects to improve product yields, to meet new environmental standards, to improve the operating integrity of key processing units, and to install advanced process control technology, as well as for safety projects. Total capital spending for continuing operations for RM for the three year period was $2.4 billion, representing 18 percent of our total capital spending for continuing operations. 70 Table of Contents Key projects during the three year period included: Construction of a polypropylene plant at the Bayway refinery in New Jersey; Construction of a fluid catalytic cracking unit and a S Zorb Sulfur Removal Technology (S Zorb) unit at the Ferndale, Washington, refinery; Expansion of the alkylation unit at the Los Angeles refinery; Capacity expansion and debottlenecking projects at the Borger, Texas, refinery; Completion of a commercial S Zorb unit at the Borger refinery; An expansion of capacity in the Seaway crude oil pipeline; and Installation of an advanced central control building and associated technologies at the Borger facility. In early 2003, we completed three major projects: a polypropylene plant at the Bayway refinery in Linden, New Jersey, and both a fluid catalytic cracking unit and a S Zorb unit at the Ferndale, Washington, refinery. The Bayway polypropylene plant utilizes propylene feedstock from the Bayway refinery to make up to 775 million pounds per year of polypropylene. The plant became operational in March 2003. At Ferndale, the fluid catalytic cracking unit significantly improves gasoline production per barrel of crude input and the new S Zorb unit reduces sulfur in gasoline. Both became fully operational in 2003. Also in 2003, we made investments related to clean fuels, safety and environmental projects throughout our refining system. We completed projects at our refineries in Ponca City, Oklahoma and Roxana, Illinois, to produce the low sulfur gasoline required by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). We also began construction of a new diesel hydrotreater at the Rodeo facility of our San Francisco area refinery that is expected to produce reformulated California highway diesel an estimated one year ahead of the June 2006 deadline. In July 2003, we completed the acquisition of certain refining assets in Hartford, Illinois, from Premcor. The operations of these assets are being integrated into the operations of our nearby Wood River refinery. The overall production of the refinery will only increase slightly, but integration of the new assets will enable the refinery to process heavier, lower cost crude oil. Startup of the integrated facilities is expected in the second quarter of 2004. Internationally, we continue to invest in our ongoing refining and marketing operations, including a replacement reformer at our Humber refinery in the United Kingdom and marketing growth in select countries in Europe and Asia. 2004 Capital Budget RMs 2004 capital budget for continuing operations is $1.3 billion, a 9 percent increase over spending of $1.2 billion in 2003. Domestic spending is expected to consume 81 percent of the RM budget. We plan to direct about $900 million of the RM capital budget to domestic refining, primarily to fund clean fuels projects in order to comply with new EPA standards for refined products. Worldwide, clean fuels spending for our RM business is expected to be about $600 million, or 55 percent of the total refining budget. Our U.S. marketing and transportation businesses are expected to spend about $125 million, while the remaining budget will fund projects in our international refining and marketing businesses in Europe and the Asia Pacific region. 71 Table of Contents Emerging Businesses Capital spending for Emerging Businesses during 2003 was primarily for construction of the Immingham combined heat and power cogeneration plant near the companys Humber refinery in the United Kingdom. We expect the plant to be operational in mid 2004. Emerging Businesses 2004 capital budget of $62 million is primarily dedicated to the completion of the Immingham plant. Contingencies Legal and Tax Matters We accrue for contingencies when a loss is probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated. Based on currently available information, we believe that it is remote that future costs related to known contingent liability exposures will exceed current accruals by an amount that would have a material adverse impact on the companys financial statements. All significant litigation arising from the March 27, 2000, explosion and fire that occurred in an out of service butadiene storage tank at the K Resin styrene butadiene copolymer (SBC) plant has now been resolved. Environmental We are subject to the same numerous international, federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations, as are other companies in the petroleum exploration and production industry; and refining, marketing and transportation of crude oil and refined products businesses. The most significant of these environmental laws and regulations include, among others, the: Federal Clean Air Act, which governs air emissions; Federal Clean Water Act, which governs discharges to water bodies; Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), which imposes liability on generators, transporters, and arrangers of hazardous substances at sites where hazardous substance releases have occurred or are threatened to occur; Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), which governs the treatment, storage, and disposal of solid waste; Federal Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA90), under which owners and operators of onshore facilities and pipelines, lessees or permittees of an area in which an offshore facility is located, and owners and operators of vessels are liable for removal costs and damages that result from a discharge of oil into navigable waters of the United States; Federal Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act (EPCRA), which requires facilities to report toxic chemical inventories with local emergency planning committees and responses departments; Federal Safe Drinking Water Act, which governs the disposal of wastewater in underground injection wells; and 72 Table of Contents U.S. Department of the Interior regulations, which relate to offshore oil and gas operations in U.S. waters and impose liability for the cost of pollution cleanup resulting from operations, as well as potential liability for pollution damages. These laws and their implementing regulations set limits on emissions and, in the case of discharges to water, establish water quality limits. They also, in most cases, require permits in association with new or modified operations. These permits can require an applicant to collect substantial information in connection with the application process, which can be expensive and time consuming. In addition, there can be delays associated with notice and comment periods and the agencys processing of the application. Many of the delays associated with the permitting process are beyond the control of the applicant. Many states and foreign countries where we operate also have, or are developing, similar environmental laws and regulations governing these same types of activities. While similar, in some cases these regulations may impose additional, or more stringent, requirements that can add to the cost and difficulty of marketing or transporting products across state and international borders. The ultimate financial impact arising from environmental laws and regulations is neither clearly known nor easily determinable as new standards, such as air emission standards, water quality standards and stricter fuel regulations, continue to evolve. However, environmental laws and regulations, including those that may arise to address concerns about global climate change, are expected to continue to have an increasing impact on our operations in the United States and in other countries in which we operate. Notable areas of potential impacts include air emission compliance and remediation obligations in the United States. Under the Clean Air Act, the EPA has promulgated a number of stringent limits on air emissions and established a federally mandated operating permit program. Violations of the Clean Air Act and most other environmental laws and regulations in the United States are enforceable with civil and criminal sanctions. The EPA also has promulgated specific rules governing the sulfur content of gasoline, known generically as the Tier II Sulfur Rules, the first phase requirements of which became applicable to our gasoline as of January 2004. To meet the requirements, we are implementing a compliance strategy that relies on the use of a combination of technologies, including our proprietary S Zorb technology. The EPA also has promulgated rules regarding the sulfur content in highway diesel fuel, which become applicable in 2006. In April 2003, the EPA proposed a rule regarding emissions from non road diesel engines and limiting non road diesel fuel sulfur content. If promulgated, this rule would significantly reduce non road diesel fuel sulfur content limits as early as 2007. We are currently evaluating S Zorb systems for removing sulfur from diesel fuel in special applications. The refining industry is actively considering several advanced and conventional technologies for complying with these rules. Because the non road rule is not final, we are still evaluating and developing capital strategies for future compliance. Additional areas of potential air related impact are the proposed revisions to the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) and the Kyoto Protocol. In July 1997, the EPA promulgated more stringent revisions to the NAAQS for ozone and particulate matter. Since that time, final adoption of these revisions has been the subject of litigation (American Trucking Association, Inc. et al. v. United States Environmental Protection Agency) that eventually reached the U.S. Supreme Court during the fall of 2000. In February 2001, the U.S. Supreme Court remanded this matter, in part, to the EPA to address the implementation provisions relating to the revised ozone NAAQS. If adopted, the revised NAAQS could result in substantial future environmental expenditures for us. In 1997, an international conference on global warming concluded an agreement, known as the Kyoto Protocol, which called for reductions of certain emissions that contribute to increases in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. The United States has not ratified the treaty codifying the Kyoto Protocol 73 Table of Contents but may in the future. In addition, other countries where we have interests, or may have interests in the future, have made commitments to the Kyoto Protocol and are in various stages of formulating applicable regulations. Currently, it is not possible to accurately estimate the costs that we could incur to comply with such regulations, but such expenditures could be substantial. We also are subject to certain laws and regulations relating to environmental remediation obligations associated with current and past operations. Such laws and regulations include CERCLA and RCRA and their state equivalents. Remediation obligations include cleanup responsibility arising from petroleum releases from underground storage tanks located at numerous past and present ConocoPhillips owned and or operated petroleum marketing outlets throughout the United States. Federal and state laws require that contamination caused by such underground storage tank releases be assessed and remediated to meet applicable standards. In addition to other cleanup standards, many states have adopted cleanup criteria for methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) for both soil and groundwater. MTBE standards continue to evolve, and future environmental expenditures associated with the remediation of MTBE contaminated underground storage tank sites could be substantial. At RCRA permitted facilities, we are required to assess environmental conditions. If conditions warrant, we may be required to remediate contamination caused by prior operations. In contrast to CERCLA, which is often referred to as Superfund, the cost of corrective action activities under RCRA corrective action programs typically is borne solely by us. Over the next decade, we anticipate that significant ongoing expenditures for RCRA remediation activities may be required, but such annual expenditures for the near term are not expected to vary significantly from the range of such expenditures we have experienced over the past few years. Longer term, expenditures are subject to considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly. We, from time to time, receive requests for information or notices of potential liability from the EPA and state environmental agencies alleging that we are a potentially responsible party under CERCLA or an equivalent state statute. On occasion, we also have been made a party to cost recovery litigation by those agencies or by private parties. These requests, notices and lawsuits assert potential liability for remediation costs at various sites that typically are not owned by us, but allegedly contain wastes attributable to our past operations. As of December 31, 2002, we reported we had been notified of potential liability under CERCLA and comparable state laws at 58 sites around the United States. In the 2002 report, sites from Phillips and Conoco were listed separately resulting in eight duplicate listings. These duplicate listings are consolidated in this 2003 report. At December 31, 2003, we had combined the eight duplicate listings, reclassified one existing site, and resolved six sites. Additionally, we had received 16 new notices of potential liability, leaving 61 sites where we have been notified of potential liability. For most Superfund sites, our potential liability will be significantly less than the total site remediation costs because the percentage of waste attributable to us, versus that attributable to all other potentially responsible parties, is relatively low. Although liability of those potentially responsible is generally joint and several for federal sites and frequently so for state sites, other potentially responsible parties at sites where we are a party typically have had the financial strength to meet their obligations, and where they have not, or where potentially responsible parties could not be located, our share of liability has not increased materially. Many of the sites at which we are potentially responsible are still under investigation by the EPA or the state agencies concerned. Prior to actual cleanup, those potentially responsible normally assess site conditions, apportion responsibility and determine the appropriate remediation. In some instances, we may have no liability or attain a settlement of liability. Actual cleanup costs generally occur after the parties obtain EPA or equivalent state agency approval. There are relatively few sites where we are a major participant, and given the timing and amounts of anticipated expenditures, neither the cost of remediation at those sites nor such costs at all CERCLA sites, in the aggregate, is expected to have a material adverse effect on our competitive or financial condition. 74 Table of Contents Expensed environmental costs were $593 million in 2003 and are expected to be about $596 million in 2004 and $574 million in 2005. Capitalized environmental costs were $522 million in 2003 and are expected to be about $742 million and $967 million in 2004 and 2005, respectively. Remediation Accruals We accrue for remediation activities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and reasonable estimates of the liability can be made. These accrued liabilities are not reduced for potential recoveries from insurers or other third parties and are not discounted (except those assumed in a purchase business combination, which we do record on a discounted basis). Many of these liabilities result from CERCLA, RCRA and similar state laws that require us to undertake certain investigative and remedial activities at sites where we conduct, or once conducted, operations or at sites where ConocoPhillips generated waste was disposed. The accrual also includes a number of sites we have identified that may require environmental remediation, but which are not currently the subject of CERCLA, RCRA or state enforcement activities. If applicable, we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third party recoveries. In the future, we may incur significant costs under both CERCLA and RCRA. Considerable uncertainty exists with respect to these costs, and under adverse changes in circumstances, potential liability may exceed amounts accrued as of December 31, 2003. Remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site, depending on the mix of unique site characteristics, evolving remediation technologies, diverse regulatory agencies and enforcement policies, and the presence or absence of potentially liable third parties. Therefore, it is difficult to develop reasonable estimates of future site remediation costs. At December 31, 2003, our balance sheet included a total environmental accrual related to continuing operations of $1,119 million, compared with $743 million at December 31, 2002. The increase in accruals from year end 2002, primarily resulted from evaluation of Conoco environmental liabilities during the purchase price allocation period. We expect to incur the majority of these expenditures within the next 30 years. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, and as with other companies engaged in similar businesses, environmental costs and liabilities are inherent in our operations and products, and there can be no assurance that material costs and liabilities will not be incurred. However, we currently do not expect any material adverse affect upon our results of operations or financial position as a result of compliance with environmental laws and regulations. Other We have deferred tax assets related to certain accrued liabilities, alternative minimum tax credits, and loss carryforwards. Valuation allowances have been established for certain foreign and state net operating loss carryforwards that reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that will, more likely than not, be realized. Uncertainties that may affect the realization of these assets include tax law changes and the future level of product prices and costs. Based on our historical taxable income, our expectations for the future, and available tax planning strategies, management expects that the net deferred tax assets will be realized as offsets to reversing deferred tax liabilities and as reductions in future taxable income. The alternative minimum tax credit can be carried forward indefinitely to reduce our regular tax liability. 75 Table of Contents NEW ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS In December 2003, the FASB revised and reissued SFAS No. 132 (revised 2003), Employers Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, and 106, which revises and requires additional disclosures about pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans. It does not change the measurement or recognition of those plans required by previous Financial Accounting Board Standards. We adopted the provisions of this Standard effective December 2003. Certain provisions of this Standard regarding disclosure of information about foreign plans and disclosure of estimated future benefit payments are not required until 2004. The adoption of the provisions applicable to 2003 did not have an impact on our results of operations or financial position, nor will the adoption of the additional provisions in 2004 have an impact on our results of operations or financial position. In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Liabilities and Equity, to address the balance sheet classification of certain financial instruments that have characteristics of both liabilities and equity. This statement was immediately effective for all contracts created or modified after May 31, 2003, and became effective July 1, 2003, for all previously existing contracts. On November 7, 2003, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 150 3, which deferred certain provisions of SFAS No. 150. As a result of adopting this new accounting standard in the third quarter of 2003, and the subsequent November 7, 2003, deferral of certain provisions, there was no impact on our 2003 financial statements. We continue to monitor the deferral status of SFAS No. 150. In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations, and SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, which became effective on July 1, 2001, and January 1, 2002, respectively. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has requested the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) to consider the issue of whether SFAS Nos. 141 and 142 require interests held under oil, gas and mineral leases to be separately classified as intangible assets on the balance sheets of companies in the extractive industries. Historically, in accordance with SFAS No. 19, Financial Accounting and Reporting by Oil and Gas Producing Companies, we have capitalized the cost of oil and gas leasehold interests and, consistent with industry practice, reported these assets as part of tangible EP properties, plants and equipment. If such interests were deemed to be intangible assets by the EITF, mineral rights to extract oil and gas for both proved and unproved properties would be classified separately from EP properties, plants and equipment as intangible assets on our balance sheet. This interpretation by the EITF would only affect the classification of oil and gas mineral rights on our balance sheet and would not affect total assets, net worth, results of operations or cash flows. EP properties, plants and equipment at December 31, 2003 and 2002, included approximately $10.5 billion and $10.8 billion, respectively, of mineral rights to extract oil and gas, net of accumulated depletion, that would be reclassified on the balance sheet as intangible assets, if the interpretation that the SEC requested the EITF to consider was applied. We plan to continue to classify oil and gas mineral rights as EP properties, plants and equipment until further guidance is provided by the EITF. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to select appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. See Note 1 Accounting Policies 76 Table of Contents in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for descriptions of our major accounting policies. Certain of these accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is a reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts would have been reported under different conditions, or if different assumptions had been used. These critical accounting policies are discussed with the Audit and Compliance Committee on an annual basis and are presented below. Oil and Gas Accounting Accounting for oil and gas exploratory activity is subject to special accounting rules that are unique to the oil and gas industry. The acquisition of geological and geophysical seismic information, prior to the discovery of proved reserves, is expensed as incurred, similar to accounting for research and development costs. However, leasehold acquisition costs and exploratory well costs are capitalized on the balance sheet, pending determination of whether proved oil and gas reserves have been discovered on the prospect. Property Acquisition Costs For individually significant leaseholds, management periodically assesses for impairment based on exploration and drilling efforts to date. For leasehold acquisition costs that individually are relatively small, management exercises judgment and determines a percentage probability that the prospect ultimately will fail to find proved oil and gas reserves and pools that leasehold information with others in the geographic area. For prospects in areas that have had limited, or no, previous exploratory drilling, the percentage probability of ultimate failure is normally judged to be quite high. This judgmental percentage is multiplied by the leasehold acquisition cost, and that product is divided by the contractual period of the leasehold to determine a periodic leasehold impairment charge that is reported in exploration expense. This judgmental probability percentage is reassessed and adjusted throughout the contractual period of the leasehold based on favorable or unfavorable exploratory activity on the leasehold or on adjacent leaseholds, and leasehold impairment amortization expense is adjusted prospectively. By the end of the contractual period of the leasehold, the impairment probability percentage will have been adjusted to 100 percent if the leasehold is expected to be abandoned, or will have been adjusted to zero percent if there is an oil or gas discovery that is under development. See the supplemental Oil and Gas Operations disclosures about Costs Incurred and Capitalized Costs for more information about the amounts and geographic locations of costs incurred in acquisition activity, and the amounts on the balance sheet related to unproved properties. Exploratory Costs For exploratory wells, drilling costs are temporarily capitalized, or suspended, on the balance sheet, pending a judgmental determination of whether potentially economic oil and gas reserves have been discovered by the drilling effort. This judgment usually is made within two months of the completion of the drilling effort, but can take longer, depending on the complexity of the geologic structure. Accounting rules require that this judgment be made at least within one year of well completion. If a judgment is made that the well did not encounter potentially economic oil and gas quantities, the well costs are expensed as a dry hole and are reported in exploration expense. Exploratory wells that are judged to have discovered potentially economic quantities of oil and gas and that are in areas where a major capital expenditure (e.g., a pipeline or offshore platform) would be required before production could begin, and where the economic viability of that major capital expenditure depends upon the successful completion of further exploratory work in the area, remain capitalized on the balance sheet as long as additional exploratory appraisal work is under way or firmly planned. For complicated offshore exploratory discoveries, it is not unusual to have exploratory wells remain suspended on the balance sheet for several years while we perform additional appraisal work on the potential oil and gas field. Unlike leasehold acquisition costs, there is no periodic impairment assessment of suspended exploratory well costs. Management continuously monitors the results of the additional appraisal drilling and seismic work and expenses the suspended well costs as dry holes when it judges that the potential field does not warrant further exploratory efforts in the near term. 77 Table of Contents See the supplemental Oil and Gas Operations disclosures about Costs Incurred and Capitalized Costs for more information about the amounts and geographic locations of costs incurred in exploration activity and the amounts on the balance sheet related to unproved properties, as well as the Wells In Progress disclosure for the number and geographic location of wells not yet declared productive or dry. Proved Oil and Gas Reserves Engineering estimates of the quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves in oil and gas fields are inherently imprecise and represent only approximate amounts because of the subjective judgments involved in developing such information. Despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates, accounting rules require supplemental disclosure of proved oil and gas reserve estimates due to the importance of these estimates to better understanding the perceived value and future cash flows of a companys oil and gas operations. The judgmental estimation of proved oil and gas reserves also is important to the income statement because the proved oil and gas reserve estimate for a field serves as the denominator in the unit of production calculation of depreciation, depletion and amortization of the capitalized costs for that field. There are several authoritative guidelines regarding the engineering criteria that have to be met before estimated oil and gas reserves can be designated as proved. Our reservoir engineering department has policies and procedures in place that are consistent with these authoritative guidelines. We have qualified and experienced internal engineering personnel who make these estimates. Proved reserve estimates are updated annually and take into account recent production and seismic information about each field. Also, as required by authoritative guidelines, the estimated future date when a field will be permanently shut in for economic reasons is based on an extrapolation of oil and gas prices and operating costs prevalent at the balance sheet date. This estimated date when production will end affects the amount of estimated recoverable reserves. Therefore, as prices and cost levels change from year to year, the estimate of proved reserves also changes. Canadian Syncrude Reserves Canadian Syncrude proven reserves cannot be measured precisely. Reserve estimates of Canadian Syncrude are based on subjective judgments involving geological and engineering assessments of in place crude bitumen volume, the mining plan, historical extraction recovery and upgrading yield factors, installed plant operating capacity and operating approval limits. The reliability of these estimates at any point in time depends on both the quality and quantity of the technical and economic data and the efficiency of extracting the bitumen and upgrading it into a light sweet crude oil. Despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates, these estimates are used in determining depreciation expense. Impairment of Assets Long lived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in the future cash flows expected to be generated by an asset group. If, upon review, the sum of the undiscounted pretax cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset group, the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value. Individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes based on a judgmental assessment of the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets generally on a field by field basis for exploration and production assets, at an entire complex level for downstream assets, or at a site level for retail stores. Because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for long lived assets, the fair value usually is based on the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates commensurate with the risks involved in the asset group. The expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are based on judgmental assessments of future production volumes, prices and costs, considering all available information at the date of review. See Note 12 Property Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. 78 Table of Contents Asset Retirement Obligations and Environmental Costs Under various contracts, permits and regulations, we have material legal obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore the land or seabed at the end of operations at production sites. The largest asset removal obligations facing us involve removal and disposal of offshore oil and gas platforms around the world, and oil and gas production facilities and pipelines in Alaska. The estimated discounted costs of dismantling and removing these facilities are accrued at the installation of the asset. Estimating the future asset removal costs necessary for this accounting calculation is difficult. Most of these removal obligations are many years in the future and the contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what removal practices and criteria will have to be met when the removal event actually occurs. Asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing, as well as political, environmental, safety and public relations considerations. See Note 1 Accounting Policies and Note 13 Asset Retirement Obligations and Accrued Environmental Costs, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. Business Acquisitions Purchase Price Allocation Accounting for the acquisition of a business requires the allocation of the purchase price to the various assets and liabilities of the acquired business. For most assets and liabilities, purchase price allocation is accomplished by recording the asset or liability at its estimated fair value. The most difficult estimations of individual fair values are those involving properties, plants and equipment and identifiable intangible assets. We use all available information to make these fair value determinations and, for major business acquisitions, typically engage an outside appraisal firm to assist in the fair value determination of the acquired long lived assets. We have, if necessary, up to one year after the acquisition closing date to finish these fair value determinations and finalize the purchase price allocation. Intangible Assets and Goodwill In connection with the acquisition of Tosco Corporation on September 14, 2001, and the merger on August 30, 2002, we recorded material intangible assets for tradenames, air emission permit credits, and permits to operate refineries. These intangible assets were determined to have indefinite useful lives and so are not amortized. This judgmental assessment of an indefinite useful life has to be continuously evaluated in the future. If, due to changes in facts and circumstances, management determines that these intangible assets then have definite useful lives, amortization will have to commence at that time on a prospective basis. As long as these intangible assets are judged to have indefinite lives, they will be subject to periodic lower of cost or market tests, which requires managements judgment of the estimated fair value of these intangible assets. See Note 6 Acquisition of Tosco Corporation, Note 3 Merger of Conoco and Phillips, and Note 12 Property Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. Also in connection with the acquisition of Tosco and the merger, we recorded a material amount of goodwill. Under the accounting rules for goodwill, this intangible asset is not amortized. Instead, goodwill is subject to annual reviews for impairment based on a two step accounting test. The first step is to compare the estimated fair value of any reporting units within the company that have recorded goodwill with the recorded net book value (including the goodwill) of the reporting unit. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is higher than the recorded net book value, no impairment is deemed to exist and no further testing is required that year. If, however, the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is below the recorded net book value, then a second step must be performed to determine the amount of the goodwill impairment to record, if any. In this second step, the estimated fair value from the first step is used as the purchase price in a hypothetical new acquisition of the reporting unit. The various purchase business combination rules are followed to determine a hypothetical purchase price allocation for the reporting 79 Table of Contents units assets and liabilities. The residual amount of goodwill that results from this hypothetical purchase price allocation is compared with the recorded amount of goodwill for the reporting unit, and the recorded amount is written down to the hypothetical amount if lower. The reporting unit or units used to evaluate and measure goodwill for impairment are determined primarily from the manner in which the business is managed. A reporting unit is an operating segment or a component that is one level below an operating segment. A component is a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component. However, two or more components of an operating segment shall be aggregated and deemed a single reporting unit if the components have similar economic characteristics. We have determined that we have three reporting units for purposes of assigning goodwill and testing for impairment. These are Worldwide Exploration and Production, Worldwide Refining and Worldwide Marketing. Our Midstream, Chemicals and Emerging Businesses operating segments were not assigned any goodwill from the merger because the two predecessor companies operations did not overlap in these operating segments so we were unable to capture significant synergies and strategic advantages from the merger in these areas. In our Exploration and Production operating segment, management reporting is primarily organized based on geographic areas. All of these geographic areas have similar business processes, distribution networks and customers, and are supported by a worldwide exploration team and shared services organizations. Therefore, all components have been aggregated into one reporting unit, Worldwide Exploration and Production, which is the same as the operating segment. In contrast, in our Refining and Marketing operating segment, management reporting is primarily organized based on functional areas. Because the two broad functional areas of Refining and Marketing have dissimilar business processes and customers, we concluded that it would not be appropriate to aggregate these components into only one reporting unit at the Refining and Marketing operating segment level. Instead, we have identified two reporting units within the operating segment: Worldwide Refining and Worldwide Marketing. Components in those two reporting units have similar business processes, distribution networks and customers. If we later reorganize our businesses or management structure so that the components within these three reporting units are no longer economically similar, the reporting units would be revised and goodwill would be re assigned using a relative fair value approach in accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Goodwill impairment testing at a lower reporting unit level could result in the recognition of impairment that would not otherwise be recognized at the current higher level of aggregation. In addition, the sale or disposition of a portion of these three reporting units will be allocated a portion of the reporting units goodwill, based on relative fair values, which will adjust the amount of gain or loss on the sale or disposition. Because quoted market prices for our reporting units are not available, management has to apply judgment in determining the estimated fair value of these reporting units for purposes of performing the first step of the periodic goodwill impairment test. Management uses all available information to make these fair value determinations, including the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates commensurate with the risks involved in the assets and observed market multiples of operating cash flows and net income, and may engage an outside appraisal firm for assistance. In addition, if the first test step is not met, further judgment has to be applied in determining the fair values of individual assets and liabilities for purposes of the hypothetical purchase price allocation. Again, management has to use all available information to make these fair value determinations and may engage an outside appraisal firm for assistance. At year end 2003, the estimated fair values of our Worldwide Exploration and Production, Worldwide Refining, and Worldwide Marketing reporting units, excluding those included in discontinued operations, ranged from between 15 percent to 35 percent higher than recorded net book values (including goodwill) of the reporting units. However, a lower fair value estimate in the future for any of these reporting units could result in impairment of the $15.1 billion of goodwill. 80 Table of Contents Inventory Valuation Prior to the acquisition of Tosco in September 2001 and the merger in August 2002, our inventories on the last in, first out (LIFO) cost basis were predominantly reflected on the balance sheet at historical cost layers established many years ago, when price levels were much lower. Therefore, prior to 2001, our LIFO inventories were relatively insensitive to current price level changes. However, the acquisition of Tosco and the ConocoPhillips merger added LIFO cost layers that were recorded at replacement cost levels prevalent in late September 2001 and August 2002, respectively. As a result, our LIFO cost inventories are now much more sensitive to lower of cost or market impairment write downs, whenever price levels fall. We recorded a LIFO inventory lower of cost or market impairment in the fourth quarter of 2001 due to a crude oil price deterioration. While crude oil is not the only product in the companys LIFO pools, its market value is a major factor in lower of cost or market calculations. We estimate that additional impairments could occur if a 60 percent/40 percent blended average of West Texas Intermediate/Brent crude oil prices falls below $21.25 per barrel at a reporting date. The determination of replacement cost values for the lower of cost or market test uses objective evidence, but does involve judgment in determining the most appropriate objective evidence to use in the calculations. Projected Benefit Obligations Determination of the projected benefit obligations for our defined benefit pension and postretirement plans are important to the recorded amounts for such obligations on the balance sheet and to the amount of benefit expense in the income statement. This also impacts the required company contributions into the plans. The actuarial determination of projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements involves judgment about uncertain future events, including estimated retirement dates, salary levels at retirement, mortality rates, lump sum election rates, rates of return on plan assets, future health care cost trend rates, and rates of utilization of health care services by retirees. Due to the specialized nature of these calculations, we engage outside actuarial firms to assist in the determination of these projected benefit obligations. For Employee Retirement Income Security Act qualified pension plans, the actuary exercises fiduciary care on behalf of plan participants in the determination of the judgmental assumptions used in determining required company contributions into plan assets. Due to differing objectives and requirements between financial accounting rules and the pension plan funding regulations promulgated by governmental agencies, the actuarial methods and assumptions for the two purposes differ in certain important respects. Ultimately, we will be required to fund all promised benefits under pension and postretirement benefit plans not funded by plan assets or investment returns, but the judgmental assumptions used in the actuarial calculations significantly affect periodic financial statements and funding patterns over time. Benefit expense is particularly sensitive to the discount rate and return on plan assets assumptions. A 1 percent decrease in the discount rate would increase annual benefit expense by $85 million, while a 1 percent decrease in the return on plan assets assumption would increase annual benefit expense by $25 million. OUTLOOK After adjusting for asset dispositions, EPs worldwide production for 2004 is expected to be about the same level as it was in 2003. The dispositions contributed approximately 37,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day to 2003 production. For 2004, production increases in Asia Pacific and Latin America are expected to offset net declines in the United States, Canada and the North Sea. In RM, the optimization of spending related to clean fuels project initiatives will be an important focus area during 2004. In addition, we expect our average refinery crude oil utilization rate for 2004 to average about the same as in 2003. 81 Table of Contents Crude oil and natural gas prices are subject to external factors over which we have no control, such as global economic conditions, political events, demand growth, inventory levels, weather, competing fuels prices, and availability of supply. Crude oil prices rose significantly in 2003 due to supply disruptions during the year in several producing countries and the delays in the return of Iraqi crude production to the market in the face of rising global oil demand. As a result of these factors, global oil inventories remained at exceptionally low levels throughout 2003. Low oil inventories, coupled with economic recovery and the prospects for higher oil demand growth are expected to keep prices elevated through the first half of 2004. U.S. natural gas prices weakened moderately during the second half of 2003 from the very strong levels experienced during the second quarter, but the annual average was significantly higher in 2003 versus 2002. Prices weakened in the second half due to a strong buildup of natural gas inventories during the summer and early fall, as mild weather, weak industrial demand and fuel switching reduced natural gas demand. At the same time, high prices and the startup of a mothballed regasification terminal increased LNG imports to the United States. However, natural gas prices rose moderately in December, reflecting continuing concerns about the adequacy of gas supplies in the United States. Supply adequacy concerns are expected to keep prices above historical levels in 2004. Refining margins are subject to movements in the price of crude oil and other feedstocks, and the prices of petroleum products, which are subject to market factors over which we have no control, such as the U.S. and global economies; government regulations; military, political and social conditions in oil producing countries; seasonal factors that affect demand, such as the summer driving months; and the levels of refining output and product inventories. U.S. and international refining and marketing margins rose in 2003 versus 2002, due to improved refined product demand and a series of supply disruptions. U.S. refining margins were above the five year historical average in 2003 as a result of refinery outages in several regions of the United States, a product pipeline rupture in Arizona, and labor strikes in Venezuela, which removed both crude and refined products from the market. Combined with strong product demand, product inventories were drawn down to extremely low levels in the first half of the year, which elevated refining margins. Stronger demand in the face of tight supplies also improved marketing margins in 2003 versus 2002. The sustainability of current refining and marketing margins depends on the continued recovery of the global economy and refined product demand growth. In February 2003, the Venezuelan government implemented a currency exchange control regime. The government has published legal instruments supporting the controls, one of which establishes official exchange rates for the U.S. dollar. The devaluation of the Venezuelan currency by approximately 17 percent in February 2004 did not have a significant impact on our Venezuelan operations; however, future changes in the exchange rate could have a significant impact on our Venezuelan operations. In addition, our Venezuelan operations remain subject to civil unrest in the country. Our Venezuelan operations contributed approximately $150 million to our 2003 net income. In June 2003, we and our co venturers in the Mackenzie gas project in Canada announced that funding and participation agreements have been reached and a preliminary information package was submitted to relevant regulatory authorities. The Mackenzie gas project involves natural gas production facilities, compression and gathering pipelines in the Mackenzie Delta area, and a pipeline system in the Mackenzie River Valley. The filing of the information package is a key step in the process leading to the submission of applications for the development of the natural gas fields and pipeline facilities. Regulatory applications are expected to be filed in 2004. First gas production is currently targeted to commence in late 2009. In July 2003, we signed a Heads of Agreement with Qatar Petroleum for the development of Qatargas 3, a large scale LNG project located in Qatar and servicing the U.S. natural gas market. This provides the framework for the necessary agreements and the completion of key feasibility studies. Qatargas 3 would be an integrated project, jointly owned by us and Qatar Petroleum, consisting of facilities to produce and liquefy gas from Qatars North field. The LNG would be shipped from Qatar, and we would be 82 Table of Contents responsible for regasification and marketing within the United States. Average daily gas sales volumes are projected to be approximately 1 billion cubic feet per day with startup anticipated in the 2009 timeframe. In late October 2003, we signed a Heads of Agreement with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, ENI and ChevronTexaco to conduct front end engineering and design work for an LNG facility to be constructed in Nigerias central Niger Delta. The participants have agreed to form an incorporated joint venture, Brass LNG Limited, to undertake the project. The engineering and design studies are expected to be completed in 2005, and the facility is targeted to be operational in 2009. In December 2003, we signed a Statement of Intent with Qatar Petroleum regarding the construction of a gas to liquids plant in Ras Laffan, Qatar. The Statement of Intent initiates detailed technical and commercial pre front end engineering and design studies and establishes principles for negotiating a Heads of Agreement for an integrated reservoir to market plant. More definite agreements are expected in 2004. Also in December 2003, we announced the signing of an agreement with Freeport LNG Development, L.P. to participate in its proposed LNG receiving terminal in Quintana, Texas. We would acquire 1 billion cubic feet per day of regasification capacity in the terminal for our use and obtain a 50 percent interest in the general partnership managing the venture. The terminal will be designed with a storage capacity of 6.9 billion cubic feet and a send out capacity of 1.5 billion cubic feet per day. Pending government approvals, construction is scheduled to begin in the second half of 2004, with commercial startup in mid 2007. In addition, we and our co venturer are pursuing a proposed LNG receiving terminal in Harpswell, Maine. The proposal calls for construction of the terminal at a site previously used as a U.S. Navy fuel depot. LNG would be converted back to natural gas at the terminal for delivery through a new pipeline that would connect the terminal to the existing pipeline grid. Depending on receipt of the necessary regulatory approvals, construction could begin in 2006, with the facility operational by 2009.

Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Financial Instrument Market Risk We and certain of our subsidiaries hold and issue derivative contracts and financial instruments that expose cash flows or earnings to changes in commodity prices, foreign exchange rates or interest rates. We may use financial and commodity based derivative contracts to manage the risks produced by changes in the prices of electric power, natural gas, crude oil and related products, fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, or to exploit market opportunities. Our use of derivative instruments is governed by an Authority Limitations document approved by our Board that prohibits the use of highly leveraged derivatives or derivative instruments without sufficient liquidity for comparable valuations without approval from the Chief Executive Officer. The Authority 84 Table of Contents Limitations document also authorizes the Chief Executive Officer to establish the maximum Value at Risk (VaR) limits for the company and compliance with these limits is monitored daily. The Chief Financial Officer monitors risks resulting from foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, while the Executive Vice President of Commercial monitors commodity price risk. Both report to the Chief Executive Officer. The Commercial group manages our commercial marketing, optimizes our commodity flows and positions, monitors related risks of our upstream and downstream businesses, and selectively takes price risk to add value. Commodity Price Risk We operate in the worldwide crude oil, refined products, natural gas, natural gas liquids, and electric power markets and are exposed to fluctuations in the prices for these commodities. These fluctuations can affect our revenues, as well as the cost of operating, investing, and financing activities. Generally, our policy is to remain exposed to market prices of commodities; however, executive management may elect to use derivative instruments to hedge the price risk of our crude oil and natural gas production, as well as refinery margins. Our Commercial group uses futures, forwards, swaps, and options in various markets to optimize the value of our supply chain, which may move our risk profile away from market average prices to accomplish the following objectives: Balance physical systems. In addition to cash settlement prior to contract expiration, exchange traded futures contracts also may be settled by physical delivery of the commodity, providing another source of supply to meet our refinery requirements or marketing demand; Meet customer needs. Consistent with our policy to generally remain exposed to market prices, we use swap contracts to convert fixed price sales contracts, which are often requested by natural gas and refined product consumers, to a floating market price; Manage the risk to our cash flows from price exposures on specific crude oil, natural gas, refined product and electric power transactions; and Enable us to use the market knowledge gained from these activities to do a limited amount of trading not directly related to our physical business. For the 12 months ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, the gains or losses from this activity were not material to our cash flows or income from continuing operations. We use a VaR model to estimate the loss in fair value that could potentially result on a single day from the effect of adverse changes in market conditions on the derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments held or issued, including commodity purchase and sales contracts recorded on the balance sheet at December 31, 2003, as derivative instruments in accordance with SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended. Using Monte Carlo simulation, a 95 percent confidence level and a one day holding period, the VaR for those instruments issued or held for trading purposes at December 31, 2003 and 2002, was immaterial to our net income and cash flows. The VaR for instruments held for purposes other than trading at December 31, 2003 and 2002, was also immaterial to our net income and cash flows. 85 Table of Contents Interest Rate Risk The following tables provide information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. The debt tables present principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates; the derivative table shows the notional quantities on which the cash flows will be calculated by swap termination date. Weighted average variable rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at the reporting date. The carrying amount of our floating rate debt approximates its fair value. The fair value of the fixed rate financial instruments is estimated based on quoted market prices.

Under SFAS 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, these swaps were designated as hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of $400 million of 3.625% Notes due 2007, $750 million of 6.35% Notes due 2009, and $350 million of 4.75% Notes due 2012. These swaps qualify for the shortcut method of hedge accounting, so over the term of the swaps we will not recognize gain or loss due to ineffectiveness in the hedge.

We do not comprehensively hedge the exposure to currency rate changes, although we may choose to selectively hedge exposures to foreign currency rate risk. Examples include firm commitments for capital projects, certain local currency tax payments and dividends, and cash returns from net investments in foreign affiliates to be remitted within the coming year. At December 31, 2003, we held foreign currency swaps hedging short term intercompany loans between European subsidiaries and a U.S. subsidiary. Although these swaps hedge exposures to fluctuations in exchange rates, we elected not to utilize hedge accounting as allowed by SFAS No. 133. As a result, the change in the fair value of these foreign currency swaps is recorded directly in earnings. Since the gain or loss on the swaps is offset by the gain or loss from remeasuring the intercompany loans into the functional currency of the lender or borrower, there would be no impact to income from an adverse hypothetical 10 percent change in the December 31, 2003, exchange rates. The notional and fair market values of these positions at December 31, 2003, were as follows: 87 Table of Contents Millions of Dollars Notional Fair Market Value Foreign Currency Swaps Sell U.S. dollar, buy euro $ 267 2 Sell U.S. dollar, buy British pound 789 26 Sell U.S. dollar, buy Danish krone 12 Sell U.S. dollar, buy Norway kroner 380 7 Sell U.S. dollar, buy Swedish krona 93 5 At December 31, 2002, ConocoPhillips had the following significant foreign currency derivative contracts: Approximately $194 million in foreign currency swaps hedging the companys European commercial paper program, with a fair value of $7.1 million; Approximately $536 million in foreign currency swaps hedging short term intercompany loans between U.K. subsidiaries and a U.S. subsidiary, with a fair value of $9 million; and Approximately $24 million in foreign currency swaps hedging the companys firm purchase and sales commitments for gasoline in Germany, with a negative fair value of $4 million. Although these swaps hedge exposures to fluctuations in exchange rates, the company elected not to utilize hedge accounting as allowed by SFAS No. 133. As a result, the change in the fair value of these foreign currency swaps is recorded directly in earnings. Assuming an adverse hypothetical 10 percent change in the December 31, 2002, exchange rates, the potential foreign currency remeasurement loss in non cash pretax earnings from these swaps, intercompany loans, and commercial paper would be approximately $3 million. In addition to the intercompany loans discussed above, at December 31, 2002, U.S. subsidiaries held long term sterling denominated intercompany receivables totaling $152 million due from a U.K. subsidiary. A Norwegian subsidiary held $198 million of intercompany U.S. dollar denominated receivables due from its U.S. parent at December 31, 2002. The potential foreign currency remeasurement gains or losses in non cash pretax earnings from a hypothetical 10 percent change in the year end 2002 exchange rates from these intercompany balances was $35 million.
