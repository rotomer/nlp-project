RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Merger of Conoco and Phillips On August 30, 2002, Conoco Inc. (Conoco) and Phillips Petroleum Company (Phillips) combined their businesses by merging with wholly owned subsidiaries of a new company named ConocoPhillips (the merger). The merger was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting, with Phillips designated as the acquirer for accounting purposes. Because Phillips was designated as the acquirer, its operations and results are presented in this annual report for all periods prior to the close of the merger. From the merger date forward, the operations and results of ConocoPhillips reflect the combined operations of the two companies. Business Environment and Executive Overview ConocoPhillips is an international, integrated energy company. We are the third largest integrated energy company in the United States, based on market capitalization. We have approximately 35,800 employees worldwide, and at year end 2004 had assets of $93 billion. Our stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol COP. Our business is organized into six operating segments: Exploration and Production (EP) This segment primarily explores for, produces and markets crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids on a worldwide basis. Midstream This segment gathers and processes natural gas produced by ConocoPhillips and others, and fractionates and markets natural gas liquids, primarily in the United States, Canada and Trinidad. The Midstream segment includes our 30.3 percent equity investment in Duke Energy Field Services, LLC (DEFS), a joint venture with Duke Energy Corporation. Refining and Marketing (RM) This segment purchases, refines, markets and transports crude oil and petroleum products, mainly in the United States, Europe and Asia. LUKOIL Investment This segment consists of our equity investment in the ordinary shares of LUKOIL, an international, integrated oil and gas company headquartered in Russia. Our investment was 10 percent at December 31, 2004. 43 Table of Contents Chemicals This segment manufactures and markets petrochemicals and plastics on a worldwide basis. The Chemicals segment consists of our 50 percent equity investment in Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC (CPChem), a joint venture with ChevronTexaco Corporation. Emerging Businesses This segment encompasses the development of new businesses beyond our traditional operations, including new technologies related to natural gas conversion into clean fuels and related products (e.g., gas to liquids), technology solutions, power generation, and emerging technologies. Crude oil and natural gas prices, along with refining margins, play the most significant roles in our profitability. Accordingly, our overall earnings depend primarily upon the profitability of our EP and RM segments. Crude oil and natural gas prices, along with refining margins, are driven by market factors over which we have no control. However, from a competitive perspective, there are other important factors that we must manage well to be successful, including: Adding to our proved reserve base. We add to our proved reserve base in three primary ways: o Successful exploration and development of new fields. o Acquisition of existing fields. o Applying new technologies and processes to boost recovery from existing fields. Through a combination of all three methods listed above, we have been successful in the past in maintaining or adding to our production and proved reserve base, and we anticipate being able to do so in the future. In the three years ending December 31, 2004, our reserve replacement exceeded 200 percent, excluding the impact of our equity investment in LUKOIL. The replacement rate was primarily attributable to the merger of Conoco and Phillips, and extensions and discoveries. Improved recovery also positively contributed to our reserve replacement success. Although it cannot be assured, going forward, we expect to more than replace our production over the next three years, excluding the impact of our equity investment in LUKOIL. This expectation is based on our current slate of exploratory and improved recovery projects. Operating our producing properties and refining and marketing operations safely, consistently and in an environmentally sound manner. Safety is our first priority and we are committed to protecting the health and safety of everyone who has a role in our operations. Maintaining high utilization rates at our refineries, minimizing downtime in producing fields, and maximizing the development of our reserves all enable us to capture the value the market gives us in terms of prices and margins. During 2004, our worldwide refinery utilization rate was 94 percent, compared with 95 percent in 2003. Finally, our operations are conducted in a manner that emphasizes our environmental stewardship. Controlling costs and expenses. Since we cannot control the prices of the commodity products we sell, keeping our operating and overhead costs low, within the context of our commitment to safety and environmental stewardship, is a high priority. We monitor these costs using various methodologies that are reported to senior management monthly, on both an absolute dollar basis and a per unit basis. Because low operating and overhead costs are critical to maintaining competitive positions in our industries, cost control is a component of our variable compensation programs. Selecting the appropriate projects in which to invest our capital dollars. We participate in capital intensive industries. As a result, we must often invest significant capital dollars to explore for new oil and gas fields, develop newly discovered fields, maintain existing fields, or continue to maintain and improve our refinery complexes. We invest in those projects that are expected to provide an adequate financial return on invested dollars. However, there are often long lead times 44 Table of Contents from the time we make an investment to the time that investment is operational and begins generating financial returns. Our capital expenditures and investments in 2004 totaled $9.5 billion, and we anticipate capital expenditures and investments to be approximately $7.9 billion in 2005. The 2005 amount excludes any discretionary expenditures that may be made to further increase our equity investment in LUKOIL. Excluding investments in LUKOIL, we project that 2005 capital expenditures will be higher than 2004 due to ongoing development projects, cost increases and new opportunities. Managing our asset portfolio. We continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire assets that will contribute to future growth at competitive prices. We also continually assess our assets to determine if any no longer fit our growth strategy and should be sold or otherwise disposed. This management of our asset portfolio is important to ensuring our long term growth and maintaining adequate financial returns. During 2004 we substantially completed the asset disposition program that we announced at the time of the merger. Also during 2004, we acquired a 10 percent interest in LUKOIL, a major Russian integrated energy company. Hiring, developing and retaining a talented workforce. We want to attract, train, develop and retain individuals with the knowledge and skills to implement our business strategy and who support our values and ethics. Our key performance indicators are shown in the statistical tables provided at the beginning of the operating segment sections that follow. These include crude oil and natural gas prices and production, natural gas liquids prices, refining capacity utilization, and refinery output. Other significant factors that can and or do affect our profitability include: Property and leasehold impairments. As mentioned above, we participate in capital intensive industries. At times, these investments become impaired when our reserve estimates are revised downward, when crude oil or natural gas prices decline significantly for long periods of time, or when a decision to dispose of an asset leads to a write down to fair market value. Property impairments in 2004 totaled $164 million, compared with $252 million in 2003. We may also invest large amounts of money in exploration blocks which, if exploratory drilling proves unsuccessful, could lead to material impairment of leasehold values. Goodwill. As a result of mergers and acquisitions, at year end 2004 we had $15 billion of goodwill on our balance sheet. Although our latest tests indicate that no goodwill impairment is currently required, future deterioration in market conditions could lead to goodwill impairments that would have a substantial negative affect on our profitability. Tax jurisdictions. As a global company, our operations are located in countries with different tax rates and fiscal structures. Accordingly, our overall effective tax rate can vary significantly between periods based on the mix of earnings within our global operations. Segment Analysis The EP segments results are most closely linked to crude oil and natural gas prices. These are commodity products, the prices of which are subject to factors external to our company and over which we have no control. We benefited from favorable crude oil prices in 2004, which contributed significantly to what we view as strong results from this segment in 2004. Industry crude oil prices were approximately $10 per barrel higher in 2004, versus 2003, averaging $41.42 per barrel for West Texas Intermediate. The increase primarily was due to strong global consumption associated with the robust global economic recovery and particularly strong demand growth in China, as well as oil supply disruptions in Iraq and in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico due to hurricane activity, with little excess OPEC production capacity available to replace lost supplies. Industry U.S. natural gas prices were moderately higher in 2004, versus 2003, 45 Table of Contents averaging approximately $6.13 per thousand cubic feet for Henry Hub. Natural gas prices rose in 2004 due primarily to higher oil prices, continued concerns regarding the adequacy of U.S. natural gas supplies, and hurricane activity disrupting production in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. At year end 2004, we estimated that a $1 per barrel change in crude oil prices would have an estimated $180 million annual impact on net income. For natural gas, the corresponding impact is approximately $50 million for a 10 cent per thousand cubic feet price change. The Midstream segments results are most closely linked to natural gas liquids prices. The most important factor on the profitability of this segment is the results from our 30.3 percent equity investment in DEFS. Higher natural gas liquids prices improved results from this segment in 2004. During 2004, we sold some of our non DEFS Midstream assets located in the Lower 48 states that are not associated with our EP operations. Refining margins, refinery utilization, cost control, and marketing margins primarily drive the RM segments results. Refining margins are subject to movements in the cost of crude oil and other feedstocks, and the sales prices for refined products, which are subject to market factors over which we have no control. Refining margins in 2004 were improved over 2003, resulting in improved RM profitability. Industry U.S. refining margins were sharply higher in 2004 versus 2003 due to robust U.S. refined product demand and concerns regarding the adequacy of refined product supplies in the U.S. market in light of tightening gasoline specifications and the ban on methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) in New York and Connecticut. Industry U.S. marketing margins declined in 2004 versus 2003, as wholesale and retail prices did not keep pace with rising gasoline and diesel spot market prices, which rose in part as a consequence of the increase in crude oil prices. At year end 2004, we estimated that a 25 cent per barrel change in worldwide refining margins would have an estimated $125 million annual impact on net income. For U.S. marketing margins, the corresponding impact is approximately $100 million for a 1 cent per gallon margin change. Our refineries operated at 94 percent of capacity in 2004, and our goal in 2005 is to operate at an even higher level. The LUKOIL Investment segment consists of our investment in the ordinary shares of LUKOIL. In October 2004, we closed on a transaction to acquire 7.6 percent of LUKOILs shares held by the Russian government for approximately $2 billion. During the remainder of the year, we acquired additional shares in the open market for an additional $641 million, bringing our equity ownership interest in LUKOIL to 10 percent by year end 2004. The Chemicals segment consists of our 50 percent interest in CPChem. The chemicals and plastics industry is mainly a commodity based industry where the margins for key products are based on market factors over which CPChem has little or no control. The chemicals and plastics industry had been in a cyclical downturn that began in late 2000. In this difficult market environment, CPChem placed great emphasis on safety, cost control and managing its capacity utilization. In addition, CPChem is investing in feedstock advantaged areas in the Middle East with access to large, growing markets, such as Asia. During 2004, margins improved in the chemicals and plastics industries, leading to improved results from this segment. The Emerging Businesses segment represents our investment in new technologies or businesses outside our normal scope of operations. We do not expect the results from this segment to be material to our consolidated results. However, the businesses in this segment allow us to support our primary segments by staying current on new technologies that could become important drivers of profitability in future years. 46 Table of Contents At December 31, 2004, we had a debt to capital ratio of 26 percent, compared with 34 percent at the end of 2003. The decrease was due to a $2.8 billion reduction in debt during 2004, along with increased equity reflecting strong earnings. If market conditions permit, we are targeting to lower our debt to capital ratio over the next several years to the low 20 percent range. This should improve our cost of capital and further position us for growth opportunities in the future. Consolidated Results Millions of Dollars Years Ended December 31 2004 2003 2002 Income from continuing operations $ 8,107 4,593 698 Income (loss) from discontinued operations 22 237 (993 ) Cumulative effect of accounting changes (95) * Net income (loss) $ 8,129 4,735 (295 ) * Includes a $107 million charge related to discontinued operations. A summary of the companys net income (loss) by business segment follows: Millions of Dollars Years Ended December 31 2004 2003 2002 Exploration and Production (EP) $ 5,702 4,302 1,749 Midstream 235 130 55 Refining and Marketing (RM) 2,743 1,272 143 LUKOIL Investment 74 Chemicals 249 7 (14 ) Emerging Businesses (102 ) (99 ) (310 ) Corporate and Other (772 ) (877 ) (1,918 ) Net income (loss) $ 8,129 4,735 (295 ) 2004 vs. 2003 Net income was $8,129 million in 2004, compared with $4,735 million in 2003. The improved results in 2004 primarily were due to: Improved refining margins in our RM segment. Higher crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices in our EP and Midstream segments. Improved margins in the Chemicals segment. Initial equity earnings from our investment in LUKOIL. See the Segment Results section for additional information on our segment results. 47 Table of Contents 2003 vs. 2002 Net income was $4,735 million in 2003, compared with a net loss of $295 million in 2002. The improved results in 2003 were primarily due to: Increased EP and RM production volumes as a result of the merger. Higher crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids prices in our EP segment. Improved refining and marketing margins in our RM segment. Lower impairments and lease loss accruals related to discontinued operations. Lower merger related expenses in 2003, compared with 2002. Income Statement Analysis 2004 vs. 2003 Sales and other operating revenues increased 30 percent in 2004, while purchased crude oil, natural gas and products increased 34 percent. These increases mainly were due to: Higher petroleum products prices. Higher prices for crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids. Increased volumes of natural gas bought and sold by our commercial organization in its role of optimizing the commodity flows of our EP segment. Higher excise, value added and other similar taxes. Equity in earnings of affiliates increased 183 percent in 2004. The increase reflects initial equity earnings from our investment in LUKOIL, as well as improved results from: Our heavy oil joint ventures in Venezuela (Hamaca and Petrozuata), due to higher crude oil prices and higher production volumes. Our chemicals joint venture, Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC, due to higher volumes and margins. Our midstream joint venture, Duke Energy Field Services, LLC, reflecting higher natural gas liquids prices. Our joint venture refinery in Melaka, Malaysia, due to improved refining margins in the Asia Pacific region. Our joint venture delayed coker facilities at the Sweeny, Texas, refinery, Merey Sweeny LLP, due to wider heavy light crude oil differentials. Depreciation, depletion and amortization (DDA) increased 9 percent in 2004, primarily due to new fields onstream for a full year for the first time in 2004, including the Bayu Undan field in the Timor Sea; the Su Tu Den field, offshore Vietnam; and the Grane field in the Norwegian North Sea. In addition, foreign currency rates and the Norway Removal Grant Act increased DDA in 2004. In 2005, we expect DDA to increase by approximately 15 percent over 2004 levels, reflecting new projects in the EP segment, including a full years production from the Magnolia field in the Gulf of Mexico and the Belanak field, offshore Indonesia, as well as new production from the Clair field in the Atlantic Margin and continued ramp up at the Bayu Undan field. 48 Table of Contents Interest and debt expense declined 35 percent in 2004. The decrease primarily was due to lower average debt levels during 2004 and an increased amount of interest being capitalized on major capital projects. Our effective tax rate for 2004 was 44 percent, compared with 45 percent for 2003. The decrease in the effective tax rate in 2004, compared with 2003, mainly was due to the impact of a higher proportion of income in lower tax rate jurisdictions, partially offset by reduced benefits from tax rate reductions. We adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, (SFAS No. 143) effective January 1, 2003. As a result, we recognized a benefit of $145 million for the cumulative effect of this accounting change. Also effective January 1, 2003, we adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 46 (revised December 2003), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, (FIN 46(R)) for variable interest entities involving synthetic leases and certain other financing structures created prior to February 1, 2003. This resulted in a charge of $240 million for the cumulative effect of this accounting change. We recognized a net $95 million charge in 2003 for the cumulative effect of these two accounting changes. 2003 vs. 2002 The merger affects the comparability of the 2003 and 2002 periods. 2003 includes a full year of ConocoPhillips operations, while 2002 includes only four months of combined operations. Prior to August 30, 2002, our results reflect Phillips operations only. Accordingly, when comparing 2003 with 2002, the merger significantly increased: Sales revenues and purchase costs due to higher volumes of products being bought and sold. Equity earnings due to an increased number of equity affiliates. Production and operating expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses due to the increased size and scope of operations following the merger, partially offset by lower merger related costs in 2003. Depreciation, depletion and amortization due to the increased depreciable asset base. Taxes other than income taxes due to higher gasoline sales, production volumes and property and payroll taxes. Interest and debt expense due to higher debt levels following the merger. In addition to the merger impact, sales and other operating revenues and purchase costs increased because of higher prices for key products such as crude oil, natural gas, automotive gasoline and distillates. A higher net gain on asset sales was primarily responsible for the increase in other income in 2003. During 2003, we sold several EP operations that did not fit into our long term growth strategy. In addition, 2003 included gains attributable to insurance demutualization benefits. Selling, general and administrative expenses in 2002 included a $246 million charge for the write off of in process research and development costs acquired in the merger. The absence of such a significant charge in the 2003 period reduced the impact of the merger on this line item. Accretion on discounted liabilities increased $123 million in 2003, reflecting accretion expense on environmental liabilities assumed in the merger and discounted obligations associated with the retirement and removal of long lived assets that became effective January 1, 2003, with the adoption of SFAS No. 143. See Note 2 Changes in Accounting Principles, in the Notes to Financial Statements, for additional information. 49 Table of Contents In addition to the merger impact, interest and debt expense also increased in 2003 because of the adoption of FIN 46(R). The adoption of FIN 46(R) for variable interest entities involving synthetic leases and certain other financing structures, effective January 1, 2003, resulted in increased balance sheet debt, which resulted in higher interest expense in 2003. See Note 2 Changes in Accounting Principles, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. During 2003, we recognized a $28 million gain on subsidiary equity transactions related to our EP Bayu Undan development in the Timor Sea. See Note 6 Subsidiary Equity Transactions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. Our effective tax rate in 2003 was 45 percent, compared with 67 percent in 2002. The lower effective tax rate in 2003 primarily was the result of a higher proportion of income in lower tax rate jurisdictions and the one time impact of tax law changes in certain international jurisdictions. Contributing to the higher effective tax rate in 2002 was a write off of in process research and development costs, as well as the partial impairment of an exploration prospect, both without corresponding tax benefits in 2002. Our discontinued operations had income of $237 million in 2003, compared with a net loss of $993 million in 2002. The net loss in 2002 reflected charges totaling $1,008 million after tax related to the impairment of properties, plants and equipment; goodwill; intangible assets; and provisions for losses associated with various operating lease commitments. For additional information about our discontinued operations, see Note 4 Discontinued Operations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Restructuring Accruals As a result of the merger, we began a restructuring program in September 2002 to capture the benefits of combining Conoco and Phillips by eliminating redundancies, consolidating assets, and sharing common services and functions across regions. The restructuring program was essentially completed during 2004. The information in Note 5 Restructuring, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is incorporated herein by reference. 50 Table of Contents Segment Results EP 2004 2003 2002 Millions of Dollars Net Income Alaska $ 1,832 1,445 870 Lower 48 1,110 929 286 United States 2,942 2,374 1,156 International 2,760 1,928 593 $ 5,702 4,302 1,749 Dollars Per Unit Average Sales Prices Crude oil (per barrel) United States $ 38.25 28.85 23.83 International 37.18 28.27 25.16 Total consolidated 37.65 28.54 24.39 Equity affiliates* 24.18 19.01 18.41 Worldwide EP 36.06 27.52 24.08 Natural gas lease (per thousand cubic feet) United States 5.33 4.67 2.75 International 4.14 3.69 2.79 Total consolidated 4.62 4.08 2.77 Equity affiliates* 2.19 4.44 2.71 Worldwide EP 4.61 4.08 2.77 Average Production Costs Per Barrel of Oil Equivalent United States $ 6.48 5.89 5.66 International 4.31 4.12 3.99 Total consolidated 5.26 4.92 4.94 Equity affiliates* 4.86 4.85 4.38 Worldwide EP 5.23 4.92 4.92 Millions of Dollars Worldwide Exploration Expenses General administrative; geological and geophysical; and lease rentals $ 286 301 285 Leasehold impairment 175 133 146 Dry holes 242 167 161 $ 703 601 592 * Excludes our equity share of LUKOIL reported in the LUKOIL Investment segment. 51 Table of Contents 2004 2003 2002 Thousands of Barrels Daily Operating Statistics Crude oil produced Alaska 298 325 331 Lower 48 51 54 40 United States 349 379 371 European North Sea 271 290 196 Asia Pacific 94 61 24 Canada 25 30 13 Other areas 58 72 43 Total consolidated 797 832 647 Equity affiliates* 108 102 35 905 934 682 Natural gas liquids produced Alaska 23 23 24 Lower 48 26 25 8 United States 49 48 32 European North Sea 14 9 8 Asia Pacific 9 Canada 10 10 4 Other areas 2 2 2 84 69 46 Millions of Cubic Feet Daily Natural gas produced** Alaska 165 184 175 Lower 48 1,223 1,295 928 United States 1,388 1,479 1,103 European North Sea 1,119 1,215 595 Asia Pacific 301 318 137 Canada 433 435 165 Other areas 71 63 43 Total consolidated 3,312 3,510 2,043 Equity affiliates* 5 12 4 3,317 3,522 2,047 * Excludes our equity share of LUKOIL reported in the LUKOIL Investment segment. ** Represents quantities available for sale.

Thousands of Barrels Daily Mining operations Syncrude produced 21 19 8 52 Table of Contents The EP segment explores for, produces and markets crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids on a worldwide basis. It also mines deposits of oil sands in Canada to extract the bitumen and upgrade it into a synthetic crude oil. At December 31, 2004, our EP operations were producing in the United States, Norway, the United Kingdom, Canada, Nigeria, Venezuela, offshore Timor Leste in the Timor Sea, Australia, China, Indonesia, the United Arab Emirates, Vietnam, and Russia. 2004 vs. 2003 Net income from the EP segment increased 33 percent in 2004. The increase primarily was due to higher crude oil prices and, to a lesser extent, higher natural gas and natural gas liquids prices. Increased sales prices were partially offset by lower crude oil and natural gas production, as well as higher exploration expenses and lower net gains on asset dispositions. The 2003 period included a net benefit of $142 million for the cumulative effect of accounting changes (SFAS No. 143 and FIN 46(R)), as well as benefits of $233 million from changes in certain international income tax and site restoration laws and equity realignment of certain Australian operations. Included in 2004 is a $72 million benefit related to the remeasurement of deferred tax liabilities from the 2003 Canadian graduated tax rate reduction and a 2004 Alberta provincial tax rate change. If crude oil and natural gas prices in 2005 do not remain at the historically strong levels experienced in 2004, EPs earnings would be negatively impacted in 2005. See the Business Environment and Executive Overview section for additional discussion of crude oil and natural gas prices, including estimates of our EP segments sensitivities to crude oil and natural gas prices. Proved reserves at year end 2004 were 7.61 billion barrels of oil equivalent (BOE), compared with 7.85 billion BOE at year end 2003. This excludes the estimated 880 million BOE reported in the LUKOIL Investment segment. Our Canadian Syncrude mining operations had an additional 258 million barrels of proved oil sands reserves at the end of 2004, compared with 265 million barrels at year end 2003. 2003 vs. 2002 Net income from the EP segment increased 146 percent in 2003, compared with 2002. The improvement reflects higher production volumes, primarily due to the merger; higher crude oil and natural gas prices; and an increased net gain on asset sales. These items were partially offset by higher production and operating expenses; depreciation, depletion and amortization; and taxes other than income taxes, all the result of the larger size and scope of our operations following the merger. In addition, 2003 included benefits of $233 million in our international EP operations from changes in income tax and site restoration laws, as well as an equity realignment of certain Australian operations. Also, the cumulative effect of the adoption of SFAS No. 143 and the adoption of FIN 46(R) for variable interest entities involving synthetic leases and certain other financing structures increased EPs net income by $142 million in 2003. ConocoPhillips proved reserves at year end 2003 were 7.85 billion barrels of oil equivalent, a slight increase over 7.81 billion barrels at year end 2002. Our Canadian Syncrude mining operations had an additional 265 million barrels of proved oil sands reserves at the end of 2003, compared with 272 million barrels at year end 2002. 53 Table of Contents U.S. EP 2004 vs. 2003 Net income from our U.S. EP operations increased 24 percent in 2004. The increase was mainly the result of higher crude oil prices and, to a lesser extent, higher natural gas and natural gas liquids prices, partially offset by lower crude oil and natural gas production volumes and lower net gains on asset dispositions. In addition, the 2003 period included a net benefit of $142 million for the cumulative effect of accounting changes (SFAS No. 143 and FIN 46(R)). U.S. EP production on a BOE basis averaged 629,000 barrels per day in 2004, down 7 percent from 674,000 BOE per day in 2003. The decreased production primarily was the result of the impact of 2003 asset dispositions, normal field production declines, and planned maintenance activities during 2004. 2003 vs. 2002 Net income from our U.S. EP operations increased 105 percent in 2003, compared with 2002. The improvement reflects higher crude oil and natural gas prices, higher production volumes, and a net $143 million benefit from the cumulative effect of adopting SFAS No. 143 and FIN 46(R). U.S. EP production averaged 674,000 BOE per day in 2003, an increase of 15 percent from 587,000 BOE per day in 2002. The increased production primarily was the result of the merger, as well as increased production from the Borealis satellite field at Kuparuk and from the Alpine field, partially offset by normal field production declines and the impact of asset dispositions. International EP 2004 vs. 2003 Net income from our international EP operations increased 43 percent in 2004. The increase primarily was due to higher crude oil prices and, to a lesser extent, higher natural gas and natural gas liquids prices and higher natural gas liquids volumes. Higher prices were partially offset by increased exploration expenses. International EP production averaged 913,000 BOE per day in 2004, down slightly from 916,000 BOE per day in 2003. This excludes the estimated 38,000 barrels per day reported in the LUKOIL Investment segment. Production was favorably impacted in 2004 by the startup of production from the Su Tu Den field in Vietnam in late 2003, the ramp up of liquids production from the Bayu Undan field in the Timor Sea since startup in February 2004, and the startup of the Hamaca upgrader in Venezuela in the fourth quarter of 2004. These items were more than offset by the impact of asset dispositions, normal field production declines, and planned maintenance. In addition, our Syncrude mining operations produced 21,000 barrels per day in 2004, compared with 19,000 barrels per day in 2003. 54 Table of Contents 2003 vs. 2002 Net income from our international EP operations increased 225 percent in 2003, compared with 2002. Increased production volumes following the merger accounted for the majority of the earnings improvement. Higher crude oil and natural gas prices contributed to the remaining increase. International EPs production averaged 916,000 BOE per day in 2003, compared with 482,000 BOE per day in 2002. In addition, our Syncrude mining operations produced 19,000 barrels per day in 2003, compared with 8,000 barrels per day in 2002. The merger was the primary reason for the production increase. International EPs net income in 2003 also was favorably impacted by the following items: In Norway, the Norway Removal Grant Act (1986) was repealed in the second quarter of 2003. Prior to its repeal, this Act required the Norwegian government to contribute to the cost of removing offshore oil and gas production facilities. Now, the co venturers in the facilities must fund all removal costs, but can deduct the removal costs, as incurred, under the Petroleum Tax Act, at the marginal tax rate in effect at the time of removal. These changes required us: to recognize an additional liability for the governments share, prior to repeal of the Act, of the future removal costs, with a corresponding increase in properties, plants and equipment (PPE); and to establish a net deferred tax asset for the temporary differences between the financial basis and tax basis of all of our Norwegian removal assets and liabilities. Some of the increases in PPE were on shut in fields, which led to immediate impairments of those properties. The overall impact on 2003 results was a net after tax benefit of $87 million. In the Timor Sea region, ConocoPhillips and its co venturers received final approvals from authorities to proceed with the natural gas development phase of the Bayu Undan project in the second quarter of 2003. This approval allowed a broad ownership interest re alignment among the co venturers to proceed, which included our sale of a 10 percent interest in the project and the issuance of equity by previously wholly owned subsidiaries. In addition, the ratification of the Australia/Timor Leste treaty lowered the companys deferred tax liability position. The net result of these events was an after tax benefit of $51 million in 2003. See Note 6 Subsidiary Equity Transactions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. In November 2003, the Canadian Parliament enacted federal tax rate reductions for oil and gas producers. As a result, we recognized a $95 million benefit upon revaluation of our deferred tax liability in the fourth quarter. 55 Table of Contents Midstream 2004 2003 2002 Millions of Dollars Net Income* $ 235 130 55 *Includes DEFS related net income: $ 143 72 23 Dollars Per Barrel Average Sales Prices U.S. natural gas liquids* Consolidated $ 29.38 22.67 19.07 Equity 28.60 22.12 15.92 * Based on index prices from the Mont Belvieu and Conway market hubs that are weighted by natural gas liquids component and location mix.

The Midstream segment purchases raw natural gas from producers and gathers natural gas through an extensive network of pipeline gathering systems. The natural gas is then processed to extract natural gas liquids from the raw gas stream. The remaining residue gas is marketed to electrical utilities, industrial users, and gas marketing companies. Most of the natural gas liquids are fractionated separated into individual components like ethane, butane and propane and marketed as chemical feedstock, fuel, or blendstock. The Midstream segment consists of our 30.3 percent interest in Duke Energy Field Services, LLC (DEFS), as well as our other natural gas gathering and processing operations, and natural gas liquids fractionation and marketing businesses, primarily in the United States, Canada and Trinidad. 2004 vs. 2003 Net income from the Midstream segment increased 81 percent in 2004. The improvement was primarily attributable to improved results from DEFS, which had: Higher gross margins, primarily reflecting higher natural gas liquids prices. A $23 million (gross) charge in 2003 for the cumulative effect of accounting changes, mainly related to the adoption of SFAS No. 143; partially offset by investment impairments and write downs of assets held for sale during 2004. Our Midstream operations outside of DEFS had higher earnings in 2004 as well, reflecting the impact of higher natural gas liquids prices that more than offset the effect of asset dispositions in 2004. Included in the Midstream segments net income was a benefit of $36 million in 2004, the same as 2003, representing the amortization of the excess amount of our 30.3 percent equity interest in the net assets of DEFS over the book value of our investment in DEFS. 56 Table of Contents 2003 vs. 2002 Net income from the Midstream segment increased 136 percent in 2003, compared with 2002. The increase primarily was attributable to improved results from DEFS and the addition of midstream operations following the merger. DEFS results mainly increased because of higher natural gas liquids prices in 2003. In addition, DEFS results in 2002 included higher costs for gas imbalance adjustment accruals. Included in the Midstream segments 2003 net income was a basis difference benefit of $36 million, compared with $35 million in 2002, representing the amortization of the excess amount of our 30.3 percent equity interest in the net assets of DEFS over the book value of our investment in DEFS. 57 Table of Contents RM 2004 2003 2002 Millions of Dollars Net Income United States $ 2,126 990 138 International 617 282 5 $ 2,743 1,272 143 Dollars Per Gallon U.S. Average Sales Prices* Automotive gasoline Wholesale $ 1.33 1.05 .96 Retail 1.52 1.35 1.03 Distillates wholesale 1.24 .92 .77 *Excludes excise taxes.

RM has operations in the United States, Europe and Asia Pacific. 2004 vs. 2003 Net income from the RM segment increased 116 percent in 2004, primarily due to higher refining margins. This was partially offset by lower U.S. marketing margins, and higher maintenance turnaround and utility costs. The 2003 period included a $125 million net charge for the cumulative effect of accounting changes (FIN 46(R)). 2003 vs. 2002 Net income from our RM segment increased substantially in 2003, compared with 2002. The improved results primarily were due to significantly higher U.S. refining margins. The addition of refining and marketing assets in the merger also contributed to the higher 2003 earnings, as did increased wholesale gasoline margins. Partially offsetting the improvements was a net charge of $125 million for the cumulative effect of the adoption of FIN 46(R) for variable interest entities involving synthetic leases and certain other financing structures. U.S. RM 2004 vs. 2003 Net income from our U.S. RM operations increased 115 percent in 2004, primarily due to higher refining margins, partially offset by lower marketing margins, and higher maintenance turnaround and utility costs. The 2003 period included a $125 million net charge for the cumulative effect of accounting change (FIN 46(R)). Our U.S. refining capacity utilization rate was 95 percent in 2004, compared with 96 percent in 2003. The lower capacity utilization was due to increased maintenance downtime. 2003 vs. 2002 Net income from our U.S. RM operations increased significantly in 2003, compared with 2002. The improved results mainly were due to significantly higher refining margins. The addition of refining and marketing assets in the merger also contributed to the higher 2003 earnings, as did increased wholesale gasoline margins. Partially offsetting the margin improvements in 2003 was a net charge of $125 million for the cumulative effect of the adoption of FIN 46(R) for variable interest entities involving synthetic leases and certain other financing structures, along with higher utility costs. Our U.S. refineries ran at a crude oil capacity utilization rate of 96 percent in 2003, compared with 91 percent in 2002. The rate in 2002 was lowered by higher maintenance turnaround activity, the impact of tropical storms on our Gulf Coast refineries, and the loss of Venezuelan crude oil supply in the fourth quarter due to the economic and political instability in that country during the quarter. 59 Table of Contents International RM 2004 vs. 2003 Net income from the international RM operations increased 119 percent in 2004, with the improvement primarily attributable to higher refining margins, partially offset by negative foreign currency impacts on operating costs. Our international crude oil refining capacity utilization rate was 91 percent in 2004, compared with 94 percent in 2003. Beginning in the third quarter of 2004, we changed our crude oil capacity utilization statistic at the Humber refinery to make it consistent with our other refineries. This change has been applied to the operating statistics for 2003 and 2002. 2003 vs. 2002 Net income from our international RM operations increased substantially in 2003, compared with 2002. The improvement was due to the larger size and scope of our international refining and marketing operations following the merger, along with higher international refining margins. Included in international RMs net income in 2003 was a net foreign currency gain of $18 million, compared with a net gain of $9 million in 2002. Our international crude oil capacity utilization rate was 94 percent in 2003, compared with 83 percent in 2002. The lower utilization rate in 2002 primarily was the result of the Humber refinery in the United Kingdom being shut down for an extended period of time in the fourth quarter due to a power outage and subsequent downtime. LUKOIL Investment Millions of Dollars 2004 2003 2002 Net Income $ 74 Operating Statistics* Net crude oil production (thousands of barrels daily) 38 Net natural gas production (millions of cubic feet daily) 13 Net refinery crude processed (thousands of barrels daily) 19 *Represents our net share of our estimate of LUKOILs production and processing. This segment represents our investment in the ordinary shares of LUKOIL, an international, integrated oil and gas company headquartered in Russia, which we account for under the equity method. In October 2004, we closed on a transaction to acquire 7.6 percent of LUKOILs shares held by the Russian government. During the remainder of 2004, we increased our ownership interest to 10 percent. In addition to our estimate of our fourth quarter weighted average 8.6 percent equity share of LUKOILs earnings, this segment also reflects the amortization of the basis difference between our equity interest in the net assets of LUKOIL and the historical cost of our investment in LUKOIL. In addition, this segment will include the costs associated with the employees seconded to LUKOIL. 60 Table of Contents Because LUKOILs accounting cycle close and preparation of U.S. GAAP financial statements occurs subsequent to our accounting cycle close, our equity earnings and statistics for 2004 from our LUKOIL investment are an estimate, based on market indicators, historical production trends of LUKOIL, and other factors. Any difference between the estimate and actual results will be recorded in a subsequent period. This estimate to actual adjustment will then be a recurring component of future period results. Chemicals Millions of Dollars 2004 2003 2002 Net Income (Loss) $ 249 7 (14 ) The Chemicals segment consists of our 50 percent interest in Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC (CPChem), which we account for using the equity method of accounting. CPChem uses natural gas liquids and other feedstocks to produce petrochemicals such as ethylene, propylene, styrene, benzene, and paraxylene. These products are then marketed and sold, or used as feedstocks to produce plastics and commodity chemicals, such as polyethylene, polystyrene and cyclohexane. 2004 vs. 2003 Net income from the Chemicals segment increased $242 million in 2004, compared with 2003. The improvement reflects that CPChem had improved equity earnings from Qatar Chemical Company Ltd. (Q Chem), an olefins and polyolefins complex in Qatar, and Saudi Chevron Phillips Company, an aromatics complex in Saudi Arabia. Results from CPChems consolidated operations also improved from higher ethylene and benzene margins, as well as increased ethylene, polyethylene and normal alpha olefins sales volumes. 2003 vs. 2002 The worldwide chemicals industry experienced an economic downturn beginning in the second half of 2000, and the downturn continued through 2003. The downturn led to excess production capacity in the industry and pressured margins on key products. The chemicals industry has also been impacted by high energy prices, which negatively impacts both utility and feedstock costs. Emerging Businesses Millions of Dollars 2004 2003 2002 Net Loss Technology solutions $ (18 ) (20 ) (16 ) Gas to liquids (33 ) (50 ) (273 ) Power (31 ) (5 ) (3 ) Other (20 ) (24 ) (18 ) $ (102 ) (99 ) (310 ) 61 Table of Contents The Emerging Businesses segment includes the development of new businesses outside our traditional operations. These activities include gas to liquids (GTL) operations, power generation, technology solutions such as sulfur removal technologies, and emerging technologies, such as renewable fuels and emission management technologies. 2004 vs. 2003 Emerging Businesses incurred a net loss of $102 million in 2004, compared with a net loss of $99 million in 2003. Contributing to the higher losses in 2004 were lower domestic power margins and higher maintenance costs, as well as increased costs associated with the Immingham power plant project in the United Kingdom, which entered the initial commissioning phase of the project during 2004. Prior to the initial commissioning phase, most costs associated with this project were capitalized as construction costs. This project completed the initial commissioning phase and began commercial operations in October 2004. Partially offsetting these items were lower research and development costs, compared with 2003, which included the costs of a demonstration GTL plant then under construction. Construction of the GTL plant was substantially completed during the second quarter of 2003. 2003 vs. 2002 Emerging Businesses incurred a net loss of $99 million in 2003, compared with a net loss of $310 million in 2002. The net loss in 2003 was less than that in 2002 as a result of a $246 million write off of purchased in process research and development costs in the third quarter of 2002 related to Conocos GTL and other technologies. In accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 4, Applicability of FASB Statement No. 2 to Business Combinations Accounted for by the Purchase Method, value assigned to research and development activities in the purchase price allocation that have no alternative future use are required to be charged to expense at the date of the consummation of the combination. The $246 million charge was the same on both a before tax and after tax basis, because there was no tax basis in the assigned value prior to its write off. Corporate and Other Millions of Dollars 2004 2003 2002 Net Income (Loss) Net interest $ (514 ) (632 ) (412 ) Corporate general and administrative expenses (212 ) (173 ) (173 ) Discontinued operations 22 237 (993 ) Merger related costs (14 ) (223 ) (307 ) Cumulative effect of accounting changes (112 )* Other (54 ) 26 (33 ) $ (772 ) (877 ) (1,918 ) *Includes a $107 million charge related to discontinued operations. 2004 vs. 2003 After tax net interest consists of interest and debt expense, net of interest income and capitalized interest, as well as premiums incurred on the early retirement of debt and costs associated with the receivables 62 Table of Contents monetization program. Net interest decreased 19 percent in 2004, primarily due to lower average debt levels, an increased amount of interest being capitalized in 2004, lower charges for premiums paid on the early retirement of debt, and lower costs associated with the receivables monetization program. After tax corporate general and administrative expenses increased 23 percent in 2004. The increase reflects higher compensation costs, which includes increased stock based compensation due to an increase in both the number of units issued and higher stock prices in the 2004 period. Discontinued operations net income declined 91 percent in 2004, reflecting asset dispositions completed during 2003 and 2004. Beginning with the second quarter of 2004, we no longer separately identify merger related costs because these activities have been substantially completed. The category Other consists primarily of items not directly associated with the operating segments on a stand alone basis, including certain foreign currency transaction gains and losses, and environmental costs associated with sites no longer in operation. Results from Other were lower in 2004, mainly due to the inclusion in the 2003 period of gains related to insurance demutualization benefits, negative foreign currency transaction impacts, higher environmental costs and increased minority interest expense. 2003 vs. 2002 Net interest increased 53 percent in 2003, compared with 2002. The increase in 2003 mainly was due to our higher debt levels following the merger, the impact of the adoption of FIN 46(R) for variable interest entities involving synthetic leases and certain other financing structures, and increased premiums on the early retirement of debt. The adoption of FIN 46(R) at January 1, 2003, increased debt, which resulted in higher interest expense. Income from discontinued operations was $237 million in 2003, compared with a loss of $993 million in 2002. The net loss in 2002 reflects charges totaling $1,008 million after tax related to the impairment of properties, plants and equipment; goodwill; intangible assets; and provisions for losses associated with various operating lease commitments. For additional information about our discontinued operations, see Note 4 Discontinued Operations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. On an after tax basis, merger related costs were $223 million in 2003, compared with $307 million in 2002. Included in these costs were employee relocation expenses, transition labor costs, and other charges directly associated with the merger. Results from Other were improved in 2003, compared with 2002, because of higher foreign currency transaction gains and an after tax gain of $34 million in the first quarter of 2003, representing beneficial interests we had in certain insurance companies as a result of the conversion of those companies from mutual companies to stock companies, a process known as demutualization. These beneficial interests arose from our prior purchase and ownership of various insurance policies and contracts issued by the mutual companies. Prior to the demutualizations, our mutual ownership interests in these insurance companies were not recognized because the ownership interests in the mutual companies were neither capable of valuation nor marketable. Included in Other in 2003 was a net foreign currency transaction gain of $67 million, after tax, compared with a net gain of $21 million in 2002. 63 Table of Contents CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Financial Indicators Millions of Dollars Except as Indicated 2004 2003 2002 Current ratio 1.0 .8 .9 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 11,959 9,356 4,978 Total debt repayment obligations due within one year $ 632 1,440 849 Total debt* $ 15,002 17,780 19,766 Mandatorily redeemable preferred securities of trust subsidiaries* $ 350 Other minority interests $ 1,105 842 651 Common stockholders equity $ 42,723 34,366 29,517 Percent of total debt to capital** 26 % 34 39 Percent of floating rate debt to total debt 19 % 17 12 * With the adoption of FIN 46(R) effective January 1, 2003, the mandatorily redeemable preferred securities were removed from our balance sheet and effectively replaced with debt. ** Capital includes total debt, mandatorily redeemable preferred securities, other minority interests and common stockholders equity. To meet our short and long term liquidity requirements, we look to a variety of funding sources, primarily cash generated from operating activities. In addition, during 2004 we raised approximately $1.6 billion in funds from the sale of assets. During 2004, available cash was used to support the companys ongoing capital expenditures and investments program, repay debt and pay dividends. In September 2004, our Board of Directors (Board) declared a quarterly dividend of $.50 per share, which represented a 16 percent increase from the previous quarters dividend rate. Total dividends paid on our common stock in 2004 were $1.2 billion. During 2004, cash and cash equivalents increased $897 million to $1,387 million. In early 2005, a portion of this cash was used to repay $544 million of commercial paper that had been outstanding at December 31, 2004. In addition to cash flows from operating activities and proceeds from asset sales, we also rely on our commercial paper and credit facility programs, as well as our $5 billion universal shelf registration statement, to support our short and long term liquidity requirements. We anticipate that these sources of liquidity will be adequate to meet our funding requirements through 2006, including our capital spending program and required debt payments. Our cash flows from operating activities increased in each of the annual periods from 2002 through 2004. In addition to favorable market conditions, major acquisitions and mergers played a significant role in the upward trend of our cash flows from operating activities. The most significant event during this period was the merger of Conoco and Phillips on August 30, 2002. Phillips was designated as the acquirer for accounting purposes, so 2002 operating cash flows included eight months (January through August) of Phillips activity only and four months of ConocoPhillips activity (September through December), while 2003 included the first full year of ConocoPhillips activity. Absent any other significant acquisitions or mergers during 2005, we expect that market conditions will be the most important factor affecting our 2005 cash flows, when compared with 2004. 64 Table of Contents Significant Sources of Capital Operating Activities During 2004 cash of $11,959 million was provided by operating activities, an increase of $2,603 million from 2003. This increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to an increase in income from continuing operations, partially offset by an increase in working capital. The working capital increase primarily was driven by higher accounts receivable and a higher retained interest in receivables sold to a Qualifying Special Purpose Entity (QSPE), partly offset by higher accounts payable. Contributing to the increase in accounts receivable and accounts payable were higher sales and purchase prices, respectively. For additional information on income from continuing operations, see the Results of Operations section. For additional information on receivables sold to a QSPE, see Receivables Monetization in the Off Balance Sheet Arrangements section. Our cash flows from operating activities for both the short and long term are highly dependent upon prices for crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids, as well as refining and marketing margins. During 2003 and particularly in 2004, we benefited from high crude oil and natural gas prices, as well as strong refining margins. The sustainability of these prices and margins are driven by market conditions over which we have no control. In addition, the level of our production volumes of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids also impacts our cash flows. These production levels are impacted by such factors as acquisitions and dispositions of fields, field production decline rates, new technologies, operating efficiency, the addition of proved reserves through exploratory success, and the timely and cost effective development of those proved reserves. We will need to continue to add to our proved reserve base through exploration and development of new fields, or by acquisition, and to apply new technologies and processes to boost recovery from existing fields in order to maintain or increase production and proved reserves. We have been successful in the past in maintaining or adding to our production and proved reserve base and, although it cannot be assured, anticipate being able to do so in the future. Our barrel of oil equivalent (BOE) production, after adjusting our 2003 production for approximately 60,000 BOE per day for assets sold in 2003 and early 2004, has increased in each of the past three years (2002, 2003 and 2004). Excluding the impact of our equity investment in LUKOIL on our production, we expect our 2005 production level to be approximately 4 percent higher than our 2004 level of 1.54 million BOE per day. In 2006, we expect our production level to increase an additional 4 percent over our projected 2005 BOE production level. Beyond 2006, we estimate our BOE production to grow at an average annual rate of approximately 3 percent for the period 2007 through 2010. These projections are tied to projects currently scheduled to begin production or ramp up in those years and exclude our Canadian Syncrude mining operations. Excluding the impact of our equity investment in LUKOIL on our proved oil and gas reserves, our reserve replacement over the three year period ending December 31, 2004, exceeded 200 percent. Contributing to our success during this three year period were proved reserves added by the merger of Conoco and Phillips, volumes added through extensions and discoveries, and improved recovery. Although it cannot be assured, going forward, we expect to more than replace our production over the next three years. This expectation is based on our current slate of exploratory and improved recovery projects. As discussed in Critical Accounting Policies, engineering estimates of proved reserves are imprecise and therefore each year reserves may be revised upward or downward due to the impact of changes in oil and gas prices or as more technical data becomes available on the reservoirs. In 2004 and 2002, revisions decreased our reserves, while in 2003, revisions increased reserves. It is not possible to reliably predict how revisions will impact reserve quantities in the future. The net addition of proved undeveloped reserves accounted for 64 percent, 76 percent and 34 percent of our total net additions in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. 65 Table of Contents During these years, we converted, on average, approximately 13 percent per year of our proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves. Of the proved undeveloped reserves we had at December 31, 2004, we estimate that the average annual conversion rate for these reserves for the following three years will be in the 25 percent range. For additional information related to the development of proved undeveloped reserves, see the discussion under the EP section of Capital Spending. The projections and actual results noted above exclude the impact of our equity investment in LUKOIL, and the anticipated production and reserve replacement results are subject to risks, including reservoir performance; operational downtime; finding and development execution; obtaining management, Board and third party approval of development projects in a timely manner; regulatory changes; geographical location; market prices; and environmental issues; and therefore, cannot be assured. Asset Sales Following the merger, we initiated an asset disposition program. Our ultimate target was to raise approximately $4.5 billion by the end of 2004. During 2004, proceeds from asset sales were $1.6 billion, bringing total proceeds to approximately $5.0 billion since the program began. While we will continue to have modest asset disposition activity, this asset disposition program was essentially completed at the end of the second quarter of 2004. Proceeds from these asset sales were used primarily to pay off debt. Commercial Paper and Credit Facilities While the stability of our cash flows from operating activities benefits from geographic diversity and the effects of upstream and downstream integration, our operating cash flows remain exposed to the volatility of commodity crude oil and natural gas prices and refining and marketing margins, as well as periodic cash needs to finance tax payments and crude oil, natural gas and petroleum product purchases. Our primary funding source for short term working capital needs is a $5 billion commercial paper program, a portion of which may be denominated in other currencies (limited to euro 3 billion equivalent). Commercial paper maturities are generally limited to 90 days. At December 31, 2004, we had $544 million of commercial paper outstanding, compared with $709 million of commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2003. Effective October 12, 2004, we entered into two new revolving credit facilities totaling $5 billion to replace our previously existing $1.5 billion 364 day facility that was set to expire on October 13, 2004; two revolving credit facilities totaling $2 billion expiring in October 2006; and a $500 million facility expiring in October 2008. The two new facilities include a $2.5 billion four year facility expiring in October 2008 and a $2.5 billion five year facility expiring in October 2009. Both facilities are available for use as direct bank borrowings or as support for our $5 billion commercial paper program. In addition, the five year facility may be used to support issuances of letters of credit totaling up to $750 million. The facilities are broadly syndicated among financial institutions and do not contain any material adverse change provisions or any covenants requiring maintenance of specified financial ratios or ratings. The credit agreements do contain a cross default provision relating to our, or any of our consolidated subsidiaries, failure to pay principal or interest on other debt obligations of $200 million or more. There were no outstanding borrowings under these facilities at December 31, 2004. One of our Norwegian subsidiaries had two $300 million revolving credit facilities that expired in June 2004, which were not renewed. 66 Table of Contents Moodys Investor Service has maintained a rating of A3 on our senior long term debt; and Standard and Poors Rating Service and Fitch have maintained ratings of A . We do not have any ratings triggers on any of our corporate debt that would cause an automatic event of default in the event of a downgrade of our credit rating and thereby impact our access to liquidity. In the event that our credit rating deteriorated to a level that would prohibit us from accessing the commercial paper market, we would still be able to access funds under our $5 billion revolving credit facilities. Based on our commercial paper balance of $544 million and having issued $173 million of letters of credit at year end, we had access to $4.3 billion in borrowing capacity as of December 31, 2004, which provides liquidity to cover daily operations. In addition, at year end 2004 our $1.4 billion cash balance and $720 million of remaining capacity related to our receivables monetization program also supported our liquidity position. Shelf Registration In late 2002, we filed a universal shelf registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for various types of debt and equity securities. As a result, we have available to issue and sell a total of $5 billion of various types of securities under the universal shelf registration statement. Minority Interests At December 31, 2004, we had outstanding $1,105 million of equity held by minority interest owners, including a minority interest of $504 million in Ashford Energy Capital S.A. The remaining minority interest amounts related to controlled operating joint ventures with minority interest owners. The largest of these, $542 million, was related to the Bayu Undan liquefied natural gas project in the Timor Sea. During the third quarter of 2004, a $141 million net minority interest in Conoco Corporate Holdings L.P. was retired. In December 2001, in order to raise funds for general corporate purposes, Conoco and Cold Spring Finance S.a.r.l. formed Ashford Energy Capital S.A. through the contribution of a $1 billion Conoco subsidiary promissory note and $500 million cash by Cold Spring. Through its initial $500 million investment, Cold Spring is entitled to a cumulative annual preferred return based on three month LIBOR rates, plus 1.32 percent. The preferred return at December 31, 2004, was 3.34 percent. In 2008, and at each 10 year anniversary thereafter, Cold Spring may elect to remarket their investment in Ashford, and if unsuccessful, could require ConocoPhillips to provide a letter of credit in support of Cold Springs investment, or in the event that such letter of credit is not provided, then cause the redemption of their investment in Ashford. Should ConocoPhillips credit rating fall below investment grade, Ashford would require a letter of credit to support $475 million of the term loans, as of December 31, 2004, made by Ashford to other ConocoPhillips subsidiaries. If the letter of credit is not obtained within 60 days, Cold Spring could cause Ashford to sell the ConocoPhillips subsidiary notes. At December 31, 2004, Ashford held $1.7 billion of ConocoPhillips subsidiary notes and $25 million in investments unrelated to ConocoPhillips. We report Cold Springs investment as a minority interest because it is not mandatorily redeemable and the entity does not have a specified liquidation date. Other than the obligation to make payment on the subsidiary notes described above, Cold Spring does not have recourse to our general credit. Receivables Factoring At December 31, 2003, we had sold $226 million of receivables under factoring arrangements. We retained servicing responsibility for these sold receivables, which gives us certain benefits, the fair value of which approximates the fair value of the liability incurred for continuing to service the receivables. At December 31, 2004, we had no receivables outstanding under similar arrangements. See Note 14 Sales of Receivables, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. 67 Table of Contents Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Receivables Monetization At December 31, 2004 and 2003, certain credit card and trade receivables had been sold to a QSPE in a revolving period securitization arrangement. This arrangement provides for us to sell, and the QSPE to purchase, certain receivables, and for the QSPE to then issue beneficial interests of up to $1.2 billion to five bank sponsored entities. All five bank sponsored entities are multi seller conduits with access to the commercial paper market and purchase interests in similar receivables from numerous other companies unrelated to us. We have no ownership interests, nor any variable interests, in any of the bank sponsored entities. As a result, we do not consolidate any of these entities. Furthermore, we do not consolidate the QSPE because it meets the requirements of SFAS No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities, to be excluded from the consolidated financial statements of ConocoPhillips. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the QSPE had issued beneficial interests to the bank sponsored entities of $480 million and $1.2 billion, respectively. The receivables transferred to the QSPE met the isolation and other requirements of SFAS No. 140 to be accounted for as sales and were accounted for accordingly. We retain beneficial interests in this QSPE that are subordinate to the beneficial interests issued to the bank sponsored entities. These retained interests, which are reported on the balance sheet in accounts and notes receivable related parties, were $3.2 billion at December 31, 2004, and $1.3 billion at December 31, 2003. We also retain servicing responsibility related to the sold receivables, which gives us certain rights and abilities, the fair value of which approximates the fair value of the liability incurred for continuing to service the receivables. The carrying value of the subordinated beneficial interests in the QSPE approximates fair market value due to the very short term of the underlying assets. See Note 14 Sales of Receivables, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. Preferred Securities In 1997, we formed a statutory business trust, Phillips 66 Capital II (Trust II), with ConocoPhillips owning all of the common securities of the trust. The sole purpose of the trust was to issue preferred securities to outside investors, investing the proceeds thereof in an equivalent amount of subordinated debt securities of ConocoPhillips. The trust was established to raise funds for general corporate purposes. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, Trust II had $350 million of mandatorily redeemable preferred securities outstanding, whose sole asset was $361 million of ConocoPhillips subordinated debt securities, which bear interest at 8 percent. Distributions on the trust preferred securities are paid by the trust with funds from interest payments made by ConocoPhillips on the subordinated debt securities. We made interest payments of $29 million in both 2004 and 2003. In addition, we guaranteed the payment obligations of the trust on the trust preferred securities to the extent we made interest payments on the subordinated debt securities. When we redeem the subordinated debt securities, Trust II is required to apply all the redemption proceeds to the immediate redemption of the preferred securities. See Note 2 Changes in Accounting Principles and Note 18 Preferred Stock and Other Minority Interests, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. Affiliated Companies As part of our normal ongoing business operations and consistent with normal industry practice, we invest in, and enter into, numerous agreements with other parties to pursue business opportunities, which share costs and apportion risks among the parties as governed by the agreements. At December 31, 2004, we were liable for certain contingent obligations under various contractual arrangements as described below. 68 Table of Contents Hamaca: The Hamaca project involves the development of heavy oil reserves from the Orinoco Oil Belt. We own a 40 percent interest in the Hamaca project, which is operated by Petrolera Ameriven on behalf of the owners. The other participants in Hamaca are Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA) and ChevronTexaco Corporation. Our interest is held through a jointly owned limited liability company, Hamaca Holding LLC, for which we use the equity method of accounting. Hamaca Holding LLC revenues for 2004 were approximately $625 million, expenses were approximately $413 million and cash provided by operating activities was approximately $324 million. We have a 57.1 percent non controlling ownership interest in Hamaca Holding LLC. In the second quarter of 2001, we, along with our co venturers in the Hamaca project, secured approximately $1.1 billion in a joint debt financing. The Export Import Bank of the United States provided a guarantee supporting a 17 year term $628 million bank facility. The joint venture also arranged a $470 million 14 year term commercial bank facility for the project. Total debt of $957 million was outstanding under these credit facilities at December 31, 2004. Of this amount, $383 million is recourse to ConocoPhillips. The proceeds of these joint financings were used to primarily fund a heavy oil upgrader. The remaining necessary funding was provided by capital contributions from the co venturers on a pro rata basis to the extent necessary to successfully complete construction. Once completion certification is achieved (required by October 1, 2005), the joint project financings will become non recourse with respect to the co venturers and the lenders under those facilities can then look only to the Hamaca projects cash flows for payment. Merey Sweeny L.P. (MSLP): MSLP is a limited partnership in which we and PDVSA each own an indirect 50 percent interest. During 1999, MSLP issued $350 million of 8.85 percent bonds due 2019 that we, along with PDVSA, were jointly and severally liable for under a construction completion guarantee. In May 2004, MSLP achieved completion certification. As a result, the construction completion guarantee related to the debt and bond financing arrangements secured by MSLP expired and the debt became non recourse to ConocoPhillips and the bondholders can look only to MSLP cash flows for payment. Other: At December 31, 2004, we had guarantees of approximately $250 million outstanding for our portion of other joint venture debt obligations, which have terms of up to 20 years. Payment would be required if a joint venture defaults on its debt obligations. Included in these outstanding guarantees was $95 million associated with the Polar Lights Company joint venture in Russia. For additional information about guarantees see Note 15 Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Capital Requirements For information about our capital expenditures and investments, see the Capital Spending section. Our balance sheet debt at December 31, 2004, was $15.0 billion. This reflects debt reductions of approximately $2.8 billion during 2004. The debt reduction primarily resulted from repayment in April of the $1,350 million aggregate principal amount of our 5.90% Notes due 2004 at maturity, the redemption in August 2004 of the $1,150 million aggregate principal amount of our 8.5% Notes due 2005, and a reduction of $165 million in our outstanding commercial paper balance to $544 million at December 31, 2004. The 8.5% Notes were redeemed at a premium of $58 million plus accrued interest. In addition, we have given notice to redeem in March 2005 our $400 milion 3.625% Notes due 2007. Going forward, we have no significant mandatory debt retirements until payment of the $1,250 million aggregate principal amount of our 5.45% Notes due in 2006, at maturity. 69 Table of Contents On February 4, 2005, we announced a stock repurchase program that provides for the repurchase of up to $1 billion of the companys common stock over a period of up to two years. The program will serve as a means of offsetting dilution to shareholders from the companys stock based compensation programs. Acquisitions for the share repurchase program will be made at managements discretion at prevailing prices, subject to market conditions and other factors. Purchases may be increased, decreased or discontinued at any time without prior notice. Shares of stock repurchased under the plan will be held as treasury shares.

The majority of the purchase obligations are market based contracts. Includes: (1) our commercial activities of $34,880 million, of which $16,243 million are primarily related to the supply of crude oil to our refineries and the optimization of the supply chain, $7,176 million primarily related to the supply of unfractionated NGLs to fractionators, optimization of NGL assets, and for resale to customers, $4,919 million primarily related to natural gas for resale to customers, $3,378 million related to transportation, $1,351 million of futures, $1,284 million related to product purchases and $529 million related to the purchase side of exchange agreements; (2) $27,615 million of purchase commitments for products, mostly natural gas and natural gas liquids, from CPChem over the remaining term of 96 years; and (3) purchase commitments for jointly owned fields and facilities where we are the operator, of which some of the obligations will be reimbursed by our co owners in these properties. Does not include: (1) purchase commitments for jointly owned fields and facilities where we are not the operator; (2) our agreement to purchase up to 104,000 barrels per day of Petrozuata crude oil for a market based formula price over the term of the Petrozuata joint venture (about 35 years) in the event that Petrozuata is unable to sell the production for higher prices; and (3) an agreement to purchase up to 165,000 barrels per day of Venezuelan Merey, or equivalent, crude oil for a market price over a remaining 15 year term if a variety of conditions are met. *** Does not include: (1) Taxes the companys consolidated balance sheet reflects liabilities related to income, excise, property, production, payroll and environmental taxes. We anticipate the current liability of $3,154 million for accrued income and other taxes will be paid in the next year. We have other accrued tax liabilities whose resolution may not occur for several years, so it is not possible to determine the exact timing or amount of future payments. Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for tax purposes; (2) Pensions for the 2005 through 2009 time period, we expect to contribute an average of $415 million per year to our qualified and non qualified pension and postretirement medical plans in the United States and an average of $135 million per year to our non U.S. plans, which are expected to be in excess of required minimums in many cases. Our required minimum funding in 2005 is expected to be $60 million in the United States and $90 million outside the United States; and (3) Interest we anticipate payments of $894 million in 2005, $1,672 million for the period 2006 through 2007, $1,496 million for the period 2008 through 2009, and $8,259 million for the remaining years to total $12,321 million. 70 Table of Contents Capital Spending Capital Expenditures and Investments Millions of Dollars 2005 Budget 2004 2003 2002 EP United States Alaska $ 751 645 570 706 United States Lower 48 720 669 848 499 International 4,558 3,935 3,090 2,071 6,029 5,249 4,508 3,276 Midstream 11 7 10 5 RM United States 1,420 1,026 860 676 International 212 318 319 164 1,632 1,344 1,179 840 LUKOIL Investment* 2,649 Chemicals 60 Emerging Businesses 5 75 284 122 Corporate and Other** 225 172 188 85 $ 7,902 9,496 6,169 4,388 United States $ 3,123 2,520 2,493 2,043 International 4,779 6,976 3,676 2,345 $ 7,902 9,496 6,169 4,388 Discontinued operations $ 1 224 97 * Discretionary expenditures in 2005 for potential additional equity investment in LUKOIL to increase our ownership percentage up to 20 percent, from 10 percent at December 31, 2004, are not included in our 2005 budget amounts. ** Excludes discontinued operations. Our capital spending for continuing operations for the three year period ending December 31, 2004, totaled $20.1 billion, including $2.6 billion in 2004 relating to our purchase of a 10 percent interest in LUKOIL, an international integrated oil and gas company headquartered in Russia. Spending was primarily focused on the growth of our EP segment, with 65 percent of total spending for continuing operations in this segment. Excluding discretionary expenditures for potential additional investment in LUKOIL, our capital budget for 2005 is $7.9 billion. Included in this amount is approximately $500 million to acquire an interest in a joint venture with LUKOIL to develop oil and gas resources in Russias Timan Pechora province. Also included are approximately $345 million in capitalized interest and approximately $145 million that will be funded by minority interests in the Bayu Undan gas export project. We plan to direct approximately 76 percent of our 2005 capital budget to EP and 21 percent to RM. EP Capital spending for continuing operations for EP during the three year period ending December 31, 2004, totaled $13 billion. The expenditures over the three year period supported several key exploration and development projects including: The West Sak and Alpine projects and drilling of National Petroleum Reserve Alaska (NPR A) and satellite field prospects on Alaskas North Slope. 71 Table of Contents Magnolia development in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Expansion of the Syncrude oil sands project and development of the Surmont heavy oil project in Canada. The Hamaca heavy oil project in Venezuelas Orinoco Oil Belt. The Grane field and Ekofisk Area growth project in the Norwegian North Sea. The Clair, CMS3 and Britannia satellite developments in the United Kingdom. The Kashagan field and satellite prospects in the north Caspian Sea, offshore Kazakhstan. The Bayu Undan gas recycle and gas development projects in the Timor Sea. The Belanak, Suban and South Jambi projects in Indonesia. The Peng Lai 19 3 development in Chinas Bohai Bay and additional Bohai Bay appraisal and satellite field prospects. The Su Tu Den project in Block 15 1 in Vietnam. Capital expenditures for construction of our Endeavour Class tankers and an additional interest in the Trans Alaska Pipeline System were also included in the EP segment. UNITED STATES Alaska During the three year period ending December 31, 2004, we made capital expenditures for the construction of double hulled Endeavour Class tankers for use in transporting Alaskan crude oil to the U.S. West Coast and Hawaii. We expect the fifth and final Endeavour Class tanker will be in Alaska North Slope service in 2006. We continued development drilling in the Greater Kuparuk Area, the Greater Prudhoe Area, the Alpine field and the development of West Saks heavy oil accumulations. In addition, we increased oil production capacity at the Alpine field with the completion of Alpine Capacity Expansion Phase I and a significant portion of Phase II in the third quarter of 2004. We expect to complete the final component of Phase II in 2005. We also participated in exploratory drilling on the North Slope and we were the successful bidder on 71 tracts covering approximately 484 thousand net acres, at the June 2004 Bureau of Land Management oil and gas lease sale for the Northwest Planning Area of the NPR A. During 2004, we and our co venturers in the Trans Alaska Pipeline System began a project to upgrade the pipelines pump stations that is expected to be substantially complete by the end of 2005 and anticipated to be fully complete by the third quarter of 2006. Lower 48 States In the Lower 48, we continued to explore or develop our acreage positions in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, South Texas, the San Juan Basin, the Permian Basin, and the Texas Panhandle. In the Gulf of Mexico, we began production in late 2004 from the Magnolia field, and we sanctioned and began development of the K2 discovery in Green Canyon Block 562 in 2004. Onshore capital was focused on natural gas developments in the San Juan Basin of New Mexico and the Lobo Trend of South Texas. In addition, Lower 48 is pursuing select opportunities in its other producing basins. 72 Table of Contents CANADA In Canada, capital spending in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin continued to focus on development and exploration in the eastern foothills of the Rocky Mountains and the western edge of our core areas in Alberta, Northeast British Columbia and Southwest Saskatchewan. We continued with development of the Stage III expansion mining project in the Canadian province of Alberta, which is expected to increase our Canadian Syncrude production. The Aurora Train 2 project (the new mine) started up in late October 2003. The upgrader expansion project is expected to be fully operational by mid 2006. In 2004, we continued with development of the Surmont heavy oil project. Over the life of this 30 year project, we anticipate that approximately 500 production and steam injection well pairs will be drilled, with our share of the project costs estimated at $1 billion. During 2004, our capital expenditures associated with development of the Surmont project were approximately $33 million. SOUTH AMERICA At our Hamaca project in Venezuela, construction of an upgrader to convert heavy crude oil into a medium grade crude oil became fully operational in the fourth quarter of 2004. NORTHWEST EUROPE In the U.K. and Norwegian sectors of the North Sea, funds were invested during the three year period ending December 31, 2004, for development of the Ekofisk Area growth project, expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2005; the Grane field in the Norwegian North Sea, where production began late in the third quarter of 2003; the U.K. Clair field, where production is expected to begin in early 2005, the CMS3 area, comprising five natural gas fields in the southern sector of the U.K. North Sea, where the final field began production in 2004; and the Britannia satellite fields, Callanish and Brodgar, where production is expected in 2007. AFRICA In Nigeria, we made capital expenditures for the ongoing development of onshore oil and natural gas fields, and for ongoing exploration activities both onshore and on deepwater leases. CASPIAN SEA In 2002, following a discovery well drilled in 2000, we and our co venturers, and the government of the Republic of Kazakhstan, declared the Kashagan field on the Kazakhstan shelf in the North Caspian Sea to be commercial. In February 2004, the Republic of Kazakhstan approved a development plan for the field and construction activities began. Additional exploratory drilling through 2004 has resulted in the discovery of a total of five fields in the area. In May 2002, we along with the other remaining co venturers, completed the acquisition of proportionate interests of two co venturers rights, which increased our ownership interest from 7.14 percent to 8.33 percent. During 2003, we exercised our pre emptive rights to acquire a proportionate share of B.G. Internationals interest in the North Caspian Sea license that includes the Kashagan field. Discussions continue with the Republic of Kazakhstan government to conclude the sale. 73 Table of Contents In the South Caspian, drilling was completed in 2004 on the Zafar Mashal #1 exploration well in Azerbaijan waters. The well was declared non commercial and was written off to dry hole expense. ASIA PACIFIC Timor Sea In the Timor Sea, we continued with development activities associated with Phase I of the Bayu Undan gas recycle project, where condensate and natural gas liquids are separated and removed and the dry gas re injected into the reservoir. Production of liquids began from Phase I in February of 2004. All Phase I development drilling is expected to be complete by April 2005. In June of 2003, we received approval from the Timor Sea Designated Authority for Phase II, the development of a liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant near Darwin, Australia, as well as a gas pipeline from Bayu Undan to the LNG facility. Construction activities continued through 2004, and the first LNG cargo from the 3.52 million ton per year facility is scheduled for delivery in early 2006. Indonesia In Indonesia, funds were used to construct the Belanak floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO) facility and develop the Belanak field in the South Natuna Sea Block B, where commercial oil production began in late 2004. Also, in Block B we began development of the Kerisi and Hiu fields, and we began the preliminary engineering phase of the North Belut field development. In South Sumatra, following the execution of the West Java gas sales agreement in August, we began the development of the Suban Phase II project, which is an expansion of the existing Suban gas plant. Also in South Sumatra, we completed the construction of the South Jambi shallow gas project in the South Jambi B Block, where first production began in June 2004. China In late December 2002, we began production from Phase I of our Peng Lai 19 3 development located on Block 11/05 in Chinas Bohai Bay. In late 2004, we approved development plans for the second phase of the Peng Lai 19 3 oil field, as well as concurrent development of the nearby 25 6 field. In early 2005, the Chinese government also approved the development. The development of Peng Lai 19 3 and Peng Lai 25 6 will include multiple wellhead platforms and a larger FPSO facility. Vietnam In Vietnams Block 15 1, the Su Tu Den Phase I southwest area development project was approved in December 2001, and production from this area began in the fourth quarter of 2003. Water injection facilities were put into service in 2004, and preliminary engineering for the nearby Su Tu Vang development began in early 2005. In 2004, we continued the development of the Rang Dong field on Block 15 2, including the development of the central part of the field, where two additional platforms and additional production and injection wells are expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2005. 2005 Capital Budget EPs 2005 capital budget is $6.0 billion, 15 percent higher than actual expenditures in 2004. Twenty four percent of EPs 2005 capital budget is planned for the United States, with 51 percent of that slated for Alaska. 74 Table of Contents We plan to spend $751 million in 2005 for our Alaskan operations. A majority of the capital spending will fund Prudhoe Bay, Greater Kuparuk and Western North Slope operations including additional work on the Alpine capacity expansion projects, two Alpine satellite and West Sak field developments, construction to complete our fifth and final Endeavour Class tanker, and exploration activities. In the Lower 48, offshore capital expenditures will be focused on continued development of the K2 and Ursa fields and the completion of Magnolia wells in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Onshore capital will focus primarily on developing natural gas reserves within core areas, including the San Juan Basin of New Mexico and the Lobo Trend of South Texas. EP is directing $4.6 billion of its 2005 capital budget to international projects. Included in this amount is approximately $500 million for a 30 percent economic interest in a joint venture with LUKOIL to develop oil and gas resources in the northern part of Russias Timan Pechora province. Closing on the joint venture arrangement is expected in the first half of 2005. The majority of the remaining funds will be directed to developing other major long term projects, including the Bayu Undan gas development project in the Timor Sea; the Kashagan project in the Caspian Sea; the Britannia satellites, Ekofisk Area growth, Alvheim and Saturn projects in the North Sea; the Bohai Bay project in China; the Syncrude expansion, Surmont heavy oil and the Mackenzie Delta gas projects in Canada; the Belanak, Kerisi Hiu and Suban Phase II projects in Indonesia; the Corocoro project in Venezuela; and the Qatargas 3 LNG project in Qatar. PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES Excluding the impact of our equity investment in LUKOIL, costs incurred for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002, relating to the development of proved undeveloped oil and gas reserves were $2,351 million, $2,002 million, and $1,631 million, respectively. During these years, we converted, on average, approximately 13 percent per year of our proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves. Although it cannot be assured, estimated future development costs relating to the development of proved undeveloped reserves for the years 2005 through 2007 are projected to be $2,223 million, $1,668 million, and $851 million, respectively, excluding the impact of our equity investment in LUKOIL. Of our 2,232 million BOE proved undeveloped reserves at year end 2004, approximately 82 percent were associated with 12 major developments. Of these 12, three are expected to have an aggregate of approximately 300 million BOE convert from proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves during 2005, 2006 and 2007 (with expected year of conversion noted parenthetically) as follows: Nigeria natural gas reserves (2005). Bayu Undan field in the Timor Sea (natural gas for 2006). Brodgar field in the United Kingdom (2007). The remaining nine developments are currently producing and are expected to have additional proved reserves convert from undeveloped to developed over time as development activities continue and or production facilities are expanded or upgraded: The Hamaca and Petrozuata heavy oil projects in Venezuela. The Ekofisk, Eldfisk, Heidrun and Visund fields in the North Sea and Norwegian Sea. Indonesia natural gas reserves. 75 Table of Contents The Prudhoe Bay field on Alaskas North Slope. The Magnolia field in the Gulf of Mexico. In addition, proved undeveloped reserves added in 2004 for the Kashagan field in Kazakhstan are expected to be converted to proved developed in 2008 with completion of the first phase of the project. RM Capital spending for continuing operations for RM during the three year period ending December 31, 2004, was primarily for clean fuels projects to meet new environmental standards, refinery upgrade projects to improve product yields, and the operating integrity of key processing units, as well as for safety projects. During this three year period, RM capital spending for continuing operations was $3.4 billion, representing 17 percent of our total capital spending for continuing operations. Key projects during the three year period included: Construction of a polypropylene plant at the Bayway refinery in New Jersey. Construction of a fluid catalytic cracking unit and a S Zorb Sulfur Removal Technology unit at the Ferndale, Washington, refinery. Expansion of the alkylation unit at the Los Angeles refinery. Capacity expansion and debottlenecking projects at the Borger, Texas, refinery. An expansion of capacity in the Seaway crude oil pipeline. Integration of certain refinery assets purchased adjacent to our Wood River refinery in Illinois. In 2004, we continued to expend funds related to clean fuels, safety and environmental projects in the United States, including investing in a new diesel hydrotreater at the Rodeo facility of our San Francisco refinery. The new diesel hydrotreater is expected to produce reformulated California highway diesel an estimated one year ahead of the June 2006 deadline. The integration of certain refining assets purchased adjacent to our Wood River refinery in Illinois was completed in the second quarter of 2004. Integration of the assets enables the refinery to process heavier, lower cost crude oil. Internationally, we continued to invest in our ongoing refining and marketing operations, including a replacement reformer at our Humber refinery in the United Kingdom and marketing growth in select countries in Europe and Asia. 2005 Capital Budget RMs 2005 capital budget for continuing operations is $1.6 billion, a 21 percent increase over actual spending in 2004. Domestic spending is expected to consume 87 percent of the RM budget. 76 Table of Contents We plan to direct about $1.3 billion of the RM capital budget to domestic refining, of which approximately 65 percent will go toward domestic clean fuels projects in order to comply with new U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) standards for refined products. Worldwide, clean fuels spending for our RM refining business is expected to be $814 million, or approximately 60 percent of the total refining budget. Our U.S. marketing and transportation businesses are expected to spend about $143 million, while the remaining budget will fund projects in our international refining and marketing businesses in Europe and the Asia Pacific region. Emerging Businesses Capital spending for Emerging Businesses during the three year period ending December 31, 2004, was primarily for construction of the Immingham combined heat and power cogeneration plant near the companys Humber refinery in the United Kingdom. The plant began commercial operations in October 2004. Contingencies Legal and Tax Matters We accrue for contingencies when a loss is probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated. Based on currently available information, we believe that it is remote that future costs related to known contingent liability exposures will exceed current accruals by an amount that would have a material adverse impact on the companys financial statements. Environmental We are subject to the same numerous international, federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations, as are other companies in the petroleum exploration and production industry; and refining, marketing and transportation of crude oil and refined products businesses. The most significant of these environmental laws and regulations include, among others, the: Federal Clean Air Act, which governs air emissions. Federal Clean Water Act, which governs discharges to water bodies. Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), which imposes liability on generators, transporters, and arrangers of hazardous substances at sites where hazardous substance releases have occurred or are threatened to occur. Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), which governs the treatment, storage, and disposal of solid waste. Federal Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA90), under which owners and operators of onshore facilities and pipelines, lessees or permittees of an area in which an offshore facility is located, and owners and operators of vessels are liable for removal costs and damages that result from a discharge of oil into navigable waters of the United States. Federal Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act (EPCRA), which requires facilities to report toxic chemical inventories with local emergency planning committees and responses departments. 77 Table of Contents Federal Safe Drinking Water Act, which governs the disposal of wastewater in underground injection wells. U.S. Department of the Interior regulations, which relate to offshore oil and gas operations in U.S. waters and impose liability for the cost of pollution cleanup resulting from operations, as well as potential liability for pollution damages. These laws and their implementing regulations set limits on emissions and, in the case of discharges to water, establish water quality limits. They also, in most cases, require permits in association with new or modified operations. These permits can require an applicant to collect substantial information in connection with the application process, which can be expensive and time consuming. In addition, there can be delays associated with notice and comment periods and the agencys processing of the application. Many of the delays associated with the permitting process are beyond the control of the applicant. Many states and foreign countries where we operate also have, or are developing, similar environmental laws and regulations governing these same types of activities. While similar, in some cases these regulations may impose additional, or more stringent, requirements that can add to the cost and difficulty of marketing or transporting products across state and international borders. The ultimate financial impact arising from environmental laws and regulations is neither clearly known nor easily determinable as new standards, such as air emission standards, water quality standards and stricter fuel regulations, continue to evolve. However, environmental laws and regulations, including those that may arise to address concerns about global climate change, are expected to continue to have an increasing impact on our operations in the United States and in other countries in which we operate. Notable areas of potential impacts include air emission compliance and remediation obligations in the United States. For example, the EPA has promulgated rules regarding the sulfur content in highway diesel fuel, which become applicable in June 2006. In April 2003, the EPA proposed a rule regarding emissions from non road diesel engines and limiting non road diesel fuel sulfur content. The non road rule, as promulgated in June 2004, significantly reduces non road diesel fuel sulfur content limits as early as 2007. We are evaluating and developing capital strategies for future integrated compliance of our diesel fuel for the highway and non road markets. Additional areas of potential air related impact are the proposed revisions to the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) and the Kyoto Protocol. In July 1997, the EPA promulgated more stringent revisions to the NAAQS for ozone and particulate matter. Since that time, final adoption of these revisions has been the subject of litigation (American Trucking Association, Inc. et al. v. United States Environmental Protection Agency) that eventually reached the U.S. Supreme Court during the fall of 2000. In February 2001, the U.S. Supreme Court remanded this matter, in part, to the EPA to address the implementation provisions relating to the revised ozone NAAQS. The EPA responded by promulgating a revised implementation rule for its new 8 hour NAAQS on April 30, 2004. Several environmental groups have since filed challenges to this new rule. Depending upon the outcomes of the various challenges, area designations, and the resulting State Implementation Plans, the revised NAAQS could result in substantial future environmental expenditures for us. In 1997, an international conference on global warming concluded an agreement, known as the Kyoto Protocol, which called for reductions of certain emissions that contribute to increases in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. The United States has not ratified the treaty codifying the Kyoto Protocol but may in the future ratify, support or sponsor either it or other climate change related emissions reduction programs. Other countries where we have interests, or may have interests in the future, have made commitments to the Kyoto Protocol and are in various stages of formulating applicable regulations. 78 Table of Contents Because considerable uncertainty exists with respect to the regulations that would ultimately govern implementation of the Kyoto Protocol, it currently is not possible to accurately estimate our future compliance costs under the Kyoto Protocol, but they could be substantial. The Kyoto Protocol became effective as to its ratifying countries in February 2005. We also are subject to certain laws and regulations relating to environmental remediation obligations associated with current and past operations. Such laws and regulations include CERCLA and RCRA and their state equivalents. Remediation obligations include cleanup responsibility arising from petroleum releases from underground storage tanks located at numerous past and present ConocoPhillips owned and or operated petroleum marketing outlets throughout the United States. Federal and state laws require that contamination caused by such underground storage tank releases be assessed and remediated to meet applicable standards. In addition to other cleanup standards, many states adopted cleanup criteria for methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) for both soil and groundwater. MTBE standards continue to evolve, and future environmental expenditures associated with the remediation of MTBE contaminated underground storage tank sites could be substantial. At RCRA permitted facilities, we are required to assess environmental conditions. If conditions warrant, we may be required to remediate contamination caused by prior operations. In contrast to CERCLA, which is often referred to as Superfund, the cost of corrective action activities under RCRA corrective action programs typically is borne solely by us. Over the next decade, we anticipate that significant ongoing expenditures for RCRA remediation activities may be required, but such annual expenditures for the near term are not expected to vary significantly from the range of such expenditures we have experienced over the past few years. Longer term, expenditures are subject to considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly. We, from time to time, receive requests for information or notices of potential liability from the EPA and state environmental agencies alleging that we are a potentially responsible party under CERCLA or an equivalent state statute. On occasion, we also have been made a party to cost recovery litigation by those agencies or by private parties. These requests, notices and lawsuits assert potential liability for remediation costs at various sites that typically are not owned by us, but allegedly contain wastes attributable to our past operations. As of December 31, 2003, we reported we had been notified of potential liability under CERCLA and comparable state laws at 61 sites around the United States. At December 31, 2004, we had resolved 9 of these sites and had received 12 new notices of potential liability, leaving 64 unresolved sites where we have been notified of potential liability. For most Superfund sites, our potential liability will be significantly less than the total site remediation costs because the percentage of waste attributable to us, versus that attributable to all other potentially responsible parties, is relatively low. Although liability of those potentially responsible is generally joint and several for federal sites and frequently so for state sites, other potentially responsible parties at sites where we are a party typically have had the financial strength to meet their obligations, and where they have not, or where potentially responsible parties could not be located, our share of liability has not increased materially. Many of the sites at which we are potentially responsible are still under investigation by the EPA or the state agencies concerned. Prior to actual cleanup, those potentially responsible normally assess site conditions, apportion responsibility and determine the appropriate remediation. In some instances, we may have no liability or attain a settlement of liability. Actual cleanup costs generally occur after the parties obtain EPA or equivalent state agency approval. There are relatively few sites where we are a major participant, and given the timing and amounts of anticipated expenditures, neither the cost of remediation at those sites nor such costs at all CERCLA sites, in the aggregate, is expected to have a material adverse effect on our competitive or financial condition. 79 Table of Contents Expensed environmental costs were $623 million in 2004 and are expected to be about $610 million in 2005 and $620 million in 2006. Capitalized environmental costs were $652 million in 2004 and are expected to be about $1,096 million and $769 million in 2005 and 2006, respectively. Remediation Accruals We accrue for remediation activities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and reasonable estimates of the liability can be made. These accrued liabilities are not reduced for potential recoveries from insurers or other third parties and are not discounted (except those assumed in a purchase business combination, which we do record on a discounted basis). Many of these liabilities result from CERCLA, RCRA and similar state laws that require us to undertake certain investigative and remedial activities at sites where we conduct, or once conducted, operations or at sites where ConocoPhillips generated waste was disposed. The accrual also includes a number of sites we identified that may require environmental remediation, but which are not currently the subject of CERCLA, RCRA or state enforcement activities. If applicable, we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third party recoveries. In the future, we may incur significant costs under both CERCLA and RCRA. Considerable uncertainty exists with respect to these costs, and under adverse changes in circumstances, potential liability may exceed amounts accrued as of December 31, 2004. Remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site, depending on the mix of unique site characteristics, evolving remediation technologies, diverse regulatory agencies and enforcement policies, and the presence or absence of potentially liable third parties. Therefore, it is difficult to develop reasonable estimates of future site remediation costs. At December 31, 2004, our balance sheet included a total environmental accrual related to continuing operations of $1,061 million, compared with $1,119 million at December 31, 2003. We expect to incur a substantial majority of these expenditures within the next 30 years. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, and as with other companies engaged in similar businesses, environmental costs and liabilities are inherent in our operations and products, and there can be no assurance that material costs and liabilities will not be incurred. However, we currently do not expect any material adverse affect upon our results of operations or financial position as a result of compliance with environmental laws and regulations. Other We have deferred tax assets related to certain accrued liabilities, loss carryforwards, and credit carryforwards. Valuation allowances have been established for certain foreign operating and domestic capital loss carryforwards that reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that will, more likely than not, be realized. Uncertainties that may affect the realization of these assets include tax law changes and the future level of product prices and costs. Based on our historical taxable income, our expectations for the future, and available tax planning strategies, management expects that the net deferred tax assets will be realized as offsets to reversing deferred tax liabilities and as reductions in future taxable income. 80 Table of Contents NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS AND EMERGING ISSUES New Accounting Standards In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153, Exchange of Nonmonetary Assets an amendment of APB Opinion No. 29. This amendment eliminates the Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 29 exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with an exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance. This Statement is effective on a prospective basis beginning July 1, 2005. We continue to evaluate this standard. Also in December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment, (SFAS No. 123(R), which supercedes APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and replaces SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, that we adopted at the beginning of 2003. SFAS No. 123(R) prescribes the accounting for a wide range of share based compensation arrangements, including share options, restricted share plans, performance based awards, share appreciation rights, and employee share purchase plans, and generally requires the fair value of share based awards to be expensed in the income statement. We are studying the provisions of this new pronouncement to determine the impact, if any, on our financial statements. For more information on our adoption of SFAS No. 123 and its effect on net income, see Note 1 Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, Inventory Costs an amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4. This Statement requires that items, such as idle facility expense, excessive spoilage, double freight, and re handling costs, be recognized as current period charges. We are required to implement this Statement in the first quarter of 2006. We are analyzing the provisions of this standard to determine the effects, if any, on our financial statements. In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Liabilities and Equity, to address the balance sheet classification of certain financial instruments that have characteristics of both liabilities and equity. The Statement, already effective for contracts created or modified after May 31, 2003, was originally intended to become effective July 1, 2003, for all contracts existing at May 31, 2003. However, on November 7, 2003, the FASB issued an indefinite deferral of certain provisions of SFAS No. 150. We continue to monitor and assess the FASBs modifications of SFAS No. 150, but do not anticipate any material impact to our financial statements. Emerging Issues At a November 2004 meeting, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) discussed Issue No. 04 13, Accounting for Purchases and Sales of Inventory with the Same Counterparty, which addresses accounting issues that arise when one company both sells inventory to and buys inventory from another company in the same line of business. This draft encompasses our buy/sell transactions described in the Revenue Recognition section of Note 1 Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Depending on the EITFs conclusions on this issue, it is possible that we could have to decrease sales and other operating revenues for 2004, 2003 and 2002 by $15,492 million, $11,673 million and $4,371 million, respectively, with a corresponding decrease in purchased crude oil, natural gas and products on our consolidated income statement. We believe any impact to our income from continuing operations and net income would result from LIFO inventory and would not be material to our financial statements. Additionally, these transactions have no impact on reported volumes for the production of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids or refinery throughput and are not a significant component of reported volumes for sales of petroleum products. The FASB is currently reviewing the accounting guidance provided in SFAS No. 19, Financial Accounting and Reporting by Oil and Gas Producing Companies, relating to exploratory costs that have 81 Table of Contents been capitalized, or suspended, on the balance sheet, pending a determination of whether potential economic oil and gas reserves have been discovered. For additional information, see Note 9 Properties, Plants and Equipment, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In June 2004, the FASB published the Exposure Draft, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143. This interpretation clarifies that an entity is required to recognize a liability for a legal obligation to perform asset retirement activities when the retirement is conditional on a future event if the liabilitys fair value can be reasonably estimated. If the liabilitys fair value cannot be reasonably estimated, then the entity must disclose (a) a description of the obligation, (b) the fact that a liability has not been recognized because the fair value cannot be reasonably estimated, and (c) the reasons why the fair value cannot be reasonably estimated. Depending on the FASBs conclusions on this issue, it is possible that we would need to reconsider our asset retirement obligations and related disclosures for certain of our downstream assets (primarily refineries). CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to select appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. See Note 1 Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for descriptions of our major accounting policies. Certain of these accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is a reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts would have been reported under different conditions, or if different assumptions had been used. These critical accounting policies are discussed with the Audit and Finance Committee at least annually. We believe the following discussions of critical accounting policies, along with the discussions of contingencies and of deferred tax asset valuation allowances in this report, address all important accounting areas where the nature of accounting estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change. Oil and Gas Accounting Accounting for oil and gas exploratory activity is subject to special accounting rules that are unique to the oil and gas industry. The acquisition of geological and geophysical seismic information, prior to the discovery of proved reserves, is expensed as incurred, similar to accounting for research and development costs. However, leasehold acquisition costs and exploratory well costs are capitalized on the balance sheet, pending determination of whether proved oil and gas reserves have been discovered on the prospect. Property Acquisition Costs For individually significant leaseholds, management periodically assesses for impairment based on exploration and drilling efforts to date. For leasehold acquisition costs that individually are relatively small, management exercises judgment and determines a percentage probability that the prospect ultimately will fail to find proved oil and gas reserves and pools that leasehold information with others in the geographic area. For prospects in areas that have had limited, or no, previous exploratory drilling, the percentage probability of ultimate failure is normally judged to be quite high. This judgmental percentage is multiplied by the leasehold acquisition cost, and that product is divided by the contractual period of the leasehold to determine a periodic leasehold impairment charge that is reported in exploration expense. This judgmental probability percentage is reassessed and adjusted throughout the contractual period of the leasehold based on favorable or unfavorable exploratory activity on the leasehold or on adjacent leaseholds, and leasehold impairment amortization expense is adjusted prospectively. By the end of the contractual period of the leasehold, the impairment probability percentage will have been adjusted to 82 Table of Contents 100 percent if the leasehold is expected to be abandoned, or will have been adjusted to zero percent if there is an oil or gas discovery that is under development. See the supplemental Oil and Gas Operations disclosures about Costs Incurred and Capitalized Costs for more information about the amounts and geographic locations of costs incurred in acquisition activity, and the amounts on the balance sheet related to unproved properties. At year end 2004, the book value of the pools of property acquisition costs, that individually are relatively small and thus subject to the above described periodic leasehold impairment calculation, was approximately $604 million and the accumulated impairment reserve was approximately $116 million. The weighted average judgmental percentage probability of ultimate failure was approximately 69 percent and the weighted average amortization period was approximately 2.7 years. If that judgmental percentage were to be raised by 5 percent across all calculations, the pretax leasehold impairment expense in 2005, would increase by $11 million. The remaining $2,617 million of capitalized unproved property costs at year end 2004 consisted of individually significant leaseholds, mineral rights held into perpetuity by title ownership, exploratory wells currently drilling, and suspended exploratory wells, which management periodically assesses for impairment based on exploration and drilling efforts to date on the individual prospects. Of this amount, approximately $1.7 billion is concentrated in nine major projects, of which management expects approximately $500 million to move to proved properties in 2005. See the following discussion of Exploratory Costs for more information on suspended exploratory wells. Exploratory Costs For exploratory wells, drilling costs are temporarily capitalized, or suspended, on the balance sheet, pending a determination of whether a sufficient quantity of potentially economic oil and gas reserves have been discovered by the drilling effort to justify completion of the find as a producing well. Accounting rules require this judgment to be made within one year of well completion in areas not requiring major infrastructure capital expenditures. If a judgment is made that the well did not encounter potentially economic oil and gas quantities, the well costs are expensed as a dry hole and reported in exploration expense. If exploratory wells encounter potentially economic quantities of oil and gas in areas where major infrastructure capital expenditures (e.g., a pipeline or offshore platform) are required before production can begin, and the economic viability of those capital expenditures depends upon the successful completion of further exploratory drilling work in the area, the well costs remain capitalized on the balance sheet as long as additional exploratory drilling work is under way or firmly planned. In these situations, recoverable reserves are considered economic if the quantity found justifies completion of the find as a producing well, without considering the major infrastructure capital expenditures that will need to be made. Once all additional exploratory drilling and testing work has been completed, the economic viability of the overall project, including any major infrastructure capital expenditures that will need to be made, is evaluated within one year of the last exploratory well completion. If economically viable, internal company approvals are obtained to move the project into the development phase. Often, the ability to move the project into the development phase and record proved reserves is dependent on obtaining permits and government or co venturer approvals, the timing of which is ultimately beyond our control. Exploratory well costs remain suspended as long as the company is actively pursuing such approvals and permits and believes they will be obtained. Once all required approvals and permits have been obtained, the projects are moved into the development phase and the oil and gas reserves are designated as proved reserves. For complex exploratory discoveries, it is not unusual to have exploratory wells remain suspended on the balance sheet for several years while we perform additional drilling work on the potential oil and gas field, or we seek government or co venturer approval of development plans or seek environmental permitting. Unlike leasehold acquisition costs, there is no periodic impairment assessment of suspended exploratory well costs. Management continuously monitors the results of the additional appraisal drilling and seismic work and expenses the suspended well costs as dry holes when it judges that the potential field does not warrant further investment in the near term. 83 Table of Contents Included in total suspended well costs at year end 2004 was $70 million related to eight exploratory wells in areas where major capital expenditures will be required and no further exploratory drilling is planned, but for which we are actively pursuing those activities necessary to classify the reserves as proved. These costs were suspended between 1999 and 2003. At year end 2004, we were awaiting government approval of the development plan for the Bohai Bay Phase II project in China. Suspended well costs associated with this project represented $42 million of the $70 million total. This project was approved by the government in early 2005, which will allow us to book proved reserves in 2005, at which time the suspended well costs will be reclassified as part of the capitalized costs of the project. In addition, suspended amounts at year end 2004 also included $28 million related to projects where infrastructure decisions are dependent on environmental permitting and production capacity, or where we are continuing to assess reserves and their potential development. During 2004 and 2003, additions to suspended wells in areas where major capital expenditures will be required and no further exploratory drilling is planned were $7 million and $22 million, respectively. Had these amounts been expensed, they would not have had a material impact on our trend of exploration expenses or our financial statements. At year end 2004 and 2003, we did not have any amounts suspended that were associated with areas not requiring major capital expenditures before production could begin, where more than one year had elapsed since the completion of drilling. For additional information on suspended wells, see Note 9 Properties, Plants and Equipment, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Proved Oil and Gas Reserves and Canadian Syncrude Reserves Engineering estimates of the quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves in oil and gas fields and in place crude bitumen volumes in oil sand mining operations are inherently imprecise and represent only approximate amounts because of the subjective judgments involved in developing such information. Reserve estimates are based on subjective judgments involving geological and engineering assessments of in place hydrocarbon volumes, the production or mining plan, historical extraction recovery and processing yield factors, installed plant operating capacity and operating approval limits. The reliability of these estimates at any point in time depends on both the quality and quantity of the technical and economic data and the efficiency of extracting and processing the hydrocarbons. Despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates, accounting rules require disclosure of proved reserve estimates due to the importance of these estimates to better understand the perceived value and future cash flows of a companys exploration and production (EP) operations. There are several authoritative guidelines regarding the engineering criteria that must be met before estimated reserves can be designated as proved. Our reservoir engineering department has policies and procedures in place that are consistent with these authoritative guidelines. We have qualified and experienced internal engineering personnel who make these estimates for our EP segment. Proved reserve estimates are updated annually and take into account recent production and seismic information about each field or oil sand mining operation. Also, as required by authoritative guidelines, the estimated future date when a field or oil sand mining operation will be permanently shutdown for economic reasons is based on an extrapolation of sales prices and operating costs prevalent at the balance sheet date. This estimated date when production will end affects the amount of estimated recoverable reserves. Therefore, as prices and cost levels change from year to year, the estimate of proved reserves also changes. Year end 2004 estimated reserves related to our LUKOIL Investment segment were based on LUKOILs year end 2003 oil and gas reserves. Because LUKOILs accounting cycle close and preparation of U.S. GAAP financial statements occurs subsequent to our accounting cycle close, our 10 percent equity share of LUKOILs oil and gas proved reserves at year end 2004 have been estimated based on the prior year report without any provision for potential 2004 reserve additions and include adjustments to conform to our reserve policy and provide for estimated 2004 production. Any differences between the estimate and actual reserve computations will be recorded in a subsequent period. This estimate to actual adjustment will then be a recurring component of future period reserves. 84 Table of Contents The judgmental estimation of proved reserves also is important to the income statement because the proved oil and gas reserve estimate for a field or the estimated in place crude bitumen volume for an oil sand mining operation serves as the denominator in the unit of production calculation of depreciation, depletion and amortization of the capitalized costs for that asset. At year end 2004, the net book value of productive EP properties, plants and equipment subject to a unit of production calculation, including our Canadian Syncrude bitumen oil sand assets, was approximately $29.5 billion and the depreciation, depletion and amortization recorded on these assets in 2004 was approximately $2.6 billion. The estimated proved developed oil and gas reserves on these fields were 4.7 billion BOE at the beginning of 2004 and were 4.8 billion BOE at the end of 2004. The estimated proved reserves on the Canadian Syncrude assets were 265 million barrels at the beginning of 2004 and were 258 million barrels at the end of 2004. If the judgmental estimates of proved reserves used in the unit of production calculations had been lower by 5 percent across all calculations, pretax depreciation, depletion and amortization in 2004 would have been increased by an estimated $174 million. Impairments of producing oil and gas properties in 2004, 2003 and 2002 totaled $67 million, $225 million and $49 million, respectively. Of these writedowns, only $52 million in 2004, $19 million in 2003 and $23 million in 2002 were due to downward revisions of proved reserves. The remainder of the impairments resulted either from properties being designated as held for sale or from the repeal of the Norway Removal Grant Act (1986) that increased asset removal obligations. Impairment of Assets Long lived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in the future cash flows expected to be generated by an asset group. If, upon review, the sum of the undiscounted pretax cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset group, the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value. Individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes based on a judgmental assessment of the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets generally on a field by field basis for exploration and production assets, at an entire complex level for downstream assets, or at a site level for retail stores. Because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for long lived assets, the fair value usually is based on the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates commensurate with the risks involved in the asset group. The expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are based on judgmental assessments of future production volumes, prices and costs, considering all available information at the date of review. See Note 11 Property Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. Asset Retirement Obligations and Environmental Costs Under various contracts, permits and regulations, we have material legal obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore the land or seabed at the end of operations at production sites. Our largest asset removal obligations involve removal and disposal of offshore oil and gas platforms around the world, and oil and gas production facilities and pipelines in Alaska. The estimated discounted costs of dismantling and removing these facilities are accrued at the installation of the asset. Estimating the future asset removal costs necessary for this accounting calculation is difficult. Most of these removal obligations are many years, or decades, in the future and the contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what removal practices and criteria must be met when the removal event actually occurs. Asset removal technologies and costs are changing constantly, as well as political, environmental, safety and public relations considerations. See Note 1 Accounting Policies, Note 12 Asset Retirement Obligations and Accrued Environmental Costs, and Note 28 New Accounting Standards and Emerging Issues, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. 85 Table of Contents Business Acquisitions Purchase Price Allocation Accounting for the acquisition of a business requires the allocation of the purchase price to the various assets and liabilities of the acquired business. For most assets and liabilities, purchase price allocation is accomplished by recording the asset or liability at its estimated fair value. The most difficult estimations of individual fair values are those involving properties, plants and equipment and identifiable intangible assets. We use all available information to make these fair value determinations and, for major business acquisitions, typically engage an outside appraisal firm to assist in the fair value determination of the acquired long lived assets. We have, if necessary, up to one year after the acquisition closing date to finish these fair value determinations and finalize the purchase price allocation. Intangible Assets and Goodwill In connection with the acquisition of Tosco Corporation on September 14, 2001, and the merger of Conoco and Phillips on August 30, 2002, we recorded material intangible assets for trademarks and tradenames, air emission permit credits, and permits to operate refineries. These intangible assets were determined to have indefinite useful lives and so are not amortized. This judgmental assessment of an indefinite useful life has to be continuously evaluated in the future. If, due to changes in facts and circumstances, management determines that these intangible assets then have definite useful lives, amortization will have to commence at that time on a prospective basis. As long as these intangible assets are judged to have indefinite lives, they will be subject to periodic lower of cost or market tests, which requires managements judgment of the estimated fair value of these intangible assets. See Note 3 Merger of Conoco and Phillips, and Note 11 Property Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. Also in connection with the acquisition of Tosco and the merger of Conoco and Phillips, we recorded a material amount of goodwill. Under the accounting rules for goodwill, this intangible asset is not amortized. Instead, goodwill is subject to annual reviews for impairment based on a two step accounting test. The first step is to compare the estimated fair value of any reporting units within the company that have recorded goodwill with the recorded net book value (including the goodwill) of the reporting unit. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is higher than the recorded net book value, no impairment is deemed to exist and no further testing is required that year. If, however, the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is below the recorded net book value, then a second step must be performed to determine the amount of the goodwill impairment to record, if any. In this second step, the estimated fair value from the first step is used as the purchase price in a hypothetical new acquisition of the reporting unit. The various purchase business combination rules are followed to determine a hypothetical purchase price allocation for the reporting units assets and liabilities. The residual amount of goodwill that results from this hypothetical purchase price allocation is compared with the recorded amount of goodwill for the reporting unit, and the recorded amount is written down to the hypothetical amount if lower. The reporting unit or units used to evaluate and measure goodwill for impairment are determined primarily from the manner in which the business is managed. A reporting unit is an operating segment or a component that is one level below an operating segment. A component is a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component. However, two or more components of an operating segment shall be aggregated and deemed a single reporting unit if the components have similar economic characteristics. Within our Exploration and Production segment and our Refining and Marketing segment, we determined that we have one and two reporting units, respectively, for purposes of assigning goodwill and testing for impairment. These are Worldwide Exploration and Production, Worldwide Refining and Worldwide Marketing. Our Midstream, Chemicals and Emerging Businesses operating segments were not assigned any goodwill from the merger because the two predecessor companies operations did not overlap in these 86 Table of Contents operating segments so we were unable to capture significant synergies and strategic advantages from the merger in these areas. In our Exploration and Production operating segment, management reporting is primarily organized based on geographic areas. All of these geographic areas have similar business processes, distribution networks and customers, and are supported by a worldwide exploration team and shared services organizations. Therefore, all components have been aggregated into one reporting unit, Worldwide Exploration and Production, which is the same as the operating segment. In contrast, in our Refining and Marketing operating segment, management reporting is primarily organized based on functional areas. Because the two broad functional areas of Refining and Marketing have dissimilar business processes and customers, we concluded that it would not be appropriate to aggregate these components into only one reporting unit at the Refining and Marketing operating segment level. Instead, we identified two reporting units within the operating segment: Worldwide Refining and Worldwide Marketing. Components in those two reporting units have similar business processes, distribution networks and customers. If we later reorganize our businesses or management structure so that the components within these three reporting units are no longer economically similar, the reporting units would be revised and goodwill would be re assigned using a relative fair value approach in accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Goodwill impairment testing at a lower reporting unit level could result in the recognition of impairment that would not otherwise be recognized at the current higher level of aggregation. In addition, the sale or disposition of a portion of these three reporting units will be allocated a portion of the reporting units goodwill, based on relative fair values, which will adjust the amount of gain or loss on the sale or disposition. Because quoted market prices for our reporting units are not available, management must apply judgment in determining the estimated fair value of these reporting units for purposes of performing the first step of the periodic goodwill impairment test. Management uses all available information to make these fair value determinations, including the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates commensurate with the risks involved in the assets and observed market multiples of operating cash flows and net income, and may engage an outside appraisal firm for assistance. In addition, if the first test step is not met, further judgment must be applied in determining the fair values of individual assets and liabilities for purposes of the hypothetical purchase price allocation. Again, management must use all available information to make these fair value determinations and may engage an outside appraisal firm for assistance. At year end 2004, the estimated fair values of our Worldwide Exploration and Production, Worldwide Refining, and Worldwide Marketing reporting units ranged from between 18 percent to 59 percent higher than recorded net book values (including goodwill) of the reporting units. However, a lower fair value estimate in the future for any of these reporting units could result in impairment of the $15.0 billion of goodwill. Use of Equity Method Accounting for Investment in LUKOIL In October 2004, we purchased 7.6 percent of the outstanding ordinary shares of LUKOIL from the Russian government. During the remainder of 2004, we purchased additional shares of LUKOIL on the open market and reached an ownership level of 10 percent in LUKOIL by the end of 2004. On January 24, 2005, LUKOIL held an extraordinary general meeting of stockholders at which our nominee to the LUKOIL Board of Directors was elected under the cumulative voting rules in Russia, and certain amendments to LUKOILs charter were approved which provide protections to preserve the significant influence of major stockholders in LUKOIL, such as ConocoPhillips. In addition, during the first quarter of 2005, the two companies began the secondment of managerial personnel between the two companies. Significant progress is also being made on advancing the major oil and gas joint venture between the two companies in the Timan Pechora region of northern Russia, over which we expect to have joint control with LUKOIL. 87 Table of Contents Based on the overall facts and circumstances surrounding our investment in LUKOIL, we concluded that we have significant influence over the operating and financial policies of LUKOIL and thus applied the equity method of accounting in the fourth quarter of 2004. Determination of whether one company has significant influence over another, the criterion required by APB Opinion No. 18, The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock, in order to use equity method accounting, is a judgmental accounting decision based on the overall facts and circumstances of each situation. Under the equity method of accounting, we estimate and record our weighted average ownership share of LUKOILs net income (determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP)) each period as equity earnings on our income statement, with a corresponding increase in our recorded investment in LUKOIL. Cash dividends received from LUKOIL each period reduce our recorded investment in LUKOIL. The use of equity method accounting also requires us to supplementally report our ownership share of LUKOILs oil and gas disclosures in our report. If future facts and circumstances were to change to where we no longer believe we have significant influence over LUKOILs operating and financial policies, we would have to change our accounting classification for the investment to an available for sale equity security under SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. If that unlikely event were to occur, our investment in LUKOIL would be marked to market each period, based on LUKOILs publicly traded share price, with the offset recorded as a component of other comprehensive income. Additionally, we would no longer record our ownership share of LUKOILs net income each period and any cash dividends received would be reported as dividend income when declared by LUKOIL. We also would no longer be able to supplementally report our ownership share of LUKOILs oil and gas disclosures. During the fourth quarter of 2004, we recorded $74 million of equity method earnings from our 8.6 percent weighted average ownership level in LUKOIL during the quarter and as of December 31, 2004, supplementally reported an estimated 770 million barrels of crude oil and 661 billion cubic feet of natural gas proved reserves from our ownership level of 10 percent at year end 2004. Because LUKOILs accounting cycle close and preparation of U.S. GAAP financial statements occurs subsequent to our accounting cycle close, we have used all available information to estimate LUKOILs U.S. GAAP net income for the fourth quarter of 2004 for purposes of our equity method accounting. Any differences between our estimate and the actual LUKOIL U.S. GAAP net income will be recorded in 2005 equity earnings. In addition, we used all available information to estimate our share of LUKOILs oil and gas disclosures. If, instead of equity method accounting, we had been required to follow the requirements of SFAS No. 115 for our investment in LUKOIL, the mark to market adjustment to reflect LUKOILs publicly traded share price at year end 2004 would have been a pretax charge against other comprehensive income of approximately $17 million. Also, $19 million of acquisition related costs would have been expensed and $74 million of equity earnings would not have been recorded. At the end of 2004, our cost of investment in LUKOIL shares exceeds our 10 percent share of LUKOILs historical U.S. GAAP balance sheet equity by an estimated $659 million. Under the accounting guidelines of APB Opinion No. 18, the basis difference between the cost of our investment and the amount of underlying equity in the historical net assets of LUKOIL is accounted for as if LUKOIL were a consolidated subsidiary. In other words, a hypothetical purchase price allocation is performed to determine how LUKOIL assets and liabilities would have been adjusted in a hypothetical push down accounting exercise to reflect the actual cost of our investment in LUKOILs shares. Once these hypothetical push down adjustments have been identified, the nature of the hypothetically adjusted assets or liabilities determines the future amortization pattern for the basis difference. We have up to one year after a stock purchase to finalize this hypothetical purchase price allocation, but have preliminarily decided to associate the basis difference primarily with LUKOILs developed property, plant and equipment base. The earnings we recorded for our LUKOIL investment in the fourth quarter of 2004 thus included a reduction 88 Table of Contents for the amortization of this basis difference. When finalizing this preliminary purchase price allocation in 2005, we will use all available information to make this estimate. Inventory Valuation Our LIFO cost inventories are sensitive to lower of cost or market impairment write downs, whenever price levels fall. While crude oil is not the only product in the companys LIFO pools, its market value is a major factor in lower of cost or market calculations. We estimate that impairments could occur if a 70 percent/30 percent blended average of West Texas Intermediate/Brent crude oil prices falls below $20.80 per barrel at a reporting date. The determination of replacement cost values for the lower of cost or market test uses objective evidence, but does involve judgment in determining the most appropriate objective evidence to use in the calculations. Projected Benefit Obligations Determination of the projected benefit obligations for our defined benefit pension and postretirement plans are important to the recorded amounts for such obligations on the balance sheet and to the amount of benefit expense in the income statement. This also impacts the required company contributions into the plans. The actuarial determination of projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements involves judgment about uncertain future events, including estimated retirement dates, salary levels at retirement, mortality rates, lump sum election rates, rates of return on plan assets, future health care cost trend rates, and rates of utilization of health care services by retirees. Due to the specialized nature of these calculations, we engage outside actuarial firms to assist in the determination of these projected benefit obligations. For Employee Retirement Income Security Act qualified pension plans, the actuary exercises fiduciary care on behalf of plan participants in the determination of the judgmental assumptions used in determining required company contributions into plan assets. Due to differing objectives and requirements between financial accounting rules and the pension plan funding regulations promulgated by governmental agencies, the actuarial methods and assumptions for the two purposes differ in certain important respects. Ultimately, we will be required to fund all promised benefits under pension and postretirement benefit plans not funded by plan assets or investment returns, but the judgmental assumptions used in the actuarial calculations significantly affect periodic financial statements and funding patterns over time. Benefit expense is particularly sensitive to the discount rate and return on plan assets assumptions. A 1 percent decrease in the discount rate would increase annual benefit expense by $105 million, while a 1 percent decrease in the return on plan assets assumption would increase annual benefit expense by $35 million. OUTLOOK EPs production for 2005 is expected to be approximately 4 percent higher than the level achieved in 2004. This projection excludes the impact of our equity investment in LUKOIL. For 2005, production increases in Asia Pacific, South America and the United States are expected to offset net declines in the North Sea. In RM, the optimization of spending related to clean fuels project initiatives will be an important focus area during 2005. We expect our average refinery crude oil utilization rate for 2005 to average in the upper nineties. This projection excludes the impact of our equity investment in LUKOIL. In January 2005, the Governor of Alaska announced that effective February 1, 2005, most satellite fields surrounding the Prudhoe Bay field would no longer qualify for a state production tax incentive that was intended to encourage development of marginal deposits. Beginning in February, these satellite fields bear the same production tax rate as Prudhoe Bay. This administrative change is anticipated to increase our production tax obligations by approximately $40 million in 2005. 89 Table of Contents In the first quarter of 2004, in regards to our Magnolia project in the Gulf of Mexico and on behalf of the Garden Banks 783/784 unit, we filed an application for royalty relief with the Minerals Management Service (MMS). Royalty relief may be granted if the value of the project using the MMS economic model and criteria is insufficient to recover the project investment without the relief. There is no assurance that such relief will be granted. In February 2003, the Venezuelan government implemented a currency exchange control regime. The government has published legal instruments supporting the controls, one of which establishes official exchange rates for the U.S. dollar. The devaluation of the Venezuelan currency by approximately 17 percent in February 2004 did not have a significant impact on our Venezuelan operations; however, future changes in the exchange rate could have a significant impact on our Venezuelan operations. In Libya, we are participating in discussions with our co venturers and Libyan authorities regarding terms in connection with our anticipated re entry into that country. In the second quarter of 2004, Norwegian authorities ordered us to modify our facilities at two Ekofisk Area installations Ekofisk and Eldfisk and had initially given us until October 1, 2004, to submit a binding plan for implementing measures to ensure workers are not disturbed by noise from other sleeping workers while they are resting. The Norwegian Petroleum Safety Authority contended we were not in compliance with regulatory requirements for rest and restitution on the installations where there are shared sleeping quarters. We appealed this order and the response deadline was deferred by the Norwegian authorities to December 31, 2004. Concurrently, the Petroleum Safety Authority put the appeal on hold pending further meetings and a letter describing plans that will ensure necessary restitution and rest. On February 3, 2005, we received an official note from the Petroleum Safety Authority stating that our letter of December 28, 2004, presented plans that will meet the intention of their order. Consequently, our appeal will not need to be processed further, and the case is closed. The Mackenzie gas project involves natural gas production facilities for three anchor fields, including the Parsons Lake field operated by us; compression and gathering pipelines in the Mackenzie Delta area; and a pipeline system in the Mackenzie River Valley. In September 2004, the National Energy Board in Canada confirmed the Commercial Discovery Declaration (CDD) for the Parsons Lake field. The CDD meets our development planning expectations, which is an important milestone in the regulatory approval process toward obtaining a production license. The main regulatory applications were filed in October 2004, triggering the start of the formal environmental and regulatory review process. This filing sets the stage for regulatory hearings in 2005, leading toward a regulatory decision in 2006. First gas production is currently targeted to commence in the 2009 timeframe. In early July 2004, we announced the finalization of our transaction with Freeport LNG Development, L.P. (Freeport LNG) to participate in a proposed LNG receiving terminal in Quintana, Texas. Freeport LNG received conditional approval in June 2004 from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to construct and operate the facility and received final approval from the FERC in January 2005. Construction began in early 2005, and commercial startup is expected in 2008. We do not have any limited partner ownership interest in the facility, but we do have a 50 percent interest in the general partnership managing the venture. In addition, we have contractual rights to two thirds of the LNG regasification capacity in the facility, or 1 billion cubic feet per day. We entered into a credit agreement with Freeport LNG, whereby we will provide loan financing of approximately $600 million for the construction of the facility. 90 Table of Contents We are pursuing three other proposed LNG regasification terminals. The Beacon Port Terminal would be located in federal waters in the Gulf of Mexico, 56 miles south of the Louisiana mainland. Also in the Gulf of Mexico is the proposed Compass Port Terminal, to be located approximately 11 miles offshore Alabama. The third proposed facility would be a joint venture located in the Port of Long Beach, California. Each of these projects are in the initial regulatory permitting process. In July 2003, we signed a Heads of Agreement with Qatar Petroleum for the development of Qatargas 3, a large scale LNG project located in Qatar and servicing the U.S. natural gas market. This provides the framework for the necessary agreements and the completion of key feasibility studies, both of which were advanced in 2004. Qatargas 3 would be an integrated project, jointly owned by Qatar Petroleum and us, consisting of facilities to produce and liquefy gas from Qatars North field. The LNG would be shipped from Qatar, and we would be responsible for regasification and marketing within the United States. Average daily gas sales volumes are projected to be approximately 1 billion cubic feet per day with startup anticipated in the 2009 timeframe. In late October 2003, we signed a Heads of Agreement with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, ENI and ChevronTexaco to conduct front end engineering and design (FEED) work for an LNG facility to be constructed in Nigerias central Niger Delta. The participants formed an incorporated joint venture, Brass LNG Limited, to undertake the project. The FEED contract was awarded to Bechtel in the fourth quarter 2004. These engineering and design studies are expected to be completed in 2006. The LNG facility is targeted to be operational in 2010. In December 2003, we signed a Statement of Intent with Qatar Petroleum regarding the construction of a gas to liquids plant in Ras Laffan, Qatar. The Statement of Intent initiates technical and commercial pre FEED studies and establishes principles for negotiating a Heads of Agreement for an integrated reservoir to market plant. Negotiations on more definitive agreements and progress on the studies continue in 2005. On February 24, 2005, ConocoPhillips and Duke Energy Corporation (Duke) agreed to terms to restructure their respective ownership levels in DEFS, which would cause DEFS to become a jointly controlled venture, owned 50 percent by each company. This restructuring has been approved by the Boards of Directors of both owners. We will increase our current 30.3 percent ownership in DEFS to 50 percent through a series of direct and indirect transfers of Midstream assets from ConocoPhillips to Duke, a disproportionate cash distribution to Duke from the sale of DEFS general partner interest in TEPPCO Partners, L.P., and a final cash payment to Duke of approximately $200 million, which we expect to fund from our general liquidity resources. We anticipate recording our equity share of the financial gain from DEFS sale of the general partner interest in TEPPCO in the first quarter of 2005. The restructuring is expected to have the effect of significantly reducing the favorable basis difference in our investment in DEFS which, in turn, will significantly reduce the basis difference amortization reported in equity method earnings (see Note 8 Investments and Long Term Receivables for more information on our basis difference in the DEFS investment). We anticipate that this reduction in basis difference amortization and the loss of earnings from the transfer of certain of our Midstream assets to Duke and DEFS will be approximately offset by our increased 50 percent share of the remaining DEFS earnings going forward. The restructuring is expected to close in the second quarter of 2005, subject to normal regulatory approvals. Once completed, our Midstream segment will consist primarily of our 50 percent equity method interest in DEFS. 91 Table of Contents CAUTIONARY STATEMENT FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE SAFE HARBOR PROVISIONS OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995 This report includes forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. You can identify our forward looking statements by the words anticipate, estimate, believe, continue, could, intend, may, plan, potential, predict, should, will, expect, objective, projection, forecast, goal, guidance, outlook, effort, target and similar expressions. We based the forward looking statements relating to our operations on our current expectations, estimates and projections about ourselves and the industries in which we operate in general. We caution you that these statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that we cannot predict. In addition, we based many of these forward looking statements on assumptions about future events that may prove to be inaccurate. Accordingly, our actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what we have expressed or forecast in the forward looking statements. Any differences could result from a variety of factors, including the following: Fluctuations in crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices, refining and marketing margins and margins for our chemicals business. Changes in our business, operations, results and prospects. The operation and financing of our midstream and chemicals joint ventures. Potential failure or delays in achieving expected reserve or production levels from existing and future oil and gas development projects due to operating hazards, drilling risks and the inherent uncertainties in predicting oil and gas reserves and oil and gas reservoir performance. Unsuccessful exploratory drilling activities. Failure of new products and services to achieve market acceptance. Unexpected changes in costs or technical requirements for constructing, modifying or operating facilities for exploration and production projects, manufacturing or refining. Unexpected technological or commercial difficulties in manufacturing or refining our products, including synthetic crude oil and chemicals products. Lack of, or disruptions in, adequate and reliable transportation for our crude oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids, LNG and refined products. Inability to timely obtain or maintain permits, including those necessary for construction of LNG terminals or regasification facilities, comply with government regulations, or make capital expenditures required to maintain compliance. Failure to complete definitive agreements and feasibility studies for, and to timely complete construction of, announced and future LNG projects and related facilities. Potential disruption or interruption of our operations due to accidents, extraordinary weather events, civil unrest, political events or terrorism. International monetary conditions and exchange controls. Liability for remedial actions, including removal and reclamation obligations, under environmental regulations. Liability resulting from litigation. 92 Table of Contents General domestic and international economic and political conditions, including armed hostilities and governmental disputes over territorial boundaries. Changes in tax and other laws, regulations or royalty rules applicable to our business. Inability to obtain economical financing for exploration and development projects, construction or modification of facilities and general corporate purposes. 93 Table of Contents Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Financial Instrument Market Risk We and certain of our subsidiaries hold and issue derivative contracts and financial instruments that expose cash flows or earnings to changes in commodity prices, foreign exchange rates or interest rates. We may use financial and commodity based derivative contracts to manage the risks produced by changes in the prices of electric power, natural gas, crude oil and related products, fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, or to exploit market opportunities. Our use of derivative instruments is governed by an Authority Limitations document approved by our Board that prohibits the use of highly leveraged derivatives or derivative instruments without sufficient liquidity for comparable valuations without approval from the Chief Executive Officer. The Authority Limitations document also authorizes the Chief Executive Officer to establish the maximum Value at Risk (VaR) limits for the company and compliance with these limits is monitored daily. The Chief Financial Officer monitors risks resulting from foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, while the Executive Vice President of Commercial monitors commodity price risk. Both report to the Chief Executive Officer. The Commercial organization manages our commercial marketing, optimizes our commodity flows and positions, monitors related risks of our upstream and downstream businesses, and selectively takes price risk to add value. Commodity Price Risk We operate in the worldwide crude oil, refined products, natural gas, natural gas liquids, and electric power markets and are exposed to fluctuations in the prices for these commodities. These fluctuations can affect our revenues, as well as the cost of operating, investing, and financing activities. Generally, our policy is to remain exposed to market prices of commodities; however, executive management may elect to use derivative instruments to hedge the price risk of our crude oil and natural gas production, as well as refinery margins. Our Commercial organization uses futures, forwards, swaps, and options in various markets to optimize the value of our supply chain, which may move our risk profile away from market average prices to accomplish the following objectives: Balance physical systems. In addition to cash settlement prior to contract expiration, exchange traded futures contracts also may be settled by physical delivery of the commodity, providing another source of supply to meet our refinery requirements or marketing demand. Meet customer needs. Consistent with our policy to generally remain exposed to market prices, we use swap contracts to convert fixed price sales contracts, which are often requested by natural gas and refined product consumers, to a floating market price. Manage the risk to our cash flows from price exposures on specific crude oil, natural gas, refined product and electric power transactions. Enable us to use the market knowledge gained from these activities to do a limited amount of trading not directly related to our physical business. For the 12 months ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, the gains or losses from this activity were not material to our cash flows or income from continuing operations. 94 Table of Contents We use a VaR model to estimate the loss in fair value that could potentially result on a single day from the effect of adverse changes in market conditions on the derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments held or issued, including commodity purchase and sales contracts recorded on the balance sheet at December 31, 2004, as derivative instruments in accordance with SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended. Using Monte Carlo simulation, a 95 percent confidence level and a one day holding period, the VaR for those instruments issued or held for trading purposes at December 31, 2004 and 2003, was immaterial to our net income and cash flows. The VaR for instruments held for purposes other than trading at December 31, 2004 and 2003, was also immaterial to our net income and cash flows. Interest Rate Risk The following tables provide information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. The debt tables present principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates; the derivative table shows the notional quantities on which the cash flows will be calculated by swap termination date. Weighted average variable rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at the reporting date. The carrying amount of our floating rate debt approximates its fair value. The fair value of the fixed rate financial instruments is estimated based on quoted market prices.

Under SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, these swaps were designated as hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of $400 million of 3.625% Notes due 2007, $750 million of 6.35% Notes due 2009, and $350 million of 4.75% Notes due 2012. These swaps qualify for the shortcut method of hedge accounting, so over the term of the swaps we will not recognize gain or loss due to ineffectiveness in the hedge.

We do not comprehensively hedge the exposure to currency rate changes, although we may choose to selectively hedge exposures to foreign currency rate risk. Examples include firm commitments for capital projects, certain local currency tax payments and dividends, and cash returns from net investments in foreign affiliates to be remitted within the coming year. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, we held foreign currency swaps hedging short term intercompany loans between European subsidiaries and a U.S. subsidiary. Although these swaps hedge exposures to fluctuations in exchange rates, we elected not to utilize hedge accounting as allowed by SFAS No. 133. As a result, the change in the fair value of these foreign currency swaps is recorded directly in earnings. Since the gain or loss on the swaps is offset by the gain or loss from remeasuring the intercompany loans into the functional currency of the lender or borrower, there would be no impact to income from an adverse hypothetical 10 percent change in the December 31, 2004 or 2003, exchange rates. The notional and fair market values of these positions at December 31, 2004 and 2003, were as follows: 96 Table of Contents Millions of Dollars Foreign Currency Swaps Notional Fair Market Value 2004 2003 2004 2003 Sell U.S. dollar, buy euro $ 370 267 13 2 Sell U.S. dollar, buy British pound 1,253 789 14 26 Sell U.S. dollar, buy Canadian dollar 85 2 Sell U.S. dollar, buy Czech koruny 13 Sell U.S. dollar, buy Danish krone 15 12 Sell U.S. dollar, buy Norwegian kroner 991 380 58 7 Sell U.S. dollar, buy Polish zlotych 2 Sell U.S. dollar, buy Swedish krona 148 93 3 5 For additional information about our use of derivative instruments, see Note 17 Financial Instruments and Derivative Contracts, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 97 Table of Contents
