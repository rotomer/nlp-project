BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW ConocoPhillips is an international, integrated energy company. We are the third largest integrated energy company in the United States, based on market capitalization. We have approximately 38,400 employees worldwide, and at year end 2006 had assets of $165 billion. Our stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol COP. On March 31, 2006, we completed the $33.9 billion acquisition of Burlington Resources Inc., an independent exploration and production company that held a substantial position in North American natural gas proved reserves, production and exploratory acreage. This acquisition added approximately 2 billion barrels of oil equivalent to our proved reserves. The acquisition is reflected in our results of operations beginning in the second quarter of 2006. Our business is organized into six operating segments: Exploration and Production (E&P) This segment primarily explores for, produces and markets crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids on a worldwide basis. Midstream This segment gathers, processes and markets natural gas produced by ConocoPhillips and others, and fractionates and markets natural gas liquids, primarily in the United States and Trinidad. The Midstream segment primarily consists of our 50 percent equity investment in DCP Midstream, LLC, formerly named Duke Energy Field Services, LLC. Refining and Marketing (R&M) This segment purchases, refines, markets and transports crude oil and petroleum products, mainly in the United States, Europe and Asia. LUKOIL Investment This segment consists of our equity investment in the ordinary shares of OAO LUKOIL (LUKOIL), an international, integrated oil and gas company headquartered in Russia. At December 31, 2006, our ownership interest, based on authorized and issued shares, was 20 percent, and 20.6 percent based on estimated shares outstanding. Chemicals This segment manufactures and markets petrochemicals and plastics on a worldwide basis. The Chemicals segment consists of our 50 percent equity investment in Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC (CPChem). 49 Emerging Businesses This segment includes the development of new technologies and businesses outside our normal scope of operations. Crude oil and natural gas prices, along with refining margins, are the most significant factors in our profitability. Accordingly, our overall earnings depend primarily upon the profitability of our E&P and R&M segments. Crude oil and natural gas prices, along with refining margins, are driven by market factors over which we have no control. However, from a competitive perspective, there are other important factors we must manage well to be successful, including: Adding to our proved reserve base. We primarily add to our proved reserve base in three ways: Successful exploration and development of new fields. Acquisition of existing fields. Applying new technologies and processes to improve recovery from existing fields. Through a combination of all three methods listed above, we have been successful in the past in maintaining or adding to our production and proved reserve base. Although it cannot be assured, we anticipate being able to do so in the future. In late 2005, we signed an agreement with the Libyan National Oil Corporation under which we and our co venturers acquired an ownership interest in the Waha concessions in Libya. As a result, we added 238 million barrels to our net proved crude oil reserves in 2005. The acquisition of Burlington Resources in March of 2006 added approximately 2 billion barrels of oil equivalent to our proved reserves, and through our investments in LUKOIL over the past three years we purchased about 1.9 billion barrels of oil equivalent. In the three years ending December 31, 2006, our reserve replacement was 254 percent, including the impact of the Burlington Resources acquisition and our additional equity investment in LUKOIL. Operating our producing properties and refining and marketing operations safely, consistently and in an environmentally sound manner. Safety is our first priority and we are committed to protecting the health and safety of everyone who has a role in our operations and the communities in which we operate. Maintaining high utilization rates at our refineries and minimizing downtime in producing fields enable us to capture the value available in the market in terms of prices and margins. During 2006, our worldwide refinery capacity utilization rate was 92 percent, compared with 93 percent in 2005. The reduced utilization rate reflects both scheduled downtime and unplanned weather related downtime. Concerning the environment, we strive to conduct our operations in a manner consistent with our environmental stewardship principles. Controlling costs and expenses. Since we cannot control the prices of the commodity products we sell, controlling operating and overhead costs and prudently managing our capital program, within the context of our commitment to safety and environmental stewardship, are high priorities. We monitor these costs using various methodologies that are reported to senior management monthly, on both an absolute dollar basis and a per unit basis. Because managing operating and overhead costs are critical to maintaining competitive positions in our industries, cost control is a component of our variable compensation programs. With the rise in commodity prices over the last several years, and the subsequent increase in industry wide spending on capital and major maintenance programs, we and other energy companies are experiencing inflation for the costs of certain goods and services in excess of general worldwide inflationary trends. Such costs include rates for drilling rigs, steel and other raw materials, as well as costs for skilled labor. While we work to manage the effect these inflationary pressures have on our costs, our capital program has been impacted by these factors, and certain projects have been delayed. Our capital program may be further impacted by these factors going forward. 50 Selecting the appropriate projects in which to invest our capital dollars. We participate in capital intensive industries. As a result, we must often invest significant capital dollars to explore for new oil and gas fields, develop newly discovered fields, maintain existing fields, or continue to maintain and improve our refinery complexes. We invest in those projects that are expected to provide an adequate financial return on invested dollars. However, there are often long lead times from the time we make an investment to the time that investment is operational and begins generating financial returns. Our capital expenditures and investments in 2006 totaled $15.6 billion, and we anticipate capital expenditures and investments to be approximately $12.3 billion in 2007. Managing our asset portfolio. We continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire assets that will contribute to future growth at competitive prices. We also continually assess our assets to determine if any no longer fit our strategic plans and should be sold or otherwise disposed. This management of our asset portfolio is important to ensuring our long term growth and maintaining adequate financial returns. During 2005 and 2006, we increased our investment in LUKOIL, ending the year with a 20 percent ownership interest, based on authorized and issued shares. During 2006, we completed the $33.9 billion acquisition of Burlington Resources. Also during 2006, we announced the commencement of an asset rationalization program to evaluate our asset base to identify those assets that may no longer fit into our strategic plans or those that could bring more value by being monetized in the near term. This program generated proceeds of $1.5 billion through January 31, 2007. We expect this rationalization program to result in proceeds from asset dispositions of $3 billion to $4 billion. In December 2006, we announced a program to dispose of our company owned U.S. retail marketing outlets to new or existing wholesale marketers. Hiring, developing and retaining a talented workforce. We want to attract, train, develop and retain individuals with the knowledge and skills to implement our business strategy and who support our values and ethics. Our key performance indicators are shown in the statistical tables provided at the beginning of the operating segment sections that follow. These include crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices and production, refining capacity utilization, and refinery output. Other significant factors that can affect our profitability include: Property and leasehold impairments. As mentioned above, we participate in capital intensive industries. At times, these investments become impaired when our reserve estimates are revised downward, when crude oil or natural gas prices, or refinery margins, decline significantly for long periods of time, or when a decision to dispose of an asset leads to a write down to its fair market value. Property impairments in 2006 totaled $383 million, compared with $42 million in 2005. We may also invest large amounts of money in exploration blocks which, if exploratory drilling proves unsuccessful, could lead to material impairment of leasehold values. Goodwill. As a result of mergers and acquisitions, at year end 2006 we had $31.5 billion of goodwill on our balance sheet, after reclassifying $340 million to current assets and recording an impairment of $230 million related to assets held for sale. Although our latest tests indicate that no goodwill impairment is currently required, future deterioration in market conditions could lead to goodwill impairments that would have a substantial negative, though non cash, effect on our profitability. Effective Tax Rate. Our operations are located in countries with different tax rates and fiscal structures. Accordingly, even in a stable commodity price and fiscal/regulatory environment, our overall effective tax rate can vary significantly between periods based on the mix of pre tax earnings within our global operations. 51 Fiscal and Regulatory Environment. As commodity prices and refining margins improved over the last several years, certain governments have responded with changes to their fiscal take. These changes have generally negatively impacted our results of operations, and further changes to government fiscal take could have a negative impact on future operations. Segment Analysis The E&P segments results are most closely linked to crude oil and natural gas prices. These are commodity products, the prices of which are subject to factors external to our company and over which we have no control. Industry crude oil prices for West Texas Intermediate were higher in 2006 compared with 2005, averaging $66.00 per barrel in 2006, an increase of 17 percent. The increase was primarily due to growth in global consumption associated with continuing economic expansions and limited spare capacity from major exporting countries. Industry natural gas prices for Henry Hub decreased during 2006 to $7.24 per million British thermal units (MMBTU), down 16 percent, compared with the 2005 average of $8.64 per MMBTU, primarily due to high storage levels and moderate weather. The Midstream segments results are most closely linked to natural gas liquids prices. The most important factor on the profitability of this segment is the results from our 50 percent equity investment in DCP Midstream. During 2005, we increased our ownership interest in DCP Midstream from 30.3 percent to 50 percent, and we recorded a gain of $306 million, after tax, for our equity share of DCP Midstreams sale of its general partnership interest in TEPPCO Partners, LP (TEPPCO). An adjustment recorded in 2006 increased this gain by $24 million. DCP Midstreams natural gas liquids prices increased 11 percent in 2006, generally tracking the increase in crude oil prices. Refining margins, refinery utilization, cost control, and marketing margins primarily drive the R&M segments results. Refining margins are subject to movements in the cost of crude oil and other feedstocks, and the sales prices for refined products, which are subject to market factors over which we have no control. Industry refining margins in the United States were stronger overall in comparison to 2005, contributing to improved R&M profitability. Key factors contributing to the stronger refining margins in 2006 were high U.S. gasoline and distillate demand. Industry marketing margins in the United States were stronger in 2006, compared with those in 2005, as the market did not encounter the steep product cost increases experienced in 2005 due to hurricanes. The LUKOIL Investment segment consists of our investment in the ordinary shares of LUKOIL. In October 2004, we closed on a transaction to acquire 7.6 percent of LUKOILs shares from the Russian government for approximately $2 billion. During the remainder of 2004, all of 2005 and 2006, we invested an additional $5.5 billion, bringing our equity ownership interest in LUKOIL to 20 percent by year end 2006, based on authorized and issued shares. We initiated this strategic investment to gain further exposure to Russias resource potential, where LUKOIL has significant positions in proved reserves and production. We also are benefiting from an increase in proved oil and gas reserves at an attractive cost, and our E&P segment should benefit from direct participation with LUKOIL in large oil projects in the northern Timan Pechora province of Russia, and an opportunity to potentially participate in the development of the West Qurna field in Iraq. The Chemicals segment consists of our 50 percent interest in CPChem. The chemicals and plastics industry is mainly a commodity based industry where the margins for key products are based on market factors over which CPChem has little or no control. CPChem is investing in feedstock advantaged areas in the Middle East with access to large, growing markets, such as Asia. Our 2006 financial results from Chemicals were the strongest since the formation of CPChem in 2000, as this business line has emerged from a deep cyclical downturn that began around that time. 52 The Emerging Businesses segment represents our investment in new technologies or businesses outside our normal scope of operations. The businesses in this segment focus on staying current on new technologies to support our primary segments. They also pursue technologies involving heavy oils, biofuels, and alternative energy sources. Some of these technologies may have the potential to become important drivers of profitability in future years. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Consolidated Results A summary of the companys net income (loss) by business segment follows: Millions of Dollars Years Ended December 31 2006 2005 2004 Exploration and Production (E&P) $ 9,848 8,430 5,702 Midstream 476 688 235 Refining and Marketing (R&M) 4,481 4,173 2,743 LUKOIL Investment 1,425 714 74 Chemicals 492 323 249 Emerging Businesses 15 (21 ) (102 ) Corporate and Other (1,187 ) (778 ) (772 ) Net income $ 15,550 13,529 8,129 2006 vs. 2005 The improved results in 2006 were primarily the result of: Higher crude oil prices in the E&P segment. The inclusion of Burlington Resources in our results of operations for the E&P segment. Improved refining margins and volumes and marketing margins in the R&M segments U.S. operations. Increased equity earnings from our investment in LUKOIL due to an increase in our ownership percentage and higher estimated commodity prices and volumes. The recognition in 2006 of business interruption insurance recoveries attributable to hurricanes in 2005. These items were partially offset by: The impairment of certain assets held for sale in the R&M and E&P segments. Lower natural gas prices in the E&P segment. Higher interest and debt expense resulting from higher average debt levels due to the Burlington Resources acquisition. Decreased net income from the Midstream segment, reflecting the inclusion of our equity share of DCP Midstreams gain on the sale of the general partner interest in TEPPCO in our 2005 results. 53 2005 vs. 2004 The improved results in 2005, compared with 2004, primarily were due to: Higher crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices in our E&P and Midstream segments. Improved refining margins in our R&M segment. Increased equity earnings from our investment in LUKOIL. Our equity share of DCP Midstreams gain on the sale of its general partner interest in TEPPCO in 2005. Income Statement Analysis 2006 vs. 2005 Sales and other operating revenues increased 2 percent in 2006, while purchased crude oil, natural gas and products decreased 5 percent. The increase in sales and other operating revenues was primarily due to higher realized prices for crude oil and petroleum products, as well as higher sales volumes associated with the Burlington Resources acquisition. These increases were mostly offset by decreases associated with the implementation of Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 04 13, Accounting for Purchases and Sales of Inventory with the Same Counterparty. The decrease in purchased crude oil, natural gas and products was primarily the result of the implementation of Issue No. 04 13. See Note 2 Changes in Accounting Principles, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information on the impact of this Issue on our income statement. Equity in earnings of affiliates increased 21 percent in 2006. The increase reflects improved results from: LUKOIL, resulting from an increase in our ownership percentage, as well as higher estimated crude oil and petroleum products prices and volumes, and a net benefit from the alignment of our estimate of LUKOILs fourth quarter 2005 net income to LUKOILs reported results. Our chemicals joint venture, CPChem, due to higher margins and volumes, as well as the recognition of a business interruption insurance net benefit. These increases were offset partially by the inclusion of our equity share of DCP Midstreams gain on the sale of the general partner interest in TEPPCO in our 2005 results. Other income increased 47 percent during 2006, primarily due to the recognition in 2006 of recoveries on business interruption insurance claims attributable to losses sustained from hurricanes in 2005. In addition, interest income was higher in 2006. These increases were partially offset by higher net gains on asset dispositions recorded in 2005. Production and operating expenses increased 22 percent in 2006. The increase was primarily due to the acquired Burlington Resources assets, increased production at the Bayu Undan field associated with the Darwin liquefied natural gas (LNG) project in Australia, the first year of production in Libya, and the acquisition of the Wilhelmshaven refinery in Germany. Exploration expenses increased 26 percent in 2006, primarily due to the Burlington Resources acquisition. Depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) increased 71 percent during 2006. The increase was primarily the result of the addition of Burlington Resources assets in E&Ps depreciable asset base. In addition, the acquisition of the Wilhelmshaven refinery increased DD&A recorded by the R&M segment. 54 Impairments were $683 million in 2006, compared with $42 million in 2005. The increase primarily relates to the impairment in 2006 of certain assets held for sale in the R&M and E&P segments, comprised of properties, plants and equipment, trademark intangibles and goodwill. We also recorded an impairment charge in the E&P segment associated with assets in the Canadian Rockies Foothills area, as a result of declining well performance and drilling results. See Note 13 Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. Interest and debt expense increased from $497 million in 2005 to $1,087 million in 2006, primarily due to higher average debt levels as a result of the financing required to partially fund the acquisition of Burlington Resources. 2005 vs. 2004 Sales and other operating revenues increased 33 percent in 2005, while purchased crude oil, natural gas and products increased 39 percent. These increases primarily were due to higher petroleum product prices and higher prices for crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids. Equity in earnings of affiliates increased 125 percent in 2005, compared with 2004. The increase reflects a full years equity earnings from our investment in LUKOIL, as well as improved results from: Our heavy oil joint ventures in Venezuela (Hamaca and Petrozuata), due to higher crude oil prices benefiting both ventures, and higher production volumes at Hamaca. Our chemicals joint venture, CPChem, due to higher margins. Our midstream joint venture, DCP Midstream, reflecting higher natural gas liquids prices and DCP Midstreams gain on the sale of its TEPPCO general partner interest. Our joint venture refinery in Melaka, Malaysia, due to improved refining margins in the Asia Pacific region. Our joint venture delayed coker facilities at the Sweeny, Texas, refinery, Merey Sweeny LLP, due to wider heavy light crude oil differentials. Other income increased 52 percent in 2005, compared with 2004. The increase was mainly due to higher net gains on asset dispositions in 2005, as well as higher interest income. Asset dispositions in 2005 included the sale of our interest in coalbed methane acreage positions in the Powder River Basin in Wyoming, as well as our interests in Dixie Pipeline, Turcas Petrol A.S., and Venture Coke Company. Asset dispositions in 2004 included our interest in the Petrovera heavy oil joint venture in Canada. Production and operating expenses increased 16 percent in 2005, compared with 2004. The E&P segment had higher maintenance and transportation costs; higher costs associated with new fields, including the Magnolia field in the Gulf of Mexico; negative impact from foreign currency exchange rates; and upward insurance premium adjustments. The R&M segment had higher utility costs due to higher natural gas prices, as well as higher maintenance and repair costs due to increased turnaround activity and hurricane impacts. Depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) increased 12 percent in 2005, compared with 2004, primarily due to new projects in the E&P segment, including a full years production from the Magnolia field in the Gulf of Mexico and the Belanak field, offshore Indonesia, as well as new production from the Clair field in the Atlantic Margin and continued ramp up at the Bayu Undan field in the Timor Sea. 55 We adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143 (FIN 47), effective December 31, 2005. As a result, we recognized a charge of $88 million for the cumulative effect of this accounting change. Restructuring Program As a result of the Burlington Resources acquisition, we implemented a restructuring program in March 2006 to capture the synergies of combining the two companies. Under this program, which is expected to be completed by the end of March 2008, we recorded accruals totaling $230 million for employee severance payments, site closings, incremental pension benefit costs associated with the workforce reductions, and employee relocations. Approximately 600 positions have been identified for elimination, most of which are in the United States. Of the total accrual, $224 million is reflected in the Burlington Resources purchase price allocation as an assumed liability, and $6 million ($4 million after tax) related to ConocoPhillips is reflected in selling, general and administrative expenses. Included in the total accruals of $230 million is $12 million related to pension benefits to be paid in conjunction with other retirement benefits over a number of future years. See Note 6 Restructuring, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. 56 Segment Results E&P 2006 2005 2004 Millions of Dollars Net Income Alaska $ 2,347 2,552 1,832 Lower 48 2,001 1,736 1,110 United States 4,348 4,288 2,942 International 5,500 4,142 2,760 $ 9,848 8,430 5,702 Dollars Per Unit Average Sales Prices Crude oil (per barrel) United States $ 61.09 51.09 38.25 International 63.38 52.27 37.18 Total consolidated 62.39 51.74 37.65 Equity affiliates* 46.01 37.79 24.18 Worldwide E&P 60.37 49.87 36.06 Natural gas (per thousand cubic feet) United States 6.11 7.12 5.33 International 6.27 5.78 4.14 Total consolidated 6.20 6.32 4.62 Equity affiliates* .30 .26 2.19 Worldwide E&P 6.19 6.30 4.61 Natural gas liquids (per barrel) United States 40.35 40.40 31.05 International 42.89 36.25 28.96 Total consolidated 41.50 38.32 30.02 Equity affiliates* Worldwide E&P 41.50 38.32 30.02 Average Production Costs Per Barrel of Oil Equivalent United States $ 5.43 4.24 3.70 International** 5.65 4.58 3.86 Total consolidated** 5.55 4.43 3.79 Equity affiliates* 5.83 4.93 4.14 Worldwide E&P** 5.57 4.47 3.81 *Excludes our equity share of LUKOIL, which is reported in the LUKOIL Investment segment. **Prior years restated to reflect reclassification of certain costs to conform to current year presentation.

It also mines deposits of oil sands in Canada to extract the bitumen and upgrade it into a synthetic crude oil. At December 31, 2006, our E&P operations were producing in the United States, Norway, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Canada, Nigeria, Venezuela, Ecuador, Argentina, offshore Timor Leste in the Timor Sea, Australia, China, Indonesia, Algeria, Libya, the United Arab Emirates, Vietnam, and Russia. 2006 vs. 2005 Net income from the E&P segment increased 17 percent in 2006. The increase was primarily due to higher realized crude oil prices and, to a lesser extent, higher sales prices for natural gas liquids and Syncrude. In addition, increased sales volumes, primarily the result of the Burlington Resources acquisition, contributed positively to net income in 2006. These items were partially offset by lower realized natural gas prices, higher exploration expenses, the negative impacts of changes in tax laws, and asset impairments. If crude oil prices in 2007 do not remain at the levels experienced in 2006, and if costs continue to increase, the E&P segments earnings would be negatively impacted. See the Business Environment and Executive Overview section for additional information on industry crude oil and natural gas prices and inflationary cost pressures. Proved reserves at year end 2006 were 9.36 billion barrels of oil equivalent (BOE), compared with 7.92 billion BOE at year end 2005. This excludes the estimated 1,805 million BOE and 1,442 million BOE included in the LUKOIL Investment segment at year end 2006 and 2005, respectively. Also excluded is our share of Canadian Syncrude mining operations, which was 243 million barrels of proved oil sands reserves at year end 2006, compared with 251 million barrels at year end 2005. U.S. E&P Net income from our U.S. E&P operations increased slightly in 2006, primarily resulting from higher crude oil prices, as well as increased crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids production in the Lower 48 states, reflecting the Burlington Resources acquisition. These increases were partially offset by lower natural gas prices, higher exploration expenses, lower production levels in Alaska, and higher production taxes in Alaska. In August 2006, the state of Alaska enacted new production tax legislation, retroactive to April 1, 2006. The new legislation results in a higher production tax structure for ConocoPhillips. U.S. E&P production on a BOE basis averaged 808,000 barrels per day in 2006, compared with 633,000 barrels per day in 2005. Production was favorably impacted in 2006 by the addition of volumes from the Burlington Resources assets, offset slightly by decreases in production levels in Alaska. Production in Alaska was negatively impacted by operational shut downs and weather related transportation delays. International E&P Net income from our international E&P operations increased 33 percent in 2006, reflecting higher crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids prices and production, as well as higher levels of LNG production from the Darwin LNG facility associated with the Bayu Undan field in the Timor Sea. These increases were offset partially by increased exploration expenses and a $93 million after tax impairment charge associated with assets in the Canadian Rockies Foothills area. In addition, the increases to net income were partially offset by the negative impacts of tax law changes. 59 The following international tax legislation was enacted during 2006: In the United Kingdom, the rate of supplementary corporation tax applicable to U.K. upstream activity increased in July 2006 from 10 percent to 20 percent, retroactive to January 1, 2006, which increased the U.K. upstream corporation tax from 40 percent to 50 percent. This resulted in additional tax expense during 2006 of approximately $470 million, comprised of approximately $250 million for revaluing beginning deferred tax liability balances, and approximately $220 million to reflect the new rate from January 1, 2006. In Canada, the Alberta government reduced the Alberta corporate income tax rate from 11.5 percent to 10 percent, effective April 2006. In addition, the Canadian federal government announced federal tax rate reductions whereby the federal tax rate will decline by 2 percent over the period 2008 to 2010 and the 1.12 percent federal surtax will be eliminated in 2008. As a result of these tax rate reductions, we recorded a one time favorable adjustment in the E&P segment of $401 million to our deferred tax liability in the second quarter of 2006. The China Ministry of Finance enacted a Special Levy on Earnings from Petroleum Enterprises, effective March 26, 2006. The special levy, which is based on the cost recovery price of crude oil, starts at a rate of 20 percent of the excess price when crude oil prices exceed $40 per barrel, and increases 5 percent for every corresponding $5 per barrel increase in the cost recovery price. Once the cost recovery price reaches $60 per barrel, a maximum levy rate of 40 percent is applied. This special levy resulted in a negative impact to earnings of $41 million in 2006. The Venezuelan government enacted an extraction tax of 33.33 percent with an effective date of May 29, 2006. The tax is calculated based on the value of oil extracted, less royalty payments. This extraction tax resulted in a reduction in our equity earnings of $113 million in 2006. An increase in the Venezuelan income tax rate from 34 percent to 50 percent for heavy oil projects was enacted in the third quarter of 2006, and became effective with the tax year beginning January 1, 2007. Had this new rate been in effect in 2006, our equity earnings would have been reduced by an estimated $205 million. The Algerian government enacted an exceptional profits tax with an effective date of August 1, 2006. In general, the exceptional profits tax applies to all calendar months during which the monthly arithmetic average of the high and low Brent price is greater than $30 per barrel. The tax rate is determined by reference to a price coefficient, the calculation of which is prescribed in the legislation. For 2006, the rate of the tax was 6.2 percent. The resulting negative impact on earnings in 2006 was approximately $36 million, including a rate adjustment effected in respect of the deferred tax provision. International E&P production averaged 1,128,000 BOE per day in 2006, an increase of 24 percent from 910,000 BOE per day in 2005. Production was favorably impacted in 2006 by the addition of Burlington Resources assets, higher gas production at Bayu Undan associated with the Darwin LNG ramp up in Australia, and the 2006 reentry into Libya. Our Syncrude mining operations produced 21,000 barrels per day in 2006, compared with 19,000 barrels per day in 2005. 2005 vs. 2004 Net income from the E&P segment increased 48 percent in 2005, compared with 2004. The increase primarily was due to higher sales prices for crude oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids and Syncrude. In addition, increased sales volumes associated with the Magnolia and Bayu Undan fields, as well as the Hamaca project, contributed positively to net income in 2005. Partially offsetting these items were increased production and operating costs, DD&A and taxes, as well as mark to market losses on certain U.K. natural gas contracts. 60 U.S. E&P Net income from our U.S. E&P operations increased 46 percent in 2005, compared with 2004. The increase primarily was the result of higher crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices; higher sales volumes from the Magnolia deepwater field in the Gulf of Mexico, which began producing in late 2004; and higher gains from asset sales in 2005. These items were partially offset by: Higher production and operating expenses, reflecting increased transportation costs and well workover and other maintenance activity, and the impact of newly producing fields and environmental accruals. Higher DD&A, mainly due to increased production from the Magnolia field and other new fields. Higher production taxes, resulting from increased prices for crude oil and natural gas. U.S. E&P production on a BOE basis averaged 633,000 barrels per day in 2005, compared with 629,000 barrels per day in 2004. The slight increase reflects the positive impact of a full years production from the Magnolia field and the purchase of overriding royalty interests in Utah and the San Juan Basin, mostly offset by normal field production declines, hurricane related downtime, and the impact of asset dispositions. International E&P Net income from our international E&P operations increased 50 percent in 2005, compared with 2004. The increase primarily was the result of higher crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices. In addition, we had higher sales volumes from the Bayu Undan field in the Timor Sea and the Hamaca project in Venezuela. These items were partially offset by: Higher production and operating expenses, reflecting increased costs at our Canadian Syncrude operations (including higher utility costs there) and increased costs associated with newly producing fields. Mark to market losses on certain U.K. natural gas contracts. Higher DD&A, mainly due to increased production from the Bayu Undan field. Higher income taxes incurred by our equity affiliates at our Venezuelan heavy oil projects. International E&P production averaged 910,000 BOE per day in 2005, a slight decrease from 913,000 BOE per day in 2004. Production was favorably impacted in 2005 by the Bayu Undan field and the Hamaca heavy oil upgrader project. At the Bayu Undan field, 2005 production was higher than in 2004, when production was still ramping up. At the Hamaca project, production increased in late 2004 with the startup of a heavy oil upgrader. These increases in production were offset by the impact of planned and unplanned maintenance, and field production declines. Our Syncrude mining operations produced 19,000 barrels per day in 2005, compared with 21,000 barrels per day in 2004. 61 Midstream 2006 2005 2004 Millions of Dollars Net Income* $ 476 688 235 *Includes DCP Midstream related net income: $ 385 591 143 Dollars Per Barrel Average Sales Prices U.S. natural gas liquids* Consolidated $ 40.22 36.68 29.38 Equity 39.45 35.52 28.60 *Based on index prices from the Mont Belvieu and Conway market hubs that are weighted by natural gas liquids component and location mix.

The Midstream segment purchases raw natural gas from producers and gathers natural gas through an extensive network of pipeline gathering systems. The natural gas is then processed to extract natural gas liquids from the raw gas stream. The remaining residue gas is marketed to electrical utilities, industrial users, and gas marketing companies. Most of the natural gas liquids are fractionated separated into individual components like ethane, butane and propane and marketed as chemical feedstock, fuel, or blendstock. The Midstream segment consists of our equity investment in DCP Midstream, LLC, formerly named Duke Energy Field Services, LLC, as well as our other natural gas gathering and processing operations, and natural gas liquids fractionation and marketing businesses, primarily in the United States and Trinidad. In July 2005, ConocoPhillips and Duke Energy Corporation (Duke) restructured their respective ownership levels in DCP Midstream, which resulted in DCP Midstream becoming a jointly controlled venture, owned 50 percent by each company. Prior to the restructuring, our ownership interest in DCP Midstream was 30.3 percent. This restructuring increased our ownership in DCP Midstream through a series of direct and indirect transfers of certain Canadian Midstream assets from DCP Midstream to Duke, a disproportionate cash distribution from DCP Midstream to Duke from the sale of DCP Midstreams interest in TEPPCO Partners, L.P. (TEPPCO), and a combined payment by ConocoPhillips to Duke and DCP Midstream of approximately $840 million. The Empress plant in Canada was not included in the initial transaction as originally anticipated due to weather related damage. Subsequently, we sold the Empress plant to Duke in August 2005 for approximately $230 million. 2006 vs. 2005 Net income from the Midstream segment decreased 31 percent in 2006, primarily due to the gain from the sale of DCP Midstreams interest in TEPPCO included in 2005 results. Our net share of this gain was $306 million on an after tax basis. This decrease was partially offset by a $24 million positive tax adjustment recorded in 2006 to the gain recorded in 2005 on the sale of DCP Midstreams interest in TEPPCO, as well as higher natural gas liquids prices and an increased ownership interest in DCP Midstream. 62 2005 vs. 2004 Net income from the Midstream segment increased 193 percent in 2005, compared with 2004. Included in the Midstream segments 2005 net income is a $306 million gain, representing our share of DCP Midstreams gain on the sale of its general partnership interest in TEPPCO. In addition, our Midstream segment benefited from improved natural gas liquids prices in 2005, which increased earnings at DCP Midstream, as well as our other Midstream operations. These positive items were partially offset by the loss of earnings from asset dispositions completed in 2004 and 2005. Included in the Midstream segments net income was a benefit of $17 million in 2005, compared with $36 million in 2004, representing the amortization of the excess amount of our equity interest in the net assets of DCP Midstream over the book value of our investment in DCP Midstream. The reduced amount in 2005 resulted from a significant reduction in the favorable basis difference of our investment in DCP Midstream following the restructuring. 63 R&M 2006 2005 2004 Millions of Dollars Net Income United States $ 3,915 3,329 2,126 International 566 844 617 $ 4,481 4,173 2,743 Dollars Per Gallon U.S. Average Sales Prices* Automotive gasoline Wholesale $ 2.04 1.73 1.33 Retail 2.18 1.88 1.52 Distillates wholesale 2.11 1.80 1.24 *Excludes excise taxes.

Actual capacity at year end 2006, 2005 and 2004 was 2,208,000, 2,182,000 and 2,160,000 barrels per day, respectively, in the United States. Actual international capacity was 693,000 barrels per day at year end 2006 and 428,000 barrels per day at year end 2005 and 2004. 64 The R&M segments operations encompass refining crude oil and other feedstocks into petroleum products (such as gasoline, distillates and aviation fuels); buying, selling and transporting crude oil; and buying, transporting, distributing and marketing petroleum products. R&M has operations in the United States, Europe and Asia Pacific. 2006 vs. 2005 Net income from the R&M segment increased 7 percent in 2006. The increase resulted primarily from: Higher U.S. refining and marketing margins, and higher U.S. refining volumes. The recognition of a net benefit related to business interruption insurance. The inclusion of an $83 million charge for the cumulative effect of adopting FIN 47 in the results for 2005. The increase in net income was partially offset by impairments on assets held for sale recognized in 2006, as well as higher depreciation expense. See the Business Environment and Executive Overview section for our view of the factors supporting industry refining and marketing margins. We expect our average worldwide refinery crude oil utilization rate for 2007 to average in the mid nineties. U.S. R&M Net income from our U.S. R&M operations increased 18 percent in 2006, primarily due to: Higher refining and marketing margins, and higher refining volumes. The recognition of a net $111 million business interruption insurance benefit. A $78 million charge for the cumulative effect of adopting FIN 47 in 2005. These items were partially offset by after tax impairments of $227 million associated with certain assets held for sale, as well as higher depreciation expense. Our U.S. refining capacity utilization rate was 92 percent in 2006, the same as in 2005, reflecting unplanned weather related downtime in both years. International R&M Net income from our international R&M operations decreased 33 percent in 2006, due primarily to: The recognition of a $214 million after tax impairment charge on certain assets held for sale. Lower refining margins. Preliminary engineering costs for certain refinery related projects. These decreases were partially offset by favorable foreign currency exchange impacts and higher refining and marketing sales volumes. Our international refining capacity utilization rate was 91 percent in 2006, compared with 99 percent in 2005. The decrease reflects scheduled downtime at certain refineries and unscheduled downtime at the Humber refinery in the United Kingdom. 65 In February 2006, we acquired the Wilhelmshaven refinery in Germany. The purchase included the refinery, a marine terminal, rail and truck loading facilities and a tank farm, as well as another entity that provides commercial and administrative support to the refinery. 2005 vs. 2004 Net income from the R&M segment increased 52 percent in 2005, compared with 2004, primarily due to higher worldwide refining margins. Higher refining margins were partially offset by: Higher utility costs, mainly due to higher prices for natural gas. Increased turnaround costs. Lower production volumes and increased maintenance costs at our U.S. Gulf Coast refineries resulting from hurricanes Katrina and Rita. An $83 million charge for the cumulative effect of adopting FIN 47. U.S. R&M Net income from our U.S. R&M operations increased 57 percent in 2005, compared with 2004. The increase mainly was the result of higher U.S. refining margins, partially offset by: Higher utility costs, mainly due to higher prices for natural gas. Increased turnaround costs. Lower production volumes and increased maintenance costs at our U.S. Gulf Coast refineries resulting from hurricanes Katrina and Rita. A $78 million charge for the cumulative effect of adopting FIN 47. Our U.S. refining capacity utilization rate was 92 percent in 2005, compared with 95 percent in 2004. The lower 2005 rate was impacted by downtime related to hurricanes. International R&M Net income from our international R&M operations increased 37 percent in 2005, compared with 2004, primarily due to higher refining margins, along with improved refinery production volumes and increased results from marketing. These factors were partially offset by negative foreign currency exchange impacts and higher utility costs. Our international crude oil capacity utilization rate was 99 percent in 2005, compared with 91 percent in 2004. A larger volume of turnaround activity in 2004 contributed to most of this variance. 66 LUKOIL Investment Millions of Dollars 2006 2005 2004 Net Income $ 1,425 714 74 Operating Statistics* Net crude oil production (thousands of barrels daily) 360 235 38 Net natural gas production (millions of cubic feet daily) 244 67 13 Net refinery crude oil processed (thousands of barrels daily) 179 122 19 *Represents our net share of our estimate of LUKOILs production and processing. This segment represents our investment in the ordinary shares of LUKOIL, an international, integrated oil and gas company headquartered in Russia, which we account for under the equity method. During 2005, we expended $2,160 million to purchase LUKOILs ordinary shares, increasing our ownership interest to 16.1 percent. We expended another $2,715 million to increase our ownership interest in LUKOIL to 20 percent at December 31, 2006, based on 851 million shares authorized and issued. Our ownership interest based on estimated shares outstanding, used for equity method accounting, was 20.6 percent at December 31, 2006. 2006 vs. 2005 Net income from the LUKOIL Investment segment increased 100 percent during 2006, primarily as a result of our increased equity ownership, higher estimated prices and volumes, and a net benefit from the alignment of our estimate of LUKOILs fourth quarter 2005 net income to LUKOILs reported results. Because LUKOILs accounting cycle close and preparation of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) financial statements occur subsequent to our reporting deadline, our equity earnings and statistics for our LUKOIL investment are estimated, based on current market indicators, historical production and cost trends of LUKOIL, and other objective data. Once the difference between actual and estimated results is known, an adjustment is recorded. This estimate to actual adjustment will be a recurring component of future period results. The adjustment to estimated results for the fourth quarter of 2005, recorded in 2006, increased net income $71 million, compared with a $10 million increase to net income recorded in 2005 to adjust the estimated results for the fourth quarter of 2004. In addition to our estimate of our equity share of LUKOILs earnings, this segment reflects the amortization of the basis difference between our equity interest in the net assets of LUKOIL and the historical cost of our investment in LUKOIL, and also includes the costs associated with our employees seconded to LUKOIL. 2005 vs. 2004 In October 2004, we purchased 7.6 percent of LUKOILs ordinary shares from the Russian government, and during the remainder of 2004, we increased our ownership interest to 10 percent. During 2005, we further increased our ownership interest to 16.1 percent. The 2005 results for the LUKOIL Investment segment reflect this increase in ownership, as well as favorable market conditions, including strong crude oil prices. 67 Chemicals Millions of Dollars 2006 2005 2004 Net Income $ 492 323 249 The Chemicals segment consists of our 50 percent interest in Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC (CPChem), which we account for under the equity method. CPChem uses natural gas liquids and other feedstocks to produce petrochemicals. These products are then marketed and sold, or used as feedstocks to produce plastics and commodity chemicals. 2006 vs. 2005 Net income from the Chemicals segment increased 52 percent during 2006. Results for 2006 reflected improved olefins and polyolefins margins and volumes. The results for 2006 also included a hurricane related business interruption insurance benefit of $20 million after tax, as well as lower utility costs due to decreased natural gas prices. 2005 vs. 2004 Net income from the Chemicals segment increased 30 percent in 2005, compared with 2004. The increase primarily was attributable to higher ethylene and polyethylene margins. Partially offsetting these margin improvements were higher utility costs, reflecting increased costs of natural gas, as well as hurricane related impacts on 2005 production, and maintenance and repair costs. Emerging Businesses Millions of Dollars 2006 2005 2004 Net Income (Loss) Power $ 82 43 (31 ) Technology solutions (23 ) (16 ) (18 ) Other (44 ) (48 ) (53 ) $ 15 (21 ) (102 ) The Emerging Businesses segment represents our investment in new technologies or businesses outside our normal scope of operations. Activities within this segment are currently focused on power generation; carbon to liquids; technology solutions, such as sulfur removal technologies; and alternative energy programs, such as advanced hydrocarbon processes, energy conversion technologies, new petroleum based products, and renewable fuels. 2006 vs. 2005 The Emerging Businesses segment had net income of $15 million in 2006, compared with a net loss of $21 million in 2005. The improved results reflect higher international power margins and volumes. The increase in net income was partially offset by a write down of a damaged gas turbine at a domestic power plant, as well as lower domestic power margins and volumes. 68 2005 vs. 2004 The Emerging Businesses segment incurred a net loss of $21 million in 2005, compared with a net loss of $102 million in 2004. The improved results in 2005 reflect: The first full year of operations at the Immingham power plant in the United Kingdom, which began commercial operations in the fourth quarter of 2004. Lower costs in the gas to liquids business due to the closing of a demonstration plant. Improved margins in the domestic power generation business. Corporate and Other Millions of Dollars 2006 2005 * 2004 Net Income (Loss) Net interest $ (870 ) (467 ) (514 ) Corporate general and administrative expenses (133 ) (183 ) (212 ) Discontinued operations (23 ) 22 Acquisition/merger related costs (98 ) (14 ) Other (86 ) (105 ) (54 ) $ (1,187 ) (778 ) (772 ) *Certain amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation. 2006 vs. 2005 Net interest consists of interest and financing expense, net of interest income and capitalized interest, as well as premiums incurred on the early retirement of debt. Net interest increased 86 percent in 2006. The increase was primarily due to higher average debt levels as a result of the financing required to partially fund the acquisition of Burlington Resources. The increases were partially offset by higher amounts of interest being capitalized, as well as higher premiums incurred in 2005 on the early retirement of debt. Corporate general and administrative expenses decreased 27 percent in 2006, primarily due to reduced benefit related expenses. Acquisition/merger related costs in 2006 included seismic relicensing and other transition costs associated with the Burlington Resources acquisition. In 2007, we anticipate transition costs to be approximately $45 million after tax. The category Other includes certain foreign currency transaction gains and losses, and environmental costs associated with sites no longer in operation. Results from Other improved during 2006, primarily due to foreign currency transaction gains in 2006, versus losses in 2005, partially offset by certain tax items not directly attributable to the operating segments. 2005 vs. 2004 Net interest decreased 9 percent in 2005, compared with 2004, primarily due to lower average debt levels and increased interest income. Interest income increased as a result of our higher average cash balances during 2005. These items were partially offset by increased early debt retirement fees and a lower amount 69 of interest being capitalized in 2005, reflecting the completion of several major projects in the second half of 2004. Corporate general and administrative expenses decreased 14 percent in 2005. The decrease reflects increased allocations of management level stock based compensation to the operating segments, which had previously been retained at corporate. These increased corporate allocations did not have a material impact on the operating segments results. This was partially offset by increased charitable contributions. Discontinued operations had a loss in 2005 compared with income in 2004, reflecting asset dispositions completed during 2004 and 2005. Results from Other were lower in 2005, mainly due to certain unfavorable foreign currency transaction impacts. 70 CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Financial Indicators Millions of Dollars Except as Indicated 2006 2005 2004 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 21,516 17,628 11,959 Notes payable and long term debt due within one year 4,043 1,758 632 Total debt 27,134 12,516 15,002 Minority interests 1,202 1,209 1,105 Common stockholders equity 82,646 52,731 42,723 Percent of total debt to capital* 24 % 19 26 Percent of floating rate debt to total debt 41 9 19 *Capital includes total debt, minority interests and common stockholders equity. To meet our short and long term liquidity requirements, we look to a variety of funding sources, primarily cash generated from operating activities. In addition, during 2006 we raised $545 million in funds from the sale of assets. During 2006, available cash was used to support our ongoing capital expenditures and investments program, provide loan financing to certain equity affiliates, repay debt, pay dividends, repurchase shares of our common stock and fund a portion of our acquisition of Burlington Resources Inc. Total dividends paid on our common stock in 2006 were $2.3 billion. During 2006, cash and cash equivalents declined $1,397 million to $817 million. In addition to cash flows from operating activities and proceeds from asset sales, we also rely on our cash balance, commercial paper and credit facility programs, and our shelf registration statements, to support our short and long term liquidity requirements. We anticipate these sources of liquidity will be adequate to meet our funding requirements through 2008, including our capital spending program, our share repurchase programs, dividend payments, required debt payments and the funding requirements related to the business venture with EnCana Corporation (EnCana), which closed January 3, 2007. For additional information about the EnCana transaction, see Note 31 Joint Venture with EnCana Corporation, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Our cash flows from operating activities increased in each of the annual periods from 2004 through 2006. Favorable market conditions played a significant role in the upward trend of our cash flows from operating activities. In addition, cash flows in 2006 benefited from the inclusion of the operating activity of Burlington Resources beginning in the second quarter of 2006. Absent any unusual event during 2007, we expect market conditions will again be the most important factor affecting our 2007 operating cash flows. Significant Sources of Capital Operating Activities During 2006, cash of $21,516 million was provided by operating activities, a 22 percent increase over cash from operations of $17,628 million in 2005. This increase reflects higher worldwide crude oil prices and U.S. refining margins, higher distributions from equity affiliates, and the impact of the Burlington Resources acquisition, partially offset by higher interest payments. 71 During 2005, cash flow from operations increased $5,669 million to $17,628 million. The improvement, compared with 2004, primarily resulted from higher crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices, as well as improved worldwide refining margins. While the stability of our cash flows from operating activities benefits from geographic diversity and the effects of upstream and downstream integration, our short and long term operating cash flows are highly dependent upon prices for crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids, as well as refining and marketing margins. During 2005 and 2006, we benefited from favorable crude oil and natural gas prices, as well as refining margins. The sustainability of these prices and margins is driven by market conditions over which we have no control. Absent other mitigating factors, as these prices and margins fluctuate, we would expect a corresponding change in our operating cash flows. The level of our production volumes of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids also impacts our cash flows. These production levels are impacted by such factors as acquisitions and dispositions of fields, field production decline rates, new technologies, operating efficiency, weather conditions, the addition of proved reserves through exploratory success, and the timely and cost effective development of those proved reserves. While we actively manage these factors that affect production, they cause certain variability in cash flows, although historically this variability has not been as significant as that experienced with commodity prices and refining margins. After adjusting our 2003 production for assets sold in 2003 and early 2004, our BOE production has increased in each of the past three years, driven primarily by acquisitions, including our increased ownership interest in LUKOIL over 2005 and 2006, and the acquisition of Burlington Resources in 2006. Going forward, based on our 2006 production level of 2.34 million BOE per day, we expect our annual production growth to average in the range of 2 percent to 4 percent over the five year period ending in 2011. These projections are tied to projects currently scheduled to begin production or ramp up in those years, include our equity share of LUKOIL, and exclude our Canadian Syncrude mining operations. To maintain or grow our production volumes, we must continue to add to our proved reserve base. Our reserve replacement over the three year period ending December 31, 2006, was 254 percent. The purchase of reserves in place was a significant reason for our successful replacement of reserves over the past three years. These purchases included the acquisition of Burlington Resources in 2006 and the reentry into Libya in late 2005, as well as proved reserves added through our investments in LUKOIL. We are developing and pursuing projects we anticipate will allow us to add to our reserve base going forward. However, access to additional resources has become increasingly difficult as direct investment is prohibited in some nations, while fiscal and other terms in other countries can make projects uneconomic or unattractive. In addition, political instability, competition from national oil companies, and lack of access to high potential areas due to environmental or other regulation may negatively impact our ability to increase our reserve base. As such, the timing and level at which we add to our reserve base may, or may not, allow us to replace our production over subsequent years. As discussed in Critical Accounting Policies, engineering estimates of proved reserves are imprecise, and therefore, each year reserves may be revised upward or downward due to the impact of changes in oil and gas prices or as more technical data becomes available on the reservoirs. In 2006 and 2004, revisions decreased our reserves, while in 2005, revisions increased reserves. It is not possible to reliably predict how revisions will impact reserve quantities in the future. See the Capital Spending section for analysis of proved undeveloped reserves. In addition, the level and quality of output from our refineries impacts our cash flows. The output at our refineries is impacted by such factors as operating efficiency, maintenance turnarounds, feedstock availability and weather conditions. We actively manage the operations of our refineries and typically any 72 variability in their operations has not been as significant to cash flows as that experienced with refining margins. Asset Sales Proceeds from asset sales in 2006 were $545 million, compared with $768 million in 2005. We announced in April 2006 an asset rationalization program to dispose of assets that no longer fit into our strategic plans or those that could bring more value by being monetized in the near term. We expect the program to result in proceeds from asset dispositions of $3 billion to $4 billion. Through January 31, 2007, proceeds from asset sales under this program were approximately $1.5 billion. In December 2006, we announced a program to dispose of our U.S. company owned retail marketing outlets to new or existing wholesale marketers. Commercial Paper and Credit Facilities At December 31, 2006, we had two revolving credit facilities totaling $5 billion that expire in October 2011. Also, we have a $2.5 billion revolving credit facility that expires in April 2011, for which we recently requested an extension of one year in accordance with the terms of the facility. These facilities may be used as direct bank borrowings, as support for the ConocoPhillips $7.5 billion commercial paper program, as support for the ConocoPhillips Qatar Funding Ltd. $1.5 billion commercial paper program, or as support for issuances of letters of credit totaling up to $750 million. The facilities are broadly syndicated among financial institutions and do not contain any material adverse change provisions or any covenants requiring maintenance of specified financial ratios or ratings. The credit agreements contain a cross default provision relating to the failure to pay principal or interest on other debt obligations of $200 million or more by ourselves, or by any of our consolidated subsidiaries. Our primary funding source for short term working capital needs is the ConocoPhillips $7.5 billion commercial paper program, a portion of which may be denominated in other currencies (limited to euro 3 billion equivalent). Commercial paper maturities are generally limited to 90 days. The ConocoPhillips Qatar Funding Ltd. $1.5 billion commercial paper program is used to fund commitments relating to the Qatargas 3 project. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, we had no outstanding borrowings under the credit facilities, but $41 million and $62 million, respectively, in letters of credit had been issued. Under both commercial paper programs, there was $2,931 million of commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2006, compared with $32 million at December 31, 2005. The commercial paper increase resulted from efforts to reduce the bridge facilities used for the acquisition of Burlington Resources discussed below. Since we had $2,931 million of commercial paper outstanding and had issued $41 million of letters of credit, we had access to $4.5 billion in borrowing capacity under the three revolving credit facilities at December 31, 2006. At December 31, 2006, Moodys Investor Service had a rating of A1 on our senior long term debt; and Standard and Poors Rating Service and Fitch had ratings of A . We do not have any ratings triggers on any of our corporate debt that would cause an automatic event of default in the event of a downgrade of our credit rating and thereby impact our access to liquidity. In the event that our credit rating deteriorated to a level that would prohibit us from accessing the commercial paper market, we would still be able to access funds under our $7.5 billion revolving credit facilities. Financing the Burlington Resources Inc. Acquisition On March 31, 2006, we completed our acquisition of Burlington Resources Inc. by issuing approximately 270.4 million of our common shares, 32.1 million of which were issued from treasury shares, and paying approximately $17.5 billion in cash. We acquired $3.2 billion in cash and assumed $4.3 billion of debt from Burlington Resources in the acquisition. The cash payment was made through borrowings from two $7.5 billion bridge facilities, combined with $2.2 billion from cash balances and the issuance of 73 $300 million in commercial paper. The bridge facilities were both 364 day loan facilities with pricing and terms similar to our existing revolving credit facilities. In April 2006, we entered into and funded a $5 billion five year term loan, closed on the previously mentioned $2.5 billion five year revolving credit facility, increased the ConocoPhillips commercial paper program to $7.5 billion, and issued $3 billion of debt securities. The term loan and new credit facility were broadly syndicated among financial institutions, with terms and pricing provisions similar to our two other existing revolving credit facilities. The proceeds from the term loan, debt securities and issuances of commercial paper, together with our cash balances and cash provided by operations, allowed us to repay the $15 billion bridge facilities during the second and third quarters of 2006. The $3 billion of debt securities were issued under a new shelf registration statement filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in early April 2006 allowing for the issuance of various types of debt and equity securities. Of this issuance, $1 billion of Floating Rate Notes due April 11, 2007, were issued by ConocoPhillips, and $1.25 billion of Floating Rate Notes due April 9, 2009, and $750 million of 5.50% Notes due 2013 were issued by ConocoPhillips Australia Funding Company, a wholly owned subsidiary. ConocoPhillips and ConocoPhillips Company guarantee the obligations of ConocoPhillips Australia Funding Company. In October 2006, we filed a post effective amendment to this registration statement to terminate the offering of securities under the registration statement. Shelf Registrations In mid April 2006, we filed a universal shelf registration statement with the SEC, under which we, as a well known seasoned issuer, have the ability to issue and sell an indeterminate amount of various types of debt and equity securities. In October 2006, we filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC under which ConocoPhillips Canada Funding Company I and ConocoPhillips Canada Funding Company II, both wholly owned subsidiaries, could issue an indeterminate amount of senior debt securities, fully and unconditionally guaranteed by ConocoPhillips and ConocoPhillips Company. See the Capital Requirements section below for additional information on the issuance of debt securities under this registration statement. Minority Interests At December 31, 2006, we had outstanding $1,202 million of equity in less than wholly owned consolidated subsidiaries held by minority interest owners, including a minority interest of $508 million in Ashford Energy Capital S.A. The remaining minority interest amounts are primarily related to operating joint ventures we control. The largest of these, $672 million, was related to the Darwin LNG project located in northern Australia. In December 2001, in order to raise funds for general corporate purposes, ConocoPhillips and Cold Spring Finance S.a.r.l. (Cold Spring) formed Ashford Energy Capital S.A. through the contribution of a $1 billion ConocoPhillips subsidiary promissory note and $500 million cash by Cold Spring. Through its initial $500 million investment, Cold Spring is entitled to a cumulative annual preferred return based on three month LIBOR rates, plus 1.32 percent. The preferred return at December 31, 2006, was 6.69 percent. In 2008, and at each 10 year anniversary thereafter, Cold Spring may elect to remarket their investment in Ashford, and if unsuccessful, could require ConocoPhillips to provide a letter of credit in support of Cold Springs investment, or in the event that such letter of credit is not provided, then cause the redemption of their investment in Ashford. Should ConocoPhillips credit rating fall below investment grade on a redemption date, Ashford would require a letter of credit to support $475 million of the term loans, as of December 31, 2006, made by Ashford to other ConocoPhillips subsidiaries. If the letter of credit is not obtained within 60 days, Cold Spring could cause Ashford to sell the ConocoPhillips subsidiary notes. At December 31, 2006, Ashford held $1.9 billion of ConocoPhillips subsidiary notes and $29 million in investments unrelated to ConocoPhillips. We report Cold Springs investment as a minority interest 74 because it is not mandatorily redeemable and the entity does not have a specified liquidation date. Other than the obligation to make payment on the subsidiary notes described above, Cold Spring does not have recourse to our general credit. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As part of our normal ongoing business operations and consistent with normal industry practice, we enter into numerous agreements with other parties to pursue business opportunities, which share costs and apportion risks among the parties as governed by the agreements. At December 31, 2006, we were liable for certain contingent obligations under the following contractual arrangements: Qatargas 3: Qatargas 3 is an integrated project to produce and liquefy natural gas from Qatars North field. We own a 30 percent interest in the project. The other participants in the project are affiliates of Qatar Petroleum (68.5 percent) and Mitsui & Co., Ltd. (Mitsui) (1.5 percent). Our interest is held through a jointly owned company, Qatar Liquefied Gas Company Limited (3), for which we use the equity method of accounting. Qatargas 3 secured project financing of $4 billion in December 2005, consisting of $1.3 billion of loans from export credit agencies (ECA), $1.5 billion from commercial banks, and $1.2 billion from ConocoPhillips. The ConocoPhillips loan facilities have substantially the same terms as the ECA and commercial bank facilities. Prior to project completion certification, all loans, including the ConocoPhillips loan facilities, are guaranteed by the participants, based on their respective ownership interests. Accordingly, our maximum exposure to this financing structure is $1.2 billion. Upon completion certification, which is expected to be December 31, 2009, all project loan facilities, including the ConocoPhillips loan facilities, will become non recourse to the project participants. At December 31, 2006, Qatargas 3 had $1.2 billion outstanding under all the loan facilities, of which ConocoPhillips provided $371 million, including accrued interest. Rockies Express Pipeline LLC: In June 2006, we issued a guarantee for 24 percent of the $2.0 billion in credit facilities of Rockies Express Pipeline LLC (Rockies Express), which will be used to construct a natural gas pipeline across a portion of the United States. The maximum potential amount of future payments to third party lenders under the guarantee is estimated to be $480 million, which could become payable if the credit facility is fully utilized and Rockies Express fails to meet its obligations under the credit agreement. It is anticipated that construction completion will be achieved mid 2009, and refinancing will take place at that time, making the debt non recourse. For additional information, see Note 7 Variable Interest Entities (VIEs), in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Other: At December 31, 2006, we had guarantees outstanding for our portion of joint venture debt obligations, which have terms of up to 18 years. The maximum potential amount of future payments under the guarantees was approximately $140 million. Payment would be required if a joint venture defaults on its debt obligations. For additional information about guarantees, see Note 17 Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which is incorporated herein by reference. Capital Requirements For information about the financing of the Burlington Resources acquisition or our capital expenditures and investments, see the Significant Sources of Capital section and the Capital Spending section, respectively. 75 Our debt balance at December 31, 2006, was $27.1 billion, an increase of approximately $14.6 billion during 2006. The increase reflects debt issuances of $15.3 billion during the first quarter of 2006 related to the acquisition of Burlington Resources. In addition, we assumed $4.3 billion of Burlington Resources debt, including the recognition of an increase of $406 million to record the debt at its fair value. In May 2006, we redeemed our $240 million 7.625% Notes upon their maturity. We also redeemed our $129 million 6.60% Notes due in 2007 (part of the debt assumed in the Burlington Resources acquisition), at a premium of $4 million, plus accrued interest. In October 2006, we redeemed our $1.25 billion 5.45% Notes upon their maturity. In addition, we redeemed our $500 million 5.60% Notes due December 2006, and our $350 million 5.70% Notes due March 2007 (both issues were a part of the debt assumed in the Burlington Resources acquisition), at a premium of $1 million, plus accrued interest. In order to finance the maturity and call of the above notes, ConocoPhillips Canada Funding Company I, a wholly owned subsidiary, issued $1.25 billion of 5.625% Notes due 2016, and ConocoPhillips Canada Funding Company II, a wholly owned subsidiary, issued $500 million of 5.95% Notes due 2036, and $350 million of 5.30% Notes due 2012. ConocoPhillips and ConocoPhillips Company guarantee the obligations of ConocoPhillips Canada Funding Company I and ConocoPhillips Canada Funding Company II. In December 2006, we terminated the lease of certain refining assets, which we consolidated due to our designation as the primary beneficiary of the lease entity. As part of the termination, we exercised a purchase option of the assets totaling $111 million and retired the related debt obligations of $104 million 5.847% Notes due 2006. An associated interest swap was also liquidated. During 2005, we announced three stock repurchase programs, which provided for the purchase of up to $3 billion of the companys common stock over a period of up to two years. Acquisitions for the share repurchase programs are made at managements discretion at prevailing prices, subject to market conditions and other factors. Purchases may be increased, decreased or discontinued at any time without prior notice. Shares of stock purchased under the programs are held as treasury shares. During 2006, we purchased 15.1 million shares at a cost of $964 million under the programs, including 542,000 shares at a cost of $39 million from a consolidated Burlington Resources grantor trust. On January 12, 2007, we announced a fourth $1 billion stock repurchase program under like terms as the other three programs. Through January 31, 2007, under the four programs, we had purchased a total of 50.5 million shares, at a cost of $3.1 billion. On February 9, 2007, we announced plans to purchase $4 billion of our common stock in 2007, including the $1 billion announced on January 12, 2007. We expect to purchase $1 billion in the first quarter of 2007. In December 2005, we entered into a credit agreement with Qatargas 3, whereby we will provide loan financing of approximately $1.2 billion for the construction of an LNG train in Qatar. This financing will represent 30 percent of the projects total debt financing. Through December 31, 2006, we had provided $371 million in loan financing, including accrued interest. See the Off Balance Sheet Arrangements section for additional information on Qatargas 3. In 2004, we finalized our transaction with Freeport LNG Development, L.P. (Freeport LNG) to participate in a proposed LNG receiving terminal in Quintana, Texas. Construction began in early 2005. We do not have an ownership interest in the facility, but we do have a 50 percent interest in the general partnership managing the venture, along with contractual rights to regasification capacity of the terminal. We entered into a credit agreement with Freeport LNG, whereby we will provide loan financing of approximately $630 million for the construction of the facility. Through December 31, 2006, we had provided $520 million in loan financing, including accrued interest. 76 In the fall of 2004, ConocoPhillips and LUKOIL agreed to the expansion of the Varandey terminal as part of our investment in the OOO Naryanmarneftegaz (NMNG) joint venture. Production from the NMNG joint venture fields is transported via pipeline to LUKOILs existing terminal at Varandey Bay on the Barents Sea and then shipped via tanker to international markets. LUKOIL intends to complete an expansion of the terminals oil throughput capacity from 30,000 barrels per day to 240,000 barrels per day, with ConocoPhillips participating in the design and financing of the terminal expansion. We have an obligation to provide loan financing to Varandey Terminal Company for 30 percent of the costs of the terminal expansion, but we will have no governance or ownership interest in the terminal. We estimate our total loan obligation for the terminal expansion to be approximately $460 million at current exchange rates, including interest to be accrued during construction. This amount will be adjusted as the projects cost estimate and schedule are updated and the ruble exchange rate fluctuates. Through December 31, 2006, we had provided $203 million in loan financing, including accrued interest. Our loans to Qatargas 3, Freeport LNG and Varandey Terminal Company are included in the Loans and advances related parties line on the balance sheet. On January 3, 2007, we closed on the previously announced business venture with EnCana. As part of this transaction, we expect to contribute $7.5 billion, plus accrued interest, over a ten year period, beginning in 2007, to the upstream joint venture formed as a result of the transaction. An initial contribution of $188 million was made upon closing in January. The remaining $7.3 billion contribution obligation will be reflected as a liability on our first quarter 2007 consolidated balance sheet. Principal and interest payments of $237 million will be made each quarter, beginning in the second quarter of 2007, and continuing until the balance is paid. The principal portion of these payments will be presented on our consolidated statement of cash flows as a financing activity. Interest accrues at a rate of 5.3 percent on the unpaid principal balance. For additional information about this business venture, see Note 31 Joint Venture with EnCana Corporation, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Effective January 15, 2007, we redeemed the 8% Junior Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures due 2037, at a premium of $14 million, plus accrued interest. This redemption resulted in the immediate redemption by Phillips 66 Capital II of $350 million of 8% Capital Securities. See Note 15 Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. Also, in January 2007, we redeemed our $153 million 7.25% Notes upon their maturity, and in February 2007, we reduced our Floating Rate Five Year Term Note due 2011 from $5 billion to $4 billion. Based on prevailing commodity price levels in early 2007, we anticipate reducing debt approximately $4 billion during 2007. In February 2007, we announced a quarterly dividend of 41 cents per share, representing a 14 percent increase over the previous quarters dividend of 36 cents per share. The dividend is payable March 1, 2007, to stockholders of record at the close of business February 20, 2007. In 2007, we anticipate our cash from operations will fund our capital and dividend programs, with excess cash being used for share repurchases and debt reduction. 77 Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our aggregate contractual fixed and variable obligations as of December 31, 2006: Millions of Dollars Payments Due by Period Total Up to 1 Year Year 2 3 Year 4 5 After 5 Years Debt obligations (a) $ 27,090 1,598 1,685 12,640 11,167 Capital lease obligations 44 10 34 Total debt 27,134 1,608 1,719 12,640 11,167 Interest on debt 16,692 1,594 3,043 2,704 9,351 Operating lease obligations 3,041 584 931 530 996 Purchase obligations (b) 93,025 35,494 7,701 5,260 44,570 Other long term liabilities (c) Asset retirement obligations 5,402 576 404 390 4,032 Accrued environmental costs 1,062 270 262 119 411 Total $ 146,356 40,126 14,060 21,643 70,527 (a) Includes $718 million of net unamortized premiums and discounts.

During the three year period, 58 percent of total spending went to our E&P segment. In addition to our capital expenditures and investments spending during 2006, we also provided loans of approximately $800 million to certain affiliated companies. Our capital expenditures and investments budget for 2007 is $12.3 billion. Included in this amount is approximately $500 million in capitalized interest. We plan to direct 82 percent of the capital expenditures and investments budget to E&P and 14 percent to R&M. With the addition of loans to certain affiliated companies; and contributions, including applicable accrued interest, related to funding our portion of the EnCana transaction; our total capital program for 2007 is approximately $13.5 billion. See the Capital Requirements section, as well as Note 10 Investments, Loans and Long Term Receivables and Note 31 Joint Venture with EnCana Corporation, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. 79 E&P Capital spending for E&P during the three year period ending December 31, 2006, totaled $21.4 billion. The expenditures over the three year period supported several key exploration and development projects including: The West Sak and Alpine projects, and drilling of satellite field prospects in Alaska. The Magnolia development in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. The acquisition of limited term, fixed volume overriding royalty interests in Utah and the San Juan Basin related to our natural gas production. Expansion of the Syncrude oil sands project and development of the Surmont heavy oil project in Canada. Development of the Corocoro field offshore Venezuela. The Ekofisk Area growth project and Alvheim project in the Norwegian North Sea. The Britannia satellite and Clair developments in the U.K. North Sea and Atlantic Margin, respectively. The Kashagan field and satellite prospects in the Caspian Sea, offshore Kazakhstan, including acquiring additional ownership interest. The acquisition of an interest in OOO Naryanmarneftegaz (NMNG), a joint venture with LUKOIL, and development of the Yuzhno Khylchuyu (YK) field. The Bayu Undan gas recycle and liquefied natural gas development projects in the Timor Sea and northern Australia, respectively. The Belanak, Suban, Kerisi, Hiu, Pangkah and Belut projects in Indonesia. The Peng Lai 19 3 development in Chinas Bohai Bay and additional Bohai Bay appraisal and satellite field prospects. Expenditures related to the terms under which we returned to our former oil and natural gas production operations in the Waha concessions in Libya. Capital expenditures for construction of our Endeavour Class tankers, as well as for an upgrade to the Trans Alaska Pipeline System pump stations were also included in the E&P segment. UNITED STATES Alaska During the three year period ending December 31, 2006, we made capital expenditures for development drilling in the Greater Kuparuk Area, the Greater Prudhoe Area, the Alpine field, including Alpines first satellite fields Nanuq and Fiord, and the West Sak development. The Nanuq and Fiord fields began production in 2006. Also during this three year period, we completed both Phase I and Phase II of the Alpine Capacity Expansion project. In addition, we participated in exploratory drilling on the North Slope, including the Qannik discovery in 2006 the third Alpine satellite field, and acquired additional acreage. We also made capital expenditures for construction of double hulled Endeavour Class tankers for use in transporting Alaskan crude oil to the U.S. West Coast and Hawaii. The fifth and final Endeavour Class tanker began Alaska North Slope service in February 2007. During 2004, we and our co venturers in the Trans Alaska Pipeline System began a project to upgrade the pipelines pump stations. A phased startup of the project began in the first quarter of 2007. Lower 48 States In the Lower 48, we continued to develop our acreage positions in south Texas, the San Juan Basin, the Permian Basin, the Texas Panhandle, and in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Onshore we focused on 80 natural gas developments in the San Juan Basin of New Mexico, the Lobo Trend of South Texas, the Bossier Trend of East Texas, the Barnett Shale Trend of North Texas, and the Permian Basin of West Texas. Offshore, we expended funds for the development of the Magnolia, Ursa and K 2 fields in the deepwater of the Gulf of Mexico. CANADA In Canada, we continued with development of the Surmont heavy oil project, where initial production is expected in the first half of 2007. Over the life of this 30 plus year project, we anticipate approximately 500 production and steam injection well pairs will be drilled. We also continued with development of the Syncrude Stage III expansion mining project in the Canadian province of Alberta, where an upgrader expansion project was completed and became fully operational in 2006. In addition, capital expenditures were made on the development of our conventional crude oil and natural gas reserves in western Canada, as well as to progress the Parsons Lake/Mackenzie gas project. SOUTH AMERICA In the Gulf of Paria, off the coast of Venezuela, funds were expended to construct a floating storage and offloading (FSO) vessel and to construct and install a wellhead platform in the Corocoro field. Development drilling began on the Corocoro project in the second quarter of 2006. Arrival of the FSO and completion of pipelines and the FSO mooring is planned for the first quarter of 2007. Field production is expected to commence in the third quarter of 2008 upon installation of the central processing platform. EUROPE In the U.K. and Norwegian sectors of the North Sea, funds were invested during the three year period ending December 31, 2006, for development of the Ekofisk Area growth project, where production began in the fourth quarter of 2005; the U.K. Clair field, where production began in early 2005; the Britannia satellite fields, Callanish and Brodgar, where production is expected in 2008; and the Alvheim development project, where production is scheduled to begin in 2007. In September 2006, we announced the Jasmine discovery, a new gas and condensate field in the U.K. sector of the North Sea. Results from the discovery are being evaluated to determine the plan for appraisal drilling and development. AFRICA AND MIDDLE EAST In late December 2005, we announced, in conjunction with our co venturers, an agreement with the Libyan National Oil Corporation on the terms under which we would return to our former crude oil and natural gas production operations in the Waha concessions in Libya. As a part of that agreement, we made a payment of $520 million in January 2006 for the acquisition of an ownership interest in, and extension of, the concessions. In December 2006, approximately $200 million was paid for unamortized investments made since 1986, agreed to be paid as part of the 1986 standstill agreement to hold assets in escrow for the U.S. based co venturers. In Nigeria, we made capital expenditures for the ongoing development of onshore oil and natural gas fields, and for ongoing exploration activities both onshore and on deepwater leases. Funding was also 81 provided for our share of the basic phase of the Brass LNG project for the front end engineering and design and related activities to move the project to a final investment decision. RUSSIA AND CASPIAN Russia In June 2005, we acquired a 30 percent economic interest and a 50 percent governance interest in NMNG, a joint venture with LUKOIL to explore for and develop oil and gas resources in the northern part of Russias Timan Pechora province, including development of the YK field. Caspian During the three year period ending December 31, 2006, we invested funds to explore and develop the Kashagan field on the Kazakhstan shelf in the Caspian Sea. Construction activities to develop the field began in 2004. In 2005, we also expended funds to increase our ownership interest from 8.33 percent to 9.26 percent. ASIA PACIFIC Timor Sea and Australia In the Timor Sea and Australia, we invested funds for development activities associated with Phase I and Phase II of the Bayu Undan natural gas project, including the development of an onshore LNG facility near Darwin, Australia. Production of liquids began from Phase I in February of 2004, and development drilling concluded at the end of March 2005. In 2006, the LNG facility was completed and began full operation. Indonesia In Indonesia, funds were used for the completion of the Belanak and Hiu fields in the South Natuna Sea Block B, including construction of a floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO) vessel and associated gas plant facilities on the FPSO vessel. Oil production began from Belanak in late 2004 and first condensate production and gas exports began in June and October 2005, respectively. Natural gas production began from Hiu in late 2006. Also, in Block B funds were used to continue the development of the Kerisi and Belut fields. In South Sumatra, to prepare for the West Java gas sales agreement signed in August 2004, we continued the development of the Suban Phase II project, which is an expansion of the existing Suban gas plant. China Following approval from the Chinese government in early 2005, we began development of Phase II of the Peng Lai 19 3 oil field, as well as concurrent development of the nearby 25 6 field. The development of Peng Lai 19 3 and Peng Lai 25 6 will include multiple wellhead platforms and a larger FPSO vessel. Offshore installation work associated with the first new wellhead platform (WHP C) was ongoing at year end 2006. Vietnam In Vietnam, we began development of the Su Tu Vang field in Block 15 1 in late 2005, and continued appraisal work at the Su Tu Trang field. Preliminary engineering of the Su Tu Den Northeast development began in 2006. On Block 15 2, we continued further development of our producing Rang Dong field, including developing the central part of the field, where two additional platforms were completed in 2005 and additional production and injection wells were completed in 2005 and 2006. 82 2007 CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND INVESTMENTS BUDGET E&Ps 2007 capital expenditures and investments budget is $10.1 billion, 6 percent higher than actual expenditures in 2006. Thirty seven percent of E&Ps 2007 capital expenditures and investments budget is planned for the United States. We plan to spend $783 million in 2007 for our Alaskan operations. A majority of the capital spending will fund Prudhoe Bay, Greater Kuparuk and Western North Slope operations including the Alpine satellite fields and the West Sak heavy oil field, as well as exploration activities. In the Lower 48, expenditures will focus primarily on developing natural gas reserves within core areas, including the San Juan Basin of New Mexico, the Lobo Trend of South Texas, the Bossier Trend of East Texas, the Barnett Shale Trend of North Texas, and the Permian Basin of West Texas; and new project developments such as the Piceance Basin in northwest Colorado. Offshore capital will be focused mainly on the Ursa development. E&P is directing $6.4 billion of its 2007 capital expenditures and investments budget to international projects. Funds in 2007 will be directed to developing major long term projects, including the Kashagan project in the Caspian Sea and the YK field in northern Russia, through the NMNG joint venture with LUKOIL; the Britannia satellites, the Ekofisk Area, and the Alvheim and Statfjord fields in the North Sea; the Bohai Bay project in China; heavy oil and the Parsons Lake/Mackenzie gas projects in Canada, as well as western Canada natural gas projects; the Belanak, Kerisi, Hiu, Belut, Pangkah, and Suban Phase II projects in Indonesia; fields offshore Malaysia and Vietnam; the Corocoro project in Venezuela; and the Waha concessions in Libya. PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES The net addition of proved undeveloped reserves accounted for 37 percent, 44 percent and 38 percent of our total net additions in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. During these years, we converted, on average, 18 percent per year of our proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves. Of our 2,976 million total BOE proved undeveloped reserves at December 31, 2006, we estimated that the average annual conversion rate for these reserves for the three year period ending 2009 will be approximately 20 percent. Costs incurred for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, relating to the development of proved undeveloped oil and gas reserves were $6.4 billion, $3.4 billion, and $2.4 billion, respectively. Although it cannot be assured, estimated future development costs relating to the development of proved undeveloped reserves for the years 2007 through 2009 are projected to be $3.2 billion, $2.8 billion, and $2.4 billion, respectively. Approximately 75 percent of our proved undeveloped reserves at year end 2006 were associated with nine major development areas and our investment in LUKOIL. Seven of the major development areas are currently producing and are expected to have proved reserves convert from undeveloped to developed over time as development activities continue and or production facilities are expanded or upgraded, and include: The Hamaca and Petrozuata heavy oil projects in Venezuela. The Ekofisk field in the North Sea. The Peng Lai 19 3 field in China. Fields in the United States and Canada associated with the Burlington Resources acquisition. 83 The remaining two major projects, Qatargas 3 in Qatar and the Kashagan field in Kazakhstan, will have undeveloped proved reserves convert to developed as these projects begin production. Midstream Capital spending for Midstream during the three year period ending December 31, 2006, was primarily related to increasing our ownership interest in DCP Midstream in 2005 from 30.3 percent to 50 percent. R&M Capital spending for R&M during the three year period ending December 31, 2006, was primarily for acquiring additional crude oil refining capacity, clean fuels projects to meet new environmental standards, refinery upgrade projects to improve product yields, the operating integrity of key processing units, as well as for safety projects. During this three year period, R&M capital spending was $6.1 billion, representing 17 percent of our total capital expenditures and investments. Key projects during the three year period included: Acquisition of the Wilhelmshaven refinery in Germany. A sulfur removal technology (S Zorb SRT) unit at the Lake Charles refinery. A fluid catalytic cracking gasoline hydrotreater at the Alliance refinery. Integration of a crude unit and coker adjacent to our Wood River refinery. A hydrotreater at the Rodeo facility of our San Francisco refinery. Expansion of existing hydrotreaters for both low sulfur gasoline and ultra low sulfur diesel, with the addition of a new hydrogen plant at the Bayway refinery. A new ultra low sulfur diesel hydrotreater at the Sweeny refinery. A new ultra low sulfur diesel hydrotreater and hydrogen plant at the Billings refinery. Revamp of an existing hydrotreater for ultra low sulfur diesel and a new hydrogen plant at the Wood River refinery. A new hydrotreater for ultra low sulfur diesel and a hydrogen plant at the Ponca City refinery. Revamps of existing hydrotreaters for ultra low sulfur diesel at the Los Angeles, Trainer and Ferndale refineries. Major construction activities in progress include: A new vacuum unit, coker and revamps of heavy oil and distillate hydrotreaters at the Borger refinery. A new S Zorb SRT unit at the Wood River refinery. Development of an additional coker at the Wood River refinery. U.S. programs aimed at air emission reductions. Internationally, we continued to invest in our ongoing refining and marketing operations to upgrade and increase the profitability of our existing assets, including a replacement reformer at our Humber refinery in the United Kingdom. The 2006 acquisition of the Wilhelmshaven refinery added 260,000 barrels per day to our crude oil refining capacity. 2007 CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND INVESTMENTS BUDGET R&Ms 2007 capital budget is $1.7 billion, a 42 percent decrease from actual spending in 2006, reflecting the 2006 acquisition of the Wilhelmshaven refinery in Germany. Domestic spending in 2007 is expected to comprise 73 percent of the R&M budget. We plan to direct about $1.1 billion of the R&M capital budget to domestic refining, primarily for projects 84 related to sustaining and improving the existing business with a focus on reliability, energy efficiency, capital maintenance and regulatory compliance. Work will continue on projects to increase crude oil capacity, expand conversion capability and increase clean product yield. Our U.S. marketing and transportation businesses are expected to spend about $150 million. Internationally, we plan to spend $471 million, with a focus on projects related to reliability, safety and the environment, as well as the advancement of a full conversion refinery project in Yanbu, Saudi Arabia. Other international refinery projects remain under study. LUKOIL Investment Capital spending in our LUKOIL Investment segment during the three year period ending December 31, 2006, was for our initial purchase of an ownership interest in LUKOIL and continued purchases to increase our ownership interest. No additional purchases are expected in 2007. Emerging Businesses Capital spending for Emerging Businesses during the three year period ending December 31, 2006, was primarily for construction of the Immingham combined heat and power cogeneration plant near the companys Humber refinery in the United Kingdom. The plant began commercial operations in October 2004. Planned spending in 2007 is primarily for an expansion of the Immingham plant. Contingencies Legal and Tax Matters We accrue for contingencies when a loss is probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated. Based on currently available information, we believe that it is remote that future costs related to known contingent liability exposures will exceed current accruals by an amount that would have a material adverse impact on our financial statements. Environmental We are subject to numerous international, federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations, as are other companies in the petroleum exploration and production, refining, and crude oil and refined product marketing and transportation businesses. The most significant of these environmental laws and regulations include, among others, the: Federal Clean Air Act, which governs air emissions. Federal Clean Water Act, which governs discharges to water bodies. Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), which imposes liability on generators, transporters, and arrangers of hazardous substances at sites where hazardous substance releases have occurred or are threatened to occur. Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), which governs the treatment, storage, and disposal of solid waste. Federal Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA90), under which owners and operators of onshore facilities and pipelines, lessees or permittees of an area in which an offshore facility is located, and owners and operators of vessels are liable for removal costs and damages that result from a discharge of oil into navigable waters of the United States. 85 Federal Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act (EPCRA), which requires facilities to report toxic chemical inventories with local emergency planning committees and responses departments. Federal Safe Drinking Water Act, which governs the disposal of wastewater in underground injection wells. U.S. Department of the Interior regulations, which relate to offshore oil and gas operations in U.S. waters and impose liability for the cost of pollution cleanup resulting from operations, as well as potential liability for pollution damages. These laws and their implementing regulations set limits on emissions and, in the case of discharges to water, establish water quality limits. They also, in most cases, require permits in association with new or modified operations. These permits can require an applicant to collect substantial information in connection with the application process, which can be expensive and time consuming. In addition, there can be delays associated with notice and comment periods and the agencys processing of the application. Many of the delays associated with the permitting process are beyond the control of the applicant. Many states and foreign countries where we operate also have, or are developing, similar environmental laws and regulations governing these same types of activities. While similar, in some cases these regulations may impose additional, or more stringent, requirements that can add to the cost and difficulty of marketing or transporting products across state and international borders. The ultimate financial impact arising from environmental laws and regulations is neither clearly known nor easily determinable as new standards, such as air emission standards, water quality standards and stricter fuel regulations, continue to evolve. However, environmental laws and regulations, including those that may arise to address concerns about global climate change, are expected to continue to have an increasing impact on our operations in the United States and in other countries in which we operate. Notable areas of potential impacts include air emission compliance and remediation obligations in the United States. For example, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulation on sulfur content in highway diesel became effective in June 2006 with ConocoPhillips refineries producing ultra low sulfur diesel on schedule. The sulfur content regulation for non road diesel, as promulgated in June 2004, further lowers the sulfur content of non road diesel fuel beginning in June 2007. Capital strategy and market integration plans have incorporated this sulfur content step down to ensure ongoing integrated compliance of our diesel fuel for the highway and non road markets. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 imposed obligations to provide increasing volumes on a percentage basis of renewable fuels in transportation motor fuels through 2012. Implementing regulations are currently being developed by the EPA to identify individual company utilization and compliance procedures needed to meet these obligations. We are in the process of establishing implementation, operating and capital strategies to meet the projected requirements. In addition, we are investigating innovative technologies for the production of biofuels that may facilitate compliance. Since 1997 when an international conference on global warming concluded an agreement known as the Kyoto Protocol which called for reductions of certain emissions that contribute to increases in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations, there have been a range of national, sub national and international regulations proposed or implemented focusing on greenhouse gas reduction. These actual or proposed regulations do or will apply in countries where we have interests or may have interests in the future. Regulation in this field continues to evolve and while it is likely to be increasingly widespread and stringent, at this stage it is not possible to accurately estimate either a timetable for implementation or our future compliance costs. A recent example of such proposed regulation is Californias Assembly Bill 32, which requires the California Air Resources Board (CARB) to develop regulations and market 86 mechanisms that will ultimately reduce Californias greenhouse gas emissions by 25 percent by 2020. The overall long term fiscal impact from this type of regulation is uncertain. We also are subject to certain laws and regulations relating to environmental remediation obligations associated with current and past operations. Such laws and regulations include CERCLA and RCRA and their state equivalents. Remediation obligations include cleanup responsibility arising from petroleum releases from underground storage tanks located at numerous past and present ConocoPhillips owned and or operated petroleum marketing outlets throughout the United States. Federal and state laws require that contamination caused by such underground storage tank releases be assessed and remediated to meet applicable standards. In addition to other cleanup standards, many states adopted cleanup criteria for methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) for both soil and groundwater. MTBE standards continue to evolve, and future environmental expenditures associated with the remediation of MTBE contaminated underground storage tank sites could be substantial. At RCRA permitted facilities, we are required to assess environmental conditions. If conditions warrant, we may be required to remediate contamination caused by prior operations. In contrast to CERCLA, which is often referred to as Superfund, the cost of corrective action activities under RCRA corrective action programs typically is borne solely by us. Over the next decade, we anticipate that significant ongoing expenditures for RCRA remediation activities may be required, but such annual expenditures for the near term are not expected to vary significantly from the range of such expenditures we have experienced over the past few years. Longer term expenditures are subject to considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly. We, from time to time, receive requests for information or notices of potential liability from the EPA and state environmental agencies alleging that we are a potentially responsible party under CERCLA or an equivalent state statute. On occasion, we also have been made a party to cost recovery litigation by those agencies or by private parties. These requests, notices and lawsuits assert potential liability for remediation costs at various sites that typically are not owned by us, but allegedly contain wastes attributable to our past operations. As of December 31, 2005, we reported we had been notified of potential liability under CERCLA and comparable state laws at 66 sites around the United States. At December 31, 2006, we had resolved nine of these sites, had received six new notices of potential liability, and had reopened one site, leaving 64 unresolved sites where we have been notified of potential liability. For most Superfund sites, our potential liability will be significantly less than the total site remediation costs because the percentage of waste attributable to us, versus that attributable to all other potentially responsible parties, is relatively low. Although liability of those potentially responsible is generally joint and several for federal sites and frequently so for state sites, other potentially responsible parties at sites where we are a party typically have had the financial strength to meet their obligations, and where they have not, or where potentially responsible parties could not be located, our share of liability has not increased materially. Many of the sites at which we are potentially responsible are still under investigation by the EPA or the state agencies concerned. Prior to actual cleanup, those potentially responsible normally assess site conditions, apportion responsibility and determine the appropriate remediation. In some instances, we may have no liability or attain a settlement of liability. Actual cleanup costs generally occur after the parties obtain EPA or equivalent state agency approval. There are relatively few sites where we are a major participant, and given the timing and amounts of anticipated expenditures, neither the cost of remediation at those sites nor such costs at all CERCLA sites, in the aggregate, is expected to have a material adverse effect on our competitive or financial condition. Expensed environmental costs were $912 million in 2006 and are expected to be about $967 million in 2007 and $984 million in 2008. Capitalized environmental costs were $1,118 million in 2006 and are expected to be about $945 million and $1,082 million in 2007 and 2008, respectively. 87 We accrue for remediation activities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and reasonable estimates of the liability can be made. These accrued liabilities are not reduced for potential recoveries from insurers or other third parties and are not discounted (except those assumed in a purchase business combination, which we do record on a discounted basis). Many of these liabilities result from CERCLA, RCRA and similar state laws that require us to undertake certain investigative and remedial activities at sites where we conduct, or once conducted, operations or at sites where ConocoPhillips generated waste was disposed. The accrual also includes a number of sites we identified that may require environmental remediation, but which are not currently the subject of CERCLA, RCRA or state enforcement activities. If applicable, we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third party recoveries. In the future, we may incur significant costs under both CERCLA and RCRA. Considerable uncertainty exists with respect to these costs, and under adverse changes in circumstances, potential liability may exceed amounts accrued as of December 31, 2006. Remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site, depending on the mix of unique site characteristics, evolving remediation technologies, diverse regulatory agencies and enforcement policies, and the presence or absence of potentially liable third parties. Therefore, it is difficult to develop reasonable estimates of future site remediation costs. At December 31, 2006, our balance sheet included total accrued environmental costs of $1,062 million, compared with $989 million at December 31, 2005. We expect to incur a substantial majority of these expenditures within the next 30 years. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, and as with other companies engaged in similar businesses, environmental costs and liabilities are inherent in our operations and products, and there can be no assurance that material costs and liabilities will not be incurred. However, we currently do not expect any material adverse effect upon our results of operations or financial position as a result of compliance with environmental laws and regulations. Other We have deferred tax assets related to certain accrued liabilities, loss carryforwards, and credit carryforwards. Valuation allowances have been established for certain foreign operating and domestic capital loss carryforwards that reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that will, more likely than not, be realized. Uncertainties that may affect the realization of these assets include tax law changes and the future level of product prices and costs. Based on our historical taxable income, our expectations for the future, and available tax planning strategies, management expects that the net deferred tax assets will be realized as offsets to reversing deferred tax liabilities and as reductions in future taxable income. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. This Statement defines fair value, establishes a framework for its measurement and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. We use fair value measurements to measure, among other items, purchased assets and investments, leases, derivative contracts and financial guarantees. We also use them to assess impairment of properties, plants and equipment, intangible assets and goodwill. The Statement does not apply to share based payment transactions and inventory pricing. This Statement is effective January 1, 2008. We are currently evaluating the impact on our financial statements. In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48). This Interpretation provides guidance on 88 recognition, classification, and disclosure concerning uncertain tax liabilities. The evaluation of a tax position will require recognition of a tax benefit if it is more likely than not that it will be sustained upon examination. This Interpretation is effective beginning January 1, 2007. We have completed our analysis and concluded the adoption of FIN 48 will not have a material impact on our financial statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans an admendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R) (SFAS No. 158). We adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of this new Statement as of December 31, 2006, and the impact from these changes is reflected in Note 23 Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The requirement in SFAS No. 158 to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of the employers fiscal year end is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2008. The measurement date for our pension plan in the United Kingdom will be changed from September 30 to December 31 in time to comply with the Statements 2008 required implementation date. All other plans are presently measured at December 31 of each year. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to select appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. See Note 1 Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for descriptions of our major accounting policies. Certain of these accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is a reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts would have been reported under different conditions, or if different assumptions had been used. These critical accounting policies are discussed with the Audit and Finance Committee of the Board of Directors at least annually. We believe the following discussions of critical accounting policies, along with the discussions of contingencies and of deferred tax asset valuation allowances in this report, address all important accounting areas where the nature of accounting estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change. Oil and Gas Accounting Accounting for oil and gas exploratory activity is subject to special accounting rules that are unique to the oil and gas industry. The acquisition of geological and geophysical seismic information, prior to the discovery of proved reserves, is expensed as incurred, similar to accounting for research and development costs. However, leasehold acquisition costs and exploratory well costs are capitalized on the balance sheet pending determination of whether proved oil and gas reserves have been discovered on the prospect. Property Acquisition Costs For individually significant leaseholds, management periodically assesses for impairment based on exploration and drilling efforts to date. For leasehold acquisition costs that individually are relatively small, management exercises judgment and determines a percentage probability that the prospect ultimately will fail to find proved oil and gas reserves and pools that leasehold information with others in the geographic area. For prospects in areas that have had limited, or no, previous exploratory drilling, the percentage probability of ultimate failure is normally judged to be quite high. This judgmental percentage is multiplied by the leasehold acquisition cost, and that product is divided by the contractual period of the leasehold to determine a periodic leasehold impairment charge that is reported in exploration expense. This judgmental probability percentage is reassessed and adjusted throughout the contractual period of the leasehold based on favorable or unfavorable exploratory activity on the leasehold or on adjacent leaseholds, and leasehold impairment amortization expense is adjusted prospectively. At year end 2006, 89 the book value of the pools of property acquisition costs, that individually are relatively small and thus subject to the above described periodic leasehold impairment calculation, was $1,313 million and the accumulated impairment reserve was $238 million. The weighted average judgmental percentage probability of ultimate failure was approximately 62 percent and the weighted average amortization period was approximately 3.5 years. If that judgmental percentage were to be raised by 5 percent across all calculations, pretax leasehold impairment expense in 2007 would increase by approximately $19 million. The remaining $3,615 million of capitalized unproved property costs at year end 2006 consisted of individually significant leaseholds, mineral rights held in perpetuity by title ownership, exploratory wells currently drilling, and suspended exploratory wells. Management periodically assesses individually significant leaseholds for impairment based on exploration and drilling efforts to date on the individual prospects. Of this amount, approximately $2 billion is concentrated in ten major assets. Management expects less than $100 million to move to proved properties in 2007. Most of the remaining value is associated with Parsons Lake/Mackenzie, Alaska North Slope and Australia natural gas projects, on which we continue to work with partners and regulatory agencies in order to develop. Exploratory Costs For exploratory wells, drilling costs are temporarily capitalized, or suspended, on the balance sheet, pending a determination of whether potentially economic oil and gas reserves have been discovered by the drilling effort to justify completion of the find as a producing well. Once a determination is made the well did not encounter potentially economic oil and gas quantities, the well costs are expensed as a dry hole and reported in exploration expense. If exploratory wells encounter potentially economic quantities of oil and gas, the well costs remain capitalized on the balance sheet as long as sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made. The accounting notion of sufficient progress is a judgmental area, but the accounting rules do prohibit continued capitalization of suspended well costs on the mere chance that future market conditions will improve or new technologies will be found that would make the projects development economically profitable. Often, the ability to move the project into the development phase and record proved reserves is dependent on obtaining permits and government or co venturer approvals, the timing of which is ultimately beyond our control. Exploratory well costs remain suspended as long as the company is actively pursuing such approvals and permits and believes they will be obtained. Once all required approvals and permits have been obtained, the projects are moved into the development phase and the oil and gas reserves are designated as proved reserves. For complex exploratory discoveries, it is not unusual to have exploratory wells remain suspended on the balance sheet for several years while we perform additional appraisal drilling and seismic work on the potential oil and gas field, or we seek government or co venturer approval of development plans or seek environmental permitting. Management reviews suspended well balances quarterly, continuously monitors the results of the additional appraisal drilling and seismic work, and expenses the suspended well costs as a dry hole when it determines the potential field does not warrant further investment in the near term. Criteria utilized in making this determination include evaluation of the reservoir characteristics and hydrocarbon properties, expected development costs, ability to apply existing technology to produce the reserves, fiscal terms, regulations or contract negotiations, and our required return on investment. At year end 2006, total suspended well costs were $537 million, compared with $339 million at year end 2005. For additional information on suspended wells, including an aging analysis, see Note 11 Properties, Plants and Equipment, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Proved Oil and Gas Reserves and Canadian Syncrude Reserves Engineering estimates of the quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves in oil and gas fields and in place crude bitumen volumes in oil sand mining operations are inherently imprecise and represent only approximate amounts because of the subjective judgments involved in developing such information. 90 Reserve estimates are based on subjective judgments involving geological and engineering assessments of in place hydrocarbon volumes, the production or mining plan, historical extraction recovery and processing yield factors, installed plant operating capacity and operating approval limits. The reliability of these estimates at any point in time depends on both the quality and quantity of the technical and economic data and the efficiency of extracting and processing the hydrocarbons. Despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates, accounting rules require disclosure of proved reserve estimates due to the importance of these estimates to better understand the perceived value and future cash flows of a companys E&P operations. There are several authoritative guidelines regarding the engineering criteria that must be met before estimated reserves can be designated as proved. Our reservoir engineering department has policies and procedures in place that are consistent with these authoritative guidelines. We have qualified and experienced internal engineering personnel who make these estimates for our E&P segment. Proved reserve estimates are updated annually and take into account recent production and seismic information about each field or oil sand mining operation. Also, as required by authoritative guidelines, the estimated future date when a field or oil sand mining operation will be permanently shut down for economic reasons is based on an extrapolation of sales prices and operating costs prevalent at the balance sheet date. This estimated date when production will end affects the amount of estimated recoverable reserves. Therefore, as prices and cost levels change from year to year, the estimate of proved reserves also changes. Year end 2006 estimated reserves related to our LUKOIL Investment segment were based on LUKOILs year end 2005 oil and gas reserves. Because LUKOILs accounting cycle close and preparation of U.S. GAAP financial statements occur subsequent to our accounting cycle close, our 20.6 percent equity method share of LUKOILs oil and gas proved reserves at year end 2006 were estimated based on LUKOILs prior year report (adjusted for known additions, license extensions, dispositions, and other related information) and included adjustments to conform to our reserve policy and provided for estimated 2006 production. Any differences between the estimate and actual reserve computations will be recorded in a subsequent period. This estimate to actual adjustment will then be a recurring component of future period reserves. The judgmental estimation of proved reserves also is important to the income statement because the proved oil and gas reserve estimate for a field or the estimated in place crude bitumen volume for an oil sand mining operation serves as the denominator in the unit of production calculation of depreciation, depletion and amortization of the capitalized costs for that asset. At year end 2006, the net book value of productive E&P properties, plants and equipment subject to a unit of production calculation, including our Canadian Syncrude bitumen oil sand assets, was approximately $63 billion and the depreciation, depletion and amortization recorded on these assets in 2006 was approximately $6.2 billion. The estimated proved developed oil and gas reserves on these fields were 5.2 billion BOE at the beginning of 2006 and were 6.4 billion BOE at the end of 2006. The estimated proved reserves on the Canadian Syncrude assets were 251 million barrels at the beginning of 2006 and were 243 million barrels at the end of 2006. If the judgmental estimates of proved reserves used in the unit of production calculations had been lower by 5 percent across all calculations, pretax depreciation, depletion and amortization in 2006 would have been increased by an estimated $324 million. Impairments of producing oil and gas properties in 2006, 2005 and 2004 totaled $215 million, $4 million and $67 million, respectively. Of these write downs, $131 million in 2006, $1 million in 2005 and $52 million in 2004 were due to downward revisions of proved reserves. Impairment of Assets Long lived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in the future cash flows expected to be generated by an asset group. If, upon review, the sum of the undiscounted pretax cash flows is less than the carrying 91 value of the asset group, the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value. Individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes based on a judgmental assessment of the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets generally on a field by field basis for exploration and production assets, at an entire complex level for downstream assets, or at a site level for retail stores. Because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for long lived assets, the fair value usually is based on the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates commensurate with the risks involved in the asset group. The expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are based on judgmental assessments of future production volumes, prices and costs, considering all available information at the date of review. See Note 13 Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. Asset Retirement Obligations and Environmental Costs Under various contracts, permits and regulations, we have material legal obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore the land or seabed at the end of operations at operational sites. Our largest asset removal obligations involve removal and disposal of offshore oil and gas platforms around the world, oil and gas production facilities and pipelines in Alaska, and asbestos abatement at refineries. The estimated discounted costs of dismantling and removing these facilities are accrued at the installation of the asset. Estimating the future asset removal costs necessary for this accounting calculation is difficult. Most of these removal obligations are many years, or decades, in the future and the contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what removal practices and criteria must be met when the removal event actually occurs. Asset removal technologies and costs are changing constantly, as well as political, environmental, safety and public relations considerations. In addition, under the above or similar contracts, permits and regulations, we have certain obligations to complete environmental related projects. These projects are primarily related to cleanup at domestic refineries and underground storage tanks at U.S. service stations, and remediation activities required by the state of Alaska at exploration and production sites. Future environmental remediation costs are difficult to estimate because they are subject to change due to such factors as the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs, the unknown time and extent of such remedial actions that may be required, and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other responsible parties. See Note 1 Accounting Policies, Note 14 Asset Retirement Obligations and Accrued Environmental Costs, and Note 18 Contingencies and Commitments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. Business Acquisitions Purchase Price Allocation Accounting for the acquisition of a business requires the allocation of the purchase price to the various assets and liabilities of the acquired business. For most assets and liabilities, purchase price allocation is accomplished by recording the asset or liability at its estimated fair value. The most difficult estimations of individual fair values are those involving properties, plants and equipment and identifiable intangible assets. We use all available information to make these fair value determinations and, for major business acquisitions, typically engage an outside appraisal firm to assist in the fair value determination of the acquired long lived assets. We have, if necessary, up to one year after the acquisition closing date to finish these fair value determinations and finalize the purchase price allocation. Intangible Assets and Goodwill At December 31, 2006, we had $736 million of intangible assets determined to have indefinite useful lives, thus they are not amortized. This judgmental assessment of an indefinite useful life has to be continuously evaluated in the future. If, due to changes in facts and circumstances, management determines that these intangible assets then have definite useful lives, amortization will have to commence at that time on a 92 prospective basis. As long as these intangible assets are judged to have indefinite lives, they will be subject to periodic lower of cost or market tests that require managements judgment of the estimated fair value of these intangible assets. See Note 12 Goodwill and Intangibles, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. At December 31, 2006, we had $31.5 billion of goodwill recorded in conjunction with past business combinations. Under the accounting rules for goodwill, this intangible asset is not amortized. Instead, goodwill is subject to annual reviews for impairment at a reporting unit level. The reporting unit or units used to evaluate and measure goodwill for impairment are determined primarily from the manner in which the business is managed. A reporting unit is an operating segment or a component that is one level below an operating segment. Within our E&P segment and our R&M segment, we determined that we have one and two reporting units, respectively, for purposes of assigning goodwill and testing for impairment. These are Worldwide Exploration and Production, Worldwide Refining and Worldwide Marketing. If we later reorganize our businesses or management structure so that the components within these three reporting units are no longer economically similar, the reporting units would be revised and goodwill would be re assigned using a relative fair value approach in accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Goodwill impairment testing at a lower reporting unit level could result in the recognition of impairment that would not otherwise be recognized at the current higher level of aggregation. In addition, the sale or disposition of a portion of these three reporting units will be allocated a portion of the reporting units goodwill, based on relative fair values, which will adjust the amount of gain or loss on the sale or disposition. Because quoted market prices for our reporting units are not available, management must apply judgment in determining the estimated fair value of these reporting units for purposes of performing the periodic goodwill impairment test. Management uses all available information to make these fair value determinations, including the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates commensurate with the risks involved in the assets and observed market multiples of operating cash flows and net income, and may engage an outside appraisal firm for assistance. In addition, if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than the book value (including the goodwill), further judgment must be applied in determining the fair values of individual assets and liabilities for purposes of the hypothetical purchase price allocation. Again, management must use all available information to make these fair value determinations and may engage an outside appraisal firm for assistance. At year end 2006, the estimated fair values of our Worldwide Exploration and Production, Worldwide Refining, and Worldwide Marketing reporting units ranged from between 25 percent to 69 percent higher than recorded net book values (including goodwill) of the reporting units. However, a lower fair value estimate in the future for any of these reporting units could result in an impairment. Projected Benefit Obligations Determination of the projected benefit obligations for our defined benefit pension and postretirement plans are important to the recorded amounts for such obligations on the balance sheet and to the amount of benefit expense in the income statement. This also impacts the required company contributions into the plans. The actuarial determination of projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements involves judgment about uncertain future events, including estimated retirement dates, salary levels at retirement, mortality rates, lump sum election rates, rates of return on plan assets, future health care cost trend rates, and rates of utilization of health care services by retirees. Due to the specialized nature of these calculations, we engage outside actuarial firms to assist in the determination of these projected benefit obligations. For Employee Retirement Income Security Act qualified pension plans, the actuary exercises fiduciary care on behalf of plan participants in the determination of the judgmental assumptions used in determining required company contributions into plan assets. Due to differing objectives and requirements between financial accounting rules and the pension plan funding regulations promulgated by governmental 93 agencies, the actuarial methods and assumptions for the two purposes differ in certain important respects. Ultimately, we will be required to fund all promised benefits under pension and postretirement benefit plans not funded by plan assets or investment returns, but the judgmental assumptions used in the actuarial calculations significantly affect periodic financial statements and funding patterns over time. Benefit expense is particularly sensitive to the discount rate and return on plan assets assumptions. A 1 percent decrease in the discount rate would increase annual benefit expense by $110 million, while a 1 percent decrease in the return on plan assets assumption would increase annual benefit expense by $50 million. In determining the discount rate, we use yields on high quality fixed income investments (including among other things, Moodys Aa corporate bond yields) with adjustments as needed to match the estimated benefit cash flows of our plans. OUTLOOK EnCana Joint Ventures In October 2006, we announced a business venture with EnCana Corporation (EnCana), to create an integrated North American heavy oil business. The transaction closed on January 3, 2007. The venture consists of two 50/50 operating joint ventures, a Canadian upstream general partnership, FCCL Oil Sands Partnership, and a U.S. downstream limited liability company, WRB Refining LLC. We plan to use the equity method of accounting for our investments in both joint ventures. FCCL Oil Sands Partnerships operating assets consist of EnCanas Foster Creek and Christina Lake steam assisted gravity drainage bitumen projects, both located in the eastern flank of the Athabasca oil sands in northeast Alberta. EnCana is the operator and managing partner of this joint venture. We expect to contribute $7.5 billion, plus accrued interest, to the joint venture over a 10 year period beginning in 2007. This interest bearing cash contribution obligation will be recorded as a liability on our first quarter 2007 balance sheet. WRB Refining LLCs operating assets consist of our Wood River and Borger refineries, located in Roxana, Illinois, and Borger, Texas, respectively. This joint venture plans to expand heavy oil processing capacity at these facilities from 60,000 barrels per day to approximately 550,000 barrels per day by 2015. Total crude oil throughput at these two facilities is expected to increase from the current 452,000 barrels per day to approximately 600,000 barrels per day over the same time period. We are the operator and managing partner of this joint venture. EnCana is expected to contribute $7.5 billion, plus accrued interest to the joint venture over a 10 year period beginning in 2007. For the Wood River refinery, operating results will be shared 50/50 starting upon formation. For the Borger refinery, we are entitled to 85 percent of the operating results in 2007, 65 percent in 2008, and 50 percent in all years thereafter. Alaska We and our co venturers continue to seek agreement with the state of Alaska on fiscal terms that would enable development of a pipeline to transport natural gas from Alaskas North Slope to markets in the U.S. Lower 48 states. Alaskas new governor has stated her administration will propose a new law in the Alaska legislature and seek new proposals for development of an Alaskan gas pipeline. We expect to be actively involved in this process throughout 2007. In June 2006, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the Regulatory Commission of Alaska ruled in a proceeding involving a method for compensating shippers according to the quality of crude oil they ship through the Trans Alaska Pipeline System (quality bank). The rulings establish new valuation methodologies and require adjustments to quality bank payments retroactive to February 1, 2000. Based on our evaluations of the rulings, and taking into account contractual provisions with our crude oil customers regarding quality bank payments, our December 31, 2006, balance sheet contains a current 94 liability for our required retroactive payments to the quality bank, and a current receivable for amounts due from our crude oil customers. There was no impact to our 2006 results of operations related to this matter. In January 2007, we and our co venturer jointly filed for a two year extension of the Kenai LNG plants export license with the U.S. Department of Energy. This application would extend the export license through March 31, 2011. Venezuela Our operations in Venezuela include two heavy oil projects in the Orinoco Oil Belt (Petrozuata and Hamaca) and one conventional oil development (Corocoro). Over the past several years, our operating results have been negatively impacted by developments in Venezuela, including work disruptions, currency exchange controls, royalty rate increases, tax increases, and production quotas. More recently, Venezuelan government officials have made public statements about increasing their ownership interests in heavy oil projects required to give the national oil company of Venezuela, Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA), control and up to 60 percent ownership interests. On January 31, 2007, Venezuelas National Assembly passed an enabling law allowing the president to pass laws by decree on certain matters, including those associated with heavy oil production from the Orinoco Oil Belt. PDVSA holds a 49.9 percent interest in the Petrozuata heavy oil project and a 30 percent interest in the Hamaca heavy oil project. We have a 50.1 percent interest and a 40 percent interest in the Petrozuata and Hamaca projects, respectively. The impact, if any, of these statements or other potential government actions, on our Petrozuata and Hamaca projects is not determinable at this time, but could include future reductions of our operating results, production and proved reserves. The Petrozuata joint venture has received a preliminary audit report from the Venezuelan tax authorities, which if upheld, would result in additional income taxes of $245 million for 2002, plus interest and penalty. Petrozuata has also received an audit report claiming that it owes municipal sales tax and interest of $170 million for the period 2000 through 2005. Petrozuata believes, in both cases, these audit findings are not supported in law and it therefore does not owe these taxes. Accordingly, no provision has been established by Petrozuata. In addition, the Venezuelan tax authorities have announced their intention to accelerate the income tax audits of both Petrozuata and Hamaca for the years 2003 through 2006. ConocoPhillips continues to preserve all of its rights under contracts, investment treaties, and international law and will continue to evaluate its options in realizing the value of its investments and operations in Venezuela. Our total assets invested in Venezuelan operations at December 31, 2006, was approximately $2.5 billion. At December 31, 2006, we had recorded 1,088 million BOE of proved reserves related to Hamaca and Petrozuata, and these joint ventures produced 101,000 net barrels per day of crude oil in 2006. Other The U.S. Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA) contained a variety of provisions designed to strengthen the funding rules for U.S. defined benefit pension plans including the imposition of certain benefit limitations on U.S. tax qualified pensions that are less than 80 percent funded, based on the PPAs new funding liability. While the inputs to the PPAs new funding liability have not been completely specified at this time, we expect the PPA liability to be generally similar in concept to Current Liability as defined by section 412 (l) of the Internal Revenue Code, which is now used in pension funding calculations. On a Current Liability basis, on average our U.S. tax qualified pensions were 95 percent funded for the plan year beginning January 1, 2006. In December 2006, we and LUKOIL reached a definitive agreement for LUKOIL to purchase 376 of our fueling stations in six countries in Europe. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2007, following review by relevant authorities. 95 CAUTIONARY STATEMENT FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE SAFE HARBOR PROVISIONS OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995 This report includes forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. You can identify our forward looking statements by the words anticipate, estimate, believe, continue, could, intend, may, plan, potential, predict, should, will, expect, objective, projection, forecast, goal, guidance, outlook, effort, target and similar expressions. We based the forward looking statements relating to our operations on our current expectations, estimates and projections about ourselves and the industries in which we operate in general. We caution you that these statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that we cannot predict. In addition, we based many of these forward looking statements on assumptions about future events that may prove to be inaccurate. Accordingly, our actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what we have expressed or forecast in the forward looking statements. Any differences could result from a variety of factors, including the following: Fluctuations in crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices, refining and marketing margins and margins for our chemicals business. The operation and financing of our midstream and chemicals joint ventures. Potential failure or delays in achieving expected reserve or production levels from existing and future oil and gas development projects due to operating hazards, drilling risks and the inherent uncertainties in predicting oil and gas reserves and oil and gas reservoir performance. Unsuccessful exploratory drilling activities. Failure of new products and services to achieve market acceptance. Unexpected changes in costs or technical requirements for constructing, modifying or operating facilities for exploration and production projects, manufacturing or refining. Unexpected technological or commercial difficulties in manufacturing, refining, or transporting our products, including synthetic crude oil and chemicals products. Lack of, or disruptions in, adequate and reliable transportation for our crude oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids, LNG and refined products. Inability to timely obtain or maintain permits, including those necessary for construction of LNG terminals or regasification facilities, comply with government regulations, or make capital expenditures required to maintain compliance. Failure to complete definitive agreements and feasibility studies for, and to timely complete construction of, announced and future LNG and refinery projects and related facilities. Potential disruption or interruption of our operations due to accidents, extraordinary weather events, civil unrest, political events or terrorism. International monetary conditions and exchange controls. Liability for remedial actions, including removal and reclamation obligations, under environmental regulations. Liability resulting from litigation. &#16 0; General domestic and international economic and political developments, including armed hostilities, changes in governmental policies relating to crude oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids or refined product pricing and taxation, other political, economic or diplomatic developments, and international monetary fluctuations. 96 Changes in tax and other laws, regulations (including alternative energy mandates), or royalty rules applicable to our business. Inability to obtain economical financing for projects, construction or modification of facilities and general corporate purposes. Our ability to successfully integrate the operations of Burlington Resources into our own operations. 97 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Financial Instrument Market Risk We and certain of our subsidiaries hold and issue derivative contracts and financial instruments that expose our cash flows or earnings to changes in commodity prices, foreign exchange rates or interest rates. We may use financial and commodity based derivative contracts to manage the risks produced by changes in the prices of electric power, natural gas, crude oil and related products, fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, or to exploit market opportunities. Our use of derivative instruments is governed by an Authority Limitations document approved by our Board of Directors that prohibits the use of highly leveraged derivatives or derivative instruments without sufficient liquidity for comparable valuations without approval from the Chief Executive Officer. The Authority Limitations document also authorizes the Chief Executive Officer to establish the maximum Value at Risk (VaR) limits for the company and compliance with these limits is monitored daily. The Chief Financial Officer monitors risks resulting from foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, while the Executive Vice President of Commercial monitors commodity price risk. Both report to the Chief Executive Officer. The Commercial organization manages our commercial marketing, optimizes our commodity flows and positions, monitors related risks of our upstream and downstream businesses, and selectively takes price risk to add value. Commodity Price Risk We operate in the worldwide crude oil, refined products, natural gas, natural gas liquids, and electric power markets and are exposed to fluctuations in the prices for these commodities. These fluctuations can affect our revenues, as well as the cost of operating, investing, and financing activities. Generally, our policy is to remain exposed to the market prices of commodities; however, executive management may elect to use derivative instruments to hedge the price risk of our crude oil and natural gas production, as well as refinery margins. Our Commercial organization uses futures, forwards, swaps, and options in various markets to optimize the value of our supply chain, which may move our risk profile away from market average prices to accomplish the following objectives: Balance physical systems. In addition to cash settlement prior to contract expiration, exchange traded futures contracts also may be settled by physical delivery of the commodity, providing another source of supply to meet our refinery requirements or marketing demand. Meet customer needs. Consistent w ith our policy to generally remain exposed to market prices, we use swap contracts to convert fixed price sales contracts, which are often requested by natural gas and refined product consumers, to a floating market price. Manage the risk to our cash flows from price exposures on specific crude oil, natural gas, refined product and electric power transactions. &#16 0; Enable us to use the market knowledge gained from these activities to do a limited amount of trading not directly related to our physical business. For the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, the gains or losses from this activity were not material to our cash flows or net income. We use a VaR model to estimate the loss in fair value that could potentially result on a single day from the effect of adverse changes in market conditions on the derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments held or issued, including commodity purchase and sales contracts recorded on the balance sheet at December 31, 2006, as derivative instruments in accordance with SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended (SFAS No. 133). Using Monte Carlo simulation, a 95 percent confidence level and a one day holding period, the VaR for those 98 instruments issued or held for trading purposes at December 31, 2006 and 2005, was immaterial to our net income and cash flows. The VaR for instruments held for purposes other than trading at December 31, 2006 and 2005, was also immaterial to our net income and cash flows. Interest Rate Risk The following tables provide information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in short term U.S. interest rates. The debt tables present principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates; the derivative table shows the notional quantities on which the cash flows will be calculated by swap termination date. Weighted average variable rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at the reporting date. The carrying amount of our floating rate debt approximates its fair value. The fair value of the fixed rate financial instruments is estimated based on quoted market prices. Millions of Dollars Except as Indicated Debt Expected Maturity Date Fixed Rate Maturity Average Interest Rate Floating Rate Maturity Average Interest Rate Year End 2006 2007 $ 557 7.43 % $ 1,000 5.37 % 2008 32 6.96 2009 307 6.43 1,250 5.47 2010 1,433 8.85 2011 3,175 6.74 7,944 5.53 Remaining years 9,983 6.57 691 4.29 Total $ 15,487 $ 10,885 Fair value $ 16,856 $ 10,885 Year End 2005 2006 $ 1,534 5.73 % $ 180 5.32 % 2007 170 7.24 2008 27 6.99 2009 304 6.43 2010 1,280 8.73 41 4.51 Remaining years 7,830 6.45 721 3.71 Total $ 11,145 $ 942 Fair value $ 12,484 $ 942 At the beginning of 2005, we held certain interest rate swaps that converted $1.5 billion of debt from fixed to floating rate. Under SFAS No. 133, these swaps were designated as hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of $400 million of 3.625% Notes due 2007, $750 million of 6.35% Notes due 2009, and $350 million of 4.75% Notes due 2012, but during 2005 we terminated the majority of these interest rate swaps as we redeemed the associated debt. This reduced the amount of debt being converted from fixed to floating by the end of 2005 to $350 million. These remaining swaps continue to qualify for the shortcut method of hedge accounting, so we will not recognize any gain or loss due to ineffectiveness, if any, in the hedges. 99 Millions of Dollars Except as Indicated Interest Rate Derivatives Expected Maturity Date Notional Average Pay Rate Average Receive Rate Year End 2006 2007 variable to fixed $ % % 2008 2009 2010 2011 Remaining years fixed to variable 350 5.57 4.75 Total $ 350 Fair value position $ (10 ) Year End 2005 2006 variable to fixed $ 116 5.85 % 4.10 % 2007 2008 2009 2010 Remaining years fixed to variable 350 4.35 4.75 Total $ 466 Fair value position $ (8 ) Foreign Currency Risk We have foreign currency exchange rate risk resulting from international operations. We do not comprehensively hedge the exposure to currency rate changes, although we may choose to selectively hedge exposures to foreign currency rate risk. Examples include firm commitments for capital projects, certain local currency tax payments and dividends, and cash returns from net investments in foreign affiliates to be remitted within the coming year. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, we held foreign currency swaps hedging short term intercompany loans between European subsidiaries and a U.S. subsidiary. Although these swaps hedge exposures to fluctuations in exchange rates, we elected not to utilize hedge accounting as allowed by SFAS No. 133. As a result, the change in the fair value of these foreign currency swaps is recorded directly in earnings. Since the gain or loss on the swaps is offset by the gain or loss from remeasuring the intercompany loans into the functional currency of the lender or borrower, there would be no material impact to income from an adverse hypothetical 10 percent change in the December 31, 2006 or 2005, exchange rates. The notional and fair market values of these positions at December 31, 2006 and 2005, were as follows: 100 In Millions Foreign Currency Swaps Notional* Fair Market Value** 2006 2005 2006 2005 Sell U.S. dollar, buy euro USD 242 492 $ 5 (8 ) Sell U.S. dollar, buy British pound USD 647 463 20 (12 ) Sell U.S. dollar, buy Canadian dollar USD 1,367 517 (19 ) Sell U.S. dollar, buy Czech koruna USD 7 Sell U.S. dollar, buy Danish krone USD 17 3 Sell U.S. dollar, buy Norwegian kroner USD 1,145 1,210 15 (15 ) Sell U.S. dollar, buy Swedish krona USD 108 107 1 Sell U.S. dollar, buy Slovakia koruna USD 2 Sell U.S. dollar, buy Hungary forint USD 4 Buy U.S. dollar, sell Polish zloty USD 3 Sell euro, buy Norwegian kroner EUR 10 Buy euro, sell Norwegian kroner EUR 2 Buy euro, sell Swedish krona EUR 11 Buy euro, sell British pound EUR 125 *Denominated in U.S. dollars (USD) and euro (EUR). **Denominated in U.S. dollars.
