BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW ConocoPhillips is an international, integrated energy company. We are the third largest integrated energy company in the United States, based on market capitalization. We have approximately 32,600 employees worldwide, and at year end 2007 had assets of $178 billion. Our stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol COP. Our business is organized into six operating segments: Exploration and Production (EP) This segment primarily explores for, produces, transports and markets crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids on a worldwide basis. Midstream This segment gathers, processes and markets natural gas produced by ConocoPhillips and others, and fractionates and markets natural gas liquids, primarily in the United States and Trinidad. The Midstream segment primarily consists of our 50 percent equity investment in DCP Midstream, LLC. Refining and Marketing (RM) This segment purchases, refines, markets and transports crude oil and petroleum products, mainly in the United States, Europe and Asia. LUKOIL Investment This segment consists of our equity investment in the ordinary shares of OAO LUKOIL (LUKOIL), an international, integrated oil and gas company headquartered in Russia. At December 31, 2007, our ownership interest was 20 percent based on issued shares, and 20.6 percent based on estimated shares outstanding. Chemicals This segment manufactures and markets petrochemicals and plastics on a worldwide basis. The Chemicals segment consists of our 50 percent equity investment in Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC (CPChem). Emerging Businesses This segment represents our investment in new technologies or businesses outside our normal scope of operations. 48 Table of Contents Crude oil and natural gas prices, along with refining margins, are the most significant factors in our profitability. Accordingly, our overall earnings depend primarily upon the profitability of our EP and RM segments. Crude oil and natural gas prices, along with refining margins, are driven by market factors over which we have no control. However, from a competitive perspective, there are other important factors we must manage well to be successful, including: Operating our producing properties and refining and marketing operations safely, consistently and in an environmentally sound manner. Safety is our first priority and we are committed to protecting the health and safety of everyone who has a role in our operations and the communities in which we operate. Maintaining high utilization rates at our refineries and minimizing downtime in producing fields enable us to capture the value available in the market in terms of prices and margins. During 2007, our worldwide refinery capacity utilization rate was 94 percent, compared with 92 percent in 2006. The improved utilization rate reflects less scheduled downtime and unplanned weather related downtime. Concerning the environment, we strive to conduct our operations in a manner consistent with our environmental stewardship principles. Adding to our proved reserve base. We primarily add to our proved reserve base in three ways: o Successful exploration and development of new fields. o Acquisition of existing fields. o Applying new technologies and processes to improve recovery from existing fields. Through a combination of all three methods listed above, we have been successful in the past in maintaining or adding to our production and proved reserve base. Although it cannot be assured, we anticipate being able to do so in the future. The acquisition of Burlington Resources in March 2006 added approximately 2 billion barrels of oil equivalent to our proved reserves, and through our investments in LUKOIL during 2004, 2005 and 2006, we added about 1.9 billion barrels of oil equivalent. On January 3, 2007, we closed on a business venture with EnCana Corporation (EnCana). As part of this transaction, we added approximately 400 million barrels of oil equivalent to our proved reserves in 2007. In the three years ending December 31, 2007, our reserve replacement was 186 percent, including the impact of the Burlington Resources acquisition, our additional equity investment in LUKOIL, the EnCana business venture, and the expropriation of our Venezuelan oil assets. Access to additional resources has become increasingly difficult as direct investment is prohibited in some nations, while fiscal and other terms in other countries can make projects uneconomic or unattractive. In addition, political instability, competition from national oil companies, and lack of access to high potential areas due to environmental or other regulation may negatively impact our ability to increase our reserve base. As such, the timing and level at which we add to our reserve base may, or may not, allow us to replace our production over subsequent years. Controlling costs and expenses. Since we cannot control the prices of the commodity products we sell, controlling operating and overhead costs and prudently managing our capital program, within the context of our commitment to safety and environmental stewardship, are high priorities. We monitor these costs using various methodologies that are reported to senior management monthly, on both an absolute dollar basis and a per unit basis. Because managing operating and overhead costs are critical to maintaining competitive positions in our industries, cost control is a component of our variable compensation programs. With the rise in commodity prices over the last several years, and the subsequent increase in industry wide spending on capital and major maintenance programs, we and other energy companies are experiencing inflation for the costs of certain goods and services in excess of general worldwide inflationary trends. Such costs include rates for drilling rigs, steel and other 49 Table of Contents raw materials, as well as costs for skilled labor. While we work to manage the effect these inflationary pressures have on our costs, our capital program has been impacted by these factors. The continued weakening of the U.S. dollar has also contributed to higher costs. Our capital program may be further impacted by these factors going forward. Selecting the appropriate projects in which to invest our capital dollars. We participate in capital intensive industries. As a result, we must often invest significant capital dollars to explore for new oil and gas fields, develop newly discovered fields, maintain existing fields, or continue to maintain and improve our refinery complexes. We invest in those projects that are expected to provide an adequate financial return on invested dollars. However, there are often long lead times from the time we make an investment to the time that investment is operational and begins generating financial returns. In January 2007, we entered into two 50/50 business ventures with EnCana to create an integrated North American heavy oil business, consisting of a Canadian upstream general partnership, FCCL Oil Sands Partnership (FCCL), and a U.S. downstream limited liability company, WRB Refining LLC (WRB). We are obligated to contribute $7.5 billion, plus accrued interest, to FCCL over a 10 year period beginning in 2007. EnCana is obligated to contribute $7.5 billion, plus accrued interest, to WRB over a 10 year period beginning in 2007. Our capital expenditures and investments in 2007 totaled $11.8 billion, and we anticipate capital expenditures and investments to be approximately $14.3 billion in 2008. In addition to our capital program, we increased shareholder distributions in 2007 through a combination of increased dividends and share repurchases. Our cash dividends totaled $1.64 per share in 2007, an increase of 14 percent over $1.44 per share in 2006. We repurchased $7 billion of our common stock in 2007 and have $10 billion of share repurchase authority remaining through 2008. Managing our asset portfolio. We continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire assets that will contribute to future growth at competitive prices. We also continually assess our assets to determine if any no longer fit our strategic plans and should be sold or otherwise disposed. This management of our asset portfolio is important to ensuring our long term growth and maintaining adequate financial returns. During 2006, we increased our investment in LUKOIL, ending the year with a 20 percent ownership interest based on issued shares. During 2006, we completed the $33.9 billion acquisition of Burlington Resources. Also during 2006, we announced the commencement of an asset rationalization program to evaluate our asset base to identify those assets that may no longer fit into our strategic plans or those that could bring more value by being monetized in the near term. This program generated proceeds of approximately $3.8 billion through December 31, 2007. In 2008, we expect to complete the disposition of our retail assets in the United States, Norway, Sweden and Denmark. We will evaluate additional opportunities to optimize and strengthen our asset portfolio as the year progresses. Hiring, developing and retaining a talented work force. We strive to attract, train, develop and retain individuals with the knowledge and skills to implement our business strategy and who support our values and ethics. In 2007, we hired approximately 2,900 new employees around the world, including university hires as well as experienced hires. Throughout the company, we focus on the continued learning, development and technical training of our employees. Professional new hires participate in structured development programs designed to accelerate their technical and functional skills. The ongoing hiring and training of employees is especially important given the significant number of experienced technical personnel potentially exiting the workplace over the next few years. 50 Table of Contents Our key performance indicators are shown in the statistical tables provided at the beginning of the operating segment sections that follow. These include crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices and production, refining capacity utilization, and refinery output. Other significant factors that can affect our profitability include: Property and leasehold impairments. As mentioned above, we participate in capital intensive industries. At times, these investments become impaired when our reserve estimates are revised downward, when crude oil or natural gas prices, or refinery margins decline significantly for long periods of time, or when a decision to dispose of an asset leads to a write down to its fair market value. Property impairments in 2007, excluding the impairment of expropriated assets, totaled $442 million, compared with $383 million in 2006. We may also invest large amounts of money in exploration blocks which, if exploratory drilling proves unsuccessful, could lead to a material impairment of leasehold values. Goodwill. As a result of mergers and acquisitions, at year end 2007 we had $29.3 billion of goodwill on our balance sheet, compared with $31.5 billion of goodwill at year end 2006. Although our latest tests indicate that no goodwill impairment is currently required, future deterioration in market conditions could lead to goodwill impairments that would have a substantial negative, though non cash, effect on our profitability. Effective tax rate. Our operations are located in countries with different tax rates and fiscal structures. Accordingly, even in a stable commodity price and fiscal/regulatory environment, our overall effective tax rate can vary significantly between periods based on the mix of pretax earnings within our global operations. Fiscal and regulatory environment. As commodity prices and refining margins improved over the last several years, certain governments have responded with changes to their fiscal take. These changes have generally negatively impacted our results of operations, and further changes to government fiscal take could have a negative impact on future operations. In June 2007, our Venezuelan oil projects were expropriated, and we recorded a $4,588 million before tax ($4,512 million after tax) impairment (see the Expropriated Assets section of Note 13 Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). The company was also negatively impacted by increased production taxes enacted by the state of Alaska in the fourth quarter of 2007. In October 2007, the government of Ecuador increased the tax rate of the Windfall Profits Tax Law implemented in 2006, increasing the amount of government royalty entitlement on crude oil production to 99 percent of any increase in the price of crude oil above a contractual reference price. Also in October 2007, the Alberta provincial government publicly announced its intention to change the royalty structure for Crown lands, effective January 1, 2009 (see the Outlook section for additional information on the proposed royalty increase). In January 2008, we and our co venturers agreed to the proportional dilution of our equity interests in the Republic of Kazakhstans North Caspian Sea Production Sharing Agreement, which includes the Kashagan field, to allow the state owned energy company to increase its ownership percentage effective January 1, 2008, subject to completion of definitive agreements on dilution and other matters. Partially offsetting the above fiscal take increases were lower corporate income tax rates enacted by Canada and Germany during 2007. These tax rate reductions applied to all corporations and were not exclusive to the oil and gas industry. 51 Table of Contents Segment Analysis The EP segments results are most closely linked to crude oil and natural gas prices. These are commodity products, the prices of which are subject to factors external to our company and over which we have no control. Industry crude oil prices for West Texas Intermediate were higher in 2007 compared with 2006, averaging $72.25 per barrel in 2007, an increase of 9 percent. The increase was primarily due to growth in global consumption associated with continuing economic expansions and limited spare capacity from major exporting countries. Industry natural gas prices for Henry Hub increased during 2007, primarily due to increased demand from the residential and electric power sector. These factors were moderated by higher domestic production, increased LNG imports, and high storage levels. The Midstream segments results are most closely linked to natural gas liquids prices. The most important factor on the profitability of this segment is the results from our 50 percent equity investment in DCP Midstream. During 2005, we increased our ownership interest in DCP Midstream from 30.3 percent to 50 percent, and we recorded a gain of $306 million, after tax, for our equity share of DCP Midstreams sale of its general partnership interest in TEPPCO Partners, LP (TEPPCO). DCP Midstreams natural gas liquids prices increased 19 percent in 2007. Refining margins, refinery utilization, cost control, and marketing margins primarily drive the RM segments results. Refining margins are subject to movements in the cost of crude oil and other feedstocks, and the sales prices for refined products, which are subject to market factors over which we have no control. Industry refining margins in the United States were stronger overall in comparison to 2006. Key factors contributing to the stronger refining margins in 2007 were lower industry refining utilization in the United States and higher distillate and gasoline demand. Wholesale marketing margins in the United States were lower in 2007, compared with those in 2006, as the market did not generally keep pace with the rising cost of crude oil. The LUKOIL Investment segment consists of our investment in the ordinary shares of LUKOIL. In October 2004, we closed on a transaction to acquire 7.6 percent of LUKOILs shares from the Russian government for approximately $2 billion. During the remainder of 2004, all of 2005 and 2006, we invested an additional $5.5 billion, bringing our equity ownership interest in LUKOIL to 20 percent by year end 2006, based on issued shares. At December 31, 2007, our ownership interest was 20 percent based on issued shares and 20.6 percent based on estimated shares outstanding. We initiated this strategic investment to gain further exposure to Russias resource potential, where LUKOIL has significant positions in proved reserves and production. We benefited from an increase in proved oil and gas reserves at an attractive cost, and our EP segment should benefit from direct participation with LUKOIL in large oil projects in the northern Timan Pechora province of Russia, and potential opportunities for participation in other developments. The Chemicals segment consists of our 50 percent interest in CPChem. The chemicals and plastics industry is mainly a commodity based industry where the margins for key products are based on market factors over which CPChem has little or no control. CPChem is investing in feedstock advantaged areas in the Middle East with access to large, growing markets, such as Asia. The Emerging Businesses segment represents our investment in new technologies or businesses outside our normal scope of operations. Activities within this segment are currently focused on power generation and other items, such as carbon to liquids, technology solutions, and alternative energy and programs, such as advanced hydrocarbon processes, energy conversion technologies, new petroleum based products, and renewable fuels. Some of these technologies may have the potential to become important drivers of profitability in future years. 52 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Consolidated Results A summary of the companys net income (loss) by business segment follows: Millions of Dollars Years Ended December 31 2007 2006 2005 Exploration and Production (EP) $ 4,615 9,848 8,430 Midstream 453 476 688 Refining and Marketing (RM) 5,923 4,481 4,173 LUKOIL Investment 1,818 1,425 714 Chemicals 359 492 323 Emerging Businesses (8 ) 15 (21 ) Corporate and Other (1,269 ) (1,187 ) (778 ) Net income $ 11,891 15,550 13,529 2007 vs. 2006 The lower results in 2007 were primarily the result of: The complete impairment ($4,512 million after tax) of our oil interests in Venezuela resulting from their expropriation in June 2007. Lower crude oil production in the EP segment. Decreased net income from the Chemicals segment, primarily due to lower olefins and polyolefins margins. Higher production and operating expenses, higher production taxes, and higher depreciation, depletion and amortization expense in the EP segment. These items were partially offset by: The net benefit of asset rationalization efforts in the EP and RM segments. Higher realized crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids prices in the EP segment. Higher realized worldwide refining margins, including the benefit of planned inventory reductions in the RM segment. Increased equity earnings from our investment in LUKOIL due to higher estimated commodity prices and volumes, and an increase in our average equity ownership percentage. 2006 vs. 2005 The improved results in 2006, compared with 2005, were primarily the result of: Higher crude oil prices in the EP segment. The inclusion of Burlington Resources in our results of operations for the EP segment. Improved refining margins and volumes and marketing margins in the RM segments U.S. operations. Increased equity earnings from our investment in LUKOIL. The recognition in 2006 of business interruption insurance recoveries attributable to hurricanes in 2005. 53 Table of Contents These items were partially offset by: The impairment of certain assets held for sale in the RM and EP segments. Lower natural gas prices in the EP segment. Higher interest and debt expense resulting from higher average debt levels due to the Burlington Resources acquisition. Decreased net income from the Midstream segment, reflecting the inclusion of our equity share of DCP Midstreams gain on the sale of the general partner interest in TEPPCO in our 2005 results. Income Statement Analysis 2007 vs. 2006 Equity in earnings of affiliates increased 21 percent in 2007. The increase reflects earnings from WRB Refining LLC and FCCL Oil Sands Partnership, our downstream and upstream business ventures with EnCana, formed in January 2007. Also, we had improved results from LUKOIL, reflecting higher estimated commodity prices and volumes, and an increase in our average equity ownership percentage. These increases were partially offset by lower earnings from Hamaca and Petrozuata, our heavy oil joint ventures in Venezuela, primarily due to the expropriation of our interests during the second quarter of 2007. Additionally, CPChem reported lower earnings, primarily due to lower olefins and polyolefins margins. Other income increased 188 percent during 2007, primarily due to: Higher net gains on asset dispositions associated with asset rationalization efforts. The release of escrowed funds related to the extinguishment of Hamaca project financing. The settlement of retroactive adjustments for crude oil quality differentials on Trans Alaska Pipeline System shipments (Quality Bank) in 2007. These increases were partially offset by the recognition in 2006 of recoveries on business interruption insurance claims attributable to losses sustained from hurricanes in 2005. Exploration expenses increased 21 percent during 2007, primarily reflecting the amortization of unproved North American leaseholds obtained in the Burlington Resources acquisition and the impairment of an international exploration license. The increase also reflects higher geological and geophysical expenses and higher dry hole costs. Depreciation, depletion and amortization (DDA) increased 14 percent during 2007, primarily resulting from the addition of Burlington Resources assets in the EP segments depreciable asset base for a full year in 2007 versus only nine months in 2006. Impairment expropriated assets reflects a non cash impairment of $4,588 million before tax related to the expropriation of our oil interests in Venezuela recorded in the second quarter of 2007. For additional information, see the Expropriated Assets section of Note 13 Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Impairments, which excludes the expropriation of our oil interests in Venezuela, decreased 35 percent during 2007, primarily due to the significant impairments recorded in 2006 of certain assets held for sale in the RM segment, comprised of properties, plants and equipment, trademark intangibles and goodwill. See Note 13 Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. 54 Table of Contents Interest and debt expense increased 15 percent during 2007, primarily due to the interest expense component of the Quality Bank settlements, as well as higher expense associated with the funding requirements for the business venture with EnCana. Foreign currency transaction gains during 2007 primarily reflect the strengthening of the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar. Our effective tax rate in 2007 was 49 percent, compared with 45 percent in 2006. The change in the effective rate for 2007 was primarily due to the impact of the expropriation of our oil interests in Venezuela in the second quarter of 2007. This impact was partially offset by the effect of income tax law changes enacted during 2007, and by a higher proportion of income in higher tax rate jurisdictions during 2006. 2006 vs. 2005 Sales and other operating revenues increased 2 percent in 2006, compared with 2005, while purchased crude oil, natural gas and products decreased 5 percent. The increase in sales and other operating revenues was primarily due to higher realized prices for crude oil and petroleum products, as well as higher sales volumes associated with the Burlington Resources acquisition. These increases were mostly offset by decreases associated with the implementation of Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 04 13, Accounting for Purchases and Sales of Inventory with the Same Counterparty. The decrease in purchased crude oil, natural gas and products was primarily the result of the implementation of Issue No. 04 13. See Note 2 Changes in Accounting Principles, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information on the impact of this Issue on our income statement. Equity in earnings of affiliates increased 21 percent in 2006, compared with 2005. The increase reflects improved results from: LUKOIL, resulting from an increase in our ownership percentage, as well as higher estimated crude oil and petroleum products prices and volumes, and a net benefit from the alignment of our estimate of LUKOILs fourth quarter 2005 net income to LUKOILs reported results. CPChem, due to higher margins and volumes, as well as the recognition of a business interruption insurance net benefit. These increases were offset partially by the inclusion of our equity share of DCP Midstreams gain on the sale of the general partner interest in TEPPCO in our 2005 results. Other income increased 47 percent during 2006, compared with 2005, primarily due to the recognition in 2006 of recoveries on business interruption insurance claims. In addition, interest income was higher in 2006, compared with 2005. These increases were partially offset by higher net gains on asset dispositions recorded in 2005. Production and operating expenses increased 22 percent in 2006, compared with 2005. The increase was primarily due to the acquired Burlington Resources assets, increased production at the Bayu Undan field associated with the Darwin liquefied natural gas (LNG) project in Australia, the first year of production in Libya, and the acquisition of the Wilhelmshaven refinery in Germany. Exploration expenses increased 26 percent in 2006, compared with 2005, primarily due to the Burlington Resources acquisition. DDA increased 71 percent during 2006, compared with 2005. The increase was primarily the result of the addition of Burlington Resources assets in EPs depreciable asset base. In addition, the acquisition of the Wilhelmshaven refinery increased DDA recorded by the RM segment. 55 Table of Contents Impairments were $683 million in 2006, compared with $42 million in 2005. The increase primarily relates to the impairment in 2006 of certain assets held for sale in the RM and EP segments. We also recorded an impairment charge in the EP segment associated with assets in the Canadian Rockies Foothills area. Interest and debt expense increased from $497 million in 2005 to $1,087 million in 2006, primarily due to higher average debt levels as a result of the financing required to partially fund the acquisition of Burlington Resources. Restructuring Program As a result of the acquisition of Burlington Resources, we implemented a restructuring program in March 2006 to capture the synergies of combining the two companies. Under this program, we recorded accruals totaling $230 million in 2006 for employee severance payments, site closings, incremental pension benefit costs associated with the workforce reductions, and employee relocations. Approximately 600 positions were identified for elimination, most of which were in the United States. Of the total accrual, $224 million was reflected in the Burlington Resources purchase price allocation as an assumed liability, and $6 million ($4 million after tax) related to ConocoPhillips was reflected in selling, general and administrative expenses in 2006. Included in the total accruals of $230 million was $12 million related to pension benefits to be paid in conjunction with other retirement benefits over a number of future years. See Note 6 Restructuring, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. 56 Table of Contents Segment Results EP 2007 2006 2005 Millions of Dollars Net Income Alaska $ 2,255 2,347 2,552 Lower 48 1,993 2,001 1,736 United States 4,248 4,348 4,288 International 367 5,500 4,142 $ 4,615 9,848 8,430 Dollars Per Unit Average Sales Prices Crude oil (per barrel) United States $ 68.00 61.09 51.09 International 70.79 63.38 52.27 Total consolidated 69.47 62.39 51.74 Equity affiliates* 45.31 46.01 37.79 Worldwide EP 67.11 60.37 49.87 Natural gas (per thousand cubic feet) United States 5.98 6.11 7.12 International 6.51 6.27 5.78 Total consolidated 6.26 6.20 6.32 Equity affiliates* .30 .30 .26 Worldwide EP 6.26 6.19 6.30 Natural gas liquids (per barrel) United States 46.00 40.35 40.40 International 48.80 42.89 36.25 Total consolidated 47.13 41.50 38.32 Equity affiliates* Worldwide EP 47.13 41.50 38.32 Average Production Costs Per Barrel of Oil Equivalent United States $ 6.52 5.43 4.24 International 7.68 5.65 4.58 Total consolidated 7.13 5.55 4.43 Equity affiliates* 8.92 5.83 4.93 Worldwide EP 7.21 5.57 4.47 *Excludes our equity share of LUKOIL, which is reported in the LUKOIL Investment segment.

It also mines deposits of oil sands in Canada to extract the bitumen and upgrade it into a synthetic crude oil. At December 31, 2007, our EP operations were producing in the United States, Norway, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Canada, Nigeria, Ecuador, Argentina, offshore Timor Leste in the Timor Sea, Australia, China, Indonesia, Algeria, Libya, Vietnam, and Russia. 2007 vs. 2006 Net income from the EP segment decreased 53 percent in 2007. In the second quarter of 2007, we recorded a non cash impairment of $4,588 million before tax ($4,512 million after tax) related to the expropriation of our oil interests in Venezuela. For additional information, see the Expropriated Assets section of Note 13 Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which is incorporated herein by reference. The decrease in net income during 2007 reflects this impairment, as well as lower crude oil production, higher production taxes and operating costs, and higher DDA expense. These decreases were partially offset by: Higher realized crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas prices. A net benefit from asset rationalization efforts. A benefit related to the release of escrowed funds in connection with the extinguishment of the Hamaca project financing. The Quality Bank settlements. If crude oil prices in 2008 do not remain at the levels experienced in 2007, and if costs continue to increase, the EP segments earnings would be negatively impacted. See the Business Environment and Executive Overview section for additional information on industry crude oil and natural gas prices and inflationary cost pressures. Proved reserves at year end 2007 were 8.72 billion barrels of oil equivalent (BOE), compared with 9.36 billion BOE at year end 2006. This excludes the estimated 1,838 million BOE and 1,805 million BOE included in the LUKOIL Investment segment at year end 2007 and 2006, respectively. Also excluded is our share of Canadian Syncrude mining operations, which was 221 million barrels at year end 2007, compared with 243 million barrels at year end 2006. U.S. EP Net income from our U.S. EP operations decreased 2 percent, primarily due to higher production taxes in Alaska, higher operating costs and DDA expense, and lower crude oil production. These decreases were mostly offset by: Higher crude oil and natural gas liquids prices, and higher natural gas and natural gas liquids production. The Quality Bank settlements. Gains on the sale of assets in Alaska and the Gulf of Mexico. In December 2007, the state of Alaska enacted new production tax legislation, with retroactive provisions, which results in a higher production tax structure for ConocoPhillips. U.S. EP production averaged 843,000 BOE per day in 2007, an increase of 4 percent from 808,000 BOE per day in 2006. Production was impacted by the inclusion of the Burlington Resources assets for the full year of 2007, offset slightly by normal field decline. 59 Table of Contents International EP Net income from our international EP operations decreased 93 percent, primarily due to the impairment of expropriated assets in Venezuela, lower crude oil production, higher DDA expense, and higher operating costs. These decreases were partially offset by higher crude oil and natural gas prices, a net benefit from asset rationalization efforts, and the benefit from the release of the escrowed funds related to the Hamaca project. International EP production averaged 1,014,000 BOE per day in 2007, a decrease of 10 percent from 1,128,000 BOE per day in 2006. Production was impacted by the expropriation of our Venezuelan oil projects, planned and unplanned downtime in Australia and the North Sea, production sharing contract impacts in Australia, our exit from Dubai, and the effect of asset dispositions. These decreases were slightly offset by new production volumes from our upstream business venture with EnCana, as well as inclusion of the Burlington Resources assets for the full year of 2007. Our Syncrude mining operations produced 23,000 barrels per day in 2007, compared with 21,000 barrels per day in 2006. 2006 vs. 2005 Net income from the EP segment increased 17 percent in 2006, compared with 2005. The increase was primarily due to higher realized crude oil prices and, to a lesser extent, higher sales prices for natural gas liquids and Syncrude. In addition, increased sales volumes, primarily the result of the Burlington Resources acquisition, contributed positively to net income in 2006. These items were partially offset by lower realized natural gas prices, higher exploration expenses, the negative impacts of changes in tax laws, and asset impairments. U.S. EP Net income from our U.S. EP operations increased slightly in 2006, compared with 2005, primarily resulting from higher crude oil prices, as well as increased crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids production in the Lower 48 states, reflecting the Burlington Resources acquisition. These increases were partially offset by lower natural gas prices, higher exploration expenses, lower production levels in Alaska, and higher production taxes in Alaska. In August 2006, the state of Alaska enacted new production tax legislation, retroactive to April 1, 2006. The new legislation resulted in a higher production tax structure for ConocoPhillips. U.S. EP production on a BOE basis averaged 808,000 barrels per day in 2006, compared with 633,000 barrels per day in 2005. Production was favorably impacted in 2006 by the addition of volumes from the Burlington Resources assets, offset slightly by decreases in production levels in Alaska. Production in Alaska was negatively impacted by operational shut downs and weather related transportation delays. International EP Net income from our international EP operations increased 33 percent in 2006, compared with 2005, reflecting higher crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids prices and production, as well as higher levels of LNG production from the Darwin LNG facility associated with the Bayu Undan field in the Timor Sea. These increases were offset partially by increased exploration expenses and a $93 million after tax impairment charge associated with assets in the Canadian Rockies Foothills area. In addition, the increases to net income were partially offset by the net negative impacts of tax law changes in the United Kingdom, Canada, China, Venezuela, and Algeria. 60 Table of Contents During 2006, significant tax legislation was enacted in the United Kingdom and in Canada. The United Kingdom increased income tax rates on upstream income, resulting in a negative earnings impact of $470 million to adjust 2006 taxes and restate deferred tax liabilities. In Canada, an overall rate reduction in 2006 resulted in a favorable earnings impact of $401 million to restate deferred tax liabilities. International EP production averaged 1,128,000 BOE per day in 2006, an increase of 24 percent from 910,000 BOE per day in 2005. Production was favorably impacted in 2006 by the addition of Burlington Resources assets, higher gas production at Bayu Undan associated with the Darwin LNG ramp up in Australia, and the 2006 re entry into Libya. Our Syncrude mining operations produced 21,000 barrels per day in 2006, compared with 19,000 barrels per day in 2005.

The Midstream segment purchases raw natural gas from producers and gathers natural gas through an extensive network of pipeline gathering systems. The natural gas is then processed to extract natural gas liquids from the raw gas stream. The remaining residue gas is marketed to electrical utilities, industrial users, and gas marketing companies. Most of the natural gas liquids are fractionated separated into individual components like ethane, butane and propane and marketed as chemical feedstock, fuel, or blendstock. The Midstream segment consists of our 50 percent equity investment in DCP Midstream, LLC, as well as our other natural gas gathering and processing operations, and natural gas liquids fractionation and marketing businesses, primarily in the United States and Trinidad. 2007 vs. 2006 Net income from the Midstream segment decreased 5 percent in 2007, reflecting a shift in natural gas purchase contract terms that are more favorable to natural gas producers. In addition, earnings from DCP Midstream were lower, primarily due to increased operating costs, mainly repairs, maintenance and asset integrity work. The results also reflect a positive tax adjustment included in the 2006 results. These decreases were partially offset by higher natural gas liquids prices. 61 Table of Contents 2006 vs. 2005 Net income from the Midstream segment decreased 31 percent in 2006, compared with 2005, primarily due to the gain from the sale of DCP Midstreams interest in TEPPCO included in 2005 results. Our net share of this gain was $306 million on an after tax basis. This decrease was partially offset by a $24 million positive tax adjustment recorded in 2006 to the gain recorded in 2005 on the sale of DCP Midstreams interest in TEPPCO, as well as higher natural gas liquids prices and an increased ownership interest in DCP Midstream. In July 2005, ConocoPhillips increased its ownership interest in DCP Midstream to 50 percent from 30.3 percent. 62 Table of Contents RM 2007 2006 2005 Millions of Dollars Net Income United States $ 4,615 3,915 3,329 International 1,308 566 844 $ 5,923 4,481 4,173 Dollars Per Gallon U.S. Average Sales Prices* Gasoline Wholesale $ 2.27 2.04 1.73 Retail 2.42 2.18 1.88 Distillates wholesale 2.29 2.11 1.80 *Excludes excise taxes.

RM has operations mainly in the United States, Europe and Asia Pacific. 2007 vs. 2006 Net income from the RM segment increased 32 percent in 2007. The increase resulted primarily from: The net benefit of asset rationalization efforts. Higher realized worldwide refining margins, reflecting in part the impact of planned inventory reductions, including a benefit of $260 million from the liquidation of prior year layers under the last in, first out (LIFO) method. Higher U.S. Gulf and East Coast refining volumes due to lower planned maintenance and less weather related downtime. A $141 million deferred tax benefit related to tax legislation in Germany during the third quarter of 2007. These increases were partially offset by the net impact of our contribution of assets to WRB Refining LLC (WRB), our downstream business venture with EnCana; foreign currency impacts; and lower marketing sales volumes due to asset sales. See the Business Environment and Executive Overview section for our view of the factors supporting industry refining and marketing margins. We expect our average worldwide refinery crude oil utilization rate for 2008 to average in the mid nineties. U.S. RM Net income from our U.S. RM operations increased 18 percent in 2007, primarily due to: Higher refining volumes at our Gulf and East Coast refineries. Higher realized refining and marketing margins, due in part to the benefit of planned inventory reductions. These items were partially offset by the net impact of our contribution of the Wood River and Borger refineries to WRB, and the impact of business interruption insurance recoveries on our 2006 results. Our U.S. refining capacity utilization rate was 96 percent in 2007, compared with 92 percent in 2006, primarily reflecting lower planned maintenance and less weather related downtime. International RM Net income from our international RM operations increased 131 percent in 2007, due primarily to: The net benefit of asset rationalization efforts. The deferred tax benefit related to the tax legislation in Germany. Higher realized refining margins. These increases were partially offset by foreign currency impacts and lower marketing volumes due to the asset sales. Our international refining capacity utilization rate was 90 percent in 2007, compared with 91 percent in 2006. The 2007 utilization rate was affected by a temporary idling of the Wilhelmshaven refinery in Germany during the month of August due to economic conditions. 64 Table of Contents 2006 vs. 2005 Net income from the RM segment increased 7 percent in 2006, compared with 2005. The increase resulted primarily from: Higher U.S. refining and marketing margins and higher U.S. refining volumes. The recognition of a net benefit related to business interruption insurance. The inclusion of an $83 million charge for the cumulative effect of adopting Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143 (FIN 47) in the results for 2005. The increase in net income was partially offset by impairments on assets held for sale recognized in 2006, as well as higher depreciation expense. U.S. RM Net income from our U.S. RM operations increased 18 percent in 2006, compared with 2005, primarily due to: Higher refining and marketing margins, and higher refining volumes. The recognition of a net $111 million business interruption insurance benefit. A $78 million charge for the cumulative effect of adopting FIN 47 in 2005. These items were partially offset by after tax impairments of $227 million associated with certain assets held for sale, as well as higher depreciation expense. Our U.S. refining capacity utilization rate was 92 percent in 2006, the same as in 2005, reflecting unplanned weather related downtime in both years. International RM Net income from our international RM operations decreased 33 percent in 2006, compared with 2005, due primarily to: The recognition of a $214 million after tax impairment charge on certain assets held for sale. Lower refining margins. Preliminary engineering costs for certain refinery related projects. These decreases were partially offset by favorable foreign currency exchange impacts and higher refining and marketing sales volumes. Our international refining capacity utilization rate was 91 percent in 2006, compared with 99 percent in 2005. The decrease reflected scheduled downtime at certain refineries and unscheduled downtime at the Humber refinery in the United Kingdom. 65 Table of Contents LUKOIL Investment Millions of Dollars 2007 2006 2005 Net Income $ 1,818 1,425 714 Operating Statistics* Net crude oil production (thousands of barrels daily) 401 360 235 Net natural gas production (millions of cubic feet daily) 256 244 67 Net refinery crude oil processed (thousands of barrels daily) 214 179 122 *Represents our net share of our estimate of LUKOILs production and processing. This segment represents our investment in the ordinary shares of LUKOIL, an international, integrated oil and gas company headquartered in Russia, which we account for under the equity method. During 2005, we expended $2,160 million to purchase LUKOILs ordinary shares, increasing our ownership interest to 16.1 percent. We expended another $2,715 million to increase our ownership interest in LUKOIL to 20 percent at December 31, 2006, based on 851 million issued shares. At December 31, 2007, our ownership interest was 20 percent based on issued shares. Our ownership interest based on estimated shares outstanding, used for equity method accounting, was 20.6 percent at December 31, 2006 and 2007. 2007 vs. 2006 Net income from the LUKOIL Investment segment increased 28 percent during 2007, primarily due to higher estimated realized prices, higher estimated volumes, and an increase in our average equity ownership. The increase was partially offset by higher estimated taxes and operating costs, as well as the net impact from the alignment of estimated net income to reported results. Because LUKOILs accounting cycle close and preparation of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) financial statements occur subsequent to our reporting deadline, our equity earnings and statistics for our LUKOIL investment are estimated, based on current market indicators, publicly available LUKOIL operating results, and other objective data. Once the difference between actual and estimated results is known, an adjustment is recorded. This estimate to actual adjustment will be a recurring component of future period results. The adjustment to estimated results for the fourth quarter of 2006, recorded in 2007, decreased net income $19 million, compared with a $71 million increase to net income recorded in 2006 to adjust the estimated results for the fourth quarter of 2005. In addition to our estimate of our equity share of LUKOILs earnings, this segment reflects the amortization of the basis difference between our equity interest in the net assets of LUKOIL and the historical cost of our investment in LUKOIL, and also includes the costs associated with our employees seconded to LUKOIL. 2006 vs. 2005 Net income from the LUKOIL Investment segment increased 100 percent during 2006, compared with 2005, primarily as a result of our increased equity ownership, higher estimated prices and volumes, and a net benefit from the alignment of our estimate of LUKOILs fourth quarter 2005 net income to LUKOILs reported results. 66 Table of Contents Chemicals Millions of Dollars 2007 2006 2005 Net Income $ 359 492 323 The Chemicals segment consists of our 50 percent interest in Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC (CPChem), which we account for under the equity method. CPChem uses natural gas liquids and other feedstocks to produce petrochemicals. These products are then marketed and sold, or used as feedstocks to produce plastics and commodity chemicals. 2007 vs. 2006 Net income from the Chemicals segment decreased 27 percent during 2007, primarily due to lower olefins and polyolefins margins and higher turnaround and weather related repair costs, offset partially by a capital loss tax benefit of $65 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2007. 2006 vs. 2005 Net income from the Chemicals segment increased 52 percent during 2006, compared with 2005. Results for 2006 reflected improved olefins and polyolefins margins and volumes. The results for 2006 also included a hurricane related business interruption insurance benefit of $20 million after tax, as well as lower utility costs due to decreased natural gas prices. Emerging Businesses Millions of Dollars 2007 2006 2005 Net Income (Loss) Power $ 53 82 43 Other (61 ) (67 ) (64 ) $ (8 ) 15 (21 ) The Emerging Businesses segment represents our investment in new technologies or businesses outside our normal scope of operations. Activities within this segment are currently focused on power generation and other items, such as carbon to liquids, technology solutions, and alternative energy and programs, such as advanced hydrocarbon processes, energy conversion technologies, new petroleum based products, and renewable fuels. 2007 vs. 2006 The Emerging Businesses segment had a net loss of $8 million in 2007, compared with net income of $15 million in 2006. The decrease reflects lower margins from the Immingham power plant in the United Kingdom, as well as higher spending associated with alternative energy programs. These decreases were slightly offset by the inclusion of a write down of a damaged gas turbine at a domestic power plant in 2006 results. 67 Table of Contents 2006 vs. 2005 The Emerging Businesses segment had net income of $15 million in 2006, compared with a net loss of $21 million in 2005. The improved results reflect higher international power margins and volumes. The increase in net income was partially offset by the write down of a damaged gas turbine, as well as lower domestic power margins and volumes. Corporate and Other Millions of Dollars 2007 2006 2005 Net Loss Net interest $ (820 ) (870 ) (467 ) Corporate general and administrative expenses (176 ) (133 ) (183 ) Discontinued operations (23 ) Acquisition related costs (44 ) (98 ) Other (229 ) (86 ) (105 ) $ (1,269 ) (1,187 ) (778 ) 2007 vs. 2006 Net interest consists of interest and financing expense, net of interest income and capitalized interest, as well as premiums incurred on the early retirement of debt. Net interest decreased 6 percent in 2007, primarily due to higher amounts of interest being capitalized and higher interest income. These decreases were partially offset by the net impact of the interest components of the Quality Bank settlements and a premium on the early retirement of debt. Corporate general and administrative expenses increased 32 percent in 2007, primarily due to higher benefit related expenses. Acquisition related costs in 2007 included transition costs associated with the Burlington Resources acquisition. The category Other includes certain foreign currency transaction gains and losses, and environmental costs associated with sites no longer in operation. Results from Other were primarily impacted by foreign currency losses in 2007. 2006 vs. 2005 Net interest increased 86 percent in 2006, compared with 2005. The increase was primarily due to higher average debt levels as a result of the financing required to partially fund the acquisition of Burlington Resources. The increases were partially offset by higher amounts of interest being capitalized, as well as higher premiums incurred in 2005 on the early retirement of debt. Corporate general and administrative expenses decreased 27 percent in 2006, compared with 2005, primarily due to reduced benefit related expenses. Acquisition related costs in 2006 included seismic relicensing and other transition costs associated with the Burlington Resources acquisition. 68 Table of Contents Results from Other improved during 2006, compared with 2005, primarily due to foreign currency transaction gains in 2006, versus losses in 2005, partially offset by certain tax items not directly attributable to the operating segments. 69 Table of Contents CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Financial Indicators Millions of Dollars Except as Indicated 2007 2006 2005 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 24,550 21,516 17,628 Notes payable and long term debt due within one year 1,398 4,043 1,758 Total debt 21,687 27,134 12,516 Minority interests 1,173 1,202 1,209 Common stockholders equity 88,983 82,646 52,731 Percent of total debt to capital* 19 % 24 19 Percent of floating rate debt to total debt 25 41 9 *Capital includes total debt, minority interests and common stockholders equity. To meet our short and long term liquidity requirements, we look to a variety of funding sources. Cash generated from operating activities is the primary source of funding. In addition, during 2007 we raised $3,572 million in proceeds from asset dispositions. During 2007, available cash was used to support our ongoing capital expenditures and investments program, repurchase shares of our common stock, repay debt, provide loan financing to certain related parties, pay dividends, and meet the funding requirements related to the business venture with EnCana. During 2007, cash and cash equivalents increased $639 million to $1,456 million. In addition to cash flows from operating activities and proceeds from asset sales, we also rely on our cash balance, commercial paper and credit facility programs, and our shelf registration statements, to support our short and long term liquidity requirements. We anticipate these sources of liquidity will be adequate to meet our funding requirements in the near and long term, including our capital spending program, our share repurchase program, dividend payments, required debt payments, and the funding requirements related to the business venture with EnCana. For additional information about the EnCana transaction, see Note 16 Joint Venture Acquisition Obligation, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Our cash flows from operating activities increased in each of the annual periods from 2005 through 2007. Favorable market conditions played a significant role in the upward trend of our cash flows from operating activities. In addition, cash flows in 2007 benefited from the full year inclusion of the operating activity of Burlington Resources, versus only nine months in 2006. Absent any unusual event during 2008, we expect market conditions will again be the most important factor affecting our 2008 operating cash flows. Significant Sources of Capital Operating Activities During 2007, cash of $24,550 million was provided by operating activities, a 14 percent increase over cash from operations of $21,516 million in 2006. Contributing to the increase was a planned inventory reduction in the 2007 period, partially related to the formation of the WRB downstream business venture; the impact of the Burlington Resources acquisition late in the first quarter of 2006; and higher worldwide crude oil prices in 2007. These positive factors were partially offset by the absence of dividends from our Venezuelan operations in 2007. During 2006, cash flow from operations increased $3,888 million to $21,516 million. The improvement, compared with 2005, reflects higher worldwide crude oil prices and U.S. refining margins, higher 70 Table of Contents distributions from equity affiliates, and the impact of the Burlington Resources acquisition, partially offset by higher interest payments. While the stability of our cash flows from operating activities benefits from geographic diversity and the effects of upstream and downstream integration, our short and long term operating cash flows are highly dependent upon prices for crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids, as well as refining and marketing margins. During 2007 and 2006, we benefited from favorable crude oil and natural gas prices, as well as refining margins. The sustainability of these prices and margins is driven by market conditions over which we have no control. Absent other mitigating factors, as these prices and margins fluctuate, we would expect a corresponding change in our operating cash flows. The level of our production volumes of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids also impacts our cash flows. These production levels are impacted by such factors as acquisitions and dispositions of fields, field production decline rates, new technologies, operating efficiency, weather conditions, the addition of proved reserves through exploratory success, and the timely and cost effective development of those proved reserves. While we actively manage these factors, production levels can cause variability in cash flows, although historically this variability has not been as significant as that experienced with commodity prices. After adjusting our production rates for the impact of the expropriation of our Venezuelan oil operations in June 2007, our BOE production has increased in each of the past three years. These increases were driven primarily by acquisitions, including our increased ownership interest in LUKOIL during 2005 and 2006, the acquisition of Burlington Resources in 2006 and the business venture with EnCana in 2007. Our adjusted 2007 production was approximately 2.25 million BOE per day, after reductions for the expropriation, our exit from Dubai and the sale of non core assets. We expect 2008 annual production to be similar to the adjusted 2007 amount. Through 2012, we expect our annual production growth rate to average approximately 2 percent. These projections are tied to projects currently scheduled to begin production or ramp up in those years and exclude our Canadian Syncrude mining operations. To maintain or grow our production volumes, we must continue to add to our proved reserve base. Our reserve replacement over the three year period ending December 31, 2007, was 186 percent. The purchase of reserves in place was a significant factor in replacing our reserves over the past three years, partially offset by the expropriation of our Venezuelan oil assets. Significant purchases during this three year period included reserves added in 2007 related to the EnCana business venture, the 2006 acquisition of Burlington Resources and the 2005 re entry into Libya, as well as proved reserves added through our investments in LUKOIL. We are developing and pursuing projects we anticipate will allow us to add to our reserve base going forward. However, access to additional resources has become increasingly difficult as direct investment is prohibited in some nations, while fiscal and other terms in other countries can make projects uneconomic or unattractive. In addition, political instability, competition from national oil companies, and lack of access to high potential areas due to environmental or other regulation may negatively impact our ability to increase our reserve base. As such, the timing and level at which we add to our reserve base may, or may not, allow us to replace our production over subsequent years. As discussed in Critical Accounting Estimates, engineering estimates of proved reserves are imprecise, and therefore, each year reserves may be revised upward or downward due to the impact of changes in oil and gas prices or as more technical data becomes available on the reservoirs. In 2007 and 2005, revisions increased our reserves, while in 2006, revisions decreased reserves. It is not possible to reliably predict how revisions will impact reserve quantities in the future. See the Capital Spending section for an analysis of proved undeveloped reserves. 71 Table of Contents In addition, the level and quality of output from our refineries impacts our cash flows. The output at our refineries is impacted by such factors as operating efficiency, maintenance turnarounds, feedstock availability and weather conditions. We actively manage the operations of our refineries and, typically, any variability in their operations has not been as significant to cash flows as that experienced with refining margins. In 2006, we received approximately $1.1 billion in distributions from two heavy oil projects in Venezuela. The majority of these distributions represented operating results from previous years. We did not receive an operating distribution related to these projects in 2007. See the Outlook section for additional discussion concerning our operations in Venezuela. Asset Sales Proceeds from asset sales in 2007 were $3,572 million, compared with $545 million in 2006. The increase is mainly due to ongoing asset rationalization efforts related to the program we announced in April 2006 to dispose of assets that no longer fit into our strategic plans or those that could bring more value by being monetized in the near term. Through December 31, 2007, this program had generated proceeds of approximately $3.8 billion since inception. In 2008, we expect to complete the disposition of our retail assets in the United States, Norway, Sweden and Denmark. Commercial Paper and Credit Facilities In September 2007, we replaced our $5 billion and $2.5 billion revolving credit facilities, with one $7.5 billion revolving credit facility, expiring in September 2012. This facility may be used as direct bank borrowings, as support for the ConocoPhillips $7.5 billion commercial paper program, as support for the ConocoPhillips Qatar Funding Ltd. $1.5 billion commercial paper program, or as support for issuances of letters of credit totaling up to $750 million. The facility is broadly syndicated among financial institutions and does not contain any material adverse change provisions or any covenants requiring maintenance of specified financial ratios or ratings. The credit agreement contains a cross default provision relating to the failure to pay principal or interest on other debt obligations of $200 million or more by ConocoPhillips, or by any of its consolidated subsidiaries. Our primary funding source for short term working capital needs is the ConocoPhillips $7.5 billion commercial paper program, a portion of which may be denominated in other currencies (limited to euro 3 billion equivalent). Commercial paper maturities are generally limited to 90 days. The ConocoPhillips Qatar Funding Ltd. $1.5 billion commercial paper program is used to fund commitments relating to the Qatargas 3 project. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, we had no outstanding borrowings under the credit facilities, but $41 million in letters of credit had been issued at both dates. Under both commercial paper programs, there was $725 million of commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2007, compared with $2,931 million at December 31, 2006. Since we had $725 million of commercial paper outstanding and had issued $41 million of letters of credit, we had access to $6.7 billion in borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility at December 31, 2007. At December 31, 2007, Moodys Investor Service had a rating of A1 on our senior long term debt; and Standard and Poors Rating Service and Fitch had ratings of A. We do not have any ratings triggers on any of our corporate debt that would cause an automatic event of default in the event of a downgrade of our credit rating and thereby impact our access to liquidity. In the event that our credit rating deteriorated to a level that would prohibit us from accessing the commercial paper market, we would still be able to access funds under our $7.5 billion revolving credit facilities. Shelf Registrations We have a universal shelf registration statement on file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under which we, as a well known seasoned issuer, have the ability to issue and sell an indeterminate amount of various types of debt and equity securities. 72 Table of Contents We also have on file with the SEC a shelf registration statement under which ConocoPhillips Canada Funding Company I and ConocoPhillips Canada Funding Company II, both wholly owned subsidiaries, could issue an indeterminate amount of senior debt securities, fully and unconditionally guaranteed by ConocoPhillips and ConocoPhillips Company. Minority Interests At December 31, 2007, we had outstanding $1,173 million of equity in less than wholly owned consolidated subsidiaries held by minority interest owners, including a minority interest of $508 million in Ashford Energy Capital S.A. The remaining minority interest amounts are primarily related to operating joint ventures we control. The largest of these, $648 million, was related to the Darwin LNG project located in northern Australia. In December 2001, in order to raise funds for general corporate purposes, ConocoPhillips and Cold Spring Finance S.a.r.l. (Cold Spring) formed Ashford Energy Capital S.A. through the contribution of a $1 billion ConocoPhillips subsidiary promissory note and $500 million cash by Cold Spring. Through its initial $500 million investment, Cold Spring is entitled to a cumulative annual preferred return based on three month LIBOR rates, plus 1.32 percent. The preferred return at December 31, 2007, was 6.55 percent. In 2008, and at each 10 year anniversary thereafter, Cold Spring may elect to remarket their investment in Ashford, and if unsuccessful, could require ConocoPhillips to provide a letter of credit in support of Cold Springs investment, or in the event that such letter of credit is not provided, then cause the redemption of their investment in Ashford. Should ConocoPhillips credit rating fall below investment grade on a redemption date, Ashford would require a letter of credit to support $475 million of the term loans, as of December 31, 2007, made by Ashford to other ConocoPhillips subsidiaries. If the letter of credit is not obtained within 60 days, Cold Spring could cause Ashford to sell the ConocoPhillips subsidiary notes. At December 31, 2007, Ashford held $2.0 billion of ConocoPhillips subsidiary notes and $29 million in investments unrelated to ConocoPhillips. We report Cold Springs investment as a minority interest because it is not mandatorily redeemable and the entity does not have a specified liquidation date. Other than the obligation to make payment on the subsidiary notes described above, Cold Spring does not have recourse to our general credit. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As part of our normal ongoing business operations and consistent with normal industry practice, we enter into numerous agreements with other parties to pursue business opportunities, which share costs and apportion risks among the parties as governed by the agreements. At December 31, 2007, we were liable for certain contingent obligations under the following contractual arrangements: Qatargas 3: Qatargas 3 is an integrated project to produce and liquefy natural gas from Qatars North field. We own a 30 percent interest in the project. The other participants in the project are affiliates of Qatar Petroleum (68.5 percent) and Mitsui Co., Ltd. (1.5 percent). Our interest is held through a jointly owned company, Qatar Liquefied Gas Company Limited (3), for which we use the equity method of accounting. Qatargas 3 secured project financing of $4 billion in December 2005, consisting of $1.3 billion of loans from export credit agencies (ECA), $1.5 billion from commercial banks, and $1.2 billion from ConocoPhillips. The ConocoPhillips loan facilities have substantially the same terms as the ECA and commercial bank facilities. Prior to project completion certification, all loans, including the ConocoPhillips loan facilities, are guaranteed by the participants, based on their respective ownership interests. Accordingly, our maximum exposure to this financing structure is $1.2 billion, excluding accrued interest. Upon completion certification, which is expected in 2010, all project loan facilities, including the ConocoPhillips loan facilities, will become non recourse to the project participants. At December 31, 2007, Qatargas 3 had $2.4 billion outstanding under all the loan facilities, of which ConocoPhillips provided $690 million, and an additional $43 million of accrued interest. 73 Table of Contents Rockies Express Pipeline LLC: In June 2006, we issued a guarantee for 24 percent of the $2.0 billion in credit facilities of Rockies Express Pipeline LLC (Rockies Express), which will be used to construct a natural gas pipeline across a portion of the United States. The maximum potential amount of future payments to third party lenders under the guarantee is estimated to be $480 million, which could become payable if the credit facility is fully utilized and Rockies Express fails to meet its obligations under the credit agreement. At December 31, 2007, Rockies Express had $1,625 million outstanding under the credit facilities, with our 24 percent guarantee equaling $390 million. In addition, we have a 24 percent guarantee on $600 million of Floating Rate Notes due 2009 issued by Rockies Express in September 2007. It is anticipated that construction completion will be achieved in 2009, and refinancing will take place at that time, making the debt non recourse. For additional information, see Note 7 Variable Interest Entities (VIEs), in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Keystone Oil Pipeline: In December 2007, we acquired a 50 percent equity interest in the Keystone Oil Pipeline (Keystone), a joint venture with TransCanada Corporation. Keystone plans to construct a crude oil pipeline originating in Alberta, with delivery points in Illinois and Oklahoma. In connection with certain planning and construction activities, agreements were put in place with third parties to guarantee the payments due under those agreements. Our maximum potential amount of future payments under those agreements are estimated to be $400 million, which could become payable if Keystone fails to meet its obligations under the agreements noted above and the obligation cannot otherwise be mitigated. Payments under the guarantees are contingent upon the partners not making necessary equity contributions into Keystone; therefore, it is considered unlikely that payments would be required. All but $15 million of the guarantees will terminate after construction is completed, currently estimated to be in 2010. For additional information about guarantees, see Note 17 Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which is incorporated herein by reference. Capital Requirements For information about our capital expenditures and investments, see the Capital Spending section. Our debt balance at December 31, 2007, was $21.7 billion, a decrease of $5.4 billion during 2007, and our debt to capital ratio was 19 percent at year end 2007. Our debt to capital ratio at the end of 2008 will depend on realized commodity prices and margins, the funding of our capital program, and the level of our dividends and share repurchases. Our current debt to capital target is 20 percent to 25 percent. Effective January 15, 2007, we redeemed the 8% Junior Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures due 2037, at a premium of $14 million, plus accrued interest. This redemption resulted in the immediate redemption by Phillips 66 Capital II of $350 million of 8% Capital Securities. See Note 15 Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. Also, in January 2007, we redeemed our $153 million 7.25% Notes due 2007 upon their maturity. In February 2007, we reduced our Floating Rate Five Year Term Note due 2011 from $5 billion to $4 billion, with a subsequent reduction in July 2007 to $3 billion. In April 2007, we redeemed our $1 billion Floating Rate Notes due 2007 upon their maturity. In October 2007, we redeemed $300 million of ConocoPhillips Australia Funding Companys Floating Rate Notes due 2009 at par plus accrued interest. In May 2007, Polar Tankers Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary, issued $645 million of 5.951% Notes due 2037. The notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by ConocoPhillips and ConocoPhillips Company. In December 2007, we terminated interest rate swaps on $350 million of our 4.75% Notes due 2012. No interest rate swaps remain on any of our debt. 74 Table of Contents In January 2008, we repaid $1 billion of our Floating Rate Five Year Term Note due 2011, reducing the balance outstanding to $2 billion. In February 2008, we gave notice to redeem in March 2008 our $300 million 7.125% Debentures due 2028 at 102.7 percent, plus accrued interest. On January 3, 2007, we closed on a business venture with EnCana. As part of this transaction, we are obligated to contribute $7.5 billion, plus accrued interest, over a ten year period, beginning in 2007, to the upstream business venture, FCCL Oil Sands Partnership, formed as a result of the transaction. An initial contribution of $188 million was made upon closing in January. Quarterly principal and interest payments of $237 million began in the second quarter of 2007, and will continue until the balance is paid. Of the principal obligation amount, approximately $593 million is short term and is included in the Accounts payable related parties line on our consolidated balance sheet. The principal portion of these payments, which totaled $425 million in 2007, is presented on our consolidated statement of cash flows as an other financing activity. Interest accrues at a fixed annual rate of 5.3 percent on the unpaid principal balance. Fifty percent of the quarterly interest payment is reflected as an additional capital contribution and is included in the Capital expenditures and investments line on our consolidated statement of cash flows. On July 9, 2007, we announced plans to repurchase up to $15 billion of our common stock through the end of 2008. This amount included $2 billion remaining under a previously announced program. During 2007, we repurchased 89.5 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $7.0 billion, including 177,110 shares at a cost of $14 million from a consolidated Burlington Resources grantor trust. We anticipate first quarter 2008 share repurchases to be $2 billion to $3 billion. In December 2005, we entered into a credit agreement with Qatargas 3, whereby we will provide loan financing of approximately $1.2 billion for the construction of an LNG train in Qatar. This financing will represent 30 percent of the projects total debt financing. Through December 31, 2007, we had provided $690 million in loan financing, and an additional $43 million of accrued interest. See the Off Balance Sheet Arrangements section for additional information on Qatargas 3. In 2004, we finalized our transaction with Freeport LNG Development, L.P. (Freeport LNG) to participate in a proposed LNG receiving terminal in Quintana, Texas. Construction began in early 2005. We do not have an ownership interest in the facility, but we do have a 50 percent interest in the general partnership managing the venture, along with contractual rights to regasification capacity of the terminal. We entered into a credit agreement with Freeport LNG to provide loan financing of approximately $631 million, excluding accrued interest, for the construction of the facility. Through December 31, 2007, we had provided $594 million in loan financing, and an additional $87 million of accrued interest. In the fall of 2004, ConocoPhillips and LUKOIL agreed to the expansion of the Varandey terminal as part of our investment in the OOO Naryanmarneftegaz (NMNG) joint venture. We have an obligation to provide loan financing to Varandey Terminal Company for 30 percent of the costs of the terminal expansion, but we will have no governance or ownership interest in the terminal. We estimate our total loan obligation for the terminal expansion to be approximately $416 million at current exchange rates, excluding interest to be accrued during construction. This amount will be adjusted as the projects cost estimate and schedule are updated and the ruble exchange rate fluctuates. Through December 31, 2007, we had provided $331 million in loan financing, and an additional $32 million of accrued interest. Our loans to Qatargas 3, Freeport LNG and Varandey Terminal Company are included in the Loans and advances related parties line on the balance sheet. In February 2008, we announced a quarterly dividend of 47 cents per share, representing a 15 percent increase over the previous quarters dividend of 41 cents per share. The dividend is payable March 3, 2008, to stockholders of record at the close of business February 25, 2008. 75 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our aggregate contractual fixed and variable obligations as of December 31, 2007: Millions of Dollars Payments Due by Period Up to Year Year After Total 1 Year 2 3 4 5 5 Years Debt obligations (a) $ 21,633 1,368 2,796 7,243 10,226 Capital lease obligations 54 30 7 17 Total debt 21,687 1,398 2,803 7,243 10,243 Interest on debt and other obligations 15,439 1,429 2,608 1,949 9,453 Operating lease obligations 3,308 732 1,032 737 807 Purchase obligations (b) 125,507 49,929 11,864 8,665 55,049 Joint venture acquisition obligation (c) 6,887 593 1,285 1,427 3,582 Other long term liabilities (d) Asset retirement obligations 6,613 253 555 481 5,324 Accrued environmental costs 1,089 187 319 114 469 Unrecognized tax benefits (e) 144 144 (e ) (e ) (e ) Total $ 180,674 54,665 20,466 20,616 84,927 (a) Includes $688 million of net unamortized premiums and discounts. See Note 15 Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. (b) Represents any agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding and that specifies all significant terms. The majority of the purchase obligations are market based contracts. Includes: (1) our commercial activities of $74,446 million, of which $31,834 million are primarily related to the supply of crude oil to our refineries and the optimization of the supply chain, $10,530 million primarily related to the supply of unfractionated natural gas liquids (NGL) to fractionators, optimization of NGL assets, and for resale to customers, $9,575 million on futures, $8,933 million primarily related to natural gas for resale customers, $7,354 million related to transportation, $4,984 million related to product purchases, $943 million related to power trades, and $293 million related to the purchase side of exchange agreements; (2) $45,744 million of purchase commitments for products, mostly natural gas and NGL, from CPChem over the remaining term of 92 years; and (3) purchase commitments for jointly owned fields and facilities where we are the operator, of which some of the obligations will be reimbursed by our co venturers in these properties. Does not include: (1) purchase commitments for jointly owned fields and facilities where we are not the operator; and (2) an agreement to purchase up to 165,000 barrels per day of Venezuelan Merey, or equivalent, crude oil for a market price over a remaining 12 year term if a variety of conditions are met. (c) Represents the remaining amount of contributions, excluding interest, due over a nine year period to the upstream joint venture formed with EnCana.

The U.S. five year average consists of $460 million for 2008 and then approximately $300 million per year for the remaining four years. Our required minimum funding in 2008 is expected to be $110 million in the United States and $120 million outside the United States. (e) Does not include unrecognized tax benefits of $999 million because the ultimate disposition and timing of any payments to be made with regard to such amount is not reasonably estimable. Although unrecognized tax benefits are not a contractual obligation, they are presented in this table because they represent potential demands on our liquidity.

During the three year period, 67 percent of total spending went to our EP segment. In addition to our capital expenditures and investments spending during 2007 and 2006, we also provided loans of approximately $700 million and $800 million, respectively, to certain related parties. Our capital expenditures and investments budget for 2008 is $14.3 billion. Included in this amount is approximately $700 million in capitalized interest. We plan to direct 77 percent of the capital expenditures and investments budget to EP and 20 percent to RM. With the addition of loans to certain affiliated companies and principal contributions related to funding our portion of the EnCana transaction, our total capital program for 2008 is approximately $15.3 billion. See the Capital Requirements section, as well as Note 10 Investments, Loans and Long Term Receivables and Note 16 Joint Venture Acquisition Obligation, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. 77 Table of Contents EP Capital spending for EP during the three year period ending December 31, 2007, totaled $26.1 billion. The expenditures over this period supported key exploration and development projects including: Development drilling in the Greater Kuparuk Area, including West Sak; the Greater Prudhoe Bay Area; the Alpine field, including satellite field prospects; exploratory drilling; and the acquisition of acreage in Alaska. Oil and natural gas developments in the Lower 48 states, including New Mexico, Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Montana, North Dakota and Colorado. The Magnolia development, Ursa and K 2 fields in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. The acquisition of limited term, fixed volume overriding royalty interests in Utah and the San Juan Basin related to our natural gas production. Investment in the West2East Pipeline LLC (West2East), a company holding a 100 percent interest in Rockies Express Pipeline LLC (Rockies Express). Expansion of the Syncrude oil sands project, the development of the Surmont heavy oil project, capital expenditures related to the EnCana upstream business venture, and development of conventional oil and gas reserves, all in Canada. Development of the Corocoro field offshore Venezuela (see Note 13 Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information). The Ekofisk Area growth project and Alvheim project in the Norwegian North Sea. The Statfjord Late Life project straddling the offshore boundary between Norway and the United Kingdom. The Britannia satellite and Clair developments in the U.K. North Sea and Atlantic Margin, respectively. An integrated project to produce and liquefy natural gas from Qatars North field. Investments in three fields in Algeria. Expenditures related to the terms under which we returned to our former oil and natural gas production operations in the Waha concessions in Libya and continued development of these concessions. Ongoing development of onshore oil and natural gas fields in Nigeria and ongoing exploration activities both onshore and on deepwater leases. The Kashagan field and satellite prospects in the Caspian Sea, offshore Kazakhstan. The acquisition of an interest in OOO Naryanmarneftegaz (NMNG), a joint venture with LUKOIL, and development of the Yuzhno Khylchuyu (YK) field. The Bayu Undan gas recycle and liquefied natural gas development projects in the Timor Sea and northern Australia, respectively. The Belanak, Suban, Kerisi, Hiu and Belut projects in Indonesia. The Peng Lai 19 3 development in Chinas Bohai Bay and additional Bohai Bay appraisal and adjacent field prospects. Expenditures to develop the Su Tu Vang field and continued in field development of the Rang Dong field in Vietnam. Capital expenditures for construction of our Endeavour Class tankers, as well as for an upgrade to the Trans Alaska Pipeline System pump stations were also included in the EP segment. 2008 CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND INVESTMENTS BUDGET EPs 2008 capital expenditures and investments budget is $11.1 billion, 11 percent higher than actual expenditures in 2007. Thirty nine percent of EPs 2008 capital expenditures and investments budget is planned for the United States. 78 Table of Contents Capital spending for our Alaskan operations is expected to fund Prudhoe Bay, Greater Kuparuk and western North Slope operations, including the Alpine satellite fields, as well as exploration activities. In addition, we anticipate further development spending in our Cook Inlet Area. As a result of increased production taxes enacted by the state of Alaska in the fourth quarter of 2007, we anticipate our 2008 capital expenditures will be less than originally planned, mainly related to reduced project funding on the North Slope of Alaska. In the Lower 48, capital expenditures will focus primarily on developing natural gas reserves within core areas, including the San Juan Basin of New Mexico and Colorado; the Lobo Trend of south Texas; the Bossier and Cotton Valley Trends of east Texas and north Louisiana; the Barnett Shale Trend of north Texas; the Anadarko Basin of western Oklahoma; and the Piceance Basin in northwest Colorado. We also plan to pursue oil development in the Williston Basin of Montana and North Dakota, as well as oil and gas developments in southern Louisiana and the Permian Basin of West Texas. Offshore capital will be focused mainly on the Ursa development in the Gulf of Mexico. In addition, investments will be made in West2East for Rockies Express. EP is directing $6.8 billion of its 2008 capital expenditures and investments budget to international projects. Funds in 2008 will be directed to developing major long term projects, including the Kashagan project in the Caspian Sea and the YK field in northern Russia, through the NMNG joint venture with LUKOIL; the J Block fields, the Britannia satellites and the Ekofisk Area in the North Sea; the Bohai Bay project in China; heavy oil projects in Canada and western Canada natural gas projects; offshore Block B and onshore South Sumatra in Indonesia; fields offshore Malaysia and Vietnam; the Qatargas 3 LNG project in Qatar; and the Waha concessions in Libya. PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES The net addition of proved undeveloped reserves accounted for 77 percent, 37 percent and 44 percent of our total net additions in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. During these years, we converted, on average, 16 percent per year of our proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves. Of our 2,921 million total BOE proved undeveloped reserves at December 31, 2007, we estimated that the average annual conversion rate for these reserves for the three year period ending 2010 will be approximately 18 percent. Costs incurred for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, relating to the development of proved undeveloped oil and gas reserves were $6.4 billion, $6.4 billion, and $3.4 billion, respectively. Estimated future development costs relating to the development of proved undeveloped reserves for the years 2008 through 2010 are projected to be $4.5 billion, $3.6 billion, and $2.6 billion, respectively. Approximately 78 percent of our proved undeveloped reserves at year end 2007 were associated with 10 major development areas and our investment in LUKOIL. Eight of the major development areas are currently producing and are expected to have proved reserves convert from undeveloped to developed over time as development activities continue and or production facilities are expanded or upgraded, and include: The Ekofisk field in the North Sea. The Peng Lai 19 3 field in China. Fields in the United States and Canada. EnCana business venture projects Christina Lake and Foster Creek. The Surmont heavy oil project in Canada. The remaining two major projects, Qatargas 3 in Qatar and the Kashagan field in Kazakhstan, will have undeveloped proved reserves convert to developed as these projects begin production. 79 Table of Contents Midstream Capital spending for Midstream during the three year period ending December 31, 2007, was primarily related to increasing our ownership interest in DCP Midstream in 2005 from 30.3 percent to 50 percent. RM Capital spending for RM during the three year period ending December 31, 2007, was primarily for acquiring additional crude oil refining capacity, clean fuels projects to meet new environmental standards, refinery upgrade projects to improve product yields, the operating integrity of key processing units, as well as for safety projects. In addition, in December 2007, we invested funds to acquire a 50 percent equity interest in the Keystone Oil Pipeline (Keystone), a joint venture to construct a crude oil pipeline from Hardisty, Alberta to U.S. Midwest markets in Illinois and Oklahoma. During this three year period, RM capital spending was $6.1 billion, representing 16 percent of our total capital expenditures and investments. Key projects during the three year period included: Acquisition of the Wilhelmshaven refinery in Germany. Debottlenecking of a crude and fluid catalytic cracking unit, and completion of a new sulfur plant at the Ferndale refinery. A new ultra low sulfur diesel hydrotreater at the Sweeny refinery. Revamp of an existing hydrotreater for ultra low sulfur diesel and a new hydrogen plant at the Wood River refinery. Expansion of existing hydrotreaters for both low sulfur gasoline and ultra low sulfur diesel, with the addition of a new hydrogen plant at the Bayway refinery. A new hydrotreater for ultra low sulfur diesel and a hydrogen plant at the Ponca City refinery. Revamps of existing hydrotreaters for ultra low sulfur diesel at the Los Angeles, Trainer and Ferndale refineries. A new ultra low sulfur diesel hydrotreater and hydrogen plant at the Billings refinery. A fluid catalytic cracking gasoline hydrotreater at the Alliance refinery for production of low sulfur gasoline. A sulfur removal technology unit at the Lake Charles refinery for the production of low sulfur gasoline. A new ultra low sulfur diesel hydrotreater at the Rodeo facility of our San Francisco refinery. Major construction activities in progress include: Expansion of a hydrocracker at the Rodeo facility of our San Francisco refinery. Construction of a low sulfur gasoline project at the Billings refinery. U.S. programs aimed at air emission reductions. Internationally, we continued to invest in our ongoing refining and marketing operations to upgrade and increase the profitability of our existing assets, including upgrading the distillate desulfurization capabilities at our Humber refinery in the United Kingdom. 2008 CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND INVESTMENTS BUDGET RMs 2008 capital budget is $2.8 billion, a 102 percent increase from actual spending in 2007. Domestic spending in 2008 is expected to comprise 74 percent of the RM budget. We plan to direct about $1.6 billion of the RM capital budget to domestic refining, primarily for projects related to sustaining and improving the existing business with a focus on reliability, energy efficiency, capital maintenance and regulatory compliance. Work continues at a number of refineries on projects to 80 Table of Contents increase crude oil capacity, expand conversion capability and increase clean product yield. Our North American transportation and marketing businesses are expected to spend about $800 million, including investments in the Keystone project. Outside North America, we plan to spend about $400 million, with a focus on projects related to reliability, safety and the environment, as well as an upgrade project at the Wilhelmshaven, Germany, refinery and the advancement of a full conversion refinery project in Yanbu, Saudi Arabia. LUKOIL Investment Capital spending in our LUKOIL Investment segment during the three year period ending December 31, 2007, was for continued purchases of ordinary shares of LUKOIL to increase our ownership interest. However, no additional purchases were made in 2007, and none are expected in 2008. Emerging Businesses Capital spending for Emerging Businesses during the three year period ending December 31, 2007, was primarily for an expansion of the Immingham combined heat and power cogeneration plant near the companys Humber refinery in the United Kingdom. In addition, in October 2007, we purchased a 50 percent interest in Sweeny Cogeneration LP (SCLP). SCLP provides steam and electric power to the Sweeny refinery complex with any excess power sold into the market. We account for this joint venture using the equity method of accounting. Contingencies Legal and Tax Matters We accrue for non income tax related contingencies when a loss is probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated. If a range of amounts can be reasonably estimated and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, then the minimum of the range is accrued. In the case of income tax related contingencies, we adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48), effective January 1, 2007. FIN 48 requires a cumulative probability weighted loss accrual in cases where sustaining a tax position is less than certain. Based on currently available information, we believe it is remote that future costs related to known contingent liability exposures will exceed current accruals by an amount that would have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements. Environmental We are subject to the same numerous international, federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations, as are other companies in the petroleum exploration and production, refining, and crude oil and refined product marketing and transportation businesses. The most significant of these environmental laws and regulations include, among others, the: Federal Clean Air Act, which governs air emissions. Federal Clean Water Act, which governs discharges to water bodies. Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), which imposes liability on generators, transporters, and arrangers of hazardous substances at sites where hazardous substance releases have occurred or are threatened to occur. Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), which governs the treatment, storage, and disposal of solid waste. Federal Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA90), under which owners and operators of onshore facilities and pipelines, lessees or permittees of an area in which an offshore facility is located, and owners and operators of vessels are liable for removal costs and damages that result from a discharge of oil into navigable waters of the United States. 81 Table of Contents Federal Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act (EPCRA), which requires facilities to report toxic chemical inventories with local emergency planning committees and responses departments. Federal Safe Drinking Water Act, which governs the disposal of wastewater in underground injection wells. U.S. Department of the Interior regulations, which relate to offshore oil and gas operations in U.S. waters and impose liability for the cost of pollution cleanup resulting from operations, as well as potential liability for pollution damages. These laws and their implementing regulations set limits on emissions and, in the case of discharges to water, establish water quality limits. They also, in most cases, require permits in association with new or modified operations. These permits can require an applicant to collect substantial information in connection with the application process, which can be expensive and time consuming. In addition, there can be delays associated with notice and comment periods and the agencys processing of the application. Many of the delays associated with the permitting process are beyond the control of the applicant. Many states and foreign countries where we operate also have, or are developing, similar environmental laws and regulations governing these same types of activities. While similar, in some cases these regulations may impose additional, or more stringent, requirements that can add to the cost and difficulty of marketing or transporting products across state and international borders. The ultimate financial impact arising from environmental laws and regulations is neither clearly known nor easily determinable as new standards, such as air emission standards, water quality standards and stricter fuel regulations continue to evolve. However, environmental laws and regulations, including those that may arise to address concerns about global climate change, are expected to continue to have an increasing impact on our operations in the United States and in other countries in which we operate. Notable areas of potential impacts include air emission compliance and remediation obligations in the United States. For example, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 imposed obligations to provide increasing volumes on a percentage basis of renewable fuels in transportation motor fuels through 2012. These obligations were changed with the enactment of the Energy Independence Security Act of 2007, which was signed in late December. The new law requires fuel producers and importers to provide approximately 66 percent more renewable fuels in 2008 as compared with amounts set forth in the Energy Policy Act of 2005, with increases in amounts of renewable fuels required through 2022. We are in the process of establishing implementation, operating and capital strategies along with advanced technology development to meet these requirements. Since 1997 when the Kyoto Protocol called for reductions of certain emissions that contribute to increases in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations, there have been a range of national, sub national and international regulations proposed or implemented focusing on greenhouse gas reduction. These actual or proposed regulations do or will apply in countries where we have interests or may have interests in the future. Regulation in this field continues to evolve and while it is likely to be increasingly widespread and stringent, at this stage it is not possible to accurately estimate either a timetable for implementation or our future compliance costs. The overall long term fiscal impact from this type of regulation is uncertain. Examples of legislation or precursors for possible regulation include: European Emissions Trading Scheme, the program through which many of the European Union member states are implementing the Kyoto Protocol. Californias Assembly Bill 32, which requires the California Air Resources Board (CARB) to develop regulations and market mechanisms that will ultimately reduce Californias greenhouse gas emissions by 25 percent by 2020. 82 Table of Contents Two regulations issued by the Alberta government in 2007 under the Climate Change and Emissions Act. These regulations require any existing facility with emissions equal to or greater than 100,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide or equivalent per year to reduce the net emissions intensity of that facility by 2 percent per year beginning July 1, 2007, with an ultimate reduction target of 12 percent of baseline emissions. The U.S. Supreme Court decision in Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. , 127 S.Ct. 1438 ( 2007) confirming that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has the authority to regulate carbon dioxide as an air pollutant under the federal Clean Air Act. There is growing consensus that some form of regulation will be forthcoming at the federal level in the United States with respect to greenhouse gas emissions (including carbon dioxide) and such regulation could result in the creation of substantial additional costs in the form of taxes or required acquisition or trading of emission allowances. Additionally, with the continuing trend toward stricter standards, greater regulation and more extensive permitting requirements, our capital and operating environmental expenditures are likely to be substantial and may increase in the future. We may experience significant delays in obtaining all required environmental regulatory permits or other approvals that we need to operate or upgrade our existing facilities or construct new facilities. If there is a delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approvals or permits, the operation of our facilities may be interrupted or become subject to additional costs. We also are subject to certain laws and regulations relating to environmental remediation obligations associated with current and past operations. Such laws and regulations include CERCLA and RCRA and their state equivalents. Remediation obligations include cleanup responsibility arising from petroleum releases from underground storage tanks located at numerous past and present ConocoPhillips owned and or operated petroleum marketing outlets throughout the United States. Federal and state laws require contamination caused by such underground storage tank releases be assessed and remediated to meet applicable standards. In addition to other cleanup standards, many states adopted cleanup criteria for methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) for both soil and groundwater. Future environmental expenditures associated with the remediation of MTBE contaminated underground storage tank sites could be substantial. At RCRA permitted facilities, we are required to assess environmental conditions. If conditions warrant, we may be required to remediate contamination caused by prior operations. In contrast to CERCLA, which is often referred to as Superfund, the cost of corrective action activities under RCRA corrective action programs typically is borne solely by us. Over the next decade, we anticipate that significant ongoing expenditures for RCRA remediation activities may be required, but such annual expenditures for the near term are not expected to vary significantly from the range of such expenditures we have experienced over the past few years. Longer term expenditures are subject to considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly. We, from time to time, receive requests for information or notices of potential liability from the EPA and state environmental agencies alleging that we are a potentially responsible party under CERCLA or an equivalent state statute. On occasion, we also have been made a party to cost recovery litigation by those agencies or by private parties. These requests, notices and lawsuits assert potential liability for remediation costs at various sites that typically are not owned by us, but allegedly contain wastes attributable to our past operations. As of December 31, 2006, we reported we had been notified of potential liability under CERCLA and comparable state laws at 64 sites around the United States. At December 31, 2007, we had resolved five of these sites and had received nine new notices of potential liability, leaving 68 unresolved sites where we have been notified of potential liability. For most Superfund sites, our potential liability will be significantly less than the total site remediation costs because the percentage of waste attributable to us, versus that attributable to all other potentially responsible parties, is relatively low. Although liability of those potentially responsible is generally joint 83 Table of Contents and several for federal sites and frequently so for state sites, other potentially responsible parties at sites where we are a party typically have had the financial strength to meet their obligations, and where they have not, or where potentially responsible parties could not be located, our share of liability has not increased materially. Many of the sites at which we are potentially responsible are still under investigation by the EPA or the state agencies concerned. Prior to actual cleanup, those potentially responsible normally assess site conditions, apportion responsibility and determine the appropriate remediation. In some instances, we may have no liability or attain a settlement of liability. Actual cleanup costs generally occur after the parties obtain EPA or equivalent state agency approval. There are relatively few sites where we are a major participant, and given the timing and amounts of anticipated expenditures, neither the cost of remediation at those sites nor such costs at all CERCLA sites, in the aggregate, is expected to have a material adverse effect on our competitive or financial condition. Expensed environmental costs were $1,025 million in 2007 and are expected to be about $1.1 billion in 2008 and 2009. Capitalized environmental costs were $785 million in 2007 and are expected to be about $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion in 2008 and 2009, respectively. We accrue for remediation activities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and reasonable estimates of the liability can be made. These accrued liabilities are not reduced for potential recoveries from insurers or other third parties and are not discounted (except those assumed in a purchase business combination, which we do record on a discounted basis). Many of these liabilities result from CERCLA, RCRA and similar state laws that require us to undertake certain investigative and remedial activities at sites where we conduct, or once conducted, operations or at sites where ConocoPhillips generated waste was disposed. The accrual also includes a number of sites we identified that may require environmental remediation, but which are not currently the subject of CERCLA, RCRA or state enforcement activities. If applicable, we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third party recoveries. In the future, we may incur significant costs under both CERCLA and RCRA. Considerable uncertainty exists with respect to these costs, and under adverse changes in circumstances, potential liability may exceed amounts accrued as of December 31, 2007. Remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site, depending on the mix of unique site characteristics, evolving remediation technologies, diverse regulatory agencies and enforcement policies, and the presence or absence of potentially liable third parties. Therefore, it is difficult to develop reasonable estimates of future site remediation costs. At December 31, 2007, our balance sheet included total accrued environmental costs of $1,089 million, compared with $1,062 million at December 31, 2006. We expect to incur a substantial majority of these expenditures within the next 30 years. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, and as with other companies engaged in similar businesses, environmental costs and liabilities are inherent in our operations and products, and there can be no assurance that material costs and liabilities will not be incurred. However, we currently do not expect any material adverse effect upon our results of operations or financial position as a result of compliance with environmental laws and regulations. Other We have deferred tax assets related to certain accrued liabilities, loss carryforwards and credit carryforwards. Valuation allowances have been established to reduce these deferred tax assets to an amount that will, more likely than not, be realized. Uncertainties that may affect the realization of these assets include tax law changes and the future level of product prices and costs. Based on our historical taxable income, our expectations for the future, and available tax planning strategies, management expects 84 Table of Contents that the net deferred tax assets will be realized as offsets to reversing deferred tax liabilities and as reductions in future taxable income. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. This Statement defines fair value, establishes a framework for its measurement and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. We use fair value measurements to measure, among other items, purchased assets and investments, derivative contracts and financial guarantees. We also use them to assess impairment of properties, plants and equipment, intangible assets and goodwill. The Statement does not apply to share based payment transactions and inventory pricing. In February 2008, the FASB issued a FASB Staff Position (FSP) on Statement No. 157 that permits a one year delay of the effective date for all non financial assets and non financial liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). We will adopt this Statement effective January 1, 2008, with the exceptions allowed under the FSP described above and do not expect any significant impact to our consolidated financial statements, other than additional disclosures. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115. This Statement permits an entity to choose to measure financial instruments and certain other items similar to financial instruments at fair value, with all subsequent changes in fair value for the financial instrument reported in earnings. By electing the fair value option in conjunction with a derivative, an entity can achieve an accounting result similar to a fair value hedge without having to comply with complex hedge accounting rules. We will adopt this Statement effective January 1, 2008, and do not expect any significant impact to our consolidated financial statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (Revised), Business Combinations (SFAS No. 141(R)). This Statement will apply to all transactions in which an entity obtains control of one or more other businesses. In general, SFAS No. 141(R) requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize the fair value of all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction; establishes the acquisition date as the fair value measurement point; and modifies the disclosure requirements. This Statement applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after January 1, 2009. However, accounting for changes in valuation allowances for acquired deferred tax assets and the resolution of uncertain tax positions for prior business combinations will impact tax expense instead of impacting the prior business combination accounting starting January 1, 2009. We are currently evaluating the changes provided in this Statement. Also in December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements an amendment of ARB No. 51, which changes the classification of non controlling interests, sometimes called a minority interest, in the consolidated financial statements. Additionally, this Statement establishes a single method of accounting for changes in a parent companys ownership interest that do not result in deconsolidation and requires a parent company to recognize a gain or loss when a subsidiary is deconsolidated. This Statement is effective January 1, 2009, and will be applied prospectively with the exception of the presentation and disclosure requirements which must be applied retrospectively for all periods presented. We are currently evaluating the impact on our consolidated financial statements. 85 Table of Contents CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to select appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. See Note 1 Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for descriptions of our major accounting policies. Certain of these accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is a reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts would have been reported under different conditions, or if different assumptions had been used. These critical accounting estimates are discussed with the Audit and Finance Committee of the Board of Directors at least annually. We believe the following discussions of critical accounting estimates, along with the discussions of contingencies and of deferred tax asset valuation allowances in this report, address all important accounting areas where the nature of accounting estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change. Oil and Gas Accounting Accounting for oil and gas exploratory activity is subject to special accounting rules unique to the oil and gas industry. The acquisition of geological and geophysical seismic information, prior to the discovery of proved reserves, is expensed as incurred, similar to accounting for research and development costs. However, leasehold acquisition costs and exploratory well costs are capitalized on the balance sheet pending determination of whether proved oil and gas reserves have been discovered on the prospect. Property Acquisition Costs For individually significant leaseholds, management periodically assesses for impairment based on exploration and drilling efforts to date. For leasehold acquisition costs that individually are relatively small, management exercises judgment and determines a percentage probability that the prospect ultimately will fail to find proved oil and gas reserves and pools that leasehold information with others in the geographic area. For prospects in areas that have had limited, or no, previous exploratory drilling, the percentage probability of ultimate failure is normally judged to be quite high. This judgmental percentage is multiplied by the leasehold acquisition cost, and that product is divided by the contractual period of the leasehold to determine a periodic leasehold impairment charge that is reported in exploration expense. This judgmental probability percentage is reassessed and adjusted throughout the contractual period of the leasehold based on favorable or unfavorable exploratory activity on the leasehold or on adjacent leaseholds, and leasehold impairment amortization expense is adjusted prospectively. At year end 2007, the book value of the pools of property acquisition costs, that individually are relatively small and thus subject to the above described periodic leasehold impairment calculation, was $1,385 million and the accumulated impairment reserve was $429 million. The weighted average judgmental percentage probability of ultimate failure was approximately 65 percent and the weighted average amortization period was approximately 2.1 years. If that judgmental percentage were to be raised by 5 percent across all calculations, pretax leasehold impairment expense in 2008 would increase by approximately $29 million. The remaining $4,134 million of capitalized unproved property costs at year end 2007 consisted of individually significant leaseholds, mineral rights held in perpetuity by title ownership, exploratory wells currently drilling, and suspended exploratory wells. Management periodically assesses individually significant leaseholds for impairment based on the results of exploration and drilling efforts and the outlook for project commercialization. Of this amount, approximately $2 billion is concentrated in 10 major assets. Management expects less than $50 million to move to proved properties in 2008. Most of the $2 billion is associated with North America and Asia Pacific natural gas projects and North America oil sands projects, on which we continue to work with co venturers and regulatory agencies to develop. 86 Table of Contents Exploratory Costs For exploratory wells, drilling costs are temporarily capitalized, or suspended, on the balance sheet, pending a determination of whether potentially economic oil and gas reserves have been discovered by the drilling effort to justify completion of the find as a producing well. Once a determination is made the well did not encounter potentially economic oil and gas quantities, the well costs are expensed as a dry hole and reported in exploration expense. If exploratory wells encounter potentially economic quantities of oil and gas, the well costs remain capitalized on the balance sheet as long as sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made. The accounting notion of sufficient progress is a judgmental area, but the accounting rules do prohibit continued capitalization of suspended well costs on the mere chance that future market conditions will improve or new technologies will be found that would make the projects development economically profitable. Often, the ability to move the project into the development phase and record proved reserves is dependent on obtaining permits and government or co venturer approvals, the timing of which is ultimately beyond our control. Exploratory well costs remain suspended as long as the company is actively pursuing such approvals and permits and believes they will be obtained. Once all required approvals and permits have been obtained, the projects are moved into the development phase and the oil and gas reserves are designated as proved reserves. For complex exploratory discoveries, it is not unusual to have exploratory wells remain suspended on the balance sheet for several years while we perform additional appraisal drilling and seismic work on the potential oil and gas field, or we seek government or co venturer approval of development plans or seek environmental permitting. Management reviews suspended well balances quarterly, continuously monitors the results of the additional appraisal drilling and seismic work, and expenses the suspended well costs as a dry hole when it determines the potential field does not warrant further investment in the near term. Criteria utilized in making this determination include evaluation of the reservoir characteristics and hydrocarbon properties, expected development costs, ability to apply existing technology to produce the reserves, fiscal terms, regulations or contract negotiations, and our required return on investment. At year end 2007, total suspended well costs were $589 million, compared with $537 million at year end 2006. For additional information on suspended wells, including an aging analysis, see Note 11 Properties, Plants and Equipment, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Proved Oil and Gas Reserves and Canadian Syncrude Reserves Engineering estimates of the quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves in oil and gas fields and in place crude bitumen volumes in oil sand mining operations are inherently imprecise and represent only approximate amounts because of the subjective judgments involved in developing such information. Reserve estimates are based on subjective judgments involving geological and engineering assessments of in place hydrocarbon volumes, the production or mining plan, historical extraction recovery and processing yield factors, installed plant operating capacity and operating approval limits. The reliability of these estimates at any point in time depends on both the quality and quantity of the technical and economic data and the efficiency of extracting and processing the hydrocarbons. Despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates, accounting rules require disclosure of proved reserve estimates due to the importance of these estimates to better understand the perceived value and future cash flows of a companys EP operations. There are several authoritative guidelines regarding the engineering criteria that must be met before estimated reserves can be designated as proved. Our reservoir engineering organization has policies and procedures in place that are consistent with these authoritative guidelines. We have qualified and experienced internal engineering personnel who make these estimates for our EP segment. All of our proved crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids reserves held by consolidated companies have been estimated by ConocoPhillips. Our policy with respect to equity affiliates is either to estimate the 87 Table of Contents proved reserve quantities ourselves (applicable to those situations where we have a substantial engineering presence), or to rely on estimates prepared by the equity affiliate, and perform a reasonableness review of those assessments. Of the proved reserves attributable to equity affiliates at year end 2007, 38 percent was based on assessments of the available data performed by ConocoPhillips. The remaining 62 percent, reflecting our equity interest in LUKOIL, was based on estimates prepared by the equity affiliate. These equity affiliate prepared estimates are reviewed by ConocoPhillips and adjusted to comply with our internal reserves governance policies. Proved reserve estimates are updated annually and take into account recent production and sub surface information about each field or oil sand mining operation. Also, as required by authoritative guidelines, the estimated future date when a field or oil sand mining operation will be permanently shut down for economic reasons is based on an extrapolation of sales prices and operating costs prevalent at the balance sheet date. This estimated date when production will end affects the amount of estimated recoverable reserves. Therefore, as prices and cost levels change from year to year, the estimate of proved reserves also changes. Our proved reserves include estimated quantities related to production sharing contracts, which are reported under the economic interest method and are subject to fluctuations in prices of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids; recoverable operating expenses; and capital costs. If costs remain stable, reserve quantities attributable to recovery of costs will change inversely to changes in commodity prices. For example, if prices go up then our applicable reserve quantities would decline. The judgmental estimation of proved reserves also is important to the income statement because the proved oil and gas reserve estimate for a field or the estimated in place crude bitumen volume for an oil sand mining operation serves as the denominator in the unit of production calculation of depreciation, depletion and amortization of the capitalized costs for that asset. At year end 2007, the net book value of productive EP properties, plants and equipment subject to a unit of production calculation, including our Canadian Syncrude bitumen oil sand assets, was approximately $63 billion and the depreciation, depletion and amortization recorded on these assets in 2007 was approximately $6.9 billion. The estimated proved developed oil and gas reserves on these fields were 6.4 billion BOE at the beginning of 2007 and were 6.1 billion BOE at the end of 2007. The estimated proved reserves on the Canadian Syncrude assets were 243 million barrels at the beginning of 2007 and were 221 million barrels at the end of 2007. If the judgmental estimates of proved reserves used in the unit of production calculations had been lower by 5 percent across all calculations, pretax depreciation, depletion and amortization in 2007 would have been increased by an estimated $361 million. Impairments of producing oil and gas properties in 2007, 2006 and 2005 totaled $471 million, $215 million and $4 million, respectively. Of these write downs, $76 million in 2007, $131 million in 2006 and $1 million in 2005 were due to downward revisions of proved reserves. Impairment of Assets Long lived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in the future cash flows expected to be generated by an asset group. If, upon review, the sum of the undiscounted pretax cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset group, the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value. Individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes based on a judgmental assessment of the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets generally on a field by field basis for exploration and production assets, at an entire complex level for downstream assets, or at a site level for retail stores. Because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for long lived assets, the fair value usually is based on the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates commensurate with the risks involved in the asset group. The expected future cash flows 88 Table of Contents used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are based on judgmental assessments of future production volumes, prices and costs, considering all available information at the date of review. See Note 13 Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. Asset Retirement Obligations and Environmental Costs Under various contracts, permits and regulations, we have material legal obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore the land or seabed at the end of operations at operational sites. Our largest asset removal obligations involve removal and disposal of offshore oil and gas platforms around the world, oil and gas production facilities and pipelines in Alaska, and asbestos abatement at refineries. The fair values of obligations for dismantling and removing these facilities are accrued at the installation of the asset based on estimated discounted costs. Estimating the future asset removal costs necessary for this accounting calculation is difficult. Most of these removal obligations are many years, or decades, in the future and the contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what removal practices and criteria must be met when the removal event actually occurs. Asset removal technologies and costs are changing constantly, as well as political, environmental, safety and public relations considerations. In addition, under the above or similar contracts, permits and regulations, we have certain obligations to complete environmental related projects. These projects are primarily related to cleanup at domestic refineries and underground storage tanks at U.S. service stations, and remediation activities required by Canada and the state of Alaska at exploration and production sites. Future environmental remediation costs are difficult to estimate because they are subject to change due to such factors as the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs, the unknown time and extent of such remedial actions that may be required, and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other responsible parties. See Note 1 Accounting Policies, Note 14 Asset Retirement Obligations and Accrued Environmental Costs, and Note 18 Contingencies and Commitments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. Business Acquisitions Purchase Price Allocation Accounting for the acquisition of a business requires the allocation of the purchase price to the various assets and liabilities of the acquired business. For most assets and liabilities, purchase price allocation is accomplished by recording the asset or liability at its estimated fair value. The most difficult estimations of individual fair values are those involving properties, plants and equipment and identifiable intangible assets. We use all available information to make these fair value determinations. We have, if necessary, up to one year after the acquisition closing date to finish these fair value determinations and finalize the purchase price allocation. Intangible Assets and Goodwill At December 31, 2007, we had $731 million of intangible assets determined to have indefinite useful lives, thus they are not amortized. This judgmental assessment of an indefinite useful life has to be continuously evaluated in the future. If, due to changes in facts and circumstances, management determines that these intangible assets then have definite useful lives, amortization will have to commence at that time on a prospective basis. As long as these intangible assets are judged to have indefinite lives, they will be subject to periodic lower of cost or market tests that require managements judgment of the estimated fair value of these intangible assets. See Note 12 Goodwill and Intangibles, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. At December 31, 2007, we had $29.3 billion of goodwill recorded in conjunction with past business combinations. Under the accounting rules for goodwill, this intangible asset is not amortized. Instead, goodwill is subject to annual reviews for impairment at a reporting unit level. The reporting unit or units 89 Table of Contents used to evaluate and measure goodwill for impairment are determined primarily from the manner in which the business is managed. A reporting unit is an operating segment or a component that is one level below an operating segment. Prior to 2007, within our EP and our RM segments, we determined we had one and two reporting units, respectively, for purposes of assigning goodwill and testing for impairment. These were Worldwide Exploration and Production, Worldwide Refining and Worldwide Marketing. In December 2006, we announced a new business strategy for Worldwide Marketing to shift most of our marketing operations to a wholesale channel of trade and significantly increase the level of vertical integration between our refining and wholesale marketing operations. Because of this new business strategy, we plan to dispose of most of the retail outlets we operate or own. During 2007, the execution of this new business strategy was well under way and is expected to be fully in place by the end of 2008. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (SFAS No. 142), we have reassessed the reporting unit definitions within the RM segment based on this new business strategy and have concluded that the refining and marketing components within the RM segment now are economically similar enough to be aggregated into one reporting unit, Worldwide Refining and Marketing, beginning in 2007. No goodwill impairment would have been required in 2007 had we retained Worldwide Marketing as a separate reporting unit. If we later reorganize our businesses or management structure so that the components within our two reporting units are no longer economically similar, the reporting units would be revised and goodwill would be re assigned using a relative fair value approach in accordance with SFAS No. 142. Goodwill impairment testing at a lower reporting unit level could result in the recognition of impairment that would not otherwise be recognized at the current higher level of aggregation. In addition, the sale or disposition of a portion of these two reporting units will be allocated a portion of the reporting units goodwill, based on relative fair values, which will adjust the amount of gain or loss on the sale or disposition. When assessing the need for impairments on those sales and disposals, we take into consideration the anticipated allocation of goodwill and provisionally provide for its expected impairment upon final sale or disposal. Because quoted market prices for our reporting units are not available, management must apply judgment in determining the estimated fair value of these reporting units for purposes of performing the periodic goodwill impairment test. Management uses all available information to make these fair value determinations, including the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates commensurate with the risks involved in the assets and observed market multiples of operating cash flows and net income. In addition, if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than the book value (including the goodwill), further judgment must be applied in determining the fair values of individual assets and liabilities for purposes of the hypothetical purchase price allocation. Again, management must use all available information to make these fair value determinations. At year end 2007, the estimated fair values of our Worldwide Exploration and Production and Worldwide Refining and Marketing reporting units ranged from between 44 percent to 65 percent higher than recorded net book values (including goodwill) of the reporting units. However, a lower fair value estimate in the future for any of these reporting units could result in an impairment. Projected Benefit Obligations Determination of the projected benefit obligations for our defined benefit pension and postretirement plans are important to the recorded amounts for such obligations on the balance sheet and to the amount of benefit expense in the income statement. This also impacts the required company contributions into the plans. The actuarial determination of projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements involves judgment about uncertain future events, including estimated retirement dates, salary levels at retirement, mortality rates, lump sum election rates, rates of return on plan assets, future health care cost trend rates, and rates of utilization of health care services by retirees. Due to the specialized nature of these calculations, we engage outside actuarial firms to assist in the determination of these projected benefit obligations. For Employee Retirement Income Security Act qualified pension plans, the actuary exercises fiduciary care on behalf of plan participants in the determination of the judgmental assumptions used in 90 Table of Contents determining required company contributions into plan assets. Due to differing objectives and requirements between financial accounting rules and the pension plan funding regulations promulgated by governmental agencies, the actuarial methods and assumptions for the two purposes differ in certain important respects. Ultimately, we will be required to fund all promised benefits under pension and postretirement benefit plans not funded by plan assets or investment returns, but the judgmental assumptions used in the actuarial calculations significantly affect periodic financial statements and funding patterns over time. Benefit expense is particularly sensitive to the discount rate and return on plan assets assumptions. A 1 percent decrease in the discount rate would increase annual benefit expense by $100 million, while a 1 percent decrease in the return on plan assets assumption would increase annual benefit expense by $55 million. In determining the discount rate, we use yields on high quality fixed income investments (including among other things, Moodys Aa corporate bond yields) with adjustments as needed to match the estimated benefit cash flows of our plans. OUTLOOK Alaska In late 2007, we submitted a proposal to the governor of Alaska to advance the development of the Alaska Natural Gas Pipeline Project. The proposed pipeline would transport approximately 4 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas from the Alaska North Slope to markets in Canada and the United States. We have a 36.1 percent non operator interest in the Greater Prudhoe Area fields that are expected to be a primary source of natural gas to be shipped in the proposed pipeline. Our proposal was submitted as an alternative to the process the Alaska Legislature established in its Alaska Gasline Inducement Act (AGIA). In our proposal, we stated our willingness to make significant investments, without state matching funds, to advance this project. In January 2008, we received a letter from the governor of Alaska stating our alternative does not give the state a reason to deviate from the AGIA process. We formally responded to the governors letter on January 24, 2008. As a result of the lack of engagement by the state of Alaska on our proposal, we are reassessing how best to advance the Alaska natural gas pipeline project. During this reassessment, as an initial step we will continue planning and contracting efforts in preparation for route reconnaissance and environmental studies starting in June 2008. We expect to continue to testify before the Alaska Legislature and engage the Alaska public with our view of the best path forward to advance the gas pipeline project. Venezuela Negotiations continue between ConocoPhillips and Venezuelan authorities concerning appropriate compensation for the expropriation of the companys oil interests. We continue to preserve all our rights with respect to this situation, including our rights under the contracts we signed and under international and Venezuelan law. We continue to evaluate our options in realizing adequate compensation for the value of our oil investments and operations in Venezuela and filed a request for international arbitration on November 2, 2007, with the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), an arm of the World Bank. The request was registered by ICSID on December 13, 2007. Canada On October 25, 2007, the Alberta provincial government publicly announced its intention to make a change to the royalty structure for Crown lands, effective January 1, 2009. Although the governments proposed change will require legislative and regulatory amendments to become effective and may be further modified before final adoption, there is a high likelihood there will be some form of change to the royalty structure in Alberta. While the precise impact of the proposed change is not determinable at this time, the adoption of the proposed royalty structure could result in a range of outcomes, including a negative adjustment to our Canadian reserve base. This change will impact both our conventional western Canada natural gas business and our oil sands operations. 91 Table of Contents CAUTIONARY STATEMENT FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE SAFE HARBOR PROVISIONS OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995 This report includes forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

We caution you these statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions we cannot predict. In addition, we based many of these forward looking statements on assumptions about future events that may prove to be inaccurate. Accordingly, our actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what we have expressed or forecast in the forward looking statements. Any differences could result from a variety of factors, including the following: Fluctuations in crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices, refining and marketing margins and margins for our chemicals business. Potential failure or delays in achieving expected reserve or production levels from existing and future oil and gas development projects due to operating hazards, drilling risks and the inherent uncertainties in predicting oil and gas reserves and oil and gas reservoir performance. Unsuccessful exploratory drilling activities or the inability to obtain access to exploratory acreage. Failure of new products and services to achieve market acceptance. Unexpected changes in costs or technical requirements for constructing, modifying or operating facilities for exploration and production projects, manufacturing or refining. Unexpected technological or commercial difficulties in manufacturing, refining, or transporting our products, including synthetic crude oil and chemicals products. Lack of, or disruptions in, adequate and reliable transportation for our crude oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids, LNG and refined products. Inability to timely obtain or maintain permits, including those necessary for construction of LNG terminals or regasification facilities, comply with government regulations, or make capital expenditures required to maintain compliance. Failure to complete definitive agreements and feasibility studies for, and to timely complete construction of, announced and future LNG and refinery projects and related facilities. Potential disruption or interruption of our operations due to accidents, extraordinary weather events, civil unrest, political events or terrorism. International monetary conditions and exchange controls. Substantial investment or reduced demand for products as a result of existing or future environmental rules and regulations. Liability for remedial actions, including removal and reclamation obligations, under environmental regulations. Liability resulting from litigation. General domestic and international economic and political developments, including: armed hostilities; expropriation of assets; changes in governmental policies relating to crude oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids or refined product pricing, regulation, or taxation; other political, economic or diplomatic developments; and international monetary fluctuations. Changes in tax and other laws, regulations (including alternative energy mandates), or royalty rules applicable to our business. 92 Table of Contents Inability to obtain economical financing for projects, construction or modification of facilities and general corporate purposes. The operation and financing of our midstream and chemicals joint ventures. The factors generally described in the Risk Factors section included in Items 1 and 2 Business and Properties in this report. 93 Table of Contents Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Financial Instrument Market Risk We and certain of our subsidiaries hold and issue derivative contracts and financial instruments that expose our cash flows or earnings to changes in commodity prices, foreign exchange rates or interest rates. We may use financial and commodity based derivative contracts to manage the risks produced by changes in the prices of electric power, natural gas, crude oil and related products, fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, or to exploit market opportunities. Our use of derivative instruments is governed by an Authority Limitations document approved by our Board of Directors that prohibits the use of highly leveraged derivatives or derivative instruments without sufficient liquidity for comparable valuations without approval from the Chief Executive Officer. The Authority Limitations document also authorizes the Chief Executive Officer to establish the maximum Value at Risk (VaR) limits for the company and compliance with these limits is monitored daily. The Chief Financial Officer monitors risks resulting from foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, while the Senior Vice President of Commercial monitors commodity price risk. Both report to the Chief Executive Officer. The Commercial organization manages our commercial marketing, optimizes our commodity flows and positions, monitors related risks of our upstream and downstream businesses, and selectively takes price risk to add value. Commodity Price Risk We operate in the worldwide crude oil, refined products, natural gas, natural gas liquids, and electric power markets and are exposed to fluctuations in the prices for these commodities. These fluctuations can affect our revenues, as well as the cost of operating, investing, and financing activities. Generally, our policy is to remain exposed to the market prices of commodities; however, executive management may elect to use derivative instruments to hedge the price risk of our crude oil and natural gas production, as well as refinery margins. Our Commercial organization uses futures, forwards, swaps, and options in various markets to optimize the value of our supply chain, which may move our risk profile away from market average prices to accomplish the following objectives: Balance physical systems. In addition to cash settlement prior to contract expiration, exchange traded futures contracts also may be settled by physical delivery of the commodity, providing another source of supply to meet our refinery requirements or marketing demand. Meet customer needs. Consistent with our policy to generally remain exposed to market prices, we use swap contracts to convert fixed price sales contracts, which are often requested by natural gas and refined product consumers, to a floating market price. Manage the risk to our cash flows from price exposures on specific crude oil, natural gas, refined product and electric power transactions. Enable us to use the market knowledge gained from these activities to do a limited amount of trading not directly related to our physical business. For the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, the gains or losses from this activity were not material to our cash flows or net income. We use a VaR model to estimate the loss in fair value that could potentially result on a single day from the effect of adverse changes in market conditions on the derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments held or issued, including commodity purchase and sales contracts recorded on the balance sheet at December 31, 2007, as derivative instruments in accordance with SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended (SFAS No. 133). Using Monte Carlo simulation, a 95 percent confidence level and a one day holding period, the VaR for those 94 Table of Contents instruments issued or held for trading purposes at December 31, 2007 and 2006, was immaterial to our net income and cash flows. The VaR for instruments held for purposes other than trading at December 31, 2007 and 2006, was also immaterial to our net income and cash flows. Interest Rate Risk The following tables provide information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in short term U.S. interest rates. The debt table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates. Weighted average variable rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at the reporting date. The carrying amount of our floating rate debt approximates its fair value. The fair value of the fixed rate financial instruments is estimated based on quoted market prices.

Under SFAS No. 133, these swaps were designated as hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of $350 million of 4.75% Notes due 2012. This hedge was terminated in December 2007, when we sold our positions in the swaps for approximately $3 million. 95 Table of Contents The following table presents principal cash flows of the fixed rate 5.3 percent joint venture acquisition obligation owed to FCCL Oil Sands Partnership. The fair value of the obligation is estimated based on the net present value of the future cash flows, discounted at a year end 2007 effective yield rate of 4.9 percent, based on yields of U.S. Treasury securities of a similar average duration adjusted for ConocoPhillips average credit risk spread and the amortizing nature of the obligation principal.

We do not comprehensively hedge the exposure to currency rate changes, although we may choose to selectively hedge exposures to foreign currency rate risk. Examples include firm commitments for capital projects, certain local currency tax payments and dividends, and cash returns from net investments in foreign affiliates to be remitted within the coming year. 96 Table of Contents At December 31, 2007 and 2006, we held foreign currency swaps hedging short term intercompany loans between European subsidiaries and a U.S. subsidiary. Although these swaps hedge exposures to fluctuations in exchange rates, we elected not to utilize hedge accounting as allowed by SFAS No. 133. As a result, the change in the fair value of these foreign currency swaps is recorded directly in earnings. Since the gain or loss on the swaps is offset by the gain or loss from remeasuring the intercompany loans into the functional currency of the lender or borrower, there would be no material impact to income from an adverse hypothetical 10 percent change in the December 31, 2007 or 2006, exchange rates. The notional and fair market values of these positions at December 31, 2007 and 2006, were as follows: In Millions Foreign Currency Swaps Notional* Fair Market Value** 2007 2006 2007 2006 Sell U.S. dollar, buy euro USD 744 242 $ 3 5 Sell U.S. dollar, buy British pound USD 1,049 647 (16 ) 20 Sell U.S. dollar, buy Canadian dollar USD 1,195 1,367 13 (19 ) Sell U.S. dollar, buy Czech koruna USD 7 Sell U.S. dollar, buy Danish krone USD 20 17 Sell U.S. dollar, buy Norwegian kroner USD 779 1,145 15 15 Sell U.S. dollar, buy Swedish krona USD 11 108 Sell U.S. dollar, buy Slovakia koruna USD 2 Sell U.S. dollar, buy Hungary forint USD 4 Sell euro, buy Norwegian kroner EUR 10 Sell euro, buy Canadian dollar EUR 58 Buy euro, sell British pound EUR 1 125 3 *Denominated in U.S. dollars (USD) and euro (EUR). **Denominated in U.S. dollars.
