BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW ConocoPhillips is an international, integrated energy company. We are the third largest integrated energy company in the United States, based on market capitalization. We have approximately 33,800 employees worldwide, and at year end 2008 had assets of $143 billion. Our stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol COP. Our business is organized into six operating segments: Exploration and Production (EP) This segment primarily explores for, produces, transports and markets crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids on a worldwide basis. Midstream This segment gathers, processes and markets natural gas produced by ConocoPhillips and others, and fractionates and markets natural gas liquids, predominantly in the United States and Trinidad. The Midstream segment primarily consists of our 50 percent equity investment in DCP Midstream, LLC. Refining and Marketing (RM) This segment purchases, refines, markets and transports crude oil and petroleum products, mainly in the United States, Europe and Asia. LUKOIL Investment This segment consists of our equity investment in the ordinary shares of OAO LUKOIL, an international, integrated oil and gas company headquartered in Russia. At December 31, 2008, our ownership interest was 20 percent based on issued shares and 20.06 percent based on estimated shares outstanding. Chemicals This segment manufactures and markets petrochemicals and plastics on a worldwide basis. The Chemicals segment consists of our 50 percent equity investment in Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC (CPChem). Emerging Businesses This segment represents our investment in new technologies or businesses outside our normal scope of operations. 33 Table of Contents In 2008, the energy industry was characterized by extreme volatility. Forecasts of worldwide economic growth and increasingly scarce supply, a weakening U.S. dollar, and other factors helped drive crude oil prices to record highs. This was followed by an abrupt shift into a severe global financial recession, which reduced current and forecasted demand for petroleum products. Because of this, crude oil prices fell rapidly and refining margins also significantly weakened. As a result of the significant drop in global equity markets during the fourth quarter of 2008, we recorded two individually significant impairments in 2008 that were primarily linked to market capitalizations a $25.4 billion write down of our EP segments recorded goodwill, and a $7.4 billion reduction in the carrying value of our LUKOIL investment. These impairments contributed to a net loss in 2008 of $17.0 billion, compared with net income in 2007 of $11.9 billion, which includes the impact of a $4.5 billion impairment due to expropriation of our Venezuelan assets. Since these 2008 and 2007 impairment charges were noncash, they did not impact our cash provided by operating activities, which was $22.7 billion in 2008, compared with $24.6 billion in 2007. Crude oil and natural gas prices, along with refining margins, are the most significant factors in our profitability, and are driven by market factors over which we have no control. However, from a competitive perspective, there are other important factors we must manage well to be successful, including: Operating our producing properties and refining and marketing operations safely, consistently and in an environmentally sound manner. Safety is our first priority, and we are committed to protecting the health and safety of everyone who has a role in our operations and the communities in which we operate. Maintaining high utilization rates at our refineries and minimizing downtime in producing fields enable us to capture the value available in the market in terms of prices and margins. During 2008, our worldwide refining capacity utilization rate was 90 percent, compared with 94 percent in 2007. The lower rate primarily reflects reduced throughput at our Wilhelmshaven, Germany, refinery due to economic conditions, as well as higher unplanned downtime including impacts from hurricanes in the U.S. Gulf Coast region. Concerning the environment, we strive to conduct our operations in a manner consistent with our environmental stewardship principles. Adding to our proved reserve base. We primarily add to our proved reserve base in three ways: Successful exploration and development of new fields. Acquisition of existing fields. Applying new technologies and processes to improve recovery from existing fields. Through a combination of all three methods listed above, we have been successful in the past in maintaining or adding to our production and proved reserve base. Although it cannot be assured, we anticipate being able to do so in the future. In the three years ending December 31, 2008, our reserve replacement was 124 percent, including the impacts of the Burlington Resources acquisition, additional equity investments in LUKOIL, the FCCL Oil Sands Partnership with EnCana, the Australia Pacific LNG joint venture with Origin Energy, and the expropriation of our Venezuelan oil assets. Access to additional resources has become increasingly difficult as direct investment is prohibited in some nations, while fiscal and other terms in other countries can make projects uneconomic or unattractive. In addition, political instability, competition from national oil companies, and lack of access to high potential areas due to environmental or other regulation may negatively impact our ability to increase our reserve base. As such, the timing and level at which we add to our reserve base may, or may not, allow us to replace our production over subsequent years. Controlling costs and expenses. Since we cannot control the prices of the commodity products we sell, controlling operating and overhead costs, within the context of our commitment to safety and environmental stewardship, are high priorities. We monitor these costs using various methodologies that are reported to senior management monthly, on both an absolute dollar basis and a per unit basis. Because managing operating and overhead costs is critical to maintaining competitive positions in our 34 Table of Contents industries, cost control is a component of our variable compensation programs. In response to the current depressed market environment, we expect to reduce our work force in 2009, reduce the headcount of contractors, and continue to emphasize cost discipline throughout our operations. With the rise in commodity prices over the last several years and through the first half of 2008, and the subsequent increase in industry wide spending on capital and major maintenance programs, we and other energy companies experienced inflation for the costs of certain goods and services in excess of general worldwide inflationary trends. Such costs included rates for drilling rigs, steel and other raw materials, as well as costs for skilled labor. With the weakening of the economy and the decline in commodity prices, our industry began to see some relief from this upward cost pressure in late 2008 and into early 2009. Selecting the appropriate projects in which to invest our capital dollars. We participate in capital intensive industries. As a result, we must often invest significant capital dollars to explore for new oil and gas fields, develop newly discovered fields, maintain existing fields, or continue to maintain and improve our refinery complexes. We invest in those projects that are expected to provide an adequate financial return on invested dollars. However, there are often long lead times from the time we make an investment to the time that investment is operational and begins generating financial returns. In October 2008, we formed Australia Pacific LNG, a 50/50 joint venture with Origin Energy for the development of coalbed natural gas in Australia, and the subsequent liquefaction and transport of the liquefied natural gas targeting Asia Pacific markets. In January 2007, we entered into two 50/50 business ventures with EnCana to create an integrated North American heavy oil business, consisting of the upstream FCCL Oil Sands Partnership in Canada and the downstream WRB Refining LLC in the United States. Our capital expenditures and investments in 2008 totaled $19.1 billion, and we anticipate capital expenditures and investments to be approximately $11.7 billion in 2009. The reduced capital budget in 2009 reflects the impact of the Origin transaction on the 2008 totals, and a planned reduction in response to current market conditions. In addition to our capital program, we paid dividends on our common stock of $2.9 billion in 2008, and repurchased $8.2 billion of our common stock. Managing our asset portfolio. We continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire assets that will contribute to future growth at competitive prices. The 2006 Burlington Resources acquisition, the 2007 EnCana business ventures, and the 2008 Origin Energy joint venture are examples of such activity. We also continually assess our assets to determine if any no longer fit our strategic plans and should be sold or otherwise disposed. This management of our asset portfolio is important to ensuring our long term growth and maintaining adequate financial returns. In 2008, we completed the disposition of our retail marketing assets in Norway, Sweden and Denmark, and we also sold all of our EP properties in Argentina and the Netherlands. We closed on the sale of a large part of our U.S. retail marketing assets in January 2009. Developing and retaining a talented work force. We strive to attract, train, develop and retain individuals with the knowledge and skills to implement our business strategy and who support our values and ethics. Throughout the company, we focus on the continued learning, development and technical training of our employees. Professional new hires participate in structured development programs designed to accelerate their technical and functional skills. Our key performance indicators are shown in the statistical tables provided at the beginning of the operating segment sections that follow. These include crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices and production, refining capacity utilization, and refinery output. 35 Table of Contents Other significant factors that can affect our profitability include: Impairments. As mentioned above, we participate in capital intensive industries. At times, our investments become impaired when our reserve estimates are revised downward, when crude oil or natural gas prices, or refinery margins decline significantly for long periods of time, or when a decision to dispose of an asset leads to a write down to its fair market value. We may also invest large amounts of money in exploration blocks which, if exploratory drilling proves unsuccessful, could lead to a material impairment of leasehold values. Before tax impairments in 2008, excluding the goodwill impairment discussed below and a $7.4 billion impairment related to our LUKOIL investment, totaled $1.7 billion. This amount compares with $0.4 billion of impairments, excluding the impairment of expropriated assets (discussed below), in 2007. Goodwill. At year end 2008, we had $3.8 billion of goodwill on our balance sheet, compared with $29.3 billion at year end 2007. In 2008, we recorded a $25.4 billion complete impairment of our EP segment goodwill, primarily as a function of decreased year end commodity prices and the decline in our market capitalization. For additional information, see Note 9 Goodwill and Intangibles, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Deterioration of market conditions in the future could lead to other goodwill impairments that may have a substantial negative, though noncash, effect on our profitability. Effective tax rate. Our operations are located in countries with different tax rates and fiscal structures. Accordingly, even in a stable commodity price and fiscal/regulatory environment, our overall effective tax rate can vary significantly between periods based on the mix of pretax earnings within our global operations. Fiscal and regulatory environment. As commodity prices and refining margins fluctuated upward over the last several years, certain governments have responded with changes to their fiscal take. These changes have generally negatively impacted our results of operations, and further changes to government fiscal take could have a negative impact on future operations. In June 2007, our Venezuelan oil projects were expropriated, and we recorded a $4.5 billion after tax impairment (see the Expropriated Assets section of Note 10 Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). The company was also negatively impacted by increased production taxes enacted by the state of Alaska in the fourth quarter of 2007. In October 2007, the government of Ecuador increased the tax rate of the Windfall Profits Tax Law implemented in 2006, increasing the amount of government royalty entitlement on crude oil production to 99 percent of any increase in the price of crude oil above a contractual reference price. In Canada, the Alberta provincial government changed the royalty structure for Crown lands, effective January 1, 2009, so that a component of the new royalty rate is tied to prevailing prices. In October 2008, we and our co venturers signed definitive agreements for the proportional dilution of our equity interests in the Republic of Kazakhstans North Caspian Sea Production Sharing Agreement, which includes the Kashagan field, to allow the state owned energy company to increase its ownership percentage effective January 1, 2008. Partially offsetting the above fiscal take increases were lower corporate income tax rates enacted by Canada and Germany during 2007. These tax rate reductions applied to all corporations and were not exclusive to the oil and gas industry. 36 Table of Contents Segment Analysis The EP segments results are most closely linked to crude oil and natural gas prices. These are commodity products, the prices of which are subject to factors external to our company and over which we have no control. Industry crude oil prices for West Texas Intermediate (WTI) were higher in 2008, compared with 2007, averaging $99.56 per barrel in 2008, an increase of 38 percent. The increase was driven by concerns during the first half of 2008 of adequate supplies given the strong oil demand growth in developing Asia and the Middle East. The average annual price for WTI moderated due to the economic crisis in the second half of 2008 that impacted demand from all regions of the world. Industry natural gas prices for Henry Hub increased 32 percent during 2008 to an average price of $9.04 per million British thermal units (MMBTU), primarily due to increased demand from the industrial and electric power sector during the first half of 2008 and higher oil prices. These factors were moderated by higher domestic production and lower demand, which led to higher storage in the second half of 2008. The Midstream segments results are most closely linked to natural gas liquids prices. The most important factor on the profitability of this segment is the results from our 50 percent equity investment in DCP Midstream. DCP Midstreams natural gas liquids prices increased 11 percent in 2008. Refining margins, refinery utilization, cost control and marketing margins primarily drive the RM segments results. Refining margins are subject to movements in the cost of crude oil and other feedstocks, and the sales prices for refined products, both of which are subject to market factors over which we have no control. Industry refining margins in the United States were lower overall in comparison with 2007. The primary factor contributing to the reduced refining margins in 2008 was a decrease in gasoline demand. The LUKOIL Investment segment consists of our investment in the ordinary shares of LUKOIL. At December 31, 2008, our ownership interest in LUKOIL was 20 percent based on issued shares and 20.06 percent based on estimated shares outstanding. LUKOILs results are subject to factors similar to those of our EP and RM segments. LUKOILs upstream results are closely linked to Russian (Urals) crude oil prices and are heavily impacted by extraction tax rates. Refining margins are significant factors on LUKOILs downstream results. Export tariff rates for crude oil and refined products also have a significant impact on both upstream and downstream results. The Chemicals segment consists of our 50 percent interest in CPChem. The chemicals and plastics industry is mainly a commodity based industry where the margins for key products are based on market factors over which CPChem has little or no control. CPChem is investing in feedstock advantaged areas in the Middle East with access to large, growing markets, such as Asia. The Emerging Businesses segment represents our investment in new technologies or businesses outside our normal scope of operations. Activities within this segment are currently focused on power generation and innovation of new technologies, such as those related to conventional and nonconventional hydrocarbon recovery (including heavy oil), refining, alternative energy, biofuels and the environment. Some of these technologies have the potential to become important drivers of profitability in future years. 37 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Consolidated Results A summary of the companys net income (loss) by business segment follows: Millions of Dollars Years Ended December 31 2008 2007 2006 Exploration and Production (EP) $ (13,479 ) 4,615 9,848 Midstream 541 453 476 Refining and Marketing (RM) 2,322 5,923 4,481 LUKOIL Investment (5,488 ) 1,818 1,425 Chemicals 110 359 492 Emerging Businesses 30 (8 ) 15 Corporate and Other (1,034 ) (1,269 ) (1,187 ) Net income (loss) $ (16,998 ) 11,891 15,550 2008 vs. 2007 The lower results in 2008 were primarily the result of: A $25,443 million before and after tax goodwill impairment of all EP segment goodwill. This impairment was recorded during the fourth quarter. A $7,410 million before and after tax impairment of our LUKOIL investment taken during the fourth quarter. Lower U.S. refining margins in our RM segment. An increase in other asset impairments, predominantly in our EP and RM segments. These items were partially offset by: Higher crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices, benefiting our EP, Midstream and LUKOIL Investment segments. Commodity price benefits were somewhat counteracted by increased production taxes. A 2007 complete impairment ($4,588 million before tax, $4,512 million after tax) of our oil interests in Venezuela, resulting from their expropriation on June 26, 2007. 2007 vs. 2006 The lower results in 2007 were primarily the result of: The complete impairment of our oil interests in Venezuela. Lower crude oil production in the EP segment. Higher production and operating expenses, higher production taxes, and higher depreciation, depletion and amortization expense in the EP segment. These items were partially offset by: The net benefit of asset rationalization efforts in the EP and RM segments. Higher realized crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids prices in the EP segment. Higher realized worldwide refining margins, including the benefit of planned inventory reductions, in the RM segment. Increased equity earnings from our investment in LUKOIL due to higher estimated commodity prices and volumes, and an increase in our average equity ownership percentage. 38 Table of Contents Statement of Operations Analysis 2008 vs. 2007 Sales and other operating revenues increased 28 percent in 2008, while purchased crude oil, natural gas and products increased 37 percent. These increases were mainly the result of higher petroleum product prices and higher prices for crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids. Equity in earnings of affiliates decreased 16 percent in 2008, reflecting: Lower results from WRB Refining LLC, due to lower margins and a decline in equity ownership in accordance with the designed formation of the venture. Lower results from CPChem, due to higher operating costs, lower specialties, aromatics and styrenics margins, and lower olefins and polyolefins volumes. The absence of earnings from our heavy oil joint ventures expropriated by Venezuela in 2007. Increased losses related to our Naryanmarneftegaz (NMNG) joint venture as a result of higher production taxes and increased depreciation, depletion and amortization (DDA) costs during the startup and early production phase of the Yuzhno Khylchuyu (YK) field. These negative results were somewhat offset by improved results from the FCCL Oil Sands Partnership, DCP Midstream, LUKOIL (excluding the investment impairment), and CFJ Properties. Other income decreased 45 percent during 2008, mainly due to a lower net benefit from asset rationalization efforts, the release in 2007 of escrowed funds associated with our Hamaca joint venture in Venezuela, and the settlement of retroactive adjustments for crude oil quality differentials on Trans Alaska Pipeline System shipments (Quality Bank) in 2007. Exploration expenses increased 33 percent during 2008, reflecting increased dry hole costs and higher expenses for post discovery feasibility and development planning studies. Impairments increased from $5,030 million in 2007 to $34,539 million in 2008. This increase reflects a $25,443 million goodwill impairment recorded during 2008 in our EP segment. Also contributing to the increase was a $7,410 million impairment of our LUKOIL investment taken during 2008. These 2008 impairments were partially offset by a 2007 impairment of $4,588 million related to the expropriation of our oil interests in Venezuela. Other impairments increased $1,244 million during 2008 primarily due to property impairments taken in response to a significantly diminished outlook for crude oil and natural gas prices, refining margins and power spreads, as well as in response to revised capital spending plans. For additional information, see Note 7 Investments, Loans, and Long Term Receivables, Note 9 Goodwill and Intangibles, and Note 10 Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Interest and debt expense decreased 25 percent in 2008, primarily due to lower average interest rates, as well as the absence of 2007 interest expense related to the Alaska Quality Bank settlements. Foreign currency transaction losses incurred during 2008 totaled $117 million, compared with foreign currency transaction gains of $201 million in 2007. This change occurred as the Canadian dollar, Russian rouble, British pound, and euro all weakened against the U.S. dollar during 2008, compared with the strengthening of these currencies against the U.S. dollar in 2007. See Note 21 Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for information regarding our income tax expense and effective tax rate. 39 Table of Contents 2007 vs. 2006 Equity in earnings of affiliates increased 21 percent in 2007. The increase reflects earnings from WRB and FCCL, our downstream and upstream business ventures with EnCana, formed in January 2007. Also, we had improved results from LUKOIL, reflecting higher estimated commodity prices and volumes, and an increase in our average equity ownership percentage. These increases were partially offset by lower earnings from Hamaca and Petrozuata, our heavy oil joint ventures expropriated by Venezuela in the second quarter of 2007. Additionally, CPChem reported lower earnings, primarily due to lower olefins and polyolefins margins. Other income increased 188 percent during 2007, primarily due to: Higher net gains on asset dispositions associated with asset rationalization efforts. The release in 2007 of escrowed funds related to the extinguishment of Hamaca project financing. The Alaska Quality Bank settlements in 2007. These increases were partially offset by the recognition in 2006 of recoveries on business interruption insurance claims attributable to losses sustained from hurricanes in 2005. Exploration expenses increased 21 percent during 2007, primarily reflecting the amortization of unproved North American leaseholds obtained in the Burlington Resources acquisition and the impairment of an international exploration license. The increase also reflects higher geological and geophysical expenses and higher dry hole costs. Depreciation, depletion and amortization increased 14 percent during 2007, primarily resulting from the addition of Burlington Resources assets in the EP segments depreciable asset base for a full year in 2007 versus only nine months in 2006. Impairments reflects an impairment of $4,588 million related to the expropriation of our oil interests in Venezuela recorded in the second quarter of 2007. Impairments unrelated to the expropriation decreased 35 percent during 2007, primarily due to impairments recorded in 2006 of certain assets held for sale in the RM segment, comprised of properties, plants and equipment, trademark intangibles and goodwill. Interest and debt expense increased 15 percent during 2007, primarily due to the interest expense component of the Alaska Quality Bank settlements, as well as higher expense associated with the funding requirements for the business venture with EnCana. Foreign currency transaction gains during 2007 primarily reflect the strengthening of the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar. 40 Table of Contents Segment Results EP 2008 2007 2006 Millions of Dollars Net Income (Loss) Alaska $ 2,315 2,255 2,347 Lower 48 2,673 1,993 2,001 United States 4,988 4,248 4,348 International 6,976 367 5,500 Goodwill impairment (25,443 ) $ (13,479 ) 4,615 9,848 Dollars Per Unit Average Sales Prices Crude oil (per barrel) United States $ 97.47 68.00 61.09 International 93.30 70.79 63.38 Total consolidated 95.15 69.47 62.39 Equity affiliates* 63.89 45.31 46.01 Worldwide EP 93.12 67.11 60.37 Natural gas (per thousand cubic feet) United States 7.67 5.98 6.11 International 8.76 6.51 6.27 Total consolidated 8.28 6.26 6.20 Equity affiliates* 2.04 .30 .30 Worldwide EP 8.27 6.26 6.19 Natural gas liquids (per barrel) United States 55.63 46.00 40.35 International 59.70 48.80 42.89 Total consolidated 57.43 47.13 41.50 Worldwide EP 57.43 47.13 41.50 Average Production Costs Per Barrel of Oil Equivalent** United States $ 8.34 6.52 5.43 International 8.08 7.68 5.65 Total consolidated 8.20 7.13 5.55 Equity affiliates* 13.51 8.92 5.83 Worldwide EP 8.37 7.21 5.57 * Excludes our equity share of LUKOIL, which is reported in the LUKOIL Investment segment. ** For information on taxes other than income taxes per barrel of oil equivalent, see the Statistics section of the supplemental Oil and Gas Operations disclosure.

It also mines deposits of oil sands in Canada to extract the bitumen and upgrade it into a synthetic crude oil. At December 31, 2008, our EP operations were producing in the United States, Norway, the United Kingdom, Canada, Ecuador, Australia, offshore Timor Leste in the Timor Sea, Indonesia, China, Vietnam, Libya, Nigeria, Algeria and Russia. 2008 vs. 2007 The EP segment recorded a net loss of $13,479 million during 2008. This amount includes a $25,443 million before and after tax complete impairment of EP segment goodwill. In 2007, the EP segment had net income of $4,615 million, which includes the impact of a $4,588 million before tax impairment ($4,512 million after tax) related to the expropriation of our oil interests in Venezuela. For additional information, see the Goodwill Impairment section of Note 9 Goodwill and Intangibles, and the Expropriated Assets section of Note 10 Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which are incorporated herein by reference. The decrease in net income was attributed to the goodwill impairment, higher taxes other than income (mainly in Alaska), lower production volumes, higher operating and exploration costs, increased impairments and depreciation expense, and the absence of a 2007 benefit related to release of escrowed funds associated with our Hamaca joint venture in Venezuela. The decrease was partially offset by the absence of the 2007 Venezuela impairment, as well as higher crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices. During 2008, our EP segment recognized property impairment charges totaling $511 million after tax, mostly due to revised capital spending plans as a result of current project economics, as well as a significantly diminished outlook for commodity prices. A large portion of these impairments relate to fields in the U.S. Lower 48 and Canada. EPs results for 2008 reflect an average realized worldwide selling price of $93.12 per barrel of crude oil. In contrast, our average realized worldwide crude oil price per barrel in December 2008 was $37.23. If average crude oil prices in 2009 do not increase appreciably from the low levels at year end 2008, we would expect EPs 2009 results to be negatively impacted. Proved reserves at year end 2008 were 8.08 billion barrels of oil equivalent (BOE), compared with 8.72 billion at year end 2007. This excludes the estimated 1,893 million BOE and 1,838 million BOE included in the LUKOIL Investment segment at year end 2008 and 2007, respectively. Also excluded is our share of Canadian Syncrude, which was 249 million barrels at year end 2008, compared with 221 million at year end 2007. U.S. EP Net income from our U.S. EP operations increased 17 percent, primarily due to higher crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices. The increase was partially offset by higher production taxes (mainly in Alaska), lower volumes, an increase in impairments of properties in the Lower 48, and higher operating costs. EP production on a BOE basis averaged 775,000 per day in 2008, a decrease of 8 percent from 843,000 in 2007. The production decrease was primarily due to field decline and unplanned downtime in the Lower 48 reflecting the impact of hurricane disruptions. International EP Net income from our international EP operations increased from $367 million in 2007 to $6,976 million in 2008. The increase was attributed to the impact of the Venezuelan impairment on our prior year results and higher crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices. The increase was partially offset by higher depreciation expense due to increased rates and new assets being placed in service, increased taxes other than income, higher operating costs, and the absence of a 2007 benefit related to release of escrowed funds associated with our Hamaca joint venture in Venezuela. International EP production averaged 992,000 BOE per day in 2008, a decrease of 2 percent from 1,014,000 in 2007. Decreases in production were caused by field decline and the expropriation of our Venezuelan oil interests. These decreases were mostly offset by increased production from new developments 43 Table of Contents in the United Kingdom, Indonesia, Russia, Norway and Canada. Our Syncrude mining operations produced 22,000 barrels per day in 2008, compared with 23,000 barrels per day in 2007. In regards to our Venezuelan assets expropriated during 2007, we filed a request for international arbitration on November 2, 2007, with the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), an arm of the World Bank. The request was registered by ICSID on December 13, 2007. The tribunal of three arbitrators is constituted, and the arbitration proceeding is under way. In October 2007, the government of Ecuador increased the tax rate of the Windfall Profits Tax Law implemented in 2006, increasing the amount of government royalty entitlement on crude oil production to 99 percent of any increase in the price of crude oil above a contractual reference price. In April 2008, we initiated arbitration with ICSID against The Republic of Ecuador and PetroEcuador as a result of the governments confiscatory fiscal measures enacted in 2006 and 2007, as well as the government mandated renegotiation of our production sharing contracts into service agreements with inferior fiscal and legal terms. The arbitration has been registered by ICSID, the arbitration tribunal is fully constituted and the case is proceeding. In Canada, the Alberta provincial government changed the royalty structure for Crown lands, effective January 1, 2009. A component of the new royalty rate calculation for each well will be based on prevailing prices, and therefore we expect that our reported production and reserve volumes will move inversely with changes in commodity prices. This change will impact both our conventional western Canada natural gas and oil business and our oil sands operations. 2007 vs. 2006 Net income from the EP segment decreased 53 percent in 2007. In the second quarter of 2007, we recorded a noncash impairment of $4,588 million before tax ($4,512 million after tax) related to the expropriation of our oil interests in Venezuela. The decrease in net income during 2007 reflects this impairment, as well as lower crude oil production, higher production taxes and operating costs, and higher DDA expense. These decreases were partially offset by: Higher realized crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas prices. A net benefit from asset rationalization efforts. A benefit related to the release of escrowed funds in connection with the extinguishment of the Hamaca project financing. The Alaska Quality Bank settlements. Proved reserves at year end 2007 were 8.72 billion BOE, compared with 9.36 billion at year end 2006. This excludes the estimated 1,838 million BOE and 1,805 million BOE included in the LUKOIL Investment segment at year end 2007 and 2006, respectively. Also excluded is our share of Canadian Syncrude, which was 221 million barrels at year end 2007, compared with 243 million at year end 2006. U.S. EP Net income from our U.S. EP operations decreased 2 percent, primarily due to higher production taxes in Alaska, higher operating costs and DDA expense, and lower crude oil production. These decreases were mostly offset by: Higher crude oil and natural gas liquids prices, and higher natural gas and natural gas liquids production. The Alaska Quality Bank settlements. Gains on the sale of assets in Alaska and the Gulf of Mexico. In December 2007, the state of Alaska enacted new production tax legislation, with retroactive provisions, which results in a higher production tax structure for ConocoPhillips. 44 Table of Contents U.S. EP production averaged 843,000 BOE per day in 2007, an increase of 4 percent from 808,000 in 2006. Production was impacted by the inclusion of the Burlington Resources assets for the full year of 2007, offset slightly by field decline. International EP Net income from our international EP operations decreased 93 percent, primarily due to the impairment of expropriated assets in Venezuela, lower crude oil production, higher DDA expense, and higher operating costs. These decreases were partially offset by higher crude oil and natural gas prices, a net benefit from asset rationalization efforts, and the benefit from the release of the escrowed funds related to the Hamaca project. International EP production averaged 1,014,000 BOE per day in 2007, a decrease of 10 percent from 1,128,000 in 2006. Production was impacted by the expropriation of our Venezuelan oil projects, planned and unplanned downtime in Australia and the North Sea, production sharing contract impacts in Australia, our exit from Dubai, and the effect of asset dispositions. These decreases were slightly offset by new production volumes from our FCCL upstream business venture with EnCana, as well as inclusion of the Burlington Resources assets for the full year of 2007. Our Syncrude mining operations produced 23,000 barrels per day in 2007, compared with 21,000 in 2006. During 2006, significant tax legislation was enacted in the United Kingdom and in Canada. The United Kingdom increased income tax rates on upstream income, resulting in a negative earnings impact of $470 million to adjust 2006 taxes and restate deferred tax liabilities. In Canada, an overall rate reduction in 2006 resulted in a favorable earnings impact of $401 million to restate deferred tax liabilities.

The Midstream segment purchases raw natural gas from producers and gathers natural gas through an extensive network of pipeline gathering systems. The natural gas is then processed to extract natural gas liquids from the raw gas stream. The remaining residue gas is marketed to electrical utilities, industrial users, and gas marketing companies. Most of the natural gas liquids are fractionated separated into individual components like ethane, butane and propane and marketed as chemical feedstock, fuel or blendstock. The Midstream segment consists of our 50 percent equity investment in DCP Midstream, as well as our other natural gas gathering and processing operations, and natural gas liquids fractionation and marketing businesses, primarily in the United States and Trinidad. 45 Table of Contents 2008 vs. 2007 Net income from the Midstream segment increased 19 percent in 2008. The increase was primarily due to higher realized natural gas liquids prices, partially offset by higher operating costs and higher depreciation expense. 2007 vs. 2006 Net income from the Midstream segment decreased 5 percent in 2007, reflecting a shift in natural gas purchase contract terms that are more favorable to natural gas producers. In addition, earnings from DCP Midstream were lower, primarily due to increased operating costs, mainly repairs, maintenance and asset integrity work. The results also reflect a positive tax adjustment included in the 2006 results. These decreases were partially offset by higher natural gas liquids prices. 46 Table of Contents RM 2008 2007 2006 Millions of Dollars Net Income United States $ 1,540 4,615 3,915 International 782 1,308 566 $ 2,322 5,923 4,481 Dollars Per Gallon U.S. Average Sales Prices* Gasoline Wholesale $ 2.65 2.27 2.04 Retail 2.81 2.42 2.18 Distillates wholesale 3.06 2.29 2.11 * Excludes excise taxes.

Actual capacity at year end 2007 and 2006 was 2,037,000 and 2,208,000 barrels per day, respectively, for our domestic refineries, and 669,000 and 693,000 barrels per day, respectively, for our international refineries. The RM segments operations encompass refining crude oil and other feedstocks into petroleum products (such as gasoline, distillates and aviation fuels); buying, selling and transporting crude oil; and buying, transporting, distributing and marketing petroleum products. RM has operations mainly in the United States, Europe and the Asia Pacific region. 47 Table of Contents 2008 vs. 2007 Net income from the RM segment decreased 61 percent in 2008. The results were lower due to decreases in U.S. refining margins and volumes, increased property impairments, higher operating costs, a reduced benefit from asset rationalization efforts, and lower international marketing and refining volumes due to asset sales. During 2008, our RM segment had property impairments totaling $511 million after tax, mostly due to a significantly diminished outlook for refining margins. These RM decreases were partially offset by higher international marketing margins. During 2008, our worldwide refining capacity utilization rate was 90 percent, compared with 94 percent in 2007. We expect our 2009 rate to be similar to our rate in 2008. U.S. RM Net income from our U.S. RM operations decreased 67 percent in 2008. The decrease was primarily the result of lower refining margins and, to a lesser extent, lower refining volumes and higher turnaround and utility costs. In addition, property impairments increased in 2008, including an impairment related to one of our U.S. refineries. Our U.S. refining capacity utilization rate was 92 percent in 2008, compared with 96 percent in 2007. The decline in the current year rate resulted mainly from refinery optimization and unplanned downtime including impacts from hurricanes on our U.S. Gulf Coast refineries. International RM Net income from our international RM operations decreased 40 percent in 2008. Contributing to the decrease were higher property impairments, including impacts from a 2008 impairment of a refinery in Europe and the absence of a 2007 benefit related to an increase in the fair value of previously impaired assets held for sale. Net income for 2008 was also impacted by a reduced net benefit from asset rationalization efforts, negative foreign currency exchange impacts, the absence of a $141 million 2007 German tax legislation benefit, and lower refining and marketing volumes due to asset sales. Higher international refining and marketing margins partially offset these decreases. Our international refining capacity utilization rate was 85 percent in 2008, compared with 90 percent during the previous year. The utilization rate was primarily impacted by reduced crude throughput at our Wilhelmshaven refinery due to economic conditions and planned maintenance. 2007 vs. 2006 Net income from the RM segment increased 32 percent in 2007. The increase resulted primarily from: The net benefit of asset rationalization efforts. Higher realized worldwide refining margins, reflecting in part the impact of planned inventory reductions, including a benefit of $260 million from the liquidation of prior year layers under the last in, first out (LIFO) method. Higher U.S. Gulf and East Coast refining volumes due to lower planned maintenance and less weather related downtime. A 2007 deferred tax benefit related to tax legislation in Germany. These increases were partially offset by the net impact of our contribution of assets to WRB Refining LLC, foreign currency impacts, and lower marketing sales volumes due to asset sales. U.S. RM Net income from our U.S. RM operations increased 18 percent in 2007, primarily due to: Higher refining volumes at our Gulf and East Coast refineries. Higher realized refining and marketing margins, due in part to the benefit of planned inventory reductions. 48 Table of Contents These items were partially offset by the net impact of our contribution of the Wood River and Borger refineries to WRB, and the impact of business interruption insurance recoveries on our 2006 results. Our U.S. refining capacity utilization rate was 96 percent in 2007, compared with 92 percent in 2006, primarily reflecting lower planned maintenance and less weather related downtime. International RM Net income from our international RM operations increased 131 percent in 2007, due primarily to: The net benefit of asset rationalization efforts. The deferred tax benefit related to the tax legislation in Germany. Higher realized refining margins. These increases were partially offset by foreign currency impacts and lower marketing volumes due to the asset sales. Our international refining capacity utilization rate was 90 percent in 2007, compared with 91 percent in 2006. The 2007 utilization rate was affected by a temporary idling of the Wilhelmshaven refinery in Germany during the month of August due to economic conditions. LUKOIL Investment Millions of Dollars 2008 2007 2006 Net Income (Loss) $ (5,488 ) 1,818 1,425 Operating Statistics* Crude oil production (thousands of barrels daily) 386 401 360 Natural gas production (millions of cubic feet daily) 356 256 244 Refinery crude oil processed (thousands of barrels daily) 229 214 179 * Represents our net share of our estimate of LUKOILs production and processing. This segment represents our investment in the ordinary shares of LUKOIL, an international, integrated oil and gas company headquartered in Russia, which we account for under the equity method. At December 31, 2008, our ownership interest in LUKOIL was 20 percent based on authorized and issued shares. Our ownership interest based on estimated shares outstanding, used for equity method accounting, was 20.06 percent at that date. Because LUKOILs accounting cycle close and preparation of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles financial statements occur subsequent to our reporting deadline, our equity earnings and statistics for our LUKOIL investment are estimated based on current market indicators, publicly available LUKOIL information, and other objective data. Once the difference between actual and estimated results is known, an adjustment is recorded. This estimate to actual adjustment will be a recurring component of future period results. In addition to our estimated equity share of LUKOILs earnings, this segment reflects the amortization of the basis difference between our equity interest in the net assets of LUKOIL and the book value of our investment. The segment also includes the costs associated with our employees seconded to LUKOIL. 49 Table of Contents 2008 vs. 2007 The LUKOIL Investment segment had a $5,488 million net loss during 2008, compared with $1,818 million of net income in 2007. The 2008 results include a $7,410 million noncash, before and after tax impairment of our LUKOIL investment taken during the fourth quarter. For additional information, see the LUKOIL section of Note 7 Investments, Loans and Long Term Receivables, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which is incorporated herein by reference. Excluding the impact of the impairment, income from the LUKOIL Investment segment increased 6 percent in 2008. This increase was primarily due to higher estimated realized prices of both refined product and crude oil sales. Partially offsetting these positive impacts were higher estimated extraction taxes and higher estimated crude and refined product export tariff rates, as well as higher estimated operating costs and lower estimated crude volumes. The adjustment to estimated results for the fourth quarter of 2007, recorded in 2008, decreased net income $16 million, compared with a $19 million decrease to net income recorded in 2007 to adjust the estimated results for the fourth quarter of 2006. 2007 vs. 2006 Net income from the LUKOIL Investment segment increased 28 percent during 2007, primarily due to higher estimated realized prices, higher estimated volumes, and an increase in our average equity ownership. The increase was partially offset by higher estimated taxes and operating costs, as well as the net impact from the alignment of estimated net income to reported results. The adjustment to estimated results for the fourth quarter of 2006, recorded in 2007, decreased net income $19 million, compared with a $71 million increase to net income recorded in 2006 to adjust the estimated results for the fourth quarter of 2005. Chemicals Millions of Dollars 2008 2007 2006 Net Income $ 110 359 492 The Chemicals segment consists of our 50 percent interest in Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC (CPChem), which we account for under the equity method. CPChem uses natural gas liquids and other feedstocks to produce petrochemicals. These products are then marketed and sold, or used as feedstocks to produce plastics and commodity chemicals. 2008 vs. 2007 Net income from the Chemicals segment decreased 69 percent in 2008 due to higher utilities and other operating costs, the absence of 2007 one time tax benefits, lower specialties, aromatics and styrenics margins, and lower olefins and polyolefins volumes. Increases in olefins and polyolefins margins somewhat offset these negative effects. Business conditions in the chemicals and plastics industry are expected to remain challenging in the near term. 2007 vs. 2006 Net income from the Chemicals segment decreased 27 percent during 2007, primarily due to lower olefins and polyolefins margins and higher turnaround and weather related repair costs, offset partially by a capital loss tax benefit of $65 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2007. 50 Table of Contents Emerging Businesses Millions of Dollars 2008 2007 2006 Net Income (Loss) Power $ 106 53 82 Other (76 ) (61 ) (67 ) $ 30 (8 ) 15 The Emerging Businesses segment represents our investment in new technologies or businesses outside our normal scope of operations. Activities within this segment are currently focused on power generation and innovation of new technologies, such as those related to conventional and nonconventional hydrocarbon recovery (including heavy oil), refining, alternative energy, biofuels, and the environment. 2008 vs. 2007 Emerging Businesses reported net income of $30 million in 2008, compared with a net loss of $8 million in 2007. The increase primarily reflects improved international power generation results, including the impact of higher spark spreads. These benefits were partially offset by an $85 million after tax impairment of a U.S. cogeneration power plant, as well as by lower domestic power results. 2007 vs. 2006 The Emerging Businesses segment had a net loss of $8 million in 2007, compared with net income of $15 million in 2006. The decrease reflects lower margins from the Immingham power plant in the United Kingdom, as well as higher spending associated with alternative energy programs. These decreases were slightly offset by the inclusion of a write down of a damaged gas turbine at a domestic power plant in 2006 results. Corporate and Other Millions of Dollars 2008 2007 2006 Net Loss Net interest $ (558 ) (820 ) (870 ) Corporate general and administrative expenses (202 ) (176 ) (133 ) Acquisition/merger related costs (44 ) (98 ) Other (274 ) (229 ) (86 ) $ (1,034 ) (1,269 ) (1,187 ) 2008 vs. 2007 Net interest consists of interest and financing expense, net of interest income and capitalized interest, as well as premiums incurred on the early retirement of debt. In 2008, net interest decreased 32 percent primarily due to lower average interest rates and a higher effective tax rate. Corporate general and administrative expenses increased 15 percent in 2008, mainly as a result of increased charitable contributions. Acquisition related costs in 2007 included transition costs associated with the Burlington Resources acquisition. The category Other includes certain foreign currency transaction gains and losses, environmental costs associated with sites no longer in operation, and other costs not directly associated with an operating segment. Other expenses increased in 2008 due to various tax related adjustments, partially offset by lower foreign currency losses. 51 Table of Contents 2007 vs. 2006 Net interest decreased 6 percent in 2007, primarily due to higher amounts of interest being capitalized, partially offset by a premium on the early retirement of debt. Corporate general and administrative expenses increased 32 percent in 2007, primarily due to higher benefit related expenses. Acquisition related costs in 2007 included transition costs associated with the Burlington Resources acquisition. Results from Other were primarily impacted by foreign currency losses in 2007. CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Financial Indicators Millions of Dollars Except as Indicated 2008 2007 2006 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 22,658 24,550 21,516 Short term debt 370 1,398 4,043 Total debt 27,455 21,687 27,134 Minority interests 1,100 1,173 1,202 Common stockholders equity 55,165 88,983 82,646 Percent of total debt to capital* 33 % 19 24 Percent of floating rate debt to total debt 37 25 41 * Capital includes total debt, minority interests and common stockholders equity. To meet our short and long term liquidity requirements, we look to a variety of funding sources. Cash generated from operating activities is the primary source of funding. In addition, during 2008 we raised $1,640 million in proceeds from asset dispositions. During 2008, available cash was used to support our ongoing capital expenditures and investments program, repurchase shares of our common stock, provide loan financing to certain equity affiliates, pay dividends, and meet the funding requirements to FCCL Oil Sands Partnership. Total dividends paid on our common stock during the year were $2,854 million. During 2008, cash and cash equivalents decreased $701 million to $755 million. In addition to cash flows from operating activities and proceeds from asset sales, we rely on our commercial paper and credit facility programs, and our shelf registration statements to support our short and long term liquidity requirements. The credit markets, including the commercial paper markets in the United States, have recently experienced adverse conditions. Although we have not been materially impacted by these conditions, continuing volatility in the credit markets may increase costs associated with issuing commercial paper or other debt instruments due to increased spreads over relevant interest rate benchmarks. Such volatility may also affect our ability, or the ability of third parties with whom we seek to do business, to access those credit markets. Notwithstanding these adverse market conditions, we believe current cash and short term investment balances and cash generated by operations, together with access to external sources of funds as described below in the Significant Sources of Capital section, will be sufficient to meet our funding requirements in the near and long term, including our capital spending program, dividend payments, required debt payments and the funding requirements to FCCL. Significant Sources of Capital Operating Activities During 2008, cash of $22,658 million was provided by operating activities, an 8 percent decrease from cash from operations of $24,550 million in 2007. Contributing to the decrease were lower U.S. refining margins and volumetric inventory builds in our RM segment in 2008, versus reductions in 2007. These factors were partially offset by higher commodity prices in our EP segment. 52 Table of Contents During 2007, cash flow from operations increased $3,034 million to $24,550 million. Contributing to the improvement over 2006 results was a planned inventory reduction in the 2007 period, partially related to the formation of the WRB downstream business venture; the impact of the Burlington Resources acquisition late in the first quarter of 2006; and higher worldwide crude oil prices in 2007. These positive factors were partially offset by the absence of dividends from our Venezuelan operations in 2007. While the stability of our cash flows from operating activities benefits from geographic diversity and the effects of upstream and downstream integration, our short and long term operating cash flows are highly dependent upon prices for crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids, as well as refining and marketing margins. During 2008 and 2007, we benefited from favorable crude oil and natural gas prices, although these prices deteriorated significantly in the fourth quarter of 2008. Prices and margins are driven by market conditions over which we have no control. Absent other mitigating factors, as these prices and margins fluctuate, we would expect a corresponding change in our operating cash flows. The level of our production volumes of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids also impacts our cash flows. These production levels are impacted by such factors as acquisitions and dispositions of fields, field production decline rates, new technologies, operating efficiency, weather conditions, the addition of proved reserves through exploratory success, and the timely and cost effective development of those proved reserves. While we actively manage these factors, production levels can cause variability in cash flows, although historically this variability has not been as significant as that caused by commodity prices. Our production for 2008, including our share of production from equity affiliates, averaged 2.21 million BOE per day. Future production is subject to numerous uncertainties, including, among others, the volatile crude oil and natural gas price environment, which may impact project investment decisions; the price effect of production sharing contracts; changes in fiscal terms of projects; project delays; and weather related disruptions. Although actual year to year production levels will vary, based on our current outlook and planning assumptions, we project no material change in annual production levels from 2008 through 2013. To maintain or grow our production volumes, we must continue to add to our proved reserve base. Our reserve replacement in 2008, including equity affiliates, was 31 percent. The 2008 reserve replacement was adversely impacted by low year end commodity prices, which resulted in significant negative reserve revisions. Our 2008 reserve replacement from consolidated operations and from our equity affiliates was a negative 23 percent and a positive 224 percent, respectively. Over the three year period ending December 31, 2008, our reserve replacement was 124 percent. This was comprised of a reserve replacement from consolidated operations of 115 percent and from equity affiliates of 153 percent. The purchase of reserves in place was a significant factor in replacing our reserves over the past three year period, partially offset by the expropriation of our Venezuelan oil assets. Significant purchases during this three year period included reserves added as part of the 2008 Origin Energy joint venture, the 2007 EnCana business venture, and the 2006 acquisition of Burlington Resources, as well as proved reserves added through our investments in LUKOIL in 2006. The reserve replacement amounts above were based on the sum of our net additions (revisions, improved recovery, purchases, extensions and discoveries, and sales) divided by our production, as shown in our reserve table disclosures in the Oil and Gas Operations section of this report. We are developing and pursuing projects we anticipate will allow us to add to our reserve base. However, access to additional resources has become increasingly difficult as direct investment is prohibited in some nations, while fiscal and other terms in other countries can make projects uneconomic or unattractive. In addition, political instability, competition from national oil companies, and lack of access to high potential areas due to environmental or other regulation may negatively impact our ability to increase our reserve base. As such, the timing and level at which we add to our reserve base may, or may not, allow us to replace our production over subsequent years. As discussed in the Critical Accounting Estimates section, engineering estimates of proved reserves are imprecise, and therefore, each year reserves may be revised upward or downward due to the impact of changes in oil and gas prices or as more technical data becomes available on reservoirs. In 2008 and 2006, revisions decreased our reserves, while in 2007 revisions increased reserves. It is not possible to reliably predict how 53 Table of Contents revisions will impact reserve quantities in the future. See the Capital Spending section for an analysis of proved undeveloped reserves. In addition, the level and quality of output from our refineries impacts our cash flows. The output at our refineries is impacted by such factors as operating efficiency, maintenance turnarounds, feedstock availability and weather conditions. We actively manage the operations of our refineries and, typically, any variability in their operations has not been as significant to cash flows as that caused by refining margins. In 2006, we received approximately $1.1 billion in distributions from two heavy oil projects in Venezuela. The majority of these distributions represented operating results from previous years. We did not receive an operating distribution related to these projects in 2007 or 2008. Asset Sales Proceeds from asset sales in 2008 were $1,640 million, compared with $3,572 million in 2007. The amounts for both periods are mainly due to asset rationalization efforts related to the program we announced in April 2006 to dispose of assets that no longer fit into our strategic plans or those that could bring more value by being monetized in the near term. We do not expect any material asset dispositions in 2009 beyond the sale of our U.S. retail marketing assets. In January 2009, we closed on the sale of a large part of these assets, which included seller financing in the form of a $370 million five year note and letters of credit totaling $54 million. Commercial Paper and Credit Facilities At December 31, 2008, we had two revolving credit facilities totaling $9.85 billion, consisting of a $7.35 billion facility, expiring in September 2012, and a $2.5 billion facility scheduled to expire in September 2009 (terminated in early 2009, see the Shelf Registrations section below). The $7.35 billion facility was reduced from $7.5 billion during the third quarter of 2008 due to the bankruptcy of Lehman Commercial Paper Inc., one of the revolver participants. The $2.5 billion facility is a 364 day bank facility entered into during October 2008 to provide additional support of a temporary expansion of our commercial paper program. We expanded our commercial paper program to ensure adequate liquidity after the initial funding of our transaction with Origin Energy. For additional information on the Origin transaction, see Note 7 Investments, Loans and Long Term Receivables, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Our revolving credit facilities may be used as direct bank borrowings, as support for issuances of letters of credit totaling up to $750 million, as support for our commercial paper programs, or as support of up to $250 million on commercial paper issued by TransCanada Keystone Pipeline LP, a Keystone pipeline joint venture entity. The revolving credit facilities are broadly syndicated among financial institutions and do not contain any material adverse change provisions or any covenants requiring maintenance of specified financial ratios or ratings. The facility agreements contain a cross default provision relating to the failure to pay principal or interest on other debt obligations of $200 million or more by ConocoPhillips, or by any of its consolidated subsidiaries. Our primary funding source for short term working capital needs is the ConocoPhillips $8.1 billion commercial paper program. Commercial paper maturities are generally limited to 90 days. We also have the ConocoPhillips Qatar Funding Ltd. $1.5 billion commercial paper program, which is used to fund commitments relating to the Qatargas 3 project. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, we had no direct outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facilities, but $40 million and $41 million, respectively, in letters of credit had been issued. In addition, under both commercial paper programs, there was $6,933 million of commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2008, compared with $725 million at December 31, 2007. Since we had $6,933 million of commercial paper outstanding, had issued $40 million of letters of credit and had up to a $250 million guarantee on commercial paper issued by Keystone, we had access to $2.6 billion in borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facilities at December 31, 2008. Shelf Registrations We have a universal shelf registration statement on file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under which we, as a well known seasoned issuer, have the ability to issue and sell an indeterminate amount of various types of debt and equity securities. Under this shelf registration, in May 2008 we issued notes consisting of $400 million of 4.40% Notes due 2013, $500 million of 5.20% Notes due 2018 and 54 Table of Contents $600 million of 5.90% Notes due 2038. The proceeds from the offering were used at that time to reduce commercial paper and for general corporate purposes. Also under this shelf registration, in early 2009 we issued $1.5 billion of 4.75% Notes due 2014, $2.25 billion of 5.75% Notes due 2019, and $2.25 billion of 6.50% Notes due 2039. The proceeds of the notes were primarily used to reduce outstanding commercial paper balances. Under the terms of the $2.5 billion, 364 day revolving credit facility noted above, the receipt of the proceeds from this bond offering terminated this revolving credit facility. Our senior long term debt is rated A1 by Moodys Investor Service and A by both Standard and Poors Rating Service and Fitch, unchanged from December 31, 2008. We do not have any ratings triggers on any of our corporate debt that would cause an automatic default, and thereby impact our access to liquidity, in the event of a downgrade of our credit rating. In the event our credit rating deteriorates to a level prohibiting us from accessing the commercial paper market, we would still be able to access funds under our $7.35 billion revolving credit facility. We also have on file with the SEC a shelf registration statement under which ConocoPhillips Canada Funding Company I and ConocoPhillips Canada Funding Company II, both wholly owned subsidiaries, could issue an indeterminate amount of senior debt securities, fully and unconditionally guaranteed by ConocoPhillips and ConocoPhillips Company. Minority Interests At December 31, 2008, we had outstanding $1,100 million of equity in less than wholly owned consolidated subsidiaries held by minority interest owners, including a minority interest of $507 million in Ashford Energy Capital S.A. The remaining minority interest amounts are primarily related to operating joint ventures we control. The largest of these, amounting to $580 million, was related to Darwin LNG, an operation located in Australias Northern Territory. In December 2001, in order to raise funds for general corporate purposes, ConocoPhillips and Cold Spring Finance S.a.r.l. formed Ashford Energy Capital S.A. through the contribution of a $1 billion ConocoPhillips subsidiary promissory note and $500 million cash by Cold Spring. Through its initial $500 million investment, Cold Spring is entitled to a cumulative annual preferred return consisting of 1.32 percent plus a three month LIBOR rate set at the beginning of each quarter. The preferred return at December 31, 2008, was 5.37 percent. In 2008, Cold Spring declined its option to remarket its investment in Ashford. This option remains available in 2018 and at each 10 year anniversary thereafter. If remarketing is unsuccessful, we could be required to provide a letter of credit in support of Cold Springs investment, or in the event such a letter of credit is not provided, cause the redemption of Cold Springs investment in Ashford. Should our credit rating fall below investment grade, Ashford would require a letter of credit to support $475 million of the term loans, as of December 31, 2008, made by Ashford to other ConocoPhillips subsidiaries. If the letter of credit is not obtained within 60 days, Cold Spring could cause Ashford to sell the ConocoPhillips subsidiary notes. At December 31, 2008, Ashford held $2.0 billion of ConocoPhillips subsidiary notes and $28 million in investments unrelated to ConocoPhillips. We report Cold Springs investment as a minority interest because it is not mandatorily redeemable, and the entity does not have a specified liquidation date. Other than the obligation to make payment on the subsidiary notes described above, Cold Spring does not have recourse to our general credit. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As part of our normal ongoing business operations and consistent with normal industry practice, we enter into numerous agreements with other parties to pursue business opportunities, which share costs and apportion risks among the parties as governed by the agreements. At December 31, 2008, we were liable for certain contingent obligations under the following contractual arrangements: Qatargas 3: We own a 30 percent interest in Qatargas 3, an integrated project to produce and liquefy natural gas from Qatars North field. The other participants in the project are affiliates of Qatar Petroleum (68.5 percent) and Mitsui Co., Ltd. (1.5 percent). Our interest is held through a jointly 55 Table of Contents owned company, Qatar Liquefied Gas Company Limited (3), for which we use the equity method of accounting. Qatargas 3 secured project financing of $4 billion in December 2005, consisting of $1.3 billion of loans from export credit agencies (ECA), $1.5 billion from commercial banks, and $1.2 billion from ConocoPhillips. The ConocoPhillips loan facilities have substantially the same terms as the ECA and commercial bank facilities. Prior to project completion certification, all loans, including the ConocoPhillips loan facilities, are guaranteed by the participants, based on their respective ownership interests. Accordingly, our maximum exposure to this financing structure is $1.2 billion. Upon completion certification, currently expected in 2011, all project loan facilities, including the ConocoPhillips loan facilities, will become nonrecourse to the project participants. At December 31, 2008, Qatargas 3 had $3.0 billion outstanding under all the loan facilities, of which ConocoPhillips provided $835 million, and an additional $76 million of accrued interest. Rockies Express Pipeline LLC: In June 2006, we issued a guarantee for 24 percent of $2.0 billion in credit facilities issued to Rockies Express Pipeline LLC. Rockies Express is constructing a natural gas pipeline across a portion of the United States. The maximum potential amount of future payments to third party lenders under the guarantee is estimated to be $480 million, which could become payable if the credit facilities are fully utilized and Rockies Express fails to meet its obligations under the credit agreement. At December 31, 2008, Rockies Express had $1,561 million outstanding under the credit facilities, with our 24 percent guarantee equaling $375 million. In addition, we have a 24 percent guarantee on $600 million of Floating Rate Notes due 2009. It is anticipated that construction completion will be achieved in 2009, and refinancing will take place at that time, making the debt nonrecourse. Keystone Oil Pipeline: In December 2007, we acquired a 50 percent equity interest in four Keystone pipeline entities (Keystone), to create a joint venture with TransCanada Corporation. Keystone is constructing a crude oil pipeline originating in Alberta, with delivery points in Illinois and Oklahoma. In connection with certain planning and construction activities, we agreed to reimburse TransCanada with respect to a portion of guarantees issued by TransCanada for certain of Keystones obligations to third parties. Our maximum potential amount of future payments associated with these guarantees is based on our ultimate ownership percentage in Keystone and is estimated to be $180 million, which could become payable if Keystone fails to meet its obligations and the obligations cannot otherwise be mitigated. Payments under the guarantees are contingent upon the partners not making necessary equity contributions into Keystone; therefore, it is considered unlikely payments would be required. All but $8 million of the guarantees will terminate after construction is completed, currently estimated to occur in 2010. In October 2008, we elected to exercise an option to reduce our equity interest in Keystone from 50 percent to 20.01 percent. The change in equity will occur through a dilution mechanism, which is expected to gradually lower our ownership interest until it reaches 20.01 percent by the third quarter of 2009. At December 31, 2008, our ownership interest was 38.7 percent. In addition to the above guarantees, in order to obtain long term shipping commitments that would enable a pipeline expansion starting at Hardisty, Alberta, and extending to near Port Arthur, Texas, the Keystone owners executed an agreement in July 2008 to guarantee Keystones obligations under its agreement to provide transportation at a specified price for certain shippers to the Gulf Coast. Although our guarantee is for 50 percent of these obligations, TransCanada has agreed to reimburse us for amounts we pay in excess of our ownership percentage in Keystone. Our maximum potential amount of future payments, or cost of volume delivery, under this guarantee, after such reimbursement, is estimated to be $220 million ($550 million before reimbursement) based on a full 20 year term of the shipping commitments, which could become payable if Keystone fails to meet its obligations under the agreements and the obligations cannot otherwise be mitigated. Future payments are considered unlikely, as the payments, or cost of volume delivery, are contingent upon Keystone defaulting on its obligation to construct the pipeline in accordance with the terms of the agreement. 56 Table of Contents In December 2008, we provided a guarantee of up to $250 million of balances outstanding under a commercial paper program. This program was established by Keystone to provide funding for a portion of Keystones construction costs attributable to our ownership interest in the project. Payment under the guarantee would be due in the event Keystone failed to repay principal and interest, when due, to short term noteholders. The commercial paper program and our guarantee are expected to increase as funding needs increase during construction of the Keystone pipeline. Keystones other owner will guarantee a similar, but separate, funding vehicle. Post construction Keystone financing is anticipated to be nonrecourse to us. At December 31, 2008, $200 million was outstanding under the Keystone commercial paper program guaranteed by us. For additional information about guarantees, see Note 14 Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which is incorporated herein by reference. Capital Requirements Our debt balance at December 31, 2008, was $27.5 billion, an increase of $5.8 billion during 2008, and our debt to capital ratio was 33 percent at year end 2008, versus 19 percent at the end of 2007. The increase in the debt to capital ratio was mainly due to noncash impairments taken in the fourth quarter of 2008 and the increase in debt. Our debt to capital target range is 20 percent to 25 percent. In January 2008, we reduced our Floating Rate Five Year Term Note due 2011 from $3 billion to $2 billion, with a subsequent reduction in June 2008 to $1.5 billion. In March 2008, we redeemed our $300 million 7.125% Debentures due 2028 at a premium of $8 million, plus accrued interest. On January 3, 2007, we closed on a business venture with EnCana. As part of this transaction, we are obligated to contribute $7.5 billion, plus accrued interest, over a 10 year period, beginning in 2007, to the upstream business venture, FCCL, formed as a result of the transaction. An initial contribution of $188 million was made upon closing in January. Quarterly principal and interest payments of $237 million began in the second quarter of 2007, and will continue until the balance is paid. Of the principal obligation amount, approximately $625 million is short term and was included in the Accounts payable related parties line on our December 31, 2008, consolidated balance sheet. The principal portion of these payments, which totaled $593 million in 2008, was included in the Other line in the financing activities section of our consolidated statement of cash flows. Interest accrues at a fixed annual rate of 5.3 percent on the unpaid principal balance. Fifty percent of the quarterly interest payments was reflected as an additional capital contribution and was included in the Capital expenditures and investments line on our consolidated statement of cash flows. On July 9, 2007, we announced plans to repurchase up to $15 billion of our common stock through the end of 2008. This amount included $2 billion remaining under a previously announced program. At year end 2007, approximately $10.1 billion remained authorized for share repurchases in 2008. During 2008, we repurchased 103.7 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $8.2 billion. In December 2005, we entered into a credit agreement with Qatargas 3, whereby we will provide loan financing of approximately $1.2 billion for the construction of an LNG train in Qatar. This financing will represent 30 percent of the projects total debt financing. Through December 31, 2008, we had provided $835 million in loan financing, and an additional $76 million of accrued interest. In 2004, we finalized our transaction with Freeport LNG Development, L.P. to participate in an LNG receiving terminal in Quintana, Texas, for which construction began in early 2005. We do not have an ownership interest in the facility, but we do have a 50 percent interest in the general partnership managing the venture, along with contractual rights to regasification capacity of the terminal. We entered into a credit agreement with Freeport to provide loan financing for the construction of the facility. The terminal became operational in June 2008, and in August 2008, the loan was converted from a construction loan to a term loan and consisted of $650 million in loan financing and $124 million of accrued interest. Freeport began making repayments in September 2008, and the loan balance outstanding at December 31, 2008, was $757 million. 57 Table of Contents In 2004, ConocoPhillips and LUKOIL agreed to the expansion of the Varandey terminal as part of our investment in the OOO Naryanmarneftegaz (NMNG) joint venture. We have an obligation to provide loan financing to Varandey Terminal Company for 30 percent of the costs of the terminal expansion, but we will have no governance or ownership interest in the terminal. Terminal construction was completed in June 2008, and the final loan amount was $275 million at December 2008 exchange rates, excluding accrued interest. Although repayments are not required to start until May 2010, Varandey used available cash to repay $12 million of interest in the second half of 2008. The outstanding accrued interest at December 31, 2008, was $38 million at December exchange rates. Our loans to Qatargas 3, Freeport and Varandey Terminal Company are included in the Loans and advances related parties line on our consolidated balance sheet, while the short term portion is in Accounts and notes receivable related parties. In February 2009, we announced a quarterly dividend of 47 cents per share. The dividend is payable March 2, 2009, to stockholders of record at the close of business February 23, 2009. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our aggregate contractual fixed and variable obligations as of December 31, 2008: Millions of Dollars Payments Due by Period Up to Year Year After Total 1 Year 2 3 4 5 5 Years Debt obligations (a) $ 27,427 353 6,205 9,511 11,358 Capital lease obligations 28 17 5 6 Total debt 27,455 370 6,210 9,511 11,364 Interest on debt and other obligations 14,846 1,381 2,403 1,640 9,422 Operating lease obligations 3,769 868 1,257 727 917 Purchase obligations (b) 76,862 30,575 8,415 5,726 32,146 Joint venture acquisition obligation (c) 6,294 625 1,354 1,505 2,810 Other long term liabilities (d) Asset retirement obligations 6,615 258 543 604 5,210 Accrued environmental costs 979 173 288 146 372 Unrecognized tax benefits (e) 100 100 (e) (e) (e) Total $ 136,920 34,350 20,470 19,859 62,241 (a) Includes $639 million of net unamortized premiums and discounts. See Note 12 Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. (b) Represents any agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding and that specifies all significant terms. Does not include purchase commitments for jointly owned fields and facilities where we are not the operator. The majority of the purchase obligations are market based contracts, including exchanges and futures, for the purchase of products such as crude oil, unfractionated natural gas liquids (NGL), natural gas, and power. The products are mostly used to supply our refineries and fractionators, optimize the supply chain, and resell to customers. Product purchase commitments with third parties totaled $35,732 million; $28,315 million of these commitments are product purchases from the following affiliated companies: CPChem, mostly for natural gas and NGL over the remaining term of 91 years, and Excel Paralubes, for base oil over the remaining initial term of 16 years. 58 Table of Contents Purchase obligations of $8,185 million are related to agreements to access and utilize the capacity of third party equipment and facilities, including pipelines and LNG and product terminals, to transport, process, treat, and store products. The remainder is primarily our net share of purchase commitments for materials and services for jointly owned fields and facilities where we are the operator. (c) Represents the remaining amount of contributions, excluding interest, due over an eight year period to the FCCL upstream joint venture formed with EnCana. (d) Does not include: Pensions for the 2009 through 2013 time period, we expect to contribute an average of $625 million per year to our qualified and nonqualified pension and postretirement benefit plans in the United States and an average of $161 million per year to our non U.S. plans, which are expected to be in excess of required minimums in many cases. The U.S. five year average consists of $925 million for 2009 and then approximately $550 million per year for the remaining four years. Our required minimum funding in 2009 is expected to be $274 million in the United States and $98 million outside the United States. (e) Excludes unrecognized tax benefits of $968 million because the ultimate disposition and timing of any payments to be made with regard to such amount are not reasonably estimable. Although unrecognized tax benefits are not a contractual obligation, they are presented in this table because they represent potential demands on our liquidity. Capital Spending Capital Expenditures and Investments Millions of Dollars 2009 Budget 2008 2007 2006 EP United States Alaska $ 832 1,414 666 820 United States Lower 48 2,668 3,836 3,122 2,008 International 5,959 11,206 6,147 6,685 9,459 16,456 9,935 9,513 Midstream 7 4 5 4 RM United States 1,409 1,643 1,146 1,597 International 577 626 240 1,419 1,986 2,269 1,386 3,016 LUKOIL Investment 2,715 Chemicals Emerging Businesses 100 156 257 83 Corporate and Other 150 214 208 265 $ 11,702 19,099 11,791 15,596 United States $ 5,076 7,111 5,225 4,735 International 6,626 11,988 6,566 10,861 $ 11,702 19,099 11,791 15,596 Our capital expenditures and investments for the three year period ending December 31, 2008, totaled $46.5 billion, with 77 percent going to our EP segment. Included in these amounts was approximately $4.7 billion related to the October 2008 closing of a transaction with Origin Energy to further enhance our long term Australasian natural gas business through a 50/50 joint venture named Australia Pacific LNG. The joint venture will focus on coalbed methane production from the Bowen and Surat basins in Queensland, Australia, and LNG processing and export sales. For additional information about the Origin transaction, 59 Table of Contents see Note 7 Investments, Loans and Long Term Receivables, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Our capital expenditures and investments budget for 2009 is $11.7 billion. Included in this amount is approximately $600 million in capitalized interest. The decline from 2008 spending is primarily due to the closing of the transaction with Origin Energy in 2008 and the deferring or slowing of some projects or programs in 2009, as a result of the current business environment. We plan to direct 81 percent of the capital expenditures and investments budget to EP and 17 percent to RM. With the addition of loans to certain affiliated companies and principal contributions related to funding our portion of the FCCL business venture, our total capital program for 2009 is approximately $12.5 billion. EP Capital expenditures and investments for EP during the three year period ending December 31, 2008, totaled $35.9 billion. The expenditures over this period supported key exploration and development projects including: Significant U.S. lease acquisitions in the federal waters of the Chukchi Sea offshore Alaska, as well as in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Alaska activities related to development drilling in the Greater Kuparuk Area, including West Sak; the Greater Prudhoe Bay Area; the Alpine field, including satellite field prospects; and the Cook Inlet Area; as well as initiatives to progress the gas pipeline project named Denali The Alaska Gas Pipeline; and exploration activities. Oil and natural gas developments in the Lower 48, including New Mexico, Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Montana, North Dakota, Colorado, Wyoming, and offshore in the Gulf of Mexico. Investment in West2East Pipeline LLC, a company holding a 100 percent interest in Rockies Express Pipeline LLC. Development of the Surmont heavy oil project, capital expenditures related to the FCCL upstream business venture, and development of conventional oil and gas reserves, all in Canada. Development drilling and facilities projects in the Greater Ekofisk Area and the Alvheim project, both located in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea. The Statfjord Late Life project straddling the offshore boundary between Norway and the United Kingdom. The Britannia satellite developments in the U.K. North Sea. An integrated project to produce and liquefy natural gas from Qatars North field. Expenditures related to the terms under which we returned to our former oil and natural gas production operations in the Waha concessions in Libya and continued development of these concessions. Ongoing development of onshore oil and natural gas fields in Nigeria and ongoing exploration activities both onshore and within deepwater leases. The Kashagan field and satellite prospects in the Caspian Sea, offshore Kazakhstan. Development of the Yuzhno Khylchuyu (YK) field in the northern part of Russias Timan Pechora province through the NMNG joint venture with LUKOIL. The initial investment related to the 50/50 joint venture with Origin Energy. Projects in offshore Block B and onshore South Sumatra in Indonesia. The Peng Lai 19 3 development in Chinas Bohai Bay and additional Bohai Bay appraisal and adjacent field prospects. The Gumusut Kakap development offshore Sabah, Malaysia. 2009 CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND INVESTMENTS BUDGET EPs 2009 capital expenditures and investments budget is $9.5 billion, 43 percent lower than actual expenditures in 2008. The decline is primarily due to the 2008 Origin transaction and the deferring or slowing of some projects or programs. Thirty seven percent of EPs 2009 capital expenditures and investments budget is planned for the United States. 60 Table of Contents Capital spending for our Alaskan operations is expected to fund Prudhoe Bay, Kuparuk and Western North Slope operations, including the Alpine satellite fields, as well as initiatives to progress Denali The Alaska Gas Pipeline, and exploration activities. In the Lower 48, we expect to make capital expenditures and investments for ongoing development programs in the Permian, San Juan, Williston and Fort Worth basins and the Lobo Trend in South Texas, as well as for development of projects such as the Rockies Express natural gas pipeline. EP is directing $6.0 billion of its 2009 capital expenditures and investments budget to international projects. Funds in 2009 will be directed to developing major long term projects including: Oil sands projects, primarily those associated with the FCCL business venture, and ongoing natural gas projects in Canada. In the North Sea, the Ekofisk Area, J Block fields, Greater Britannia fields and various southern North Sea assets. The Kashagan field in the Caspian Sea. Advancement of coalbed methane projects in Australia associated with the Origin Energy joint venture. Continued development of Bohai Bay in China. The Gumusut field offshore Malaysia. The North Belut field in Block B, as well as other projects offshore Block B and onshore South Sumatra in Indonesia. Fields offshore Vietnam. Continued development of the Qatargas 3 project in Qatar. The Shah gas field in Abu Dhabi. Onshore developments in Nigeria, Algeria and Libya. PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES The net addition of proved undeveloped reserves accounted for 156 percent, 77 percent and 37 percent of our total net additions in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. During these years, we converted, on average, 15 percent per year of our proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves. Of our 2,823 million total BOE proved undeveloped reserves at December 31, 2008, we estimated that the average annual conversion rate for these reserves for the three year period ending 2011 will be approximately 15 percent. Costs incurred for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, relating to the development of proved undeveloped reserves were $4.8 billion, $4.3 billion, and $3.9 billion, respectively. Estimated future development costs relating to the development of proved undeveloped reserves for the years 2009 through 2011 are projected to be $3.9 billion, $3.1 billion, and $2.0 billion, respectively. Approximately 80 percent of our proved undeveloped reserves at year end 2008 were associated with 10 major development areas in our EP segment, and our investment in LUKOIL. Eight of the major development areas within EP are currently producing and are expected to have proved reserves convert from undeveloped to developed over time as development activities continue and or production facilities are expanded or upgraded, and include: The Ekofisk field in the North Sea. The Peng Lai 19 3 field in China. Fields in the United States. FCCL heavy oil projects Christina Lake and Foster Creek in Canada. The Surmont heavy oil project in Canada. The remaining two major projects, Qatargas 3 in Qatar and the Kashagan field in Kazakhstan, will have undeveloped proved reserves convert to developed as these projects begin production. 61 Table of Contents RM Capital spending for RM during the three year period ending December 31, 2008, was primarily for acquiring additional crude oil refining capacity, clean fuels projects to meet new environmental standards, refinery upgrade projects to improve product yields, the operating integrity of key processing units, as well as for safety projects. During this three year period, RM capital spending was $6.7 billion, representing 14 percent of our total capital expenditures and investments. Key projects during the three year period included: Acquisition of the Wilhelmshaven refinery in Germany. Debottlenecking of a crude and fluid catalytic cracking unit, and completion of a new sulfur plant at the Ferndale refinery. Installations, revamps and expansions of equipment at all U.S. refineries to enable production of low sulfur and ultra low sulfur fuels. Investment to obtain an equity interest in four Keystone pipeline entities (Keystone), a joint venture to construct a crude oil pipeline from Hardisty, Alberta, to delivery points in the United States. Installation of a 25,000 barrel per day coker and new vacuum unit at the Borger refinery. Commissioning of these units was completed following the formation of the WRB joint venture. Upgrading the distillate desulfurization capability at the Humber refinery. Major construction activities in progress include: Expansion of a hydrocracker at the Rodeo facility of our San Francisco refinery. Construction of a low sulfur gasoline project at the Billings refinery. Construction of a new sulfur recovery unit at the Sweeny refinery. Continued investment in the Keystone Oil Pipeline. Construction of a wet gas scrubber at our Alliance refinery. 2009 CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND INVESTMENTS BUDGET RMs 2009 capital budget is $2.0 billion, a 12 percent decrease from actual spending in 2008. Domestic spending in 2009 is expected to comprise 71 percent of the RM budget. We plan to direct about $1.1 billion of the RM capital budget to domestic refining, primarily for projects related to sustaining and improving existing business with a focus on safety, regulatory compliance, reliability and capital maintenance. Work continues on projects to expand conversion capability and increase clean product yield, including funding for the San Francisco hydrocracker project. Our U.S. transportation, marketing and specialty businesses are expected to spend about $300 million, including investments in the Keystone project. Internationally, we plan to spend about $600 million, with a focus on projects related to reliability, safety and the environment, as well as an upgrade project at the Wilhelmshaven, Germany, refinery. The construction bidding process for the refinery project in Yanbu, Saudi Arabia, is currently scheduled to take place in 2009. LUKOIL Investment Capital spending in our LUKOIL Investment segment during the three year period ending December 31, 2008, was for purchases of ordinary shares of LUKOIL in 2006 to increase our ownership interest. No additional purchases were made in 2007 or 2008, and none are expected in 2009. Emerging Businesses Capital spending for Emerging Businesses during the three year period ending December 31, 2008, was primarily for an expansion of the Immingham combined heat and power cogeneration plant near the companys Humber refinery in the United Kingdom. In addition, in October 2007, we purchased a 50 percent interest in Sweeny Cogeneration LP. 62 Table of Contents Contingencies Legal and Tax Matters We accrue for non income tax related contingencies when a loss is probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated. If a range of amounts can be reasonably estimated and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, then the minimum of the range is accrued. In the case of income tax related contingencies, we adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48), effective January 1, 2007. FIN 48 requires a cumulative probability weighted loss accrual in cases where sustaining a tax position is less than certain. Based on currently available information, we believe it is remote that future costs related to known contingent liability exposures will exceed current accruals by an amount that would have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements. Environmental We are subject to the same numerous international, federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations as other companies in the petroleum exploration and production, refining and crude oil and refined product marketing and transportation businesses. The most significant of these environmental laws and regulations include, among others, the: U.S. Federal Clean Air Act, which governs air emissions. U.S. Federal Clean Water Act, which governs discharges to water bodies. European Union Regulation for Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH). U.S. Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), which imposes liability on generators, transporters and arrangers of hazardous substances at sites where hazardous substance releases have occurred or are threatening to occur. U.S. Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), which governs the treatment, storage and disposal of solid waste. U.S. Federal Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA90), under which owners and operators of onshore facilities and pipelines, lessees or permittees of an area in which an offshore facility is located, and owners and operators of vessels are liable for removal costs and damages that result from a discharge of oil into navigable waters of the United States. U.S. Federal Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act (EPCRA), which requires facilities to report toxic chemical inventories with local emergency planning committees and response departments. U.S. Federal Safe Drinking Water Act, which governs the disposal of wastewater in underground injection wells. U.S. Department of the Interior regulations, which relate to offshore oil and gas operations in U.S. waters and impose liability for the cost of pollution cleanup resulting from operations, as well as potential liability for pollution damages. European Union Trading Directive resulting in European Emissions Trading Scheme. These laws and their implementing regulations set limits on emissions and, in the case of discharges to water, establish water quality limits. They also, in most cases, require permits in association with new or modified operations. These permits can require an applicant to collect substantial information in connection with the application process, which can be expensive and time consuming. In addition, there can be delays associated with notice and comment periods and the agencys processing of the application. Many of the delays associated with the permitting process are beyond the control of the applicant. Many states and foreign countries where we operate also have, or are developing, similar environmental laws and regulations governing these same types of activities. While similar, in some cases these regulations may impose additional, or more stringent, requirements that can add to the cost and difficulty of marketing or transporting products across state and international borders. 63 Table of Contents The ultimate financial impact arising from environmental laws and regulations is neither clearly known nor easily determinable as new standards, such as air emission standards, water quality standards and stricter fuel regulations continue to evolve. However, environmental laws and regulations, including those that may arise to address concerns about global climate change, are expected to continue to have an increasing impact on our operations in the United States and in other countries in which we operate. Notable areas of potential impacts include air emission compliance and remediation obligations in the United States. For example, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 imposed obligations to provide increasing volumes on a percentage basis of renewable fuels in transportation motor fuels through 2012. These obligations were changed with the enactment of the Energy Independence Security Act of 2007, which was signed in late December. The new law requires fuel producers and importers to provide approximately 66 percent more renewable fuels in 2008 as compared with amounts set forth in the Energy Policy Act of 2005, with increases in amounts of renewable fuels required through 2022. We are in the process of establishing implementation, operating and capital strategies, along with advanced technology development, to meet these requirements. We also are subject to certain laws and regulations relating to environmental remediation obligations associated with current and past operations. Such laws and regulations include CERCLA and RCRA and their state equivalents. Remediation obligations include cleanup responsibility arising from petroleum releases from underground storage tanks located at numerous past and present ConocoPhillips owned and or operated petroleum marketing outlets throughout the United States. Federal and state laws require contamination caused by such underground storage tank releases be assessed and remediated to meet applicable standards. In addition to other cleanup standards, many states adopted cleanup criteria for methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) for both soil and groundwater. At RCRA permitted facilities, we are required to assess environmental conditions. If conditions warrant, we may be required to remediate contamination caused by prior operations. In contrast to CERCLA, which is often referred to as Superfund, the cost of corrective action activities under RCRA corrective action programs typically is borne solely by us. Over the next decade, we anticipate increasing expenditures for RCRA remediation activities may be required, but such annual expenditures for the near term are not expected to vary significantly from the range of such expenditures we have experienced over the past few years. Longer term expenditures are subject to considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly. We, from time to time, receive requests for information or notices of potential liability from the EPA and state environmental agencies alleging that we are a potentially responsible party under CERCLA or an equivalent state statute. On occasion, we also have been made a party to cost recovery litigation by those agencies or by private parties. These requests, notices and lawsuits assert potential liability for remediation costs at various sites that typically are not owned by us, but allegedly contain wastes attributable to our past operations. As of December 31, 2007, we reported we had been notified of potential liability under CERCLA and comparable state laws at 68 sites around the United States. At December 31, 2008, we re opened three sites and closed one of those sites, resolved and closed seven sites, and received two new notices of potential liability, leaving 65 unresolved sites where we have been notified of potential liability. For most Superfund sites, our potential liability will be significantly less than the total site remediation costs because the percentage of waste attributable to us, versus that attributable to all other potentially responsible parties, is relatively low. Although liability of those potentially responsible is generally joint and several for federal sites and frequently so for state sites, other potentially responsible parties at sites where we are a party typically have had the financial strength to meet their obligations, and where they have not, or where potentially responsible parties could not be located, our share of liability has not increased materially. Many of the sites at which we are potentially responsible are still under investigation by the EPA or the state agencies concerned. Prior to actual cleanup, those potentially responsible normally assess site conditions, apportion responsibility and determine the appropriate remediation. In some instances, we may have no liability or attain a settlement of liability. Actual cleanup costs generally occur after the parties obtain EPA or equivalent state agency approval. There are relatively few sites where we are a major participant, and given the timing and 64 Table of Contents amounts of anticipated expenditures, neither the cost of remediation at those sites nor such costs at all CERCLA sites, in the aggregate, is expected to have a material adverse effect on our competitive or financial condition. Expensed environmental costs were $957 million in 2008 and are expected to be about $1.0 billion per year in 2009 and 2010. Capitalized environmental costs were $1,025 million in 2008 and are expected to be about $900 million per year in 2009 and 2010. We accrue for remediation activities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and reasonable estimates of the liability can be made. These accrued liabilities are not reduced for potential recoveries from insurers or other third parties and are not discounted (except those assumed in a purchase business combination, which we do record on a discounted basis). Many of these liabilities result from CERCLA, RCRA and similar state laws that require us to undertake certain investigative and remedial activities at sites where we conduct, or once conducted, operations or at sites where ConocoPhillips generated waste was disposed. The accrual also includes a number of sites we identified that may require environmental remediation, but which are not currently the subject of CERCLA, RCRA or state enforcement activities. If applicable, we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third party recoveries. In the future, we may incur significant costs under both CERCLA and RCRA. Considerable uncertainty exists with respect to these costs, and under adverse changes in circumstances, potential liability may exceed amounts accrued as of December 31, 2008. Remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site, depending on the mix of unique site characteristics, evolving remediation technologies, diverse regulatory agencies and enforcement policies, and the presence or absence of potentially liable third parties. Therefore, it is difficult to develop reasonable estimates of future site remediation costs. At December 31, 2008, our balance sheet included total accrued environmental costs of $979 million, compared with $1,089 million at December 31, 2007. We expect to incur a substantial amount of these expenditures within the next 30 years. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, and as with other companies engaged in similar businesses, environmental costs and liabilities are inherent in our operations and products, and there can be no assurance that material costs and liabilities will not be incurred. However, we currently do not expect any material adverse effect upon our results of operations or financial position as a result of compliance with current environmental laws and regulations. Climate Change There has been a broad range of proposed or promulgated state, national and international laws focusing on greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction. These proposed or promulgated laws apply or could apply in countries where we have interests or may have interests in the future. Laws in this field continue to evolve, and while they are likely to be increasingly widespread and stringent, at this stage it is not possible to accurately estimate either a timetable for implementation or our future compliance costs relating to implementation. Compliance with changes in laws, regulations and obligations that create a GHG emissions trading scheme or GHG reduction policies generally could significantly increase costs or reduce demand for fossil energy derived products. Examples of legislation or precursors for possible regulation that does or could affect our operations include: European Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS), the program through which many of the European Union (EU) member states are implementing the Kyoto Protocol. Californias Global Warming Solutions Act, which requires the California Air Resources Board (CARB) to develop regulations and market mechanisms that will ultimately reduce Californias greenhouse gas emissions by 25 percent by 2020. 65 Table of Contents Two regulations issued by the Alberta government in 2007 under the Climate Change and Emissions Act. These regulations require any existing facility with emissions equal to or greater than 100,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide or equivalent per year to reduce the net emissions intensity of that facility by 2 percent per year beginning July 1, 2007, with an ultimate reduction target of 12 percent of baseline emissions. The U.S. Supreme Court decision in Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. 497, 127 S.Ct. 1438 (2007) confirming that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has the authority to regulate carbon dioxide as an air pollutant under the Federal Clean Air Act. In the EU, we have assets that are subject to the ETS. The first phase of the EU ETS was completed at the end of 2007, with EU ETS phase II running from 2008 through 2012. The European Commission has approved most of the phase II national allocation plans. We are actively engaged to minimize any financial impact from the trading scheme. In the United States, there is growing consensus that some form of regulation will be forthcoming at the federal level with respect to GHG emissions and such regulation could result in the creation of additional costs in the form of taxes or required acquisition or trading of emission allowances. In light of this consensus, we have taken a position to encourage the adoption of a pragmatic and sustainable regulatory framework addressing GHG. To that end, we joined the U.S. Climate Action Partnership (USCAP) in support of the development of a national regulatory framework to reduce the level of GHG emissions. We support a framework that is economically sustainable, environmentally effective, transparent and fair, and internationally linked. We are working to continuously improve operational and energy efficiency through resource and energy conservation throughout our operations. Other We have deferred tax assets related to certain accrued liabilities, loss carryforwards and credit carryforwards. Valuation allowances have been established to reduce these deferred tax assets to an amount that will, more likely than not, be realized. Based on our historical taxable income, our expectations for the future, and available tax planning strategies, management expects that the net deferred tax assets will be realized as offsets to reversing deferred tax liabilities and as reductions in future taxable income. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 141 (Revised), Business Combinations (SFAS No. 141(R)). This Statement will apply to all transactions in which an entity obtains control of one or more other businesses. In general, SFAS No. 141(R) requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize the fair value of all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction; establishes the acquisition date as the fair value measurement point; and modifies the disclosure requirements. Additionally, it changes the accounting treatment for transaction costs, acquired contingent arrangements, in process research and development, restructuring costs, changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances as a result of business combination, and changes in income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date. This Statement applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after January 1, 2009. However, starting January 1, 2009, accounting for changes in valuation allowances for acquired deferred tax assets and the resolution of uncertain tax positions for prior business combinations will impact tax expense instead of impacting goodwill. Also in December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements an amendment of ARB No. 51, which requires noncontrolling interests, also called minority interests, to be presented as a separate item in the equity section of the consolidated balance sheet. It also requires the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest to be clearly presented on the face of the consolidated income statement. Additionally, this Statement clarifies that changes in a parents ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in deconsolidation are equity transactions, and when a subsidiary is deconsolidated, it requires gain or loss recognition in net income based on the fair value on the deconsolidation date. This Statement is effective January 1, 2009, and will be applied prospectively 66 Table of Contents with the exception of the presentation and disclosure requirements, which must be applied retrospectively for all periods presented. In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities an amendment of FASB No. 133. This Statement expands disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, for derivative instruments within the scope of that Statement to provide greater transparency. This includes disclosure of the additional information regarding how and why derivative instruments are used, how derivatives are accounted for, and how they affect an entitys financial performance. This Statement is effective for interim and annual financial statements beginning with the first quarter of 2009, but it will not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements, other than the additional disclosures. In November 2008, the FASB reached a consensus on Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 08 6, Equity Method Investment Accounting Considerations (EITF 08 6), which was issued to clarify how the application of equity method accounting will be affected by SFAS No. 141(R) and SFAS No. 160. EITF 08 6 clarifies that an entity shall continue to use the cost accumulation model for its equity method investments. It also confirms past accounting practices related to the treatment of contingent consideration and the use of the impairment model under Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 18, The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock. Additionally, it requires an equity method investor to account for a share issuance by an investee as if the investor had sold a proportionate share of the investment. This issue is effective January 1, 2009, and will be applied prospectively. In December 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) No. 132(R) 1, Employers Disclosures about Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets, to improve the transparency associated with the disclosures about the plan assets of a defined benefit pension or other postretirement plan. This FSP requires the disclosure of each major asset category at fair value using the fair value hierarchy in SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. Also, this FSP requires entities to disclose the net periodic benefit cost recognized for each annual period for which a statement of income is presented. This FSP is effective for annual statements beginning with 2009. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to select appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. See Note 1 Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for descriptions of our major accounting policies. Certain of these accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is a reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts would have been reported under different conditions, or if different assumptions had been used. These critical accounting estimates are discussed with the Audit and Finance Committee of the Board of Directors at least annually. We believe the following discussions of critical accounting estimates, along with the discussions of contingencies and of deferred tax asset valuation allowances in this report, address all important accounting areas where the nature of accounting estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change. Oil and Gas Accounting Accounting for oil and gas exploratory activity is subject to special accounting rules unique to the oil and gas industry. The acquisition of geological and geophysical seismic information, prior to the discovery of proved reserves, is expensed as incurred, similar to accounting for research and development costs. However, leasehold acquisition costs and exploratory well costs are capitalized on the balance sheet pending determination of whether proved oil and gas reserves have been discovered on the prospect. Property Acquisition Costs For individually significant leaseholds, management periodically assesses for impairment based on exploration and drilling efforts to date. For leasehold acquisition costs that individually are relatively small, management 67 Table of Contents exercises judgment and determines a percentage probability that the prospect ultimately will fail to find proved oil and gas reserves and pools that leasehold information with others in the geographic area. For prospects in areas that have had limited, or no, previous exploratory drilling, the percentage probability of ultimate failure is normally judged to be quite high. This judgmental percentage is multiplied by the leasehold acquisition cost, and that product is divided by the contractual period of the leasehold to determine a periodic leasehold impairment charge that is reported in exploration expense. This judgmental probability percentage is reassessed and adjusted throughout the contractual period of the leasehold based on favorable or unfavorable exploratory activity on the leasehold or on adjacent leaseholds, and leasehold impairment amortization expense is adjusted prospectively. At year end 2008, the book value of the pools of property acquisition costs, that individually are relatively small and thus subject to the above described periodic leasehold impairment calculation, was $1,447 million and the accumulated impairment reserve was $494 million. The weighted average judgmental percentage probability of ultimate failure was approximately 65 percent, and the weighted average amortization period was approximately 2.4 years. If that judgmental percentage were to be raised by 5 percent across all calculations, pretax leasehold impairment expense in 2009 would increase by approximately $30 million. The remaining $4,745 million of capitalized unproved property costs at year end 2008 consisted of individually significant leaseholds, mineral rights held in perpetuity by title ownership, exploratory wells currently drilling, and suspended exploratory wells. Management periodically assesses individually significant leaseholds for impairment based on the results of exploration and drilling efforts and the outlook for project commercialization. Of this amount, approximately $2.4 billion is concentrated in 10 major development areas. None of these major assets are expected to move to proved properties in 2009. Exploratory Costs For exploratory wells, drilling costs are temporarily capitalized, or suspended, on the balance sheet, pending a determination of whether potentially economic oil and gas reserves have been discovered by the drilling effort to justify completion of the find as a producing well. Once a determination is made the well did not encounter potentially economic oil and gas quantities, the well costs are expensed as a dry hole and reported in exploration expense. If exploratory wells encounter potentially economic quantities of oil and gas, the well costs remain capitalized on the balance sheet as long as sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made. The accounting notion of sufficient progress is a judgmental area, but the accounting rules do prohibit continued capitalization of suspended well costs on the mere chance that future market conditions will improve or new technologies will be found that would make the projects development economically profitable. Often, the ability to move the project into the development phase and record proved reserves is dependent on obtaining permits and government or co venturer approvals, the timing of which is ultimately beyond our control. Exploratory well costs remain suspended as long as the company is actively pursuing such approvals and permits, and believes they will be obtained. Once all required approvals and permits have been obtained, the projects are moved into the development phase, and the oil and gas reserves are designated as proved reserves. For complex exploratory discoveries, it is not unusual to have exploratory wells remain suspended on the balance sheet for several years while we perform additional appraisal drilling and seismic work on the potential oil and gas field, or while we seek government or co venturer approval of development plans or seek environmental permitting. Management reviews suspended well balances quarterly, continuously monitors the results of the additional appraisal drilling and seismic work, and expenses the suspended well costs as a dry hole when it determines the potential field does not warrant further investment in the near term. Criteria utilized in making this determination include evaluation of the reservoir characteristics and hydrocarbon properties, expected development costs, ability to apply existing technology to produce the reserves, fiscal terms, regulations or contract negotiations, and our required return on investment. At year end 2008, total suspended well costs were $660 million, compared with $589 million at year end 2007. For additional information on suspended wells, including an aging analysis, see Note 8 Properties, Plants and Equipment, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 68 Table of Contents Proved Oil and Gas Reserves and Canadian Syncrude Reserves Engineering estimates of the quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves in oil and gas fields and in place crude bitumen volumes in oil sand mining operations are inherently imprecise and represent only approximate amounts because of the subjective judgments involved in developing such information. Reserve estimates are based on subjective judgments involving geological and engineering assessments of in place hydrocarbon volumes, the production or mining plan, historical extraction recovery and processing yield factors, installed plant operating capacity and operating approval limits. The reliability of these estimates at any point in time depends on both the quality and quantity of the technical and economic data and the efficiency of extracting and processing the hydrocarbons. Despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates, accounting rules require disclosure of proved reserve estimates due to the importance of these estimates to better understand the perceived value and future cash flows of a companys EP operations. There are several authoritative guidelines regarding the engineering criteria that must be met before estimated reserves can be designated as proved. Our reservoir engineering organization has policies and procedures in place that are consistent with these authoritative guidelines. We have trained and experienced internal engineering personnel who estimate our proved crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids reserves held by consolidated companies, as well as our share of equity affiliates, with assistance from third party petroleum engineering consultants with regard to our equity interests in LUKOIL and Australia Pacific LNG. Proved reserve estimates are updated annually and take into account recent production and subsurface information about each field or oil sand mining operation. Also, as required by current authoritative guidelines, the estimated future date when a field or oil sand mining operation will be permanently shut down for economic reasons is based on an extrapolation of sales prices and operating costs prevalent at the balance sheet date. This estimated date when production will end affects the amount of estimated reserves. Therefore, as prices and cost levels change from year to year, the estimate of proved reserves also changes. Our proved reserves include estimated quantities related to production sharing contracts, which are reported under the economic interest method and are subject to fluctuations in prices of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids; recoverable operating expenses; and capital costs. If costs remain stable, reserve quantities attributable to recovery of costs will change inversely to changes in commodity prices. For example, if prices increase, then our applicable reserve quantities would decline. The estimation of proved reserves also is important to the statement of operations because the proved oil and gas reserve estimate for a field or the estimated in place crude bitumen volume for an oil sand mining operation serves as the denominator in the unit of production calculation of depreciation, depletion and amortization of the capitalized costs for that asset. At year end 2008, the net book value of productive EP properties, plants and equipment subject to a unit of production calculation, including our Canadian Syncrude bitumen oil sand assets, was approximately $58 billion and the depreciation, depletion and amortization recorded on these assets in 2008 was approximately $7.7 billion. The estimated proved developed oil and gas reserves of these fields were 6.1 billion BOE at the beginning of 2008 and were 5.5 billion BOE at the end of 2008. The estimated proved reserves of Canadian Syncrude assets were 221 million barrels at the beginning of 2008 and were 249 million barrels at the end of 2008. If the estimates of proved reserves used in the unit of production calculations had been lower by 5 percent across all calculations, pretax depreciation, depletion and amortization in 2008 would have increased by an estimated $406 million. Impairments of producing oil and gas properties in 2008, 2007 and 2006 totaled $793 million, $471 million and $215 million, respectively. Of these write downs, $56 million in 2008, $76 million in 2007 and $131 million in 2006 were due to downward revisions of proved reserves due to reservoir performance. Impairments Long lived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in the future cash flows expected to be generated by an asset group. If, upon review, the sum of the undiscounted pretax cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset group, the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value. Individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes based on a judgmental assessment of the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that 69 Table of Contents are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets generally on a field by field basis for exploration and production assets, at an entire complex level for downstream assets, or at a site level for retail stores. Because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for long lived assets, the fair value of impaired assets is determined based on the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates commensurate with the risks involved in the asset group or based on a multiple of operating cash flow validated with historical market transactions of similar assets where possible. The expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are based on judgmental assessments of future production volumes, prices and costs, considering all available information at the date of review. See Note 10 Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. Investments in nonconsolidated entities accounted for under the equity method are reviewed for impairment when there is evidence of a loss in value. Such evidence of a loss in value might include our inability to recover the carrying amount, the lack of sustained earnings capacity which would justify the current investment amount, or a current fair value less than the investments carrying amount. When it is determined such a loss in value is other than temporary, an impairment charge is recognized for the difference between the investments carrying value and its estimated fair value. When determining whether a decline in value is other than temporary, management considers factors such as the length of time and extent of the decline, the investees financial condition and near term prospects, and the companys ability and intention to retain its investment for a period that will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the market value of the investment. When quoted market prices are not available, the fair value is usually based on the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates commensurate with the risks of the investment. Differing assumptions could affect the timing and the amount of an impairment of an investment in any period. For additional information, see the LUKOIL section of Note 7 Investments, Loans and Long Term Receivables, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Asset Retirement Obligations and Environmental Costs Under various contracts, permits and regulations, we have material legal obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore the land or seabed at the end of operations at operational sites. Our largest asset removal obligations involve removal and disposal of offshore oil and gas platforms around the world, oil and gas production facilities and pipelines in Alaska, and asbestos abatement at refineries. The fair values of obligations for dismantling and removing these facilities are accrued at the installation of the asset based on estimated discounted costs. Estimating the future asset removal costs necessary for this accounting calculation is difficult. Most of these removal obligations are many years, or decades, in the future and the contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what removal practices and criteria must be met when the removal event actually occurs. Asset removal technologies and costs are changing constantly, as well as political, environmental, safety and public relations considerations. In addition, under the above or similar contracts, permits and regulations, we have certain obligations to complete environmental related projects. These projects are primarily related to cleanup at domestic refineries and underground storage tanks at U.S. service stations, and remediation activities required by Canada and the state of Alaska at exploration and production sites. Future environmental remediation costs are difficult to estimate because they are subject to change due to such factors as the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs, the unknown time and extent of such remedial actions that may be required, and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other responsible parties. 70 Table of Contents Business Acquisitions Purchase Price Allocation Accounting for the acquisition of a business requires the allocation of the purchase price to the various assets and liabilities of the acquired business. For most assets and liabilities, purchase price allocation is accomplished by recording the asset or liability at its estimated fair value. The most difficult estimations of individual fair values are those involving properties, plants and equipment and identifiable intangible assets. We use all available information to make these fair value determinations. We have, if necessary, up to one year after the acquisition closing date to finish these fair value determinations and finalize the purchase price allocation. Intangible Assets and Goodwill At December 31, 2008, we had $738 million of intangible assets determined to have indefinite useful lives, thus they are not amortized. This judgmental assessment of an indefinite useful life must be continuously evaluated in the future. If, due to changes in facts and circumstances, management determines these intangible assets have definite useful lives, amortization will have to commence at that time on a prospective basis. As long as these intangible assets are judged to have indefinite lives, they will be subject to periodic lower of cost or market tests that require managements judgment of the estimated fair value of these intangible assets. See Note 9 Goodwill and Intangibles, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. In the fourth quarter of 2008, we fully impaired the recorded goodwill associated with our Worldwide EP reporting unit. See the Goodwill Impairment section of Note 9 Goodwill and Intangibles, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which is incorporated herein by reference, for a detailed discussion of the facts and circumstances leading to this impairment, as well as the judgments required by management in the analysis leading to the impairment determination. After the goodwill impairment, at December 31, 2008, we had $3,778 million of goodwill remaining on our balance sheet, all of which was attributable to the Worldwide RM reporting unit. Projected Benefit Obligations Determination of the projected benefit obligations for our defined benefit pension and postretirement plans are important to the recorded amounts for such obligations on the balance sheet and to the amount of benefit expense in the statement of operations. The actuarial determination of projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements involves judgment about uncertain future events, including estimated retirement dates, salary levels at retirement, mortality rates, lump sum election rates, rates of return on plan assets, future health care cost trend rates, and rates of utilization of health care services by retirees. Due to the specialized nature of these calculations, we engage outside actuarial firms to assist in the determination of these projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements. For Employee Retirement Income Security Act qualified pension plans, the actuary exercises fiduciary care on behalf of plan participants in the determination of the judgmental assumptions used in determining required company contributions into plan assets. Due to differing objectives and requirements between financial accounting rules and the pension plan funding regulations promulgated by governmental agencies, the actuarial methods and assumptions for the two purposes differ in certain important respects. Ultimately, we will be required to fund all promised benefits under pension and postretirement benefit plans not funded by plan assets or investment returns, but the judgmental assumptions used in the actuarial calculations significantly affect periodic financial statements and funding patterns over time. Benefit expense is particularly sensitive to the discount rate and return on plan assets assumptions. A 1 percent decrease in the discount rate would increase annual benefit expense by $79 million, while a 1 percent decrease in the return on plan assets assumption would increase annual benefit expense by $43 million. In determining the discount rate, we use yields on high quality fixed income investments matched to the estimated benefit cash flows of our plans. 71 Table of Contents CAUTIONARY STATEMENT FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE SAFE HARBOR PROVISIONS OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995 This report includes forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. You can identify our forward looking statements by the words anticipate, estimate, believe, continue, could, intend, may, plan, potential, predict, should, will, expect, objective, projection, forecast, goal, guidance, outlook, effort, target and similar expressions. We based the forward looking statements relating to our operations on our current expectations, estimates and projections about ourselves and the industries in which we operate in general. We caution you these statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions we cannot predict. In addition, we based many of these forward looking statements on assumptions about future events that may prove to be inaccurate. Accordingly, our actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what we have expressed or forecast in the forward looking statements. Any differences could result from a variety of factors, including the following: Fluctuations in crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices, refining and marketing margins and margins for our chemicals business. Potential failure or delays in achieving expected reserve or production levels from existing and future oil and gas development projects due to operating hazards, drilling risks and the inherent uncertainties in predicting oil and gas reserves and oil and gas reservoir performance. Unsuccessful exploratory drilling activities or the inability to obtain access to exploratory acreage. Failure of new products and services to achieve market acceptance. Unexpected changes in costs or technical requirements for constructing, modifying or operating facilities for exploration and production, manufacturing, refining or transportation projects. Unexpected technological or commercial difficulties in manufacturing, refining, or transporting our products, including synthetic crude oil and chemicals products. Lack of, or disruptions in, adequate and reliable transportation for our crude oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids, LNG and refined products. Inability to timely obtain or maintain permits, including those necessary for construction of LNG terminals or regasification facilities, or refinery projects; comply with government regulations; or make capital expenditures required to maintain compliance. Failure to complete definitive agreements and feasibility studies for, and to timely complete construction of, announced and future exploration and production, LNG, refinery and transportation projects. Potential disruption or interruption of our operations due to accidents, extraordinary weather events, civil unrest, political events or terrorism. International monetary conditions and exchange controls. Substantial investment or reduced demand for products as a result of existing or future environmental rules and regulations. Liability for remedial actions, including removal and reclamation obligations, under environmental regulations. Liability resulting from litigation. General domestic and international economic and political developments, including: armed hostilities; expropriation of assets; changes in governmental policies relating to crude oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids or refined product pricing, regulation, or taxation; other political, economic or diplomatic developments; and international monetary fluctuations. Changes in tax and other laws, regulations (including alternative energy mandates), or royalty rules applicable to our business. Limited access to capital or significantly higher cost of capital related to illiquidity or uncertainty in the domestic or international financial markets. Inability to obtain economical financing for projects, construction or modification of facilities and general corporate purposes. 72 Table of Contents The operation and financing of our midstream and chemicals joint ventures. The factors generally described in the Risk Factors section included in Item 1A Risk Factors in this report. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Financial Instrument Market Risk We and certain of our subsidiaries hold and issue derivative contracts and financial instruments that expose our cash flows or earnings to changes in commodity prices, foreign exchange rates or interest rates. We may use financial and commodity based derivative contracts to manage the risks produced by changes in the prices of electric power, natural gas, crude oil and related products, fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, or to exploit market opportunities. Our use of derivative instruments is governed by an Authority Limitations document approved by our Board of Directors that prohibits the use of highly leveraged derivatives or derivative instruments without sufficient liquidity for comparable valuations. The Authority Limitations document also authorizes the Chief Operating Officer to establish the maximum Value at Risk (VaR) limits for the company and compliance with these limits is monitored daily. The Chief Financial Officer monitors risks resulting from foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates and reports to the Chief Executive Officer. The Senior Vice President of Commercial monitors commodity price risk and reports to the Chief Operating Officer. The Commercial organization manages our commercial marketing, optimizes our commodity flows and positions, monitors related risks of our upstream and downstream businesses, and selectively takes price risk to add value. Commodity Price Risk We operate in the worldwide crude oil, refined products, natural gas, natural gas liquids, and electric power markets and are exposed to fluctuations in the prices for these commodities. These fluctuations can affect our revenues, as well as the cost of operating, investing, and financing activities. Generally, our policy is to remain exposed to the market prices of commodities; however, executive management may elect to use derivative instruments to hedge the price risk of our crude oil and natural gas production, as well as refinery margins. Our Commercial organization uses futures, forwards, swaps, and options in various markets to optimize the value of our supply chain, which may move our risk profile away from market average prices to accomplish the following objectives: Balance physical systems. In addition to cash settlement prior to contract expiration, exchange traded futures contracts also may be settled by physical delivery of the commodity, providing another source of supply to meet our refinery requirements or marketing demand. Meet customer needs. Consistent with our policy to generally remain exposed to market prices, we use swap contracts to convert fixed price sales contracts, which are often requested by natural gas and refined product consumers, to a floating market price. Manage the risk to our cash flows from price exposures on specific crude oil, natural gas, refined product and electric power transactions. Enable us to use the market knowledge gained from these activities to do a limited amount of trading not directly related to our physical business. For the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, the gains or losses from this activity were not material to our cash flows or net income. We use a VaR model to estimate the loss in fair value that could potentially result on a single day from the effect of adverse changes in market conditions on the derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments held or issued, including commodity purchase and sales contracts recorded on the balance sheet at December 31, 2008, as derivative instruments in accordance with SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended (SFAS No. 133). Using Monte Carlo simulation, a 95 percent confidence level and a one day holding period, the VaR for those instruments issued or held for trading purposes at December 31, 2008 and 2007, was immaterial to our net income and cash flows. 73 Table of Contents The VaR for instruments held for purposes other than trading at December 31, 2008 and 2007, was also immaterial to our net income and cash flows. Interest Rate Risk The following tables provide information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in short term U.S. interest rates. The debt table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates. Weighted average variable rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at the reporting date. The carrying amount of our floating rate debt approximates its fair value. The fair value of the fixed rate financial instruments is estimated based on quoted market prices.

The fair value of the obligation is estimated based on the net present value of the future cash flows, discounted at a year end 2008 and 2007 effective yield rate of 5.4 percent and 4.9 percent, respectively, based on yields of U.S. Treasury securities of a similar average duration adjusted for ConocoPhillips average credit risk spread and the amortizing nature of the obligation principal.

We do not comprehensively hedge the exposure to currency rate changes, although we may choose to selectively hedge exposures to foreign currency rate risk. Examples include firm commitments for capital projects, net investments in foreign subsidiaries, certain local currency tax payments and dividends, and cash returns from net investments in foreign affiliates to be remitted within the coming year. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, we held foreign currency swaps hedging short term intercompany loans between European subsidiaries and a U.S. subsidiary. Although these swaps hedge exposures to fluctuations in exchange rates, we elected not to utilize hedge accounting as allowed by SFAS No. 133. As a result, the change in the fair value of these foreign currency swaps is recorded directly in earnings. Since the gain or loss on the swaps is offset by the gain or loss from remeasuring the intercompany loans into the functional currency of the lender or borrower, there would be no material impact to income from an adverse hypothetical 10 percent change in the December 31, 2008 or 2007, exchange rates. The notional and fair market values of these positions at December 31, 2008 and 2007, were as follows: In Millions Notional* Fair Market Value** Foreign Currency Swaps 2008 2007 2008 2007 Sell U.S. dollar, buy euro USD 526 744 $ 53 3 Sell U.S. dollar, buy British pound USD 1,657 1,049 (46 ) (16 ) Sell U.S. dollar, buy Canadian dollar USD 1,474 1,195 13 13 Sell U.S. dollar, buy Czech koruna USD 40 (2 ) Sell U.S. dollar, buy Danish krone USD 5 20 Sell U.S. dollar, buy Norwegian kroner USD 1,103 779 (10 ) 15 Sell U.S. dollar, buy Swedish krona USD 51 11 1 Sell U.S. dollar, buy Australian dollar USD 246 3 Sell euro, buy Canadian dollar EUR 102 58 Buy euro, sell British pound EUR 147 1 (8 ) 3 * Denominated in U.S. dollars (USD) and euro (EUR). ** Denominated in U.S. dollars.
