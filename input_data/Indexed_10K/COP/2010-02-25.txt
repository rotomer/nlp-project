The terms earnings and loss as used in Managements Discussion and Analysis refer to net income (loss) attributable to ConocoPhillips. BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW ConocoPhillips is an international, integrated energy company. We are the third largest integrated energy company in the United States, based on market capitalization. We have approximately 30,000 employees worldwide, and at year end 2009 had assets of $153 billion. Our stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol COP. Our business is organized into six operating segments: Exploration and Production (EP) This segment primarily explores for, produces, transports and markets crude oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids and bitumen on a worldwide basis. Midstream This segment gathers, processes and markets natural gas produced by ConocoPhillips and others, and fractionates and markets natural gas liquids, predominantly in the United States and Trinidad. The Midstream segment primarily consists of our 50 percent equity investment in DCP Midstream, LLC. Refining and Marketing (RM) This segment purchases, refines, markets and transports crude oil and petroleum products, mainly in the United States, Europe and Asia. LUKOIL Investment This segment consists of our equity investment in the ordinary shares of OAO LUKOIL, an international, integrated oil and gas company headquartered in Russia. At December 31, 2009, our ownership interest was 20 percent based on issued shares and 20.09 percent based on estimated shares outstanding. Chemicals This segment manufactures and markets petrochemicals and plastics on a worldwide basis. The Chemicals segment consists of our 50 percent equity investment in Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC (CPChem). Emerging Businesses This segment represents our investment in new technologies or businesses outside our normal scope of operations. 32 Table of Contents The business environment for the energy industry in 2009 continued to experience volatility associated with the supply/demand factors that drive its commodity prices and margins. During 2008, forecasts of worldwide economic growth and increasingly scarce supply, a weakening U.S. dollar, and other factors helped drive crude oil prices to record highs by mid year, with the benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) peaking at almost $150 per barrel. This was followed by an abrupt shift into a severe global financial recession, which drove crude oil prices to the low $30 per barrel range by the end of 2008. As the global economy began to recover, oil prices steadily improved during 2009 and have remained fairly strong due to demand in Asia. The recovery from the recession in the United States, however, has been slower and has impacted demand for U.S. natural gas and refined products. In response to this challenging business environment, ConocoPhillips announced several strategic initiatives in late 2009 designed to improve its financial position and increase returns on capital. This will be accomplished primarily through a combination of enhanced capital discipline and asset portfolio rationalization, consistent with our objectives of creating shareholder value and improving financial flexibility, while pursuing long term strategic projects. Our total capital program in 2010 is expected to be $11.2 billion, down from a budgeted $12.5 billion in 2009. To improve our financial position and strengthen the balance sheet, we intend to raise approximately $10 billion from asset dispositions over the next two years. Proceeds will be targeted to debt reduction, accelerating the return to our targeted debt to capital ratio of 20 percent to 25 percent. After these initiatives, we intend to continue to replace reserves and increase production from a reduced, but more strategic, asset base. Crude oil and natural gas prices, along with refining margins, are the most significant factors in our profitability, and are driven by market factors over which we have no control. As noted above, these prices and margins are subject to extreme volatility. However, from a competitive perspective, there are other important factors we must manage well to be successful, including: Operating our producing properties and refining and marketing operations safely, consistently and in an environmentally sound manner. Safety is our first priority, and we are committed to protecting the health and safety of everyone who has a role in our operations and the communities in which we operate. Optimizing utilization rates at our refineries and minimizing downtime in producing fields enable us to capture the value available in the market in terms of prices and margins. During 2009, our worldwide refining capacity utilization rate was 84 percent, compared with 90 percent in 2008. The lower rate primarily reflects reduced throughput at our U.S. and German refineries due to economic conditions, as well as higher planned downtime, efficiently utilizing periods of lower margins for maintenance. Although certain North America production was shut in during part of 2009 due to the natural gas pricing environment, we increased total production on a barrel of oil equivalent basis in 2009 by 2 percent. Finally, we strive to conduct our operations in a manner consistent with our environmental stewardship principles. Adding to our proved reserve base. We primarily add to our proved reserve base in three ways: o Successful exploration and development of new fields. o Acquisition of existing fields. o Application of new technologies and processes to improve recovery from existing fields. Through a combination of the methods listed above, we have been successful in the past in maintaining or adding to our production and proved reserve base, and we anticipate being able to do so in the future. In the five years ending December 31, 2009, our reserve replacement was 145 percent. Over this period we added reserves through acquisitions and project developments, partially offset by the impact of asset expropriations in Venezuela and Ecuador. Access to additional resources has become increasingly difficult as direct investment is prohibited in some nations, while fiscal and other terms in other countries can make projects uneconomic or unattractive. In addition, political instability, competition from national oil companies, and lack of access to high potential areas due to environmental or other regulation may negatively impact our ability to increase our reserve base. As such, the timing and level at which we add to our reserve base may, or may not, allow us to replace our production over subsequent years. 33 Table of Contents Controlling costs and expenses. Since we cannot control the prices of the commodity products we sell, controlling operating and overhead costs, within the context of our commitment to safety and environmental stewardship, are high priorities. We monitor these costs using various methodologies that are reported to senior management monthly, on both an absolute dollar basis and a per unit basis. Because managing operating and overhead costs is critical to maintaining competitive positions in our industries, cost control is a component of our variable compensation programs. Operating and overhead costs were reduced 13 percent in 2009, compared with 2008, reflecting both market conditions and our continued emphasis on cost control throughout the year. Selecting the appropriate projects in which to invest our capital dollars. We participate in capital intensive industries. As a result, we must often invest significant capital dollars to explore for new oil and gas fields, develop newly discovered fields, maintain existing fields, or continue to maintain and improve our refinery complexes. We invest in projects that are expected to provide an adequate financial return on invested dollars. However, there are often long lead times from the time we make an investment to the time that investment is operational and begins generating financial returns. The capital expenditures and investments portion of our capital program totaled $10.9 billion in 2009, and we anticipate capital expenditures and investments to be approximately $10.5 billion in 2010. The 2010 budget is consistent with our recently announced plan to improve returns through increased capital discipline, while still funding existing projects and enabling us to preserve flexibility to develop major projects in the future. In addition to our capital program, we paid dividends on our common stock of $2.8 billion in 2009. Managing our asset portfolio. We continually evaluate our assets to determine whether they no longer fit our strategic plans and should be sold or otherwise disposed. In 2008, we sold our retail marketing assets in Norway, Sweden and Denmark, in addition to our EP properties in Argentina and the Netherlands. In 2009, we sold a majority of our U.S. retail marketing assets. Also in 2009, we announced our intention to raise approximately $10 billion from asset dispositions over the next two years. Developing and retaining a talented work force. We strive to attract, train, develop and retain individuals with the knowledge and skills to implement our business strategy and who support our values and ethics. Throughout the company, we focus on the continued learning, development and technical training of our employees. Professional new hires participate in structured development programs designed to accelerate their technical and functional skills. Our key performance indicators are shown in the statistical tables provided at the beginning of the operating segment sections that follow. These include crude oil and natural gas liquids prices, natural gas prices, production, refining capacity utilization, and refinery output. 34 Table of Contents Other significant factors that can affect our profitability include: Impairments. As mentioned above, we participate in capital intensive industries. At times, our investments become impaired when our reserve estimates are revised downward, when crude oil prices, natural gas prices or refining margins decline significantly for long periods of time, or when a decision to dispose of an asset leads to a write down to its fair market value. We may also invest large amounts of money in exploration blocks which, if exploratory drilling proves unsuccessful, could lead to a material impairment of leasehold values. Before tax impairments in 2009 totaled $0.8 billion and primarily related to certain natural gas properties in western Canada and our equity investment in Naraynmarneftegaz (NMNG). Before tax impairments in 2008, excluding the goodwill impairment discussed below and a $7.4 billion impairment related to our LUKOIL investment, totaled $1.7 billion. Goodwill. At year end 2009 and 2008, we had $3.6 billion and $3.8 billion, respectively, of goodwill on our balance sheet, compared with $29.3 billion at year end 2007. In 2008, we recorded a $25.4 billion complete impairment of our EP segment goodwill, primarily as a function of decreased year end commodity prices and the decline in our market capitalization. For additional information, see Note 9 Goodwill and Intangibles, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Deterioration of market conditions in the future could lead to other goodwill impairments that may have a substantial negative, though noncash, effect on our profitability. Effective tax rate. Our operations are located in countries with different tax rates and fiscal structures. Accordingly, even in a stable commodity price and fiscal/regulatory environment, our overall effective tax rate can vary significantly between periods based on the mix of pretax earnings within our global operations. Fiscal and regulatory environment. As commodity prices and refining margins fluctuated upward over the last several years, certain governments responded with changes to their fiscal take. These changes have generally negatively impacted our results of operations, and further changes to government fiscal take could have a negative impact on future operations. In June 2007, our Venezuelan oil projects were expropriated, and we recorded a $4.5 billion after tax impairment. In the second quarter of 2009, our assets in Ecuador were effectively expropriated, and we recorded a $51 million before and after tax impairment (see the Expropriated Assets section of Note 10 Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). We were also negatively impacted by increased production taxes enacted by the state of Alaska in the fourth quarter of 2007. In Canada, the Alberta provincial government changed the royalty structure for Crown lands, effective January 1, 2009, so that a component of the new royalty rate is tied to prevailing prices. In October 2008, we and our co venturers signed definitive agreements for the proportional dilution of our equity interests in the Republic of Kazakhstans North Caspian Sea Production Sharing Agreement, which includes the Kashagan Field, to allow the state owned energy company to increase its ownership percentage effective January 1, 2008. Partially offsetting the above fiscal take increases were lower corporate income tax rates enacted by Canada and Germany during 2007. These tax rate reductions applied to all corporations and were not exclusive to the oil and gas industry. 35 Table of Contents Segment Analysis The EP segments results are most closely linked to crude oil and natural gas prices. These are commodity products, the prices of which are subject to factors external to our company and over which we have no control. Industry crude oil prices for West Texas Intermediate were lower in 2009, compared with 2008, averaging $61.69 per barrel in 2009, a decrease of 38 percent. Crude oil prices steadily trended upward during 2009, as global crude inventories were reduced due to lower production and economic recovery that stimulated the resumption of global oil demand growth. Industry natural gas prices for Henry Hub decreased 56 percent during 2009 to an average price of $3.99 per million British thermal units, primarily as a result of lower demand due to the U.S. recession and higher domestic production due to increased shale gas production. The Midstream segments results are most closely linked to natural gas liquids prices. The most important factor affecting the profitability of this segment is the results from our 50 percent equity investment in DCP Midstream. DCP Midstreams natural gas liquids prices decreased 43 percent in 2009. Refining margins, refinery utilization, cost control and marketing margins primarily drive the RM segments results. Refining margins are subject to movements in the cost of crude oil and other feedstocks, and the sales prices for refined products, both of which are subject to market factors over which we have no control. Global refining margins remained weak in 2009. The U.S. benchmark 3:2:1 crack spread decreased almost 20 percent in 2009, while the N.W. Europe benchmark declined 54 percent. Demand, particularly for distillates, continued to be suppressed by the global economic slowdown. In addition, the compressed differential in prices for high quality crude oil, compared with those of lower quality crude oil, reduced margins for those refineries configured to capitalize on the ability to process lower quality crudes. The LUKOIL Investment segment consists of our investment in the ordinary shares of LUKOIL. At December 31, 2009, our ownership interest in LUKOIL was 20 percent based on issued shares and 20.09 percent based on estimated shares outstanding. LUKOILs results are subject to factors similar to those of our EP and RM segments. LUKOILs upstream results are closely linked to Russian (Urals) crude oil prices and are heavily impacted by extraction tax rates. Refining margins are significant factors on LUKOILs downstream results. Export tariff rates for crude oil and refined products also have a significant impact on both upstream and downstream results. The Chemicals segment consists of our 50 percent interest in CPChem. The chemicals and plastics industry is mainly a commodity based industry where the margins for key products are based on market factors over which CPChem has little or no control. CPChem is investing in feedstock advantaged areas in the Middle East with access to large, growing markets, such as Asia. The Emerging Businesses segment represents our investment in new technologies or businesses outside our normal scope of operations. Activities within this segment are currently focused on power generation and innovation of new technologies, such as those related to conventional and nonconventional hydrocarbon recovery (including heavy oil), refining, alternative energy, biofuels and the environment. Some of these technologies have the potential to become important drivers of profitability in future years. 36 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Consolidated Results A summary of the companys net income (loss) attributable to ConocoPhillips by business segment follows: Millions of Dollars Years Ended December 31 2009 2008 2007 Exploration and Production (EP) $ 3,604 (13,479 ) 4,615 Midstream 313 541 453 Refining and Marketing (RM) 37 2,322 5,923 LUKOIL Investment 1,663 (5,488 ) 1,818 Chemicals 248 110 359 Emerging Businesses 3 30 (8 ) Corporate and Other (1,010 ) (1,034 ) (1,269 ) Net income (loss) attributable to ConocoPhillips $ 4,858 (16,998 ) 11,891 2009 vs. 2008 The improved results in 2009 were primarily the result of: The absence of a $25,443 million before and after tax impairment of all EP segment goodwill in 2008. The absence of a $7,410 million before and after tax impairment of our LUKOIL investment in 2008. Lower production taxes. Reduced operating and overhead expenses. These items were partially offset by: Lower crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices, which impacted our EP, Midstream and LUKOIL Investment segments. Lower refining margins in our RM segment. 2008 vs. 2007 The lower results in 2008 were primarily the result of: The goodwill and LUKOIL impairments, noted above. Lower U.S. refining margins in our RM segment. An increase in other asset impairments, predominantly in our EP and RM segments. These items were partially offset by: Higher crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices, which benefitted our EP, Midstream and LUKOIL Investment segments. Commodity price benefits were somewhat counteracted by increased production taxes. A 2007 complete impairment ($4,588 million before tax, $4,512 million after tax) of our oil interests in Venezuela, resulting from their expropriation. 37 Table of Contents Statement of Operations Analysis 2009 vs. 2008 Sales and other operating revenues decreased 38 percent in 2009, while purchased crude oil, natural gas and products decreased 39 percent. These decreases were mainly the result of significantly lower prices for petroleum products, crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids. Equity in earnings of affiliates decreased 30 percent in 2009, primarily due to reduced earnings from DCP Midstream; LUKOIL; Merey Sweeny, L.P. (MSLP); Malaysian Refining Company Sdn. Bhd.; and Excel Paralubes, which were partially offset by higher earnings from Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC. The decreases were mainly the result of lower commodity prices and refining margins. Other income decreased 52 percent during 2009. The decrease was primarily due to 2008 gains related to asset dispositions in our EP and RM segments. Production and operating expenses decreased 13 percent in 2009, as a result of lower utilities costs, favorable foreign exchange impacts, and our cost reduction efforts. Selling, general and administrative expense decreased 18 percent in 2009, primarily due to disposition of U.S. and international marketing assets. Taxes other than income taxes decreased 25 percent in 2009, primarily due to lower production taxes resulting from lower crude oil prices, as well as reduced excise taxes on petroleum product sales. Impairments decreased from $34,539 million in 2008 to $535 million in 2009, primarily reflecting the 2008 goodwill and LUKOIL impairments. Other impairments decreased $1,202 million during 2009. For additional information, see Note 6 Investments, Loans and Long Term Receivables, Note 9 Goodwill and Intangibles, and Note 10 Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Interest and debt expense increased 38 percent in 2009, as a result of a higher average debt level, partially offset by lower interest rates. Interest expense also increased as a result of lower capitalized interest. See Note 20 Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for information regarding our income tax expense and effective tax rate. 2008 vs. 2007 Sales and other operating revenues increased 28 percent in 2008, while purchased crude oil, natural gas and products increased 37 percent. These increases were the result of higher petroleum product prices and higher prices for crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids. 38 Table of Contents Equity in earnings of affiliates decreased 16 percent in 2008, reflecting: Lower results from WRB Refining LLC, due to lower margins and a decline in equity ownership in accordance with the designed formation of the venture. Lower results from CPChem, due to higher operating costs, lower specialties, aromatics and styrenics margins, and lower olefins and polyolefins volumes. The absence of earnings from our heavy oil joint ventures expropriated by Venezuela in 2007. Increased losses related to our NMNG joint venture as a result of higher production taxes and increased depreciation, depletion and amortization (DDA) costs during the startup and early production phase of the Yuzhno Khylchuyu (YK) Field. These negative results were somewhat offset by improved results from the FCCL Partnership, DCP Midstream, LUKOIL (excluding the investment impairment), and CFJ Properties. Other income decreased 45 percent during 2008, mainly due to a lower net benefit from asset rationalization efforts, the release in 2007 of escrowed funds associated with our Hamaca joint venture in Venezuela, and the settlement of retroactive adjustments for crude oil quality differentials on Trans Alaska Pipeline System shipments (Quality Bank) in 2007. Exploration expenses increased 33 percent during 2008, reflecting increased dry hole costs and higher expenses for post discovery feasibility and development planning studies. Impairments increased from $5,030 million in 2007 to $34,539 million in 2008. This increase primarily reflects the 2008 goodwill and LUKOIL impairments, partially offset by a 2007 impairment of $4,588 million related to the expropriation of our oil interests in Venezuela. Interest and debt expense decreased 25 percent in 2008, primarily due to lower average interest rates, as well as the absence of 2007 interest expense related to the Alaska Quality Bank settlements. Foreign currency transaction losses incurred during 2008 totaled $117 million, compared with foreign currency transaction gains of $201 million in 2007. This change occurred as the Canadian dollar, Russian rouble, British pound, and euro all weakened against the U.S. dollar during 2008, compared with the strengthening of these currencies against the U.S. dollar in 2007. See Note 20 Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for information regarding our income tax expense and effective tax rate. 39 Table of Contents Segment Results EP 2009 2008 2007 Millions of Dollars Net Income (Loss) Attributable to ConocoPhillips Alaska $ 1,540 2,315 2,255 Lower 48 (37 ) 2,673 1,993 United States 1,503 4,988 4,248 International 2,101 6,976 367 Goodwill impairment (25,443 ) $ 3,604 (13,479 ) 4,615 Dollars Per Unit Average Sales Prices Crude oil and natural gas liquids (per barrel) United States $ 53.21 89.38 63.87 International 57.40 89.32 68.09 Total consolidated operations 55.47 89.35 66.01 Equity affiliates 58.23 71.15 48.72 Total EP 55.63 88.91 64.99 Synthetic oil (per barrel) International 62.01 103.31 74.32 Bitumen (per barrel) International 39.67 46.85 Equity affiliates 45.69 58.54 37.94 Total EP 44.84 56.72 37.94 Natural gas (per thousand cubic feet) United States 3.45 7.67 5.98 International 4.94 8.76 6.51 Total consolidated operations 4.30 8.28 6.26 Equity affiliates 2.35 2.04 .30 Total EP 4.26 8.27 6.26 Average Production Costs Per Barrel of Oil Equivalent United States $ 7.73 8.34 6.52 International* 7.72 8.03 7.64 Total consolidated operations* 7.73 8.17 7.11 Equity affiliates 7.68 13.36 8.92 Total EP* 7.72 8.33 7.19 * Amounts in 2008 and 2007 were adjusted for certain production cost reclassifications.

Excludes gas equivalent of natural gas liquids included above. Equity affiliate statistics exclude our share of LUKOIL, which is reported in the LUKOIL Investment segment. The EP segment primarily explores for, produces, transports and markets crude oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids and bitumen on a worldwide basis. At December 31, 2009, our EP operations were producing in the United States, Norway, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, offshore Timor Leste in the Timor Sea, Indonesia, China, Vietnam, Libya, Nigeria, Algeria and Russia. 41 Table of Contents 2009 vs. 2008 The EP segment had earnings of $3,604 million during 2009. In 2008, the EP segment had a loss of $13,479 million, which included a $25,443 million before and after tax complete impairment of EP segment goodwill. For additional information, see the Goodwill Impairment section of Note 9 Goodwill and Intangibles, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which is incorporated herein by reference. Excluding the impact from the goodwill impairment, earnings from the EP segment decreased 70 percent during 2009, primarily due to substantially lower crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices. Our EP segment also recognized property impairment charges. These decreases were partially offset by lower Alaska and Lower 48 production taxes due to lower prices, as well as higher international volumes and improved operating costs. See the Business Environment and Executive Overview section for additional information on industry crude oil and natural gas prices. Proved reserves at year end 2009 were 8.36 billion barrels of oil equivalent (BOE), compared with 8.08 billion at year end 2008. This excludes the estimated 1,967 million BOE and 1,893 million BOE included in the LUKOIL Investment segment at year end 2009 and 2008, respectively. Also excluded for 2008 is our share of Canadian Syncrude reserves of 249 million barrels. U.S. EP Earnings from our U.S. EP operations decreased 70 percent, due to significantly lower crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices. Lower production taxes, lower property impairments in the Lower 48 and improved operating costs partially offset the decrease. U.S. EP production averaged 755,000 BOE per day in 2009, a decrease of 3 percent from 775,000 in 2008. Less unplanned downtime and improved well performance were more than offset by field decline. International EP Earnings from our international EP operations were $2,101 million in 2009, compared with $6,976 million in 2008. The decline was primarily a result of significantly lower crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices and higher impairments. These decreases were partially offset by higher volumes and lower operating costs. International EP production averaged 1,099,000 BOE per day in 2009, an increase of 8 percent from 1,014,000 in 2008. The increase was predominantly due to new production in the United Kingdom, Russia, China, Canada, Norway and Vietnam. In addition, production increased due to the impacts from the royalty framework in Alberta, Canada, as well as less unplanned downtime and the impact of lower prices on production sharing arrangements. These increases were partially offset by field decline and more planned downtime. 2008 vs. 2007 The EP segment recorded a loss of $13,479 million during 2008. This amount included a $25,443 million before and after tax complete impairment of EP segment goodwill. In 2007, the EP segment had earnings of $4,615 million, which included the impact of a $4,588 million before tax impairment ($4,512 million after tax) related to the expropriation of our oil interests in Venezuela. For additional information, see the Goodwill Impairment section of Note 9 Goodwill and Intangibles, and the Expropriated Assets section of Note 10 Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which are incorporated herein by reference. 42 Table of Contents The decrease in earnings resulted from the goodwill impairment, higher taxes other than income (mainly in Alaska), lower production volumes, higher operating and exploration costs, increased property impairments and depreciation expense, and the absence of a 2007 benefit related to release of escrowed funds associated with our Hamaca joint venture in Venezuela. The decrease was partially offset by the absence of the 2007 Venezuela impairment, as well as higher crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices. During 2008, our EP segment recognized property impairment charges totaling $511 million after tax, mostly due to revised capital spending plans as a result of current project economics, as well as a significantly diminished outlook for commodity prices. A large portion of these impairments relate to fields in the U.S. Lower 48 and Canada. U.S. EP Earnings from our U.S. EP operations increased 17 percent, primarily due to higher crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices. The increase was partially offset by higher production taxes (mainly in Alaska), lower volumes, an increase in impairments of properties in the Lower 48, and higher operating costs. EP production on a BOE basis averaged 775,000 per day in 2008, a decrease of 8 percent from 843,000 in 2007. The production decrease was primarily attributable to field decline and unplanned downtime in the Lower 48 due to hurricane disruptions. International EP Earnings from our international EP operations increased from $367 million in 2007 to $6,976 million in 2008. The increase was attributed to the impact of the Venezuelan impairment on our prior year results and higher crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices. The increase was partially offset by higher depreciation expense due to increased rates and new assets being placed in service, increased taxes other than income, higher operating costs, and the absence of a 2007 benefit related to release of escrowed funds associated with our Hamaca joint venture in Venezuela. International EP production averaged 1,014,000 BOE per day in 2008, a decrease of 2 percent from 1,037,000 in 2007. Decreases in production were caused by field decline and the expropriation of our Venezuelan oil interests. These decreases were mostly offset by increased production from new developments in the United Kingdom, Indonesia, Russia, Norway and Canada.

The natural gas is then processed to extract natural gas liquids from the raw gas stream. The remaining residue gas is marketed to electrical utilities, industrial users, and gas marketing companies. Most of the natural gas liquids are fractionated separated into individual components like ethane, butane and propane and marketed as chemical feedstock, fuel or blendstock. The Midstream segment consists of our 50 percent equity investment in DCP Midstream, as well as our other natural gas gathering and processing operations, and natural gas liquids fractionation and marketing businesses, primarily in the United States and Trinidad. 2009 vs. 2008 Earnings from the Midstream segment decreased 42 percent in 2009. The decrease was primarily due to substantially lower realized natural gas liquids prices, partially offset by the recognition of an $88 million after tax benefit in the first quarter of 2009 resulting from a DCP Midstream subsidiary converting subordinated units to common units. 2008 vs. 2007 Earnings from the Midstream segment increased 19 percent in 2008. The increase was primarily due to higher realized natural gas liquids prices, partially offset by higher operating costs and higher depreciation expense. 44 Table of Contents RM 2009 2008 2007 Millions of Dollars Net Income (Loss) Attributable to ConocoPhillips United States $ (192 ) 1,540 4,615 International 229 782 1,308 $ 37 2,322 5,923 Dollars Per Gallon U.S. Average Wholesale Prices* Gasoline $ 1.84 2.65 2.27 Distillates 1.76 3.06 2.29 * Excludes excise taxes.

Actual capacity at year end 2007 was 2,037,000 barrels per day for our domestic refineries and 669,000 barrels per day for our international refineries. The RM segments operations encompass refining crude oil and other feedstocks into petroleum products (such as gasoline, distillates and aviation fuels); buying, selling and transporting crude oil; and buying, transporting, distributing and marketing petroleum products. RM has operations mainly in the United States, Europe and the Asia Pacific Region. 45 Table of Contents 2009 vs. 2008 RM reported earnings of $37 million in 2009, compared with $2,322 million in 2008. The decrease was primarily a result of significantly lower U.S. and international refining margins, lower volumes, lower international marketing margins and a lower net benefit from asset rationalization efforts. These decreases were partially offset by lower operating expenses, lower property impairments and positive foreign currency exchange impacts. During 2008, our RM segment had property impairments totaling $511 million after tax, mostly due to a significantly diminished outlook for refining margins. During 2009, our worldwide refining capacity utilization rate was 84 percent, compared with 90 percent in 2008. U.S. RM Our U.S. RM operations reported a loss of $192 million in 2009, compared with earnings of $1,540 million in 2008. The decrease was primarily due to significantly lower U.S. refining margins, lower U.S. refining and marketing volumes and a lower net benefit from asset sales. These decreases were partially offset by lower operating expenses and lower property impairments. Our U.S. refining capacity utilization rate was 87 percent in 2009, compared with 92 percent in 2008. The current year rate was mainly affected by run reductions due to market conditions and increased turnaround activity, while the prior year rate was impacted by downtime associated with hurricanes. International RM International RM reported earnings of $229 million in 2009 and earnings of $782 million in 2008. The decrease in earnings was primarily due to significantly lower international refining and marketing margins, lower international marketing volumes and a lower net benefit from asset sales. These decreases were partially offset by positive foreign currency impacts, lower property impairments and lower operating expenses. Our international refining capacity utilization rate was 74 percent in 2009, compared with 85 percent in 2008. The current year rate reflects higher turnaround activity. In addition, the utilization rate for both periods reflects run reductions in response to market conditions. 2008 vs. 2007 RM earnings decreased 61 percent in 2008. The results were lower due to decreases in U.S. refining margins and volumes, increased property impairments, higher operating costs, a reduced benefit from asset rationalization efforts, and lower international marketing and refining volumes due to asset sales. These RM decreases were partially offset by higher international marketing margins. During 2008, our worldwide refining capacity utilization rate was 90 percent, compared with 94 percent in 2007. U.S. RM Earnings from our U.S. RM operations decreased 67 percent in 2008. Results for 2008 also included an impairment related to one of our U.S. refineries. Our U.S. refining capacity utilization rate was 92 percent in 2008, compared with 96 percent in 2007. The decline in the 2008 rate resulted mainly from refinery optimization and unplanned downtime, which included the impact of hurricanes on our U.S. Gulf Coast refineries. International RM Earnings from our international RM operations decreased 40 percent in 2008. Contributing to the decrease was the impairment of a refinery in Europe and the absence of a $141 million 2007 German tax legislation benefit. 46 Table of Contents Our international refining capacity utilization rate was 85 percent in 2008, compared with 90 percent during the previous year. The utilization rate was primarily impacted by reduced crude throughput at our Wilhelmshaven Refinery due to economic conditions and planned maintenance. LUKOIL Investment Millions of Dollars 2009 2008 2007 Net Income (Loss) Attributable to ConocoPhillips $ 1,663 (5,488 ) 1,818 Operating Statistics* Crude oil production (thousands of barrels daily) 387 386 401 Natural gas production (millions of cubic feet daily) 280 356 256 Refinery crude oil processed (thousands of barrels daily) 245 229 214 * Represents our net share of our estimate of LUKOILs production and processing. This segment represents our investment in the ordinary shares of LUKOIL, an international, integrated oil and gas company headquartered in Russia, which we account for under the equity method. At December 31, 2009, our ownership interest in LUKOIL was 20 percent based on authorized and issued shares. Our ownership interest based on estimated shares outstanding, used for equity method accounting, was 20.09 percent at that date. Because LUKOILs accounting cycle close and preparation of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles financial statements occur subsequent to our reporting deadline, our equity earnings and statistics for our LUKOIL investment are estimated based on current market indicators, publicly available LUKOIL information, and other objective data. Once the difference between actual and estimated results is known, an adjustment is recorded. This estimate to actual adjustment will be a recurring component of future period results. In addition to our estimated equity share of LUKOILs earnings, this segment reflects the amortization of the basis difference between our equity interest in the net assets of LUKOIL and the book value of our investment. The segment also includes the costs associated with our employees seconded to LUKOIL. 2009 vs. 2008 The LUKOIL Investment segment had earnings of $1,663 million during 2009, compared with a loss of $5,488 million in 2008. Results for 2008 included a $7,410 million noncash, before and after tax impairment of our LUKOIL investment taken during the fourth quarter. For additional information, see the LUKOIL section of Note 6 Investments, Loans and Long Term Receivables, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which is incorporated herein by reference. Excluding the impact of the impairment, earnings from the LUKOIL Investment segment decreased 13 percent in 2009. The decrease was primarily due to lower estimated realized refined product and crude oil prices, which was mostly offset by lower estimated extraction taxes and export tariff rates, and a benefit from basis difference amortization. 2008 vs. 2007 The LUKOIL Investment segment had a $5,488 million loss in 2008, compared with $1,818 million of earnings in 2007. Excluding the impact of the impairment, earnings from the LUKOIL Investment segment increased 6 percent in 2008. This increase was primarily due to higher estimated realized prices of both refined product and crude oil sales. Partially offsetting these positive impacts were higher estimated extraction taxes and higher estimated crude and refined product export tariff rates, as well as higher estimated operating costs and lower estimated crude volumes. 47 Table of Contents Chemicals Millions of Dollars 2009 2008 2007 Net Income Attributable to ConocoPhillips $ 248 110 359 The Chemicals segment consists of our 50 percent interest in Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC (CPChem), which we account for under the equity method. CPChem uses natural gas liquids and other feedstocks to produce petrochemicals. These products are then marketed and sold, or used as feedstocks, to produce plastics and commodity chemicals. 2009 vs. 2008 Earnings from the Chemicals segment increased $138 million in 2009 due to lower operating costs and higher margins in the specialties, aromatics and styrenics business line. These increases were partially offset by lower margins in the olefins and polyolefins business line. 2008 vs. 2007 Earnings from the Chemicals segment decreased by $249 million in 2008 due to higher utilities and other operating costs, the absence of 2007 one time tax benefits, lower margins in the specialties, aromatics and styrenics business line, and lower volumes from the olefins and polyolefins business line. Increases in olefins and polyolefins margins somewhat offset these negative effects. Emerging Businesses Millions of Dollars 2009 2008 2007 Net Income (Loss) Attributable to ConocoPhillips Power $ 105 106 53 Other (102 ) (76 ) (61 ) $ 3 30 (8 ) The Emerging Businesses segment represents our investment in new technologies or businesses outside our normal scope of operations. Activities within this segment are currently focused on power generation and innovation of new technologies, such as those related to conventional and nonconventional hydrocarbon recovery (including heavy oil), refining, alternative energy, biofuels, and the environment. 2009 vs. 2008 Emerging Businesses reported earnings of $3 million in 2009, compared with $30 million in 2008. The decrease was primarily due to lower international power results and higher technology development expenses, which were mostly offset by the absence of an $85 million after tax impairment of a U.S. cogeneration power plant in 2008. 2008 vs. 2007 Emerging Businesses reported earnings of $30 million in 2008, compared with a loss of $8 million in 2007. The increase primarily reflects improved international power generation results, including the impact of higher spark spreads. These benefits were partially offset by an $85 million after tax impairment of a U.S. cogeneration power plant, as well as by lower domestic power results. 48 Table of Contents Corporate and Other Millions of Dollars 2009 2008 2007 Net Loss Attributable to ConocoPhillips Net interest $ (851 ) (558 ) (820 ) Corporate general and administrative expenses (108 ) (202 ) (176 ) Acquisition/merger related costs (44 ) Other (51 ) (274 ) (229 ) $ (1,010 ) (1,034 ) (1,269 ) 2009 vs. 2008 Net interest consists of interest and financing expense, net of interest income and capitalized interest, as well as premiums incurred on the early retirement of debt. Net interest increased 53 percent in 2009 as a result of higher average debt levels, partially offset by lower average interest rates. Capitalized interest was also lower in 2009. Corporate general and administrative expenses decreased 47 percent due to decreased costs related to compensation plans and overhead. The category Other includes certain foreign currency transaction gains and losses, environmental costs associated with sites no longer in operation, and other costs not directly associated with an operating segment. Changes in the Other category are primarily due to higher foreign currency transaction gains. 2008 vs. 2007 Net interest decreased 32 percent in 2008, primarily due to lower average interest rates and a higher effective tax rate. Corporate general and administrative expenses increased 15 percent in 2008, mainly as a result of increased charitable contributions. Acquisition related costs in 2007 included transition costs associated with the Burlington Resources acquisition. Other expenses increased in 2008 due to various tax related adjustments, partially offset by lower foreign currency losses. 49 Table of Contents CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Financial Indicators Millions of Dollars Except as Indicated 2009 2008 2007 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 12,479 22,658 24,550 Short term debt 1,728 370 1,398 Total debt* 28,653 27,455 21,687 Total equity 63,057 56,265 90,156 Percent of total debt to capital** 31 % 33 19 Percent of floating rate debt to total debt 9 37 25 * Total debt includes short term and long term debt, as shown on our consolidated balance sheet. ** Capital includes total debt and total equity. To meet our short and long term liquidity requirements, we look to a variety of funding sources. Cash generated from operating activities is the primary source of funding. In addition, during 2009 $1,229 million of net debt was issued, and we received $1,270 million in proceeds from asset sales. During 2009, available cash was used to support our ongoing capital expenditures and investments program, pay dividends, and meet the funding requirements to FCCL Partnership. Total dividends paid on our common stock during the year were $2,832 million. During 2009, cash and cash equivalents decreased by $213 million to $542 million. In addition to cash flows from operating activities and proceeds from asset sales, we rely on our commercial paper and credit facility programs and our shelf registration statement to support our short and long term liquidity requirements. The credit markets, including the commercial paper markets in the United States, have experienced adverse conditions during 2008 and 2009. Although we have not been materially impacted by these conditions, continuing volatility in the credit markets may increase costs associated with issuing commercial paper or other debt instruments due to increased spreads over relevant interest rate benchmarks. Such volatility may also affect our ability, the ability of our joint ventures and equity affiliates, and the ability of third parties with whom we seek to do business, to access those credit markets. Notwithstanding these adverse market conditions, we believe current cash and short term investment balances and cash generated by operations, together with access to external sources of funds as described below in the Significant Sources of Capital section, will be sufficient to meet our funding requirements in the near and long term, including our capital spending program, dividend payments, required debt payments and the funding requirements to FCCL. Significant Sources of Capital Operating Activities During 2009, cash of $12,479 million was provided by operating activities, a 45 percent decrease from cash from operations of $22,658 million in 2008. The decline was primarily due to significantly lower commodity prices in our EP segment and lower refining margins in our RM segment. During 2008, cash flow from operations decreased $1,892 million, compared with 2007. Contributing to the decrease were lower U.S. refining margins and volumetric inventory builds in our RM segment in 2008, versus reductions in 2007. These factors were partially offset by higher commodity prices in our EP segment. While the stability of our cash flows from operating activities benefits from geographic diversity and the effects of upstream and downstream integration, our short and long term operating cash flows are highly dependent upon prices for crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids, as well as refining and marketing margins. During 2008 and 2007, we benefited from favorable crude oil and natural gas prices, although these prices deteriorated significantly in the fourth quarter of 2008. Crude oil and natural gas prices generally trended higher during 2009. Refining margins deteriorated significantly in the fourth quarter of 2008 and 50 Table of Contents remained low throughout 2009. Prices and margins in our industry are typically volatile, and are driven by market conditions over which we have no control. Absent other mitigating factors, as these prices and margins fluctuate, we would expect a corresponding change in our operating cash flows. The level of our production volumes of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids also impacts our cash flows. These production levels are impacted by such factors as acquisitions and dispositions of fields, field production decline rates, new technologies, operating efficiency, weather conditions, the addition of proved reserves through exploratory success and their timely and cost effective development. While we actively manage these factors, production levels can cause variability in cash flows, although historically this variability has not been as significant as that caused by commodity prices. Our production for 2009, including our share of production from equity affiliates, averaged 2.29 million BOE per day. Future production is subject to numerous uncertainties, including, among others, the volatile crude oil and natural gas price environment, which may impact project investment decisions; the effects of price changes on production sharing and variable royalty contracts; timing of project startups and major turnarounds; and weather related disruptions. Our production in 2010, including the impact of anticipated dispositions, is expected to be in the range of 2.2 million BOE per day, similar to 2008 production levels. We continue to evaluate various properties as potential candidates for our recently announced disposition program. The makeup and timing of our disposition program will also impact 2010 and future years production levels. To maintain or grow our production volumes, we must continue to add to our proved reserve base. Our reserve replacement in 2009 was 141 percent, including 133 percent from consolidated operations. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) adopted new reserves reporting rules effective in 2009, which allowed us to include Syncrude oil sands mining operations in our proved reserves. Excluding the impact of the addition of Syncrude, we replaced 112 percent of total production in 2009, reflecting progress on major projects, including the sanctioning of additional phases of in situ oil sands projects in Canada, as well as reserve additions from our LUKOIL Investment segment. Over the five year period ending December 31, 2009, our reserve replacement was 145 percent, including 120 percent from consolidated operations. Over this period we added reserves through acquisitions and project developments, partially offset by the impact of asset expropriations in Venezuela and Ecuador. The reserve replacement amounts above were based on the sum of our net additions (revisions, improved recovery, purchases, extensions and discoveries, and sales) divided by our production, as shown in our reserve table disclosures. For additional information about our proved reserves, including both developed and undeveloped reserves, see the Oil and Gas Operations section of this report. We are developing and pursuing projects we anticipate will allow us to add to our reserve base. However, access to additional resources has become increasingly difficult as direct investment is prohibited in some nations, while fiscal and other terms in other countries can make projects uneconomic or unattractive. In addition, political instability, competition from national oil companies, and lack of access to high potential areas due to environmental or other regulation may negatively impact our ability to increase our reserve base. As such, the timing and level at which we add to our reserve base may, or may not, allow us to replace our production over subsequent years. As discussed in the Critical Accounting Estimates section, engineering estimates of proved reserves are imprecise, and therefore, each year reserves may be revised upward or downward due to the impact of changes in oil and gas prices or as more technical data becomes available on reservoirs. In 2009 and 2007, revisions increased reserves, while in 2008 revisions decreased reserves. It is not possible to reliably predict how revisions will impact reserve quantities in the future. In addition, the level and quality of output from our refineries impacts our cash flows. The output at our refineries is impacted by such factors as operating efficiency, maintenance turnarounds, market conditions, feedstock availability and weather conditions. We actively manage the operations of our refineries, and, typically, any variability in their operations has not been as significant to cash flows as that caused by refining margins. 51 Table of Contents Asset Sales Proceeds from asset sales in 2009 were $1,270 million, compared with $1,640 million in 2008. In 2009, we closed on the sale of our ownership interest in the Keystone Pipeline and a large part of our U.S. retail marketing assets, which included seller financing in the form of a $370 million five year note and letters of credit totaling $54 million. We plan to raise approximately $10 billion from asset dispositions over the next two years. We will continue to identify the assets and begin marketing efforts over the near term, with disposition candidates across the companys operations being considered. Proceeds will be targeted toward debt reduction. Commercial Paper and Credit Facilities At December 31, 2009, we had two revolving credit facilities totaling $7.85 billion, consisting of a $7.35 billion facility expiring in September 2012 and a $500 million facility expiring in July 2012. Our revolving credit facilities may be used as direct bank borrowings, as support for issuances of letters of credit totaling up to $750 million, or as support for our commercial paper programs. The revolving credit facilities are broadly syndicated among financial institutions and do not contain any material adverse change provisions or any covenants requiring maintenance of specified financial ratios or ratings. The facility agreements contain a cross default provision relating to the failure to pay principal or interest on other debt obligations of $200 million or more by ConocoPhillips, or by any of its consolidated subsidiaries. Credit facility borrowings may bear interest at a margin above rates offered by certain designated banks in the London interbank market or at a margin above the overnight federal funds rate or prime rates offered by certain designated banks in the United States. The agreements call for commitment fees on available, but unused, amounts. The agreements also contain early termination rights if our current directors or their approved successors cease to be a majority of the Board of Directors. Our primary funding source for short term working capital needs is the ConocoPhillips $6.35 billion commercial paper program. Commercial paper maturities are generally limited to 90 days. We also have the ConocoPhillips Qatar Funding Ltd. $1.5 billion commercial paper program, which is used to fund commitments relating to the Qatargas 3 Project. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, we had no direct borrowings under the revolving credit facilities, but $40 million in letters of credit had been issued at both periods. In addition, under the two ConocoPhillips commercial paper programs, $1,300 million of commercial paper was outstanding at December 31, 2009, compared with $6,933 million at December 31, 2008. Since we had $1,300 million of commercial paper outstanding and had issued $40 million of letters of credit, we had access to $6.5 billion in borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facilities at December 31, 2009. Shelf Registration We have a universal shelf registration statement on file with the SEC under which we, as a well known seasoned issuer, have the ability to issue and sell an indeterminate amount of various types of debt and equity securities. Under SEC shelf registrations, in early February 2009, we issued $1.5 billion of 4.75% Notes due 2014, $2.25 billion of 5.75% Notes due 2019, and $2.25 billion of 6.50% Notes due 2039, and in May 2009, we issued $1.5 billion of 4.60% Notes due 2015, $1.0 billion of 6.00% Notes due 2020 and an additional $500 million of 6.50% Notes due 2039. The proceeds from these notes were primarily used to reduce outstanding commercial paper balances and for general corporate purposes. Our senior long term debt is rated A1 by Moodys Investor Service and A by both Standard and Poors Rating Service and by Fitch. We do not have any ratings triggers on any of our corporate debt that would cause an automatic default, and thereby impact our access to liquidity, in the event of a downgrade of our credit rating. If our credit rating were to deteriorate to a level prohibiting us from accessing the commercial paper market, we would still be able to access funds under our $7.35 billion revolving credit facility and our $500 million credit facility. Noncontrolling Interests At December 31, 2009, and December 31, 2008, we had $590 million and $1,100 million, respectively, of equity in less than wholly owned consolidated subsidiaries held by noncontrolling interest owners. The decline from year end 2008 was primarily due to Ashford Energy Capital S.A. redeeming for $500 million, 52 Table of Contents plus accrued dividends, the investment in Ashford held by Cold Spring Finance S.a.r.l. in the third quarter of 2009. The remaining noncontrolling interests at December 31, 2009, primarily represent operating joint ventures we control. The largest of these, amounting to $565 million, was related to Darwin liquefied natural gas (LNG) operations, located in Australias Northern Territory. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As part of our normal ongoing business operations and consistent with normal industry practice, we enter into numerous agreements with other parties to pursue business opportunities, which share costs and apportion risks among the parties as governed by the agreements. At December 31, 2009, we were liable for certain contingent obligations under the following contractual arrangements: Qatargas 3: We own a 30 percent interest in Qatargas 3, an integrated project to produce and liquefy natural gas from Qatars North Field. The other participants in the project are affiliates of Qatar Petroleum (68.5 percent) and Mitsui Co., Ltd. (1.5 percent). Our interest is held through a jointly owned company, Qatar Liquefied Gas Company Limited (3), for which we use the equity method of accounting. Qatargas 3 secured project financing of $4 billion in December 2005, consisting of $1.3 billion of loans from export credit agencies (ECA), $1.5 billion from commercial banks, and $1.2 billion from ConocoPhillips. The ConocoPhillips loan facilities have substantially the same terms as the ECA and commercial bank facilities. Prior to project completion certification, all loans, including the ConocoPhillips loan facilities, are guaranteed by the participants, based on their respective ownership interests. Accordingly, our maximum exposure to this financing structure is $1.2 billion. Upon completion certification, currently expected in 2011, all project loan facilities, including the ConocoPhillips loan facilities, will become nonrecourse to the project participants. At December 31, 2009, Qatargas 3 had approximately $3.6 billion outstanding under all the loan facilities, of which ConocoPhillips provided $1 billion, and an additional $88 million of accrued interest. Rockies Express Pipeline: In June 2006, we issued a guarantee for 24 percent of $2 billion in credit facilities issued to Rockies Express Pipeline LLC, operated by Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, L.P. Rockies Express completed construction of a natural gas pipeline across a portion of the United States in November 2009. Shortly after completion, ConocoPhillips increased its ownership from 24 to 25 percent. The maximum potential amount of future payments to third party lenders under the guarantee is estimated to be $500 million, which could become payable if the credit facilities are fully utilized and Rockies Express fails to meet its obligations under the credit agreement. At December 31, 2009, Rockies Express had $1,673 million outstanding under the credit facilities, with our 25 percent guarantee equaling $418 million. The guarantee expires in April 2011. However, it is anticipated refinancing of all or a portion of the $2 billion credit facility will take place in 2010, which is expected to reduce our guarantee exposure. For additional information about guarantees, see Note 14 Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which is incorporated herein by reference. Capital Requirements Our debt balance at December 31, 2009, was $28.7 billion, an increase of $1.2 billion during 2009, and our debt to capital ratio was 31 percent at year end 2009, versus 33 percent at the end of 2008. The change in the debt to capital ratio was due to an increase in equity. Our debt to capital ratio target range is 20 to 25 percent. During 2009, we used proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper to redeem $284 million of 6.375% Notes and $950 million of Floating Rate Notes upon their maturity, and prepaid $750 million of Floating Rate Five Year Term Notes. On January 3, 2007, we closed on a business venture with EnCana (now Cenovus). As part of this transaction, we are obligated to contribute $7.5 billion, plus accrued interest, over a 10 year period that began in 2007, to the upstream business venture, FCCL, formed as a result of the transaction. An initial contribution of $188 million was made upon closing in January. Quarterly principal and interest payments of $237 million began in the second quarter of 2007, and will continue until the balance is paid. Of the principal obligation 53 Table of Contents amount, approximately $660 million was short term and was included in the Accounts payable related parties line on our December 31, 2009, consolidated balance sheet. The principal portion of these payments, which totaled $625 million in 2009, are included in the Other line in the financing activities section of our consolidated statement of cash flows. Interest accrues at a fixed annual rate of 5.3 percent on the unpaid principal balance. Fifty percent of the quarterly interest payment is reflected as a capital contribution and is included in the Capital expenditures and investments line on our consolidated statement of cash flows. We have provided loan financing to WRB Refining LLC, to assist it in meeting its operating and capital spending requirements. At December 31, 2009, $350 million of such financing was outstanding and was classified as long term. In February 2010, we announced a quarterly dividend of 50 cents per share. The dividend is payable March 1, 2010, to stockholders of record at the close of business February 22, 2010. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our aggregate contractual fixed and variable obligations as of December 31, 2009: Millions of Dollars Payments Due by Period Up to Year Year After Total 1 Year 2 3 4 5 5 Years Debt obligations (a) $ 28,622 1,719 6,311 2,806 17,786 Capital lease obligations 31 9 6 3 13 Total debt 28,653 1,728 6,317 2,809 17,799 Interest on debt and other obligations 20,680 1,678 2,866 2,363 13,773 Operating lease obligations 3,377 872 1,166 618 721 Purchase obligations (b) 112,131 45,291 13,615 9,088 44,137 Joint venture acquisition obligation (c) 5,669 660 1,427 1,586 1,996 Other long term liabilities (d) Asset retirement obligations 8,295 407 519 532 6,837 Accrued environmental costs 1,017 192 222 113 490 Unrecognized tax benefits (e) 60 60 (e ) (e ) (e ) Total $ 179,882 50,888 26,132 17,109 85,753 (a) Includes $502 million of net unamortized premiums and discounts. See Note 12 Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. (b) Represents any agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding and that specifies all significant terms. Does not include purchase commitments for jointly owned fields and facilities where we are not the operator. The majority of the purchase obligations are market based contracts, including exchanges and futures, for the purchase of products such as crude oil, unfractionated natural gas liquids (NGL), natural gas and power. The products are mostly used to supply our refineries and fractionators, optimize the supply chain, and resell to customers. Product purchase commitments with third parties totaled $58,935 million. In addition, $40,739 million are product purchases from CPChem, mostly for natural gas and NGL over the remaining term of 90 years, and Excel Paralubes, for base oil over the remaining initial term of 15 years. Purchase obligations of $8,226 million are related to agreements to access and utilize the capacity of third party equipment and facilities, including pipelines and LNG and product terminals, to transport, process, treat, and store products. 54 Table of Contents The remainder is primarily our net share of purchase commitments for materials and services for jointly owned fields and facilities where we are the operator. (c) Represents the remaining amount of contributions, excluding interest, due over a seven year period to the FCCL upstream joint venture with Cenovus. (d) Does not include: Pensions for the 2010 through 2014 time period, we expect to contribute an average of $540 million per year to our qualified and nonqualified pension and postretirement benefit plans in the United States and an average of $250 million per year to our non U.S. plans, which are expected to be in excess of required minimums in many cases. The U.S. five year average consists of $530 million for 2010 and then approximately $540 million per year for the remaining four years. Our required minimum funding in 2010 is expected to be $130 million in the United States and $170 million outside the United States. (e) Excludes unrecognized tax benefits of $1,148 million because the ultimate disposition and timing of any payments to be made with regard to such amount are not reasonably estimable. Although unrecognized tax benefits are not a contractual obligation, they are presented in this table because they represent potential demands on our liquidity.

The Gumusut Kakap development offshore Sabah, Malaysia. 2010 CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND INVESTMENTS BUDGET EPs 2010 capital expenditures and investments budget is $8.9 billion, which is essentially the same as actual expenditures in 2009. Twenty eight percent of EPs 2010 capital expenditures and investments budget is planned for the United States. Capital spending for our Alaskan operations is expected to be directed toward the Prudhoe Bay and Kuparuk Fields, as well as the Alpine Field and satellites on the Western North Slope. In the Lower 48, we expect to make capital expenditures and investments for ongoing development in the San Juan and Permian Basins and the Bakken and Lobo Trends. Also, we expect to direct capital spending towards exploration activities in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and the Eagle Ford shale position in Texas. EP is directing $6.5 billion of its 2010 capital expenditures and investments budget to international projects. Funds in 2010 will be directed to developing major long term projects including: Canadian oil sands projects and ongoing natural gas projects in the western Canada gas basins. Further development of coalbed methane projects associated with the APLNG joint venture in Australia. Completion of the Qatargas 3 Project in Qatar.

For information on proved undeveloped reserves and the associated cost to develop these reserves, see the Oil and Gas Operations section. RM Capital spending for RM during the three year period ended December 31, 2009, was primarily for clean fuels projects to meet new environmental standards, refinery upgrade projects to improve product yields and increase heavy crude oil processing capability, improving the operating integrity of key processing units, as well as for safety projects. During this three year period, RM capital spending was $5.4 billion, representing 13 percent of our total capital expenditures and investments. Key projects during the three year period included: Installation of a 20,000 barrel per day hydrocracker at the Rodeo facility of our San Francisco Refinery. Installation of a 25,000 barrel per day coker and new vacuum unit at the Borger Refinery. Installations, revamps and expansions of equipment at all U.S. refineries to enable production of low sulfur and ultra low sulfur fuels. Upgrading the distillate desulfurization capability at the Humber Refinery. Debottlenecking of a crude and fluid catalytic cracking unit, and completion of a new sulfur plant at the Ferndale Refinery. Investment to obtain an equity interest in four Keystone Pipeline entities, and associated investment to construct a crude oil pipeline from Hardisty, Alberta, to delivery points in the United States. We disposed of our interest in the Keystone Pipeline in 2009. Major construction activities in progress include: Installation of a 65,000 barrel per day coker and a major reconfiguration of the Wood River Refinery to handle advantaged crude and increase capacity, partially funded through long term advances from ConocoPhillips. U.S. programs aimed at air emission reductions. 2010 CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND INVESTMENTS BUDGET RMs 2010 capital budget is $1.3 billion, a 24 percent decrease from actual spending in 2009, with about $0.9 billion for its U.S. downstream businesses and $0.4 billion for international RM. These funds will be used for projects related to sustaining and improving the existing business with a focus on safety, regulatory compliance and reliability. As previously announced, the refinery upgrade project at Wilhelmshaven has been delayed. Emerging Businesses Capital spending for Emerging Businesses during the three year period ended December 31, 2009, was primarily for an expansion of the Immingham combined heat and power cogeneration plant near our Humber Refinery in the United Kingdom. In addition, in October 2007, we purchased a 50 percent interest in Sweeny Cogeneration LP. Contingencies Legal and Tax Matters We accrue a liability for known contingencies (other than those related to income taxes) when a loss is probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated. If a range of amounts can be reasonably estimated and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, then the minimum of the range is 57 Table of Contents accrued. In the case of income tax related contingencies, we use a cumulative probability weighted loss accrual in cases where sustaining a tax position is less than certain. Based on currently available information, we believe it is remote that future costs related to known contingent liability exposures will exceed current accruals by an amount that would have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements. Environmental We are subject to the same numerous international, federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations as other companies in the petroleum exploration and production, refining, and crude oil and refined product marketing and transportation businesses. The most significant of these environmental laws and regulations include, among others, the: U.S. Federal Clean Air Act, which governs air emissions. U.S. Federal Clean Water Act, which governs discharges to water bodies. European Union Regulation for Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH). U.S. Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), which imposes liability on generators, transporters and arrangers of hazardous substances at sites where hazardous substance releases have occurred or are threatening to occur. U.S. Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), which governs the treatment, storage and disposal of solid waste. U.S. Federal Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA90), under which owners and operators of onshore facilities and pipelines, lessees or permittees of an area in which an offshore facility is located, and owners and operators of vessels are liable for removal costs and damages that result from a discharge of oil into navigable waters of the United States. U.S. Federal Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act (EPCRA), which requires facilities to report toxic chemical inventories with local emergency planning committees and response departments. U.S. Federal Safe Drinking Water Act, which governs the disposal of wastewater in underground injection wells. U.S. Department of the Interior regulations, which relate to offshore oil and gas operations in U.S. waters and impose liability for the cost of pollution cleanup resulting from operations, as well as potential liability for pollution damages. European Union Trading Directive resulting in European Emissions Trading Scheme. These laws and their implementing regulations set limits on emissions and, in the case of discharges to water, establish water quality limits. They also, in most cases, require permits in association with new or modified operations. These permits can require an applicant to collect substantial information in connection with the application process, which can be expensive and time consuming. In addition, there can be delays associated with notice and comment periods and the agencys processing of the application. Many of the delays associated with the permitting process are beyond the control of the applicant. Many states and foreign countries where we operate also have, or are developing, similar environmental laws and regulations governing these same types of activities. While similar, in some cases these regulations may impose additional, or more stringent, requirements that can add to the cost and difficulty of marketing or transporting products across state and international borders. The ultimate financial impact arising from environmental laws and regulations is neither clearly known nor easily determinable as new standards, such as air emission standards, water quality standards and stricter fuel regulations continue to evolve. However, environmental laws and regulations, including those that may arise to address concerns about global climate change, are expected to continue to have an increasing impact on our operations in the United States and in other countries in which we operate. Notable areas of potential impacts include air emission compliance and remediation obligations in the United States. For example, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 imposed obligations to provide increasing volumes on a percentage basis of renewable fuels in transportation motor fuels through 2012. These obligations were changed with the enactment of the Energy Independence Security Act of 2007, which was signed in 58 Table of Contents December 2007. The 2007 law requires fuel producers and importers to provide approximately 66 percent more renewable fuels in 2008 as compared with amounts set forth in the Energy Policy Act of 2005, with further increases in amounts of renewable fuels required through 2022. We have met the increased requirements to date while establishing implementation, operating and capital strategies, along with advanced technology development, to address projected future requirements. Implementing regulations and standards for 2010 and beyond remain uncertain as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has not promulgated final provisions. We also are subject to certain laws and regulations relating to environmental remediation obligations associated with current and past operations. Such laws and regulations include CERCLA and RCRA and their state equivalents. Remediation obligations include cleanup responsibility arising from petroleum releases from underground storage tanks located at numerous past and present ConocoPhillips owned and or operated petroleum marketing outlets throughout the United States. Federal and state laws require contamination caused by such underground storage tank releases be assessed and remediated to meet applicable standards. In addition to other cleanup standards, many states adopted cleanup criteria for methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) for both soil and groundwater. At RCRA permitted facilities, we are required to assess environmental conditions. If conditions warrant, we may be required to remediate contamination caused by prior operations. In contrast to CERCLA, which is often referred to as Superfund, the cost of corrective action activities under RCRA corrective action programs typically is borne solely by us. We anticipate increased expenditures for RCRA remediation activities may be required, but such annual expenditures for the near term are not expected to vary significantly from the range of such expenditures we have experienced over the past few years. Longer term expenditures are subject to considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly. We, from time to time, receive requests for information or notices of potential liability from the EPA and state environmental agencies alleging that we are a potentially responsible party under CERCLA or an equivalent state statute. On occasion, we also have been made a party to cost recovery litigation by those agencies or by private parties. These requests, notices and lawsuits assert potential liability for remediation costs at various sites that typically are not owned by us, but allegedly contain wastes attributable to our past operations. As of December 31, 2008, we reported we had been notified of potential liability under CERCLA and comparable state laws at 65 sites around the United States. At December 31, 2009, we resolved and closed two sites, re opened one site, and received one notice of potential liability, leaving 65 unresolved sites where we have been notified of potential liability. For most Superfund sites, our potential liability will be significantly less than the total site remediation costs because the percentage of waste attributable to us, versus that attributable to all other potentially responsible parties, is relatively low. Although liability of those potentially responsible is generally joint and several for federal sites and frequently so for state sites, other potentially responsible parties at sites where we are a party typically have had the financial strength to meet their obligations, and where they have not, or where potentially responsible parties could not be located, our share of liability has not increased materially. Many of the sites at which we are potentially responsible are still under investigation by the EPA or the state agencies concerned. Prior to actual cleanup, those potentially responsible normally assess site conditions, apportion responsibility and determine the appropriate remediation. In some instances, we may have no liability or attain a settlement of liability. Actual cleanup costs generally occur after the parties obtain EPA or equivalent state agency approval. There are relatively few sites where we are a major participant, and given the timing and amounts of anticipated expenditures, neither the cost of remediation at those sites nor such costs at all CERCLA sites, in the aggregate, is expected to have a material adverse effect on our competitive or financial condition. Expensed environmental costs were $1,070 million in 2009 and are expected to be about $1.1 billion per year in 2010 and 2011. Capitalized environmental costs were $891 million in 2009 and are expected to be about $830 million per year in 2010 and 2011. We accrue for remediation activities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and reasonable estimates of the liability can be made. These accrued liabilities are not reduced for potential recoveries from 59 Table of Contents insurers or other third parties and are not discounted (except those assumed in a purchase business combination, which we do record on a discounted basis). Many of these liabilities result from CERCLA, RCRA and similar state laws that require us to undertake certain investigative and remedial activities at sites where we conduct, or once conducted, operations or at sites where ConocoPhillips generated waste was disposed. The accrual also includes a number of sites we identified that may require environmental remediation, but which are not currently the subject of CERCLA, RCRA or state enforcement activities. If applicable, we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third party recoveries. In the future, we may incur significant costs under both CERCLA and RCRA. Considerable uncertainty exists with respect to these costs, and under adverse changes in circumstances, potential liability may exceed amounts accrued as of December 31, 2009. Remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site, depending on the mix of unique site characteristics, evolving remediation technologies, diverse regulatory agencies and enforcement policies, and the presence or absence of potentially liable third parties. Therefore, it is difficult to develop reasonable estimates of future site remediation costs. At December 31, 2009, our balance sheet included total accrued environmental costs of $1,017 million, compared with $979 million at December 31, 2008. We expect to incur a substantial amount of these expenditures within the next 30 years. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, and as with other companies engaged in similar businesses, environmental costs and liabilities are inherent in our operations and products, and there can be no assurance that material costs and liabilities will not be incurred. However, we currently do not expect any material adverse effect upon our results of operations or financial position as a result of compliance with current environmental laws and regulations. Climate Change There has been a broad range of proposed or promulgated state, national and international laws focusing on greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction. These proposed or promulgated laws apply or could apply in countries where we have interests or may have interests in the future. Laws in this field continue to evolve, and while it is not possible to accurately estimate either a timetable for implementation or our future compliance costs relating to implementation, such laws, if enacted, could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition. Examples of legislation or precursors for possible regulation that do or could affect our operations include: European Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS), the program through which many of the European Union (EU) member states are implementing the Kyoto Protocol. Californias Global Warming Solutions Act, which requires the California Air Resources Board (CARB) to develop regulations and market mechanisms that will ultimately reduce Californias GHG emissions by 25 percent by 2020. Two regulations issued by the Alberta government in 2007 under the Climate Change and Emissions Act. These regulations require any existing facility with emissions equal to or greater than 100,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide or equivalent per year to reduce the net emissions intensity of that facility by 2 percent per year beginning July 1, 2007, with an ultimate reduction target of 12 percent of baseline emissions. The U.S. Supreme Court decision in Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. 497, 127 S.Ct. 1438 (2007) confirming that the EPA has the authority to regulate carbon dioxide as an air pollutant under the Federal Clean Air Act. The EPAs announcement on December 7, 2009, Endangerment and Cause or Contribute Findings for Greenhouse Gases Under Section 202(a) of the Clean Air Act, 74, Fed. Reg. 66,495, finalizing its findings that GHG emissions threaten public health and the environment and that cars and light trucks cause or contribute to this threat. While these findings do not themselves impose any requirements on any industry or company at this time, these findings may lead to greater regulation of GHG emissions by the EPA, may trigger more climate based claims for damages, and may result in longer agency review time for development projects to determine the extent of climate change. 60 Table of Contents In the EU, we have assets that are subject to the ETS. The first phase of the EU ETS was completed at the end of 2007, with EU ETS Phase II running from 2008 through 2012. The European Commission has approved most of the Phase II national allocation plans. We are actively engaged to minimize any financial impact from the trading scheme. In the United States, there is growing consensus that some form of regulation will be forthcoming at the federal level with respect to GHG emissions. Such regulation could take any of several forms that result in the creation of additional costs in the form of taxes, the restriction of output, investments of capital to maintain compliance with laws and regulations, or required acquisition or trading of emission allowances. We are working to continuously improve operational and energy efficiency through resource and energy conservation throughout our operations. Compliance with changes in laws and regulations that create a GHG emission trading scheme or GHG reduction policies could significantly increase our costs, reduce demand for fossil energy derived products, impact the cost and availability of capital and increase our exposure to litigation. Such laws and regulations could also increase demand for less carbon intensive energy sources, including natural gas. The ultimate impact on our financial performance, either positive or negative, will depend on a number of factors, including but not limited to: Whether and to what extent legislation is enacted. The nature of the legislation (such as a cap and trade system or a tax on emissions). The GHG reductions required. The price and availability of offsets. The amount and allocation of allowances. Technological and scientific developments leading to new products or services. Any potential significant physical effects of climate change (such as increased severe weather events, changes in sea levels and changes in temperature). Whether, and the extent to which, increased compliance costs are ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services. Other We have deferred tax assets related to certain accrued liabilities, loss carryforwards and credit carryforwards. Valuation allowances have been established to reduce these deferred tax assets to an amount that will, more likely than not, be realized. Based on our historical taxable income, our expectations for the future, and available tax planning strategies, management expects that the net deferred tax assets will be realized as offsets to reversing deferred tax liabilities and as reductions in future taxable income. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 166, Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 140. This Statement was codified into FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 860, Transfers and Servicing. This Statement removes the concept of a qualifying special purpose entity (SPE) and the exception for qualifying SPEs from the consolidation guidance. Additionally, the Statement clarifies the requirements for financial asset transfers eligible for sale accounting. This Statement is effective January 1, 2010, and is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Also in June 2009, the FASB issued SFAS No. 167, Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46(R), to address the effects of the elimination of the qualifying SPE concept in SFAS No. 166, and other concerns about the application of key provisions of consolidation guidance for variable interest entities (VIEs). This Statement was codified into FASB ASC Topic 810, Consolidation. More specifically, SFAS No. 167 requires a qualitative rather than a quantitative approach to determine the primary beneficiary of a VIE, it amends certain guidance pertaining to the determination of the primary beneficiary when related parties are involved, and it amends certain guidance for determining whether an entity is a VIE. Additionally, this 61 Table of Contents Statement requires continuous assessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. This Statement is effective January 1, 2010, and is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to select appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. See Note 1 Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for descriptions of our major accounting policies. Certain of these accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is a reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts would have been reported under different conditions, or if different assumptions had been used. These critical accounting estimates are discussed with the Audit and Finance Committee of the Board of Directors at least annually. We believe the following discussions of critical accounting estimates, along with the discussions of contingencies and of deferred tax asset valuation allowances in this report, address all important accounting areas where the nature of accounting estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change. Oil and Gas Accounting Accounting for oil and gas exploratory activity is subject to special accounting rules unique to the oil and gas industry. The acquisition of geological and geophysical seismic information, prior to the discovery of proved reserves, is expensed as incurred, similar to accounting for research and development costs. However, leasehold acquisition costs and exploratory well costs are capitalized on the balance sheet pending determination of whether proved oil and gas reserves have been discovered on the prospect. Property Acquisition Costs For individually significant leaseholds, management periodically assesses for impairment based on exploration and drilling efforts to date. For leasehold acquisition costs that individually are relatively small, management exercises judgment and determines a percentage probability that the prospect ultimately will fail to find proved oil and gas reserves and pools that leasehold information with others in the geographic area. For prospects in areas that have had limited, or no, previous exploratory drilling, the percentage probability of ultimate failure is normally judged to be quite high. This judgmental percentage is multiplied by the leasehold acquisition cost, and that product is divided by the contractual period of the leasehold to determine a periodic leasehold impairment charge that is reported in exploration expense. This judgmental probability percentage is reassessed and adjusted throughout the contractual period of the leasehold based on favorable or unfavorable exploratory activity on the leasehold or on adjacent leaseholds, and leasehold impairment amortization expense is adjusted prospectively. At year end 2009, the book value of the pools of property acquisition costs that individually are relatively small and thus subject to the above described periodic leasehold impairment calculation, was $1,466 million and the accumulated impairment reserve was $551 million. The weighted average judgmental percentage probability of ultimate failure was approximately 62 percent, and the weighted average amortization period was approximately 2.5 years. If that judgmental percentage were to be raised by 5 percent across all calculations, pretax leasehold impairment expense in 2010 would increase by approximately $32 million. The remaining $5,040 million of gross capitalized unproved property costs at year end 2009 consisted of individually significant leaseholds, mineral rights held in perpetuity by title ownership, exploratory wells currently drilling, and suspended exploratory wells. Management periodically assesses individually significant leaseholds for impairment based on the results of exploration and drilling efforts and the outlook for project commercialization. Of this amount, approximately $2.6 billion is concentrated in 10 major development areas. One of these major assets totaling $102 million is expected to move to proved properties in 2010. Exploratory Costs For exploratory wells, drilling costs are temporarily capitalized, or suspended, on the balance sheet, pending a determination of whether potentially economic oil and gas reserves have been discovered by the drilling effort to justify completion of the find as a producing well. 62 Table of Contents If exploratory wells encounter potentially economic quantities of oil and gas, the well costs remain capitalized on the balance sheet as long as sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made. The accounting notion of sufficient progress is a judgmental area, but the accounting rules do prohibit continued capitalization of suspended well costs on the mere chance that future market conditions will improve or new technologies will be found that would make the projects development economically profitable. Often, the ability to move the project into the development phase and record proved reserves is dependent on obtaining permits and government or co venturer approvals, the timing of which is ultimately beyond our control. Exploratory well costs remain suspended as long as we are actively pursuing such approvals and permits, and believe they will be obtained. Once all required approvals and permits have been obtained, the projects are moved into the development phase, and the oil and gas reserves are designated as proved reserves. For complex exploratory discoveries, it is not unusual to have exploratory wells remain suspended on the balance sheet for several years while we perform additional appraisal drilling and seismic work on the potential oil and gas field or while we seek government or co venturer approval of development plans or seek environmental permitting. Once a determination is made the well did not encounter potentially economic oil and gas quantities, the well costs are expensed as a dry hole and reported in exploration expense. Management reviews suspended well balances quarterly, continuously monitors the results of the additional appraisal drilling and seismic work, and expenses the suspended well costs as a dry hole when it determines the potential field does not warrant further investment in the near term. Criteria utilized in making this determination include evaluation of the reservoir characteristics and hydrocarbon properties, expected development costs, ability to apply existing technology to produce the reserves, fiscal terms, regulations or contract negotiations, and our required return on investment. At year end 2009, total suspended well costs were $908 million, compared with $660 million at year end 2008. For additional information on suspended wells, including an aging analysis, see Note 8 Suspended Wells, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Proved Reserves Engineering estimates of the quantities of proved reserves are inherently imprecise and represent only approximate amounts because of the judgments involved in developing such information. Reserve estimates are based on geological and engineering assessments of in place hydrocarbon volumes, the production plan, historical extraction recovery and processing yield factors, installed plant operating capacity and operating approval limits. The reliability of these estimates at any point in time depends on both the quality and quantity of the technical and economic data and the efficiency of extracting and processing the hydrocarbons. Despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates, accounting rules require disclosure of proved reserve estimates due to the importance of these estimates to better understand the perceived value and future cash flows of a companys EP operations. There are several authoritative guidelines regarding the engineering criteria that must be met before estimated reserves can be designated as proved. Our reservoir engineering organization has policies and procedures in place consistent with these authoritative guidelines. We have trained and experienced internal engineering personnel who estimate our proved reserves held by consolidated companies, as well as our share of equity affiliates. Proved reserve estimates are adjusted annually and during the year if significant changes occur, and take into account recent production and subsurface information about each field. Also, as required by current authoritative guidelines, the estimated future date when a field will be permanently shut down for economic reasons is based on 12 month average prices and year end costs. This estimated date when production will end affects the amount of estimated reserves. Therefore, as prices and cost levels change from year to year, the estimate of proved reserves also changes. Our proved reserves include estimated quantities related to production sharing contracts, which are reported under the economic interest method and are subject to fluctuations in prices of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids; recoverable operating expenses; and capital costs. If costs remain stable, reserve quantities attributable to recovery of costs will change inversely to changes in commodity prices. For example, if prices increase, then our applicable reserve quantities would decline. The estimation of proved developed reserves 63 Table of Contents also is important to the statement of operations because the proved developed reserve estimate for a field serves as the denominator in the unit of production calculation of depreciation, depletion and amortization of the capitalized costs for that asset. At year end 2009, the net book value of productive EP properties, plants and equipment subject to a unit of production calculation was approximately $60 billion and the depreciation, depletion and amortization recorded on these assets in 2009 was approximately $8 billion. The estimated proved developed reserves for our consolidated operations were 5.5 billion BOE at the beginning of 2009 and were 5.6 billion BOE at the end of 2009. If the estimates of proved reserves used in the unit of production calculations had been lower by 5 percent across all calculations, pretax depreciation, depletion and amortization in 2009 would have increased by an estimated $424 million. Impairments of producing properties resulting from downward revisions of proved reserves due to reservoir performance were not material in the last three years. Impairments Long lived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in future cash flows expected to be generated by an asset group and annually following updates to corporate planning assumptions. If, upon review, the sum of the undiscounted pretax cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset group, the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value. Individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes based on a judgmental assessment of the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets generally on a field by field basis for exploration and production assets, or at an entire complex level for downstream assets. Because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for long lived assets, the fair value of impaired assets is determined based on the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants, or based on a multiple of operating cash flow validated with historical market transactions of similar assets where possible. The expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are based on judgmental assessments of future production volumes, commodity prices, operating costs, refining margins and capital project decisions, considering all available information at the date of review. See Note 10 Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. Investments in nonconsolidated entities accounted for under the equity method are reviewed for impairment when there is evidence of a loss in value and annually following updates to corporate planning assumptions. Such evidence of a loss in value might include our inability to recover the carrying amount, the lack of sustained earnings capacity which would justify the current investment amount, or a current fair value less than the investments carrying amount. When it is determined such a loss in value is other than temporary, an impairment charge is recognized for the difference between the investments carrying value and its estimated fair value. When determining whether a decline in value is other than temporary, management considers factors such as the length of time and extent of the decline, the investees financial condition and near term prospects, and our ability and intention to retain our investment for a period that will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the market value of the investment. When quoted market prices are not available, the fair value is usually based on the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants, plus market analysis of comparable assets owned by the investee, if appropriate. Differing assumptions could affect the timing and the amount of an impairment of an investment in any period. For additional information, see the LUKOIL and NMNG sections of Note 6 Investments, Loans and Long Term Receivables, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Asset Retirement Obligations and Environmental Costs Under various contracts, permits and regulations, we have material legal obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore the land or seabed at the end of operations at operational sites. Our largest asset removal obligations involve removal and disposal of offshore oil and gas platforms around the world, oil and gas production facilities and pipelines in Alaska, and asbestos abatement at refineries. The fair values of obligations for dismantling and removing these facilities are accrued at the installation of the asset based on estimated discounted costs. Estimating the future asset removal costs necessary for this accounting calculation is difficult. Most of these removal obligations are many years, or decades, in the future and the contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what removal practices and criteria must be met when the removal 64 Table of Contents event actually occurs. Asset removal technologies and costs, regulatory and other compliance considerations, expenditure timing, and other inputs into valuation of the obligation, including discount and inflation rates, are also subject to change. In addition, under the above or similar contracts, permits and regulations, we have certain obligations to complete environmental related projects. These projects are primarily related to cleanup at domestic refineries and underground storage tanks at U.S. service stations, and remediation activities required by Canada and the state of Alaska at exploration and production sites. Future environmental remediation costs are difficult to estimate because they are subject to change due to such factors as the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs, the unknown time and extent of such remedial actions that may be required, and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other responsible parties. Business Acquisitions Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed Accounting for the acquisition of a business requires the recognition of the consideration paid, as well as the various assets and liabilities of the acquired business. For most assets and liabilities, the asset or liability is recorded at its estimated fair value. The most difficult estimates of individual fair values are those involving properties, plants and equipment and identifiable intangible assets. We use all available information to make these fair value determinations. We have, if necessary, up to one year after the acquisition closing date to finalize these fair value determinations. Intangible Assets and Goodwill At December 31, 2009, we had $740 million of intangible assets determined to have indefinite useful lives, thus they are not amortized. This judgmental assessment of an indefinite useful life must be continuously evaluated in the future. If, due to changes in facts and circumstances, management determines these intangible assets have definite useful lives, amortization will have to commence at that time on a prospective basis. As long as these intangible assets are judged to have indefinite lives, they will be subject to periodic lower of cost or market tests that require managements judgment of the estimated fair value of these intangible assets. In the fourth quarter of 2008, we fully impaired the recorded goodwill associated with our Worldwide EP reporting unit. At December 31, 2009, we had $3,638 million of goodwill remaining on our balance sheet, all of which was attributable to the Worldwide RM reporting unit. See Note 9 Goodwill and Intangibles, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information on intangibles and goodwill, including a detailed discussion of the facts and circumstances leading to the goodwill impairment, as well as the judgments required by management in the analysis leading to the impairment determination. Projected Benefit Obligations Determination of the projected benefit obligations for our defined benefit pension and postretirement plans are important to the recorded amounts for such obligations on the balance sheet and to the amount of benefit expense in the statement of operations. The actuarial determination of projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements involves judgment about uncertain future events, including estimated retirement dates, salary levels at retirement, mortality rates, lump sum election rates, rates of return on plan assets, future health care cost trend rates, and rates of utilization of health care services by retirees. Due to the specialized nature of these calculations, we engage outside actuarial firms to assist in the determination of these projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements. For Employee Retirement Income Security Act qualified pension plans, the actuary exercises fiduciary care on behalf of plan participants in the determination of the judgmental assumptions used in determining required company contributions into the plan. Due to differing objectives and requirements between financial accounting rules and the pension plan funding regulations promulgated by governmental agencies, the actuarial methods and assumptions for the two purposes differ in certain important respects. Ultimately, we will be required to fund all promised benefits under pension and postretirement benefit plans not funded by plan assets or investment returns, but the judgmental assumptions used in the actuarial calculations significantly affect periodic financial statements and funding patterns over time. Benefit expense is particularly sensitive to the discount rate and return on plan assets assumptions. A 1 percent decrease in the discount rate assumption would increase annual benefit expense by $140 million, while a 1 percent decrease in the return on plan assets assumption would increase 65 Table of Contents annual benefit expense by $60 million. In determining the discount rate, we use yields on high quality fixed income investments matched to the estimated benefit cash flows of our plans. CAUTIONARY STATEMENT FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE SAFE HARBOR PROVISIONS OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995 This report includes forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. You can identify our forward looking statements by the words anticipate, estimate, believe, continue, could, intend, may, plan, potential, predict, should, will, expect, objective, projection, forecast, goal, guidance, outlook, effort, target and similar expressions. We based the forward looking statements on our current expectations, estimates and projections about ourselves and the industries in which we operate in general. We caution you these statements are not guarantees of future performance as they involve assumptions that, while made in good faith, may prove to be incorrect, and involve risks and uncertainties we cannot predict. In addition, we based many of these forward looking statements on assumptions about future events that may prove to be inaccurate. Accordingly, our actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what we have expressed or forecast in the forward looking statements. Any differences could result from a variety of factors, including the following: Fluctuations in crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices, refining and marketing margins and margins for our chemicals business. Potential failures or delays in achieving expected reserve or production levels from existing and future oil and gas development projects due to operating hazards, drilling risks and the inherent uncertainties in predicting oil and gas reserves and oil and gas reservoir performance. Unsuccessful exploratory drilling activities or the inability to obtain access to exploratory acreage. Failure of new products and services to achieve market acceptance. Unexpected changes in costs or technical requirements for constructing, modifying or operating facilities for exploration and production, manufacturing, refining or transportation projects. Unexpected technological or commercial difficulties in manufacturing, refining or transporting our products, including synthetic crude oil and chemicals products. Lack of, or disruptions in, adequate and reliable transportation for our crude oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids, LNG and refined products. Inability to timely obtain or maintain permits, including those necessary for construction of LNG terminals or regasification facilities, or refinery projects; comply with government regulations; or make capital expenditures required to maintain compliance. Failure to complete definitive agreements and feasibility studies for, and to timely complete construction of, announced and future exploration and production, LNG, refinery and transportation projects. Potential disruption or interruption of our operations due to accidents, extraordinary weather events, civil unrest, political events or terrorism. International monetary conditions and exchange controls. Substantial investment or reduced demand for products as a result of existing or future environmental rules and regulations. Liability for remedial actions, including removal and reclamation obligations, under environmental regulations. Liability resulting from litigation. General domestic and international economic and political developments, including armed hostilities; expropriation of assets; changes in governmental policies relating to crude oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids or refined product pricing, regulation or taxation; other political, economic or diplomatic developments; and international monetary fluctuations. Changes in tax and other laws, regulations (including alternative energy mandates), or royalty rules applicable to our business. 66 Table of Contents Limited access to capital or significantly higher cost of capital related to illiquidity or uncertainty in the domestic or international financial markets. Delays in, or our inability to implement, our recently announced asset disposition plan. Inability to obtain economical financing for projects, construction or modification of facilities and general corporate purposes. The operation and financing of our midstream and chemicals joint ventures. The factors generally described in Item 1A Risk Factors in this report. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Financial Instrument Market Risk We and certain of our subsidiaries hold and issue derivative contracts and financial instruments that expose our cash flows or earnings to changes in commodity prices, foreign exchange rates or interest rates. We may use financial and commodity based derivative contracts to manage the risks produced by changes in the prices of electric power, natural gas, crude oil and related products; fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates; or to capture market opportunities. Our use of derivative instruments is governed by an Authority Limitations document approved by our Board of Directors that prohibits the use of highly leveraged derivatives or derivative instruments without sufficient liquidity for comparable valuations. The Authority Limitations document also establishes the Value at Risk (VaR) limits for the company, and compliance with these limits is monitored daily. The Chief Financial Officer monitors risks resulting from foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates and reports to the Chief Executive Officer. The Senior Vice President of Commercial monitors commodity price risk and reports to the Chief Operating Officer. The Commercial organization manages our commercial marketing, optimizes our commodity flows and positions, and monitors related risks of our upstream and downstream businesses. Commodity Price Risk We operate in the worldwide crude oil, refined products, natural gas, natural gas liquids, and electric power markets and are exposed to fluctuations in the prices for these commodities. These fluctuations can affect our revenues, as well as the cost of operating, investing and financing activities. Generally, our policy is to remain exposed to the market prices of commodities. Our Commercial organization uses futures, forwards, swaps and options in various markets to optimize the value of our supply chain, which may move our risk profile away from market average prices to accomplish the following objectives: Balance physical systems. In addition to cash settlement prior to contract expiration, exchange traded futures contracts also may be settled by physical delivery of the commodity, providing another source of supply to meet our refinery requirements or marketing demand. Meet customer needs. Consistent with our policy to generally remain exposed to market prices, we use swap contracts to convert fixed price sales contracts, which are often requested by natural gas and refined product consumers, to a floating market price. Manage the risk to our cash flows from price exposures on specific crude oil, natural gas, refined product and electric power transactions. Enable us to use the market knowledge gained from these activities to do a limited amount of commodity trading around our asset base. We use a VaR model to estimate the loss in fair value that could potentially result on a single day from the effect of adverse changes in market conditions on the derivative financial instruments and derivative 67 Table of Contents commodity instruments held or issued, including commodity purchase and sales contracts recorded on the balance sheet at December 31, 2009, as derivative instruments. Using Monte Carlo simulation, a 95 percent confidence level and a one day holding period, the VaR for those instruments issued or held for trading purposes at December 31, 2009 and 2008, was immaterial to our cash flows and net income attributable to ConocoPhillips. The VaR for instruments held for purposes other than trading at December 31, 2009 and 2008, was also immaterial to our cash flows and net income attributable to ConocoPhillips. Interest Rate Risk The following table provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in short term U.S. interest rates. The debt portion of the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates. Weighted average variable rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at the reporting date. The carrying amount of our floating rate debt approximates its fair value. The fair value of the fixed rate financial instruments is estimated based on quoted market prices. The joint venture acquisition obligation portion of the table presents principal cash flows of the fixed rate 5.3 percent joint venture acquisition obligation owed to FCCL Partnership. The fair value of the obligation is estimated based on the net present value of the future cash flows, discounted at a year end 2009 and 2008 effective yield rate of 2.63 percent and 5.4 percent, respectively, based on yields of U.S. Treasury securities of a similar average duration adjusted for ConocoPhillips average credit risk spread and the amortizing nature of the obligation principal.

We do not comprehensively hedge the exposure to currency rate changes although we may choose to selectively hedge certain foreign currency exchange rate exposures, such as firm commitments for capital projects or local currency tax payments, dividends and cash returns from net investments in foreign affiliates to be remitted within the coming year. 68 Table of Contents At December 31, 2009 and 2008, we held foreign currency swaps hedging short term intercompany loans between European subsidiaries and a U.S. subsidiary. Although these swaps hedge exposures to fluctuations in exchange rates, we elected not to utilize hedge accounting as allowed by FASB ASC Topic 815. As a result, the change in the fair value of these foreign currency swaps is recorded directly in earnings. Since the gain or loss on the swaps is offset by the gain or loss from remeasuring the intercompany loans into the functional currency of the lender or borrower, there would be no material impact to income from an adverse hypothetical 10 percent change in the December 31, 2009 or 2008, exchange rates. The notional and fair market values of these positions at December 31, 2009 and 2008, were as follows: In Millions Notional* Fair Market Value** Foreign Currency Swaps 2009 2008 2009 2008 Sell U.S. dollar, buy euro USD 246 526 $ (2 ) 53 Sell U.S. dollar, buy British pound USD 1,664 1,657 (16 ) (46 ) Sell U.S. dollar, buy Canadian dollar USD 554 1,474 34 13 Sell U.S. dollar, buy Czech koruna USD 40 (2 ) Sell U.S. dollar, buy Danish krone USD 5 Sell U.S. dollar, buy Norwegian kroner USD 744 1,103 (4 ) (10 ) Sell U.S. dollar, buy Swedish krona USD 51 1 Sell U.S. dollar, buy Australian dollar USD 3 246 3 Sell euro, buy Canadian dollar EUR 102 Sell euro, buy British pound EUR 267 (14 ) Buy euro, sell British pound EUR 147 (8 ) * Denominated in U.S. dollars (USD) and euro (EUR). ** Denominated in U.S. dollars.
