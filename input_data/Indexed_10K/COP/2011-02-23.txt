The terms earnings and loss as used in Managements Discussion and Analysis refer to net income (loss) attributable to ConocoPhillips. BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW ConocoPhillips is an international, integrated energy company. We are the third largest integrated energy company in the United States, based on market capitalization. We have approximately 29,700 employees worldwide, and at year end 2010 had assets of $156 billion. Our stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol COP. Our business is organized into six operating segments: Exploration and Production (EP) This segment primarily explores for, produces, transports and markets crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, liquefied natural gas (LNG) and natural gas liquids on a worldwide basis. Midstream This segment gathers, processes and markets natural gas produced by ConocoPhillips and others, and fractionates and markets natural gas liquids, predominantly in the United States and Trinidad. The Midstream segment primarily consists of our 50 percent equity investment in DCP Midstream, LLC. Refining and Marketing (RM) This segment purchases, refines, markets and transports crude oil and petroleum products, mainly in the United States, Europe and Asia. LUKOIL Investment This segment consists of our investment in the ordinary shares of OAO LUKOIL, an international, integrated oil and gas company headquartered in Russia. At December 31, 2010, our ownership interest was 2.25 percent based on issued shares. See Note 6 Investments, Loans and Long Term Receivables, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for information on sales of LUKOIL shares. Chemicals This segment manufactures and markets petrochemicals and plastics on a worldwide basis. The Chemicals segment consists of our 50 percent equity investment in Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC (CPChem). Emerging Businesses This segment represents our investment in new technologies or businesses outside our normal scope of operations. 32 Table of Contents In 2010, as the global economy continued to recover from the recession, the business environment for certain parts of the energy industry also recovered. Oil prices continued to increase in 2010, reflecting strong oil demand growth, especially in China, and an improved economic outlook for the United States. U.S. natural gas prices, however, remained under pressure during 2010, despite a colder than normal winter and hotter than normal summer. U.S. natural gas production continues to increase at a faster rate than the demand recovery from the economic crisis, primarily as a result of increased production from shale plays. Storage levels are below 2009 levels, but remain historically high. We expect these factors will continue to moderate natural gas prices, resulting in limited U.S. LNG imports in the near to mid term, and potentially impacting the timing of commercialization of our Alaska North Slope and Canadian Arctic gas resources. In late 2009, we announced several strategic initiatives designed to improve our financial position and increase returns on capital. We announced plans to raise $10 billion from asset dispositions through the end of 2011, reduce our debt and increase shareholder distributions. As of year end 2010, we have generated approximately $7 billion from asset dispositions, the proceeds of which were primarily targeted toward debt reduction. This accelerated the return to our target debt to capital ratio of 20 to 25 percent. In addition, we increased the amount of our quarterly dividend rate by 10 percent, and we paid dividends on our common stock of $3.2 billion for the full year. We also announced plans to sell our entire interest in LUKOIL, and our Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to $5 billion of our common stock through 2011. As of year end 2010, we had sold approximately 90 percent of our interest in LUKOIL, which generated cash proceeds of approximately $8 billion, while we repurchased approximately $4 billion of our common stock. In February 2011, our Board authorized the additional purchase of up to $10 billion of our common stock over the next two years. Our total capital program in 2011 is expected to be $13.5 billion, a $2.8 billion increase from $10.7 billion in 2010. We also expect 2011 production to be approximately 1.7 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding the impact of any additional asset sales. Crude oil, bitumen, natural gas and LNG prices, along with refining margins, are the most significant factors in our profitability, and are driven by market factors over which we have no control. These prices and margins can be subject to extreme volatility. However, from a competitive perspective, there are other important factors we must manage well to be successful, including: Operating our producing properties and refining and marketing operations safely, consistently and in an environmentally sound manner. Safety is our first priority, and we are committed to protecting the health and safety of everyone who has a role in our operations and the communities in which we operate. Optimizing utilization rates at our refineries and minimizing downtime in producing fields enable us to capture the value available in the market in terms of prices and margins. During 2010, our worldwide refining capacity utilization rate was 81 percent, compared with 84 percent in 2009. The lower rate primarily reflects run reductions at Wilhelmshaven in response to market conditions, partially offset by lower turnaround activity. Excluding Wilhelmshaven, the worldwide refining capacity utilization rate was 90 percent in 2010, compared with 88 percent in 2009. There has been heightened public focus on the safety of the oil and gas industry, as a result of the Deepwater Horizon incident in the Gulf of Mexico (GOM), which occurred in April 2010. Safety and environmental stewardship, including the operating integrity of our assets, remain our highest priorities. Therefore, in order to improve industry spill response, in 2010 we formed a non profit organization, the Marine Well Containment Company LLC (MWCC), with Exxon Mobil Corporation, Chevron Corporation and Royal Dutch Shell plc to develop a new oil spill containment system. MWCC plans to build and deploy a rapid response system that will be available to capture and contain oil in the event of a potential future underwater well blowout in the deepwater GOM. 33 Table of Contents Adding to our proved reserve base. We primarily add to our proved reserve base in three ways: o Successful exploration and development of new fields. o Acquisition of existing fields. o Application of new technologies and processes to improve recovery from existing fields. Through a combination of the methods listed above, we have been successful in the past in maintaining or adding to our production and proved reserve base, and we anticipate being able to do so in the future. In the five years ended December 31, 2010, our reserve replacement was 111 percent, excluding LUKOIL. Over this period we added reserves through acquisitions and project developments, partially offset by the impact of asset expropriations in Venezuela and Ecuador. Access to additional resources has become increasingly difficult as direct investment is prohibited in some nations, while fiscal and other terms in other countries can make projects uneconomic or unattractive. In addition, political instability, competition from national oil companies, and lack of access to high potential areas due to environmental or other regulation may negatively impact our ability to increase our reserve base. As such, the timing and level at which we add to our reserve base may, or may not, allow us to replace our production over subsequent years. Controlling costs and expenses. Since we cannot control the prices of the commodity products we sell, controlling operating and overhead costs, within the context of our commitment to safety and environmental stewardship, is a high priority. We monitor these costs using various methodologies that are reported to senior management monthly, on both an absolute dollar basis and a per unit basis. Because managing operating and overhead costs is critical to maintaining competitive positions in our industries, cost control is a component of our variable compensation programs. Operating and overhead costs increased by 4 percent in 2010, compared with 2009, primarily as a result of market conditions and higher transportation costs. Selecting the appropriate projects in which to invest our capital dollars. We participate in capital intensive industries. As a result, we must often invest significant capital dollars to explore for new oil and gas fields, develop newly discovered fields, maintain existing fields, construct pipelines and LNG facilities, or continue to maintain and improve our refinery complexes. We invest in projects that are expected to provide an adequate financial return on invested dollars. However, there are often long lead times from the time we make an investment to the time the investment is operational and begins generating financial returns. Our total capital program in 2010 was $10.7 billion, which included $9.8 billion of capital expenditures and investments. Our 2011 capital program is expected to be approximately $13.5 billion, which includes $12.8 billion of capital expenditures and investments. The 2011 budget is consistent with our plan to improve returns through increased capital discipline, while still funding existing projects and enabling us to preserve flexibility to develop major projects in the future. Managing our asset portfolio. We continually evaluate our assets to determine whether they fit our strategic plans or should be sold or otherwise disposed. In 2009, we sold a majority of our U.S. retail marketing assets and announced our intention to raise $10 billion from asset dispositions through the end of 2011. In 2010, we completed the U.S. retail marketing disposition program. We also sold our 9.03 percent interest in the Syncrude oil sands mining operation; our 50 percent interest in CFJ Properties, a joint venture which owned and operated Flying J branded truck and travel plazas; and several EP properties located in the Lower 48 and western Canada. As part of a separate program, in 2010, we announced our intention to sell our entire interest in LUKOIL. As of year end 2010, we sold approximately 90 percent of our interest in LUKOIL. We disposed of our remaining shares in the first quarter of 2011. 34 Table of Contents Developing and retaining a talented work force. We strive to attract, train, develop and retain individuals with the knowledge and skills to implement our business strategy and who support our values and ethics. Throughout the company, we focus on the continued learning, development and technical training of our employees. Professional new hires participate in structured development programs designed to accelerate their technical and functional skills. Our key performance indicators are shown in the statistical tables provided at the beginning of the operating segment sections that follow. These include commodity prices, production and refining capacity utilization. Other significant factors that can affect our profitability include: Impairments. As mentioned above, we participate in capital intensive industries. At times, our investments become impaired when, for example, our reserve estimates are revised downward, commodity prices or refining margins decline significantly for long periods of time, or a decision to dispose of an asset leads to a write down to its fair market value. We may also invest large amounts of money in exploration which, if exploratory drilling proves unsuccessful, could lead to a material impairment of leasehold values. Before tax impairments in 2010 totaled $2.4 billion and primarily related to the $1.5 billion property impairment of our refinery in Wilhelmshaven, Germany (WRG), and a $0.6 billion impairment of our equity investment in Naraynmarneftegaz (NMNG). Before tax impairments in 2009 totaled $0.8 billion and primarily related to certain natural gas properties in western Canada and our equity investment in NMNG. Goodwill. We had $3.6 billion of goodwill on our balance sheet at year end 2010 and 2009. In 2008, we recorded a $25.4 billion complete impairment of our EP segment goodwill, primarily as a function of decreased year end commodity prices and the decline in our market capitalization. Deterioration of market conditions in the future could lead to other goodwill impairments that may have a substantial negative, though noncash, effect on our profitability. Effective tax rate. Our operations are located in countries with different tax rates and fiscal structures. Accordingly, even in a stable commodity price and fiscal/regulatory environment, our overall effective tax rate can vary significantly between periods based on the mix of pretax earnings within our global operations. Fiscal and regulatory environment. Our operations, primarily in EP, can be affected by changing economic, regulatory and political environments in the various countries in which we operate, including the United States. These changes have generally negatively impacted our results of operations, and further changes to government fiscal take could have a negative impact on future operations. Our assets in Venezuela and Ecuador were expropriated in 2007 and 2009, respectively. In Canada, the Alberta provincial government changed the royalty structure in 2009 to tie a component of the new rate to prevailing prices. Our management carefully considers these events when evaluating projects or determining the level of activity in such countries. 35 Table of Contents Segment Analysis The EP segments results are most closely linked to crude oil and natural gas prices. These are commodity products, the prices of which are subject to factors external to our company and over which we have no control. Industry crude oil prices for West Texas Intermediate (WTI) were higher in 2010, compared with 2009, averaging $79.39 per barrel in 2010, an increase of 29 percent. Uncertainty about economic growth in developed countries, especially in the United States, and concerns about the debt crisis in Europe were more than offset by increased demand from China and other developing countries. Industry natural gas prices at Henry Hub increased 10 percent during 2010 to an average price of $4.39 per million British thermal units, primarily as a result of weather related events. An increase in demand was offset by higher natural gas production levels, and as a result, natural gas storage levels remain high and have adversely impacted Henry Hub prices. The Midstream segments results are most closely linked to natural gas liquids prices. The most important factor affecting the profitability of this segment is the results from our 50 percent equity investment in DCP Midstream. DCP Midstreams natural gas liquids prices increased 39 percent in 2010. Refining margins, refinery capacity utilization and cost control primarily drive the RM segments results. Refining margins are subject to movements in the cost of crude oil and other feedstocks, and the sales prices for refined products, both of which are subject to market factors over which we have no control. Global refining margins improved during 2010, compared with 2009. The U.S. benchmark 3:2:1 crack spread increased 9 percent in 2010, while the N.W. Europe benchmark increased 16 percent. Demand for refined products improved globally in 2010, driven by the improved economic environment, particularly in the developing nations. In addition, a wider differential in prices for high quality crude oil relative to lower quality crude oil improved margins for refineries configured to capitalize on the ability to process lower quality crudes. The LUKOIL Investment segment consists of our investment in the ordinary shares of LUKOIL. At year end 2009, we had a 20 percent ownership interest in LUKOIL based on authorized and issued shares. At the end of the third quarter of 2010, as a result of our plan to divest of our entire interest in LUKOIL, our ownership interest declined to a level at which we were no longer able to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of LUKOIL. Accordingly, at the end of the third quarter of 2010, we stopped recording equity earnings from LUKOIL. Starting in the fourth quarter of 2010, earnings from the LUKOIL Investment segment primarily reflect the realized gain on share sales. We disposed of our remaining interest in LUKOIL in the first quarter of 2011. The Chemicals segment consists of our 50 percent interest in CPChem. The chemicals and plastics industry is mainly a commodity based industry where the margins for key products are based on market factors over which CPChem has little or no control. CPChem is investing in feedstock advantaged areas in the Middle East with access to large, growing markets, such as Asia. The Emerging Businesses segment represents our investment in new technologies or businesses outside our normal scope of operations. Activities within this segment are currently focused on power generation and innovation of new technologies, such as those related to conventional and nonconventional hydrocarbon recovery, refining, alternative energy, biofuels and the environment. Some of these technologies have the potential to become important drivers of profitability in future years. 36 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Consolidated Results A summary of the companys net income (loss) attributable to ConocoPhillips by business segment follows: Millions of Dollars Years Ended December 31 2010 2009 2008 Exploration and Production (EP) $ 9,198 3,604 (13,479 ) Midstream 306 313 541 Refining and Marketing (RM) 192 37 2,322 LUKOIL Investment* 2,503 1,219 (4,839 ) Chemicals 498 248 110 Emerging Businesses (59 ) 3 30 Corporate and Other (1,280 ) (1,010 ) (1,034 ) Net income (loss) attributable to ConocoPhillips $ 11,358 4,414 (16,349 ) *2009 and 2008 recast to reflect a change in accounting principle. See Note 2 Changes in Accounting Principles, for more information. 2010 vs. 2009 The improved results in 2010 were primarily the result of: Higher prices for crude oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids and liquefied natural gas (LNG) in our EP segment. Commodity price benefits were somewhat offset by increased production taxes. Gains of $4,583 million after tax from asset dispositions and LUKOIL share sales. Improved results from our domestic RM operations, reflecting higher refining margins. These items were partially offset by: Impairments totaling $1,928 million after tax. Lower production volumes from our EP segment. 2009 vs. 2008 The improved results in 2009 were primarily the result of: The absence of a $25,443 million before and after tax impairment of all EP segment goodwill in 2008. The absence of a $7,496 million before and after tax impairment of our LUKOIL investment in 2008. Lower production taxes. Reduced operating and overhead expenses. These items were partially offset by: Lower crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices, which impacted our EP, Midstream and LUKOIL Investment segments. Lower refining margins in our RM segment. 37 Table of Contents Statement of Operations Analysis 2010 vs. 2009 Sales and other operating revenues increased 27 percent in 2010, while purchased crude oil, natural gas and products increased 33 percent. These increases were primarily due to higher prices for petroleum products, crude oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids and LNG. Equity in earnings of affiliates increased 24 percent in 2010. The increase primarily resulted from: Improved earnings from CPChem primarily due to higher margins in the olefins and polyolefins business line. Improved earnings from FCCL Partnership due to higher commodity prices and volumes. Improved earnings from Merey Sweeny, L.P. (MSLP) as a result of improved margins and volumes. These increases were partially offset by a $645 million impairment of our equity investment in NMNG. Gain on dispositions increased $5,643 million in 2010. The increase primarily reflects the $2,878 million gain realized from the June 2010 sale of our 9.03 percent interest in the Syncrude oil sands mining operation; the $1,749 million gain on the divestiture of our LUKOIL shares; gains on the disposition of certain EP assets located in the Lower 48 and Canada; and the gain on sale of our 50 percent interest in CFJ Properties. For additional information, see Note 5 Assets Held for Sale and Note 6 Investment, Loans and Long Term Receivables, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Impairments increased $1,245 million in 2010, primarily as a result of the second quarter impairment of WRG. For additional information, see Note 10 Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Taxes other than income taxes increased 8 percent during 2010, primarily due to higher production taxes as a result of higher crude oil prices and higher excise taxes on petroleum product sales. Interest and debt expense decreased 8 percent during 2010, primarily due to lower debt levels. See Note 20 Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for information regarding our income tax expense and effective tax rate. 2009 vs. 2008 Sales and other operating revenues decreased 38 percent in 2009, while purchased crude oil, natural gas and products decreased 39 percent. These decreases were mainly the result of significantly lower prices for petroleum products, crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids. Equity in earnings of affiliates decreased 49 percent in 2009, primarily due to reduced earnings from LUKOIL; DCP Midstream; MSLP; Malaysian Refining Company Sdn. Bhd.; and Excel Paralubes, which were partially offset by higher earnings from CPChem. The decreases were mainly the result of lower commodity prices and refining margins. Gain on dispositions decreased 82 percent during 2009. The decrease was primarily due to 2008 gains related to asset dispositions in our EP and RM segments. Production and operating expenses decreased 13 percent in 2009, as a result of lower utilities costs, favorable foreign currency exchange impacts, and our cost reduction efforts. Selling, general and administrative expense decreased 18 percent in 2009, primarily due to disposition of U.S. and international marketing assets. 38 Table of Contents Impairments decreased from $34,625 million in 2008 to $535 million in 2009, primarily reflecting the 2008 goodwill and LUKOIL impairments. Other impairments decreased $1,151 million during 2009. For additional information, see Note 6 Investments, Loans and Long Term Receivables and Note 9 Goodwill and Intangibles, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Taxes other than income taxes decreased 25 percent in 2009, primarily due to lower production taxes resulting from lower crude oil prices, as well as reduced excise taxes on petroleum product sales. Interest and debt expense increased 38 percent in 2009, as a result of a higher average debt level, partially offset by lower interest rates. Interest expense also increased as a result of lower capitalized interest. See Note 20 Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for information regarding our income tax expense and effective tax rate. 39 Table of Contents Segment Results EP 2010 2009 2008 Millions of Dollars Net Income (Loss) Attributable to ConocoPhillips Alaska $ 1,735 1,540 2,315 Lower 48 1,033 (37 ) 2,673 United States 2,768 1,503 4,988 International 6,430 2,101 6,976 Goodwill impairment (25,443 ) $ 9,198 3,604 (13,479 ) Dollars Per Unit Average Sales Prices Crude oil and natural gas liquids (per barrel) United States $ 69.73 53.21 89.38 International 74.95 57.40 89.32 Total consolidated operations 72.63 55.47 89.35 Equity affiliates 74.81 58.23 71.15 Total EP 72.77 55.63 88.91 Synthetic oil (per barrel) International 77.56 62.01 103.31 Bitumen (per barrel) International 51.10 39.67 46.85 Equity affiliates 53.43 45.69 58.54 Total EP 53.06 44.84 56.72 Natural gas (per thousand cubic feet)* United States 4.27 3.50 7.60 International 5.60 5.06 8.65 Total consolidated operations 5.07 4.40 8.20 Equity affiliates 2.79 2.35 2.04 Total EP 4.98 4.37 8.18 *Prior periods reclassified to conform to current year presentation which includes intrasegment transfer pricing.

Excludes gas equivalent of natural gas liquids included above. Equity affiliate statistics exclude our share of LUKOIL, which is reported in the LUKOIL Investment segment. The EP segment primarily explores for, produces, transports and markets crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG and natural gas liquids on a worldwide basis. At December 31, 2010, our EP operations were producing in the United States, Norway, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, offshore Timor Leste in the Timor Sea, Indonesia, China, Vietnam, Libya, Nigeria, Algeria, Qatar and Russia. Total EP production on a barrel of oil equivalent (BOE) basis averaged 1,752,000 BOE per day in 2010, compared with 1,854,000 BOE per day in 2009. 41 Table of Contents 2010 vs. 2009 Earnings from our EP segment were $9,198 million in 2010, compared with earnings of $3,604 million in 2009. The increase in 2010 earnings primarily resulted from higher prices for crude oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids and LNG. In addition, 2010 earnings benefitted from the $2,679 million after tax gain on sale of Syncrude and higher gains from other asset rationalization efforts. These increases were partially offset by lower crude oil, natural gas and synthetic oil volumes, higher petroleum and export taxes as a result of higher prices, and the NMNG impairment. See the Business Environment and Executive Overview section for additional information on industry crude oil and natural gas prices. U.S. EP U.S. EP earnings increased 84 percent in 2010, from $1,503 million in 2009 to $2,768 million in 2010. The increase was primarily the result of higher prices for crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids. Earnings also benefitted from higher gains from asset sales in our Lower 48 portfolio and lower depreciation, depletion and amortization. These increases were partially offset by lower crude oil and natural gas volumes, higher production taxes, primarily in Alaska, and an unfavorable tax ruling. U.S. EP production averaged 686,000 BOE per day in 2010, a decrease of 9 percent from 755,000 BOE in 2009. The decrease was primarily due to field decline and unplanned downtime, which was somewhat offset by new production. International EP International EP earnings were $6,430 million in 2010, compared with $2,101 million in 2009. The increase in 2010 was mostly due to gains from the sale of Syncrude and other assets and higher crude oil, natural gas and LNG prices. These increases were partially offset by the NMNG impairment, lower synthetic oil and natural gas volumes, higher petroleum taxes as a result of higher prices and an $81 million after tax charge to exploration expenses for project costs resulting from our decision to end participation in the Shah Gas Field Project in Abu Dhabi. International EP production averaged 1,066,000 BOE per day in 2010, a decrease of 3 percent from 1,099,000 BOE in 2009. The decrease was largely due to field decline, the impact of higher prices on production sharing arrangements and the sale of Syncrude. These decreases were partially offset by production from major projects, primarily in China, Canada, Qatar and Australia. 2009 vs. 2008 The EP segment had earnings of $3,604 million during 2009. In 2008, the EP segment had a loss of $13,479 million, which included a $25,443 million before and after tax complete impairment of EP segment goodwill. Excluding the impact from the goodwill impairment, earnings from the EP segment decreased 70 percent during 2009, primarily due to substantially lower crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices. Our EP segment also recognized property impairment charges. These decreases were partially offset by lower Alaska and Lower 48 production taxes due to lower prices, as well as higher international volumes and improved operating costs. U.S. EP Earnings from our U.S. EP operations decreased 70 percent, due to significantly lower crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices. Lower production taxes, lower property impairments in the Lower 48 and improved operating costs partially offset the decrease. U.S. EP production averaged 755,000 BOE per day in 2009, a decrease of 3 percent from 775,000 BOE per day in 2008. Less unplanned downtime and improved well performance were more than offset by field decline. 42 Table of Contents International EP Earnings from our international EP operations were $2,101 million in 2009, compared with $6,976 million in 2008. The decline was primarily a result of significantly lower crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices and higher impairments. These decreases were partially offset by higher volumes and lower operating costs. International EP production averaged 1,099,000 BOE per day in 2009, an increase of 8 percent from 1,014,000 BOE per day in 2008. The increase was predominantly due to new production in the United Kingdom, Russia, China, Canada, Norway and Vietnam. In addition, production increased due to the impacts from the royalty framework in Alberta, Canada, as well as less unplanned downtime and the impact of lower prices on production sharing arrangements. These increases were partially offset by field decline and planned downtime.

The natural gas is then processed to extract natural gas liquids from the raw gas stream. The remaining residue gas is marketed to electrical utilities, industrial users, and gas marketing companies. Most of the natural gas liquids are fractionated separated into individual components like ethane, butane and propane and marketed as chemical feedstock, fuel or blendstock. The Midstream segment consists of our 50 percent equity investment in DCP Midstream, as well as our other natural gas gathering and processing operations, and natural gas liquids fractionation, trading and marketing businesses, primarily in the United States and Trinidad. 2010 vs. 2009 Midstream earnings decreased 2 percent in 2010. Higher natural gas liquids prices and, to a lesser extent, improved volumes from our equity affiliate, Phoenix Park Gas Processors Limited, were more than offset by the absence of the 2009 recognition of an $88 million after tax benefit, which resulted from a DCP Midstream subsidiary converting subordinated units to common units. In addition, higher operating expenses resulting from higher turnaround activity contributed to the decrease in earnings. 43 Table of Contents 2009 vs. 2008 Earnings from the Midstream segment decreased 42 percent in 2009. The decrease was primarily due to substantially lower realized natural gas liquids prices, partially offset by the recognition of the $88 million after tax benefit resulting from the conversion of subordinated units to common units.

Our RM segment refines crude oil and other feedstocks into petroleum products (such as gasoline, distillates and aviation fuels); buys, sells and transports crude oil; and buys, transports, distributes and markets petroleum products. RM has operations mainly in the United States, Europe and Asia. 44 Table of Contents 2010 vs. 2009 RM reported earnings of $192 million in 2010, compared with earnings of $37 million in 2009. Earnings for 2010 included the $1,124 million after tax property impairment of WRG. Excluding the impact of this impairment, earnings were significantly improved during 2010 due to higher global refining margins. Results also benefitted from a $113 million after tax gain on the sale of CFJ and higher refining and marketing volumes. These increases were partially offset by negative foreign currency impacts. See the Business Environment and Executive Overview section for additional information on industry refining margins. U.S. RM Earnings from U.S. RM were $1,022 million in 2010, compared with a loss of $192 million in 2009. The increase in 2010 primarily resulted from significantly higher refining margins and the gain on sale of CFJ. Higher refining and marketing volumes also contributed to the improvement in earnings. Our U.S. refining crude oil capacity utilization rate was 90 percent in 2010, compared with 87 percent in 2009. The increase in 2010 was primarily due to lower turnaround activity, lower run reductions due to market conditions, and less unplanned downtime. International RM International RM reported a loss of $830 million in 2010, compared with earnings of $229 million in 2009. The loss in 2010 primarily resulted from the WRG impairment and a $29 million after tax impairment resulting from our decision to end participation in the Yanbu Refinery Project. Excluding these impairments, earnings were improved due to higher refining margins, partially offset by foreign currency losses. Our international refining crude oil capacity utilization rate was 56 percent in 2010, compared with 74 percent in 2009. The 2010 rate primarily reflects run reductions at WRG in response to market conditions. We are currently exploring options to either pursue the sale of WRG or operate it as a terminal. As a result, effective January 1, 2011, we no longer include its capacity in our stated refining capacities or our capacity utilization metrics. 2009 vs. 2008 RM reported earnings of $37 million in 2009, compared with $2,322 million in 2008. The decrease was primarily a result of significantly lower U.S. and international refining margins, lower volumes, lower international marketing margins and a lower net benefit from asset rationalization efforts. These decreases were partially offset by lower operating expenses, lower property impairments and positive foreign currency impacts. During 2008, our RM segment had property impairments totaling $511 million after tax, mostly due to a significantly diminished outlook for refining margins. U.S. RM Our U.S. RM operations reported a loss of $192 million in 2009, compared with earnings of $1,540 million in 2008. The decrease was primarily due to significantly lower U.S. refining margins, lower U.S. refining and marketing volumes and a lower net benefit from asset sales. These decreases were partially offset by lower operating expenses and lower property impairments. Our U.S. refining capacity utilization rate was 87 percent in 2009, compared with 92 percent in 2008. The rate for 2009 was mainly affected by run reductions due to market conditions and increased turnaround activity, while the 2008 rate was impacted by downtime associated with hurricanes. International RM International RM reported earnings of $229 million in 2009 and earnings of $782 million in 2008. The decrease in earnings was primarily due to significantly lower international refining and marketing margins, lower international marketing volumes and a lower net benefit from asset sales. These decreases were partially offset by positive foreign currency impacts, lower property impairments and lower operating expenses. 45 Table of Contents Our international refining capacity utilization rate was 74 percent in 2009, compared with 85 percent in 2008. The rate for 2009 reflected higher turnaround activity. In addition, the utilization rate for both periods reflected run reductions in response to market conditions. LUKOIL Investment Millions of Dollars 2010 2009 * 2008 * Net Income (Loss) Attributable to ConocoPhillips $ 2,503 1,219 (4,839 ) Operating Statistics Crude oil production (thousands of barrels daily) 284 388 389 Natural gas production (millions of cubic feet daily) 254 295 330 Refinery crude oil processed (thousands of barrels daily) 189 240 226 *Recast to reflect a change in accounting principle. See Note 2 Changes in Accounting Principles, for more information. This segment represents our investment in the ordinary shares of LUKOIL, an international, integrated oil and gas company headquartered in Russia. Prior to 2010, our equity earnings for LUKOIL were estimated. Effective January 1, 2010, we changed our accounting to record our equity earnings for LUKOIL on a one quarter lag basis. This change in accounting principle has been applied retrospectively, by recasting prior period financial information. The performance metrics are also reported on a one quarter lag basis. See Note 2 Changes in Accounting Principles, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for more information. In addition to our equity share of LUKOILs earnings, segment results include the amortization of the basis difference between our equity interest in the net assets of LUKOIL and the book value of our investment, as well as gains from the divestiture of our LUKOIL shares. At year end 2009, we had a 20 percent ownership interest in LUKOIL based on authorized and issued shares. In July 2010, we announced our intention to sell our entire interest in LUKOIL. During 2010, we sold approximately 151 million shares of LUKOIL, and as a result of these sales, our ownership interest in LUKOIL was 2.25 percent at December 31, 2010, based on authorized and issued shares. In the third quarter of 2010, our ownership interest declined to a level at which we were no longer able to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of LUKOIL. Accordingly, at the end of the third quarter of 2010, we stopped applying the equity method of accounting for our remaining investment. In addition, we will no longer report proved reserves or production related to our LUKOIL investment. See Note 6 Investments, Loans and Long Term Receivables, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for more information. In the first quarter of 2011, we sold our remaining interest in LUKOIL. As a result, our first quarter 2011 earnings from the LUKOIL Investment segment will primarily reflect the realized gain on share sales. The total unrealized gain on those shares at December 31, 2010, based on a closing price of LUKOIL shares on the London Stock Exchange of $56.50 per share, was $158 million after tax, and this amount was included in accumulated other comprehensive income. 2010 vs. 2009 LUKOIL segment earnings increased $1,284 million in 2010, which primarily resulted from the $1,251 million after tax gain on our LUKOIL shares sold during 2010. 46 Table of Contents 2009 vs. 2008 LUKOIL segment earnings were $1,219 million in 2009, compared with a loss of $4,839 million in 2008. Results for 2008 included a $7,496 million noncash, before and after tax impairment of our LUKOIL investment taken during the fourth quarter. Excluding the impact of this impairment, earnings decreased 54 percent in 2009. The decrease was primarily due to lower realized refined product and crude oil prices, which was partly offset by lower extraction taxes and export tariff rates, and a benefit from basis difference amortization. Chemicals Millions of Dollars 2010 2009 2008 Net Income Attributable to ConocoPhillips $ 498 248 110 The Chemicals segment consists of our 50 percent interest in CPChem, which we account for under the equity method. CPChem uses natural gas liquids and other feedstocks to produce petrochemicals. These products are then marketed and sold, or used as feedstocks, to produce plastics and commodity chemicals. 2010 vs. 2009 Earnings from the Chemicals segment increased $250 million in 2010, primarily due to substantially higher margins in the olefins and polyolefins business line and, to a lesser extent, improved margins from the specialties, aromatics and styrenics business line. Higher operating costs partially offset these increases. 2009 vs. 2008 Earnings from the Chemicals segment increased $138 million in 2009 due to lower operating costs and higher margins in the specialties, aromatics and styrenics business line. These increases were partially offset by lower margins in the olefins and polyolefins business line. Emerging Businesses Millions of Dollars 2010 2009 2008 Net Income (Loss) Attributable to ConocoPhillips Power $ 49 105 106 Other (108 ) (102 ) (76 ) $ (59 ) 3 30 The Emerging Businesses segment represents our investment in new technologies or businesses outside our normal scope of operations. Activities within this segment are currently focused on power generation and innovation of new technologies, such as those related to conventional and nonconventional hydrocarbon recovery, refining, alternative energy, biofuels, and the environment. 47 Table of Contents 2010 vs. 2009 The Emerging Businesses segment reported a loss of $59 million in 2010, compared with earnings of $3 million in 2009. The decrease for 2010 was mainly due to lower domestic and international power generation results, which resulted from higher operating costs and impairment charges related to a U.S. cogeneration plant that was sold in December 2010. Lower margins in international power and higher technology development expenses also contributed to the decrease. 2009 vs. 2008 Emerging Businesses reported earnings of $3 million in 2009, compared with $30 million in 2008. The decrease in 2009 was primarily due to lower international power results and higher technology development expenses, which were mostly offset by the absence of an $85 million after tax impairment of a U.S. cogeneration power plant in 2008. Corporate and Other Millions of Dollars 2010 2009 2008 Net Loss Attributable to ConocoPhillips Net interest $ (965 ) (851 ) (558 ) Corporate general and administrative expenses (209 ) (108 ) (202 ) Other (106 ) (51 ) (274 ) $ (1,280 ) (1,010 ) (1,034 ) 2010 vs. 2009 Net interest consists of interest and financing expense, net of interest income and capitalized interest, as well as premiums incurred on the early retirement of debt. Net interest increased 13 percent in 2010, mostly due to a $114 million after tax premium on early debt retirement and a lower effective tax rate. These increases were partially offset by lower interest expense due to lower debt levels. Corporate general and administrative expenses increased $101 million in 2010, primarily as a result of costs related to compensation and benefit plans. The category Other includes certain foreign currency transaction gains and losses, environmental costs associated with sites no longer in operation, and other costs not directly associated with an operating segment. Changes in the Other category primarily reflect foreign currency transaction losses. 2009 vs. 2008 Net interest increased 53 percent in 2009 as a result of higher average debt levels, partially offset by lower average interest rates. Capitalized interest was also lower in 2009. Corporate general and administrative expenses decreased 47 percent due to decreased costs related to compensation plans and overhead. Changes in the Other category are primarily due to foreign currency transaction gains in 2009, compared with foreign currency transaction losses in 2008. 48 Table of Contents CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Financial Indicators Millions of Dollars Except as Indicated 2010 2009 2008 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 17,045 12,479 22,658 Short term debt 936 1,728 370 Total debt 23,592 28,653 27,455 Total equity* 69,109 62,613 56,265 Percent of total debt to capital** 25 % 31 33 Percent of floating rate debt to total debt*** 10 % 9 37 *2009 and 2008 recast to reflect a change in accounting principle. See Note 2 Changes in Accounting Principles, for more information. **Capital includes total debt and total equity. ***Includes effect of interest rate swaps. To meet our short and long term liquidity requirements, we look to a variety of funding sources. Cash generated from operating activities is the primary source of funding. In addition, during 2010, we received $15,372 million in proceeds from asset sales. During 2010, the primary uses of our available cash were: $9,761 million to support our ongoing capital expenditures and investments program, $5,202 million to repay debt, $3,866 million to repurchase common stock, $3,175 million to pay dividends on our common stock, and $982 million to purchase short term investments. During 2010, cash and cash equivalents increased by $8,912 million to $9,454 million. In addition to cash flows from operating activities and proceeds from asset sales, we rely on our commercial paper and credit facility programs and our shelf registration statement to support our short and long term liquidity requirements. We believe current cash and short term investment balances and cash generated by operations, together with access to external sources of funds as described below in the Significant Sources of Capital section, will be sufficient to meet our funding requirements in the near and long term, including our capital spending program, dividend payments, required debt payments and the funding requirements to FCCL. Significant Sources of Capital Operating Activities During 2010, cash of $17,045 million was provided by operating activities, a 37 percent increase from cash from operations of $12,479 million in 2009. The increase was primarily due to significantly higher crude oil prices in our EP segment and higher refining margins in our RM segment. During 2009, cash flow from operations decreased $10,179 million, compared with 2008. The decline was primarily due to significantly lower commodity prices in our EP segment and lower refining margins in our RM segment. While the stability of our cash flows from operating activities benefits from geographic diversity and the effects of upstream and downstream integration, our short and long term operating cash flows are highly dependent upon prices for crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG and natural gas liquids, as well as refining and marketing margins. Crude oil and natural gas prices deteriorated significantly in the fourth quarter of 2008. Crude oil prices trended higher in 2009 and 2010 although natural gas prices remained weak. Refining margins deteriorated significantly in the fourth quarter of 2008, remained low throughout 2009, and showed improvement during 2010. Prices and margins in our industry are typically volatile, and are driven by market conditions over which we have no control. Absent other mitigating factors, as these prices and margins fluctuate, we would expect a corresponding change in our operating cash flows. The level of our production volumes of crude oil, bitumen, natural gas and natural gas liquids also impacts our cash flows. These production levels are impacted by such factors as acquisitions and dispositions of fields, 49 Table of Contents field production decline rates, new technologies, operating efficiency, weather conditions, the addition of proved reserves through exploratory success and their timely and cost effective development. While we actively manage these factors, production levels can cause variability in cash flows, although historically this variability has not been as significant as that caused by commodity prices. Our EP production for 2010 averaged 1.75 million BOE per day. Future production is subject to numerous uncertainties, including, among others, the volatile crude oil and natural gas price environment, which may impact project investment decisions; the effects of price changes on production sharing and variable royalty contracts; timing of project startups and major turnarounds; and weather related disruptions. Our production in 2011, excluding the impact of any additional dispositions, is expected to be approximately 1.7 million BOE per day. We continue to evaluate various properties as potential candidates for our disposition program. The makeup and timing of our disposition program will also impact 2011 and future years production levels. To maintain or grow our production volumes, we must continue to add to our proved reserve base. Our reserve replacement in 2010 was negative 160 percent, including a positive 41 percent from consolidated operations. The 2010 reserve replacement reflects a reduction of 2.2 billion BOE due to LUKOIL share sales and other asset dispositions. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and dispositions, the EP segments reserve replacement was 138 percent of 2010 production. Over the five year period ended December 31, 2010, our reserve replacement was 75 percent, including 105 percent from consolidated operations; however, excluding LUKOIL, our five year reserve replacement would have been 111 percent. Over this period we added reserves through acquisitions and project developments, which were more than offset by the impact of asset expropriations in Venezuela and Ecuador and the sale of our investment in LUKOIL. The reserve replacement amounts above were based on the sum of our net additions (revisions, improved recovery, purchases, extensions and discoveries, and sales) divided by our production, as shown in our reserve table disclosures. For additional information about our proved reserves, including both developed and undeveloped reserves, see the Oil and Gas Operations section of this report. We are developing and pursuing projects we anticipate will allow us to add to our reserve base. However, access to additional resources has become increasingly difficult as direct investment is prohibited in some nations, while fiscal and other terms in other countries can make projects uneconomic or unattractive. In addition, political instability, competition from national oil companies, and lack of access to high potential areas due to environmental or other regulation may negatively impact our ability to increase our reserve base. As such, the timing and level at which we add to our reserve base may, or may not, allow us to replace our production over subsequent years. As discussed in the Critical Accounting Estimates section, engineering estimates of proved reserves are imprecise; therefore, each year reserves may be revised upward or downward due to the impact of changes in commodity prices or as more technical data becomes available on reservoirs. In 2010 and 2009, revisions increased reserves, while in 2008 revisions decreased reserves. It is not possible to reliably predict how revisions will impact reserve quantities in the future. In our RM segment, the level and quality of output from our refineries impacts our cash flows. The output at our refineries is impacted by such factors as operating efficiency, maintenance turnarounds, market conditions, feedstock availability and weather conditions. We actively manage the operations of our refineries, and typically, any variability in their operations has not been as significant to cash flows as that caused by refining margins. Asset Sales Proceeds from asset sales in 2010 were $15.4 billion, compared with $1.3 billion in 2009. The 2010 proceeds from asset sales included $8.3 billion from our interest in LUKOIL. The remaining sales consisted primarily of our interest in Syncrude Canada Ltd., CFJ Properties and North America EP assets. We plan to raise an additional $3 billion through the end of 2011, as part of our previously announced $10 billion asset disposition program. The sale of our LUKOIL interest is not included in this program. 50 Table of Contents Commercial Paper and Credit Facilities At December 31, 2010, we had two revolving credit facilities totaling $7.85 billion, consisting of a $7.35 billion facility expiring in September 2012 and a $500 million facility expiring in July 2012. Our revolving credit facilities may be used as direct bank borrowings, as support for issuances of letters of credit totaling up to $750 million, or as support for our commercial paper programs. The revolving credit facilities are broadly syndicated among financial institutions and do not contain any material adverse change provisions or any covenants requiring maintenance of specified financial ratios or ratings. The facility agreements contain a cross default provision relating to the failure to pay principal or interest on other debt obligations of $200 million or more by ConocoPhillips, or by any of its consolidated subsidiaries. Credit facility borrowings may bear interest at a margin above rates offered by certain designated banks in the London interbank market or at a margin above the overnight federal funds rate or prime rates offered by certain designated banks in the United States. The agreements call for commitment fees on available, but unused, amounts. The agreements also contain early termination rights if our current directors or their approved successors cease to be a majority of the Board of Directors. Our primary funding source for short term working capital needs is the ConocoPhillips $6.35 billion commercial paper program. Commercial paper maturities are generally limited to 90 days. We also have the ConocoPhillips Qatar Funding Ltd. $1.5 billion commercial paper program, which is used to fund commitments relating to the Qatargas 3 (QG3) Project. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, we had no direct borrowings under the revolving credit facilities, but $40 million in letters of credit had been issued at both periods. In addition, under the two ConocoPhillips commercial paper programs, $1,182 million of commercial paper was outstanding at December 31, 2010, compared with $1,300 million at December 31, 2009. Since we had $1,182 million of commercial paper outstanding and had issued $40 million of letters of credit, we had access to $6.6 billion in borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facilities at December 31, 2010. Shelf Registration We have a universal shelf registration statement on file with the SEC under which we, as a well known seasoned issuer, have the ability to issue and sell an indeterminate amount of various types of debt and equity securities. Our senior long term debt is rated A1 by Moodys Investor Service and A by both Standard and Poors Rating Service and by Fitch. We do not have any ratings triggers on any of our corporate debt that would cause an automatic default, and thereby impact our access to liquidity, in the event of a downgrade of our credit rating. If our credit rating were to deteriorate to a level prohibiting us from accessing the commercial paper market, we would still be able to access funds under our $7.35 billion and $500 million revolving credit facilities. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As part of our normal ongoing business operations and consistent with normal industry practice, we enter into numerous agreements with other parties to pursue business opportunities, which share costs and apportion risks among the parties as governed by the agreements. At December 31, 2010, we were liable for certain contingent obligations under the following contractual arrangements: Qatargas 3: We own a 30 percent interest in QG3, an integrated project to produce and liquefy natural gas from Qatars North Field. The other participants in the project are affiliates of Qatar Petroleum (68.5 percent) and Mitsui Co., Ltd. (1.5 percent). Our interest is held through a jointly owned company, Qatar Liquefied Gas Company Limited (3), for which we use the equity method of accounting. QG3 secured project financing of $4 billion in 2005, consisting of $1.3 billion of loans from export credit agencies (ECA), $1.5 billion from commercial banks, and $1.2 billion from ConocoPhillips. The ConocoPhillips loan facilities have substantially the same terms as the ECA and commercial bank facilities. Prior to project completion certification, all loans, including the ConocoPhillips loan facilities, are guaranteed by the participants, based on their respective ownership interests. Accordingly, our maximum exposure to this financing structure is $1.2 billion. Upon completion certification, currently expected in 2011, all project loan facilities, including the 51 Table of Contents ConocoPhillips loan facilities, will become nonrecourse to the project participants. At December 31, 2010, QG3 had approximately $4 billion outstanding under all the loan facilities, including the $1.2 billion from ConocoPhillips. Rockies Express Pipeline: In June 2006, we issued a guarantee for 24 percent of $2 billion in credit facilities issued to Rockies Express Pipeline LLC, operated by Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, L.P. In the second quarter of 2010, the credit facilities were reduced, and our guarantee was released. For additional information about guarantees, see Note 14 Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which is incorporated herein by reference. Capital Requirements Our debt balance at December 31, 2010, was $23.6 billion, a decrease of $5.1 billion during 2010, and our debt to capital ratio was 25 percent at year end 2010, versus 31 percent at the end of 2009. The change in the debt to capital ratio was due to a combination of a decrease in debt and an increase in equity. Our debt to capital ratio target range is 20 to 25 percent. On February 15, 2011, a $328 million 9.375% Note was repaid at maturity. In 2007, we closed on a business venture with Cenovus Energy Inc. As part of this transaction, we are obligated to contribute $7.5 billion, plus accrued interest, over a 10 year period that began in 2007, to the upstream business venture, FCCL, formed as a result of the transaction. Quarterly principal and interest payments of $237 million began in the second quarter of 2007, and will continue until the balance is paid. Of the principal obligation amount, approximately $695 million was short term and was included in the Accounts payable related parties line on our December 31, 2010, consolidated balance sheet. The principal portion of these payments, which totaled $659 million in 2010, is included in the Other line in the financing activities section of our consolidated statement of cash flows. Interest accrues at a fixed annual rate of 5.3 percent on the unpaid principal balance. Fifty percent of the quarterly interest payment is reflected as a capital contribution and is included in the Capital expenditures and investments line on our consolidated statement of cash flows. We have provided loan financing to WRB Refining LP, to assist it in meeting its operating and capital spending requirements. At December 31, 2010, $550 million of such financing was outstanding and $400 million was classified as long term. In February 2011, we announced a 20 percent increase in the quarterly dividend rate to 66 cents per share. The dividend is payable March 1, 2011, to stockholders of record at the close of business February 22, 2011. On March 24, 2010, our Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to $5 billion of our common stock through 2011. Repurchase of shares under this authorization totaled 64.5 million shares at a cost of $3.9 billion, through December 31, 2010. On February 11, 2011, the Board authorized the additional purchase of up to $10 billion of our common stock over the subsequent two years. At year end we had a cash and short term investment balance of $10.4 billion, a significant portion of which is expected to be directed toward the repurchase of common stock. 52 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our aggregate contractual fixed and variable obligations as of December 31, 2010: Millions of Dollars Payments Due by Period Up to Years Years After Total 1 Year 2 3 4 5 5 Years Debt obligations (a) $ 23,553 924 3,354 3,137 16,138 Capital lease obligations 39 12 4 3 20 Total debt 23,592 936 3,358 3,140 16,158 Interest on debt and other obligations 20,060 1,404 2,649 2,274 13,733 Operating lease obligations 2,896 752 1,033 554 557 Purchase obligations (b) 139,575 61,136 14,326 9,044 55,069 Joint venture acquisition obligation (c) 5,009 695 1,504 1,672 1,138 Other long term liabilities (d) Asset retirement obligations 8,776 454 722 627 6,973 Accrued environmental costs 994 117 176 119 582 Unrecognized tax benefits (e) 160 160 (e ) (e ) (e ) Total $ 201,062 65,654 23,768 17,430 94,210 (a) Includes $457 million of net unamortized premiums and discounts.

(b) Represents any agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding and that specifies all significant terms. Does not include purchase commitments for jointly owned fields and facilities where we are not the operator. The majority of the purchase obligations are market based contracts, including exchanges and futures, for the purchase of products such as crude oil, unfractionated natural gas liquids, natural gas and power. The products are mostly used to supply our refineries and fractionators, optimize the supply chain, and resell to customers. Product purchase commitments with third parties totaled $73,138 million. In addition, $50,179 million are product purchases from CPChem, mostly for natural gas and natural gas liquids over the remaining term of 89 years, and Excel Paralubes, for base oil over the remaining initial term of 15 years. Purchase obligations of $12,806 million are related to agreements to access and utilize the capacity of third party equipment and facilities, including pipelines and LNG and product terminals, to transport, process, treat, and store products. The remainder is primarily our net share of purchase commitments for materials and services for jointly owned fields and facilities where we are the operator. (c) Represents the remaining amount of contributions, excluding interest, due over a seven year period to the FCCL upstream joint venture with Cenovus. (d) Does not include: Pensions for the 2011 through 2015 time period, we expect to contribute an average of $530 million per year to our qualified and nonqualified pension and postretirement benefit plans in the United States and an average of $240 million per year to our non U.S. plans, which are expected to be in excess of required minimums in many cases. The U.S. five year average consists of $730 million for 2011 and then approximately $480 million per year for the remaining four years. Our required minimum funding in 2011 is expected to be $360 million in the United States and $160 million outside the United States. 53 Table of Contents (e) Excludes unrecognized tax benefits of $965 million because the ultimate disposition and timing of any payments to be made with regard to such amounts are not reasonably estimable. Although unrecognized tax benefits are not a contractual obligation, they are presented in this table because they represent potential demands on our liquidity.

For information on proved undeveloped reserves and the associated cost to develop these reserves, see the Oil and Gas Operations section. 55 Table of Contents RM Capital spending for RM during the three year period ended December 31, 2010, was primarily for air emission reduction and clean fuels projects to meet new environmental standards, refinery upgrade projects to improve product yields and increase heavy crude oil processing capability, improving the operating integrity of key processing units, as well as for safety projects. During this three year period, RM capital spending was $5.1 billion, which represented 13 percent of our total capital expenditures and investments. Key projects during the three year period included: Installation of a 20,000 barrel per day hydrocracker at the Rodeo facility of our San Francisco Refinery. Installation of a 225 ton per day sulfur plant at the Sweeny Refinery. Installation of facilities to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions from the Fluid Catalytic Cracker at the Alliance Refinery. Completion of a gasoline benzene reduction project at the Borger Refinery. Investment to obtain an equity interest in four Keystone Pipeline entities, and associated investment to construct a crude oil pipeline from Hardisty, Alberta, to delivery points in the United States. We disposed of our interest in the Keystone Pipeline in 2009. Major construction activities in progress include: Installation of a 65,000 barrel per day coker and a major reconfiguration of the Wood River Refinery to handle advantaged crude and increase capacity, partially funded through long term advances from ConocoPhillips. Installations, revamps and expansions of equipment at several U.S. refineries to enable production of low benzene gasoline. U.S. programs aimed at air emission reductions. 2011 CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND INVESTMENTS BUDGET RMs 2011 capital expenditures and investments budget is $1.2 billion, a 14 percent increase from actual spending in 2010, with about $1 billion targeted in the United States and $0.2 billion internationally. These funds will be used primarily for projects related to sustaining and improving the existing business with a focus on safety, regulatory compliance and reliability. Emerging Businesses Capital spending for Emerging Businesses during the three year period ended December 31, 2010, was primarily for an expansion of the Immingham combined heat and power cogeneration plant near our Humber Refinery in the United Kingdom. Contingencies A number of lawsuits involving a variety of claims have been made against ConocoPhillips that arise in the ordinary course of business. We also may be required to remove or mitigate the effects on the environment of the placement, storage, disposal or release of certain chemical, mineral and petroleum substances at various active and inactive sites. We regularly assess the need for accounting recognition or disclosure of these contingencies. In the case of all known contingencies (other than those related to income taxes), we accrue a liability when the loss is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable. If a range of amounts can be reasonably estimated and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, then the minimum of the range is accrued. We do not reduce these liabilities for potential insurance or third party recoveries. If applicable, we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third party recoveries. In the case of income tax related contingencies, we use a cumulative probability weighted loss accrual in cases where sustaining a tax position is less than certain. Based on currently available information, we believe it is remote that future costs related to known contingent liability exposures will exceed current accruals by an amount that would have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements. As we learn new facts concerning contingencies, we reassess our position 56 Table of Contents both with respect to accrued liabilities and other potential exposures. Estimates particularly sensitive to future changes include contingent liabilities recorded for environmental remediation, tax and legal matters. Estimated future environmental remediation costs are subject to change due to such factors as the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs, the unknown time and extent of such remedial actions that may be required, and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other responsible parties. Estimated future costs related to tax and legal matters are subject to change as events evolve and as additional information becomes available during the administrative and litigation processes. Legal and Tax Matters Our legal organization applies its knowledge, experience and professional judgment to the specific characteristics of our cases, employing a litigation management process to manage and monitor the legal proceedings against us. Our process facilitates the early evaluation and quantification of potential exposures in individual cases. This process also enables us to track those cases that have been scheduled for trial and or mediation. Based on professional judgment and experience in using these litigation management tools and available information about current developments in all our cases, our legal organization regularly assesses the adequacy of current accruals and determines if adjustment of existing accruals, or establishment of new accruals, are required. See Note 20 Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information about income tax related contingencies. Environmental We are subject to the same numerous international, federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations as other companies in our industry. The most significant of these environmental laws and regulations include, among others, the: U.S. Federal Clean Air Act, which governs air emissions. U.S. Federal Clean Water Act, which governs discharges to water bodies. European Union Regulation for Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH). U.S. Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), which imposes liability on generators, transporters and arrangers of hazardous substances at sites where hazardous substance releases have occurred or are threatening to occur. U.S. Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), which governs the treatment, storage and disposal of solid waste. U.S. Federal Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA90), under which owners and operators of onshore facilities and pipelines, lessees or permittees of an area in which an offshore facility is located, and owners and operators of vessels are liable for removal costs and damages that result from a discharge of oil into navigable waters of the United States. U.S. Federal Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act (EPCRA), which requires facilities to report toxic chemical inventories with local emergency planning committees and response departments. U.S. Federal Safe Drinking Water Act, which governs the disposal of wastewater in underground injection wells. U.S. Department of the Interior regulations, which relate to offshore oil and gas operations in U.S. waters and impose liability for the cost of pollution cleanup resulting from operations, as well as potential liability for pollution damages. European Union Trading Directive resulting in European Emissions Trading Scheme. These laws and their implementing regulations set limits on emissions and, in the case of discharges to water, establish water quality limits. They also, in most cases, require permits in association with new or modified operations. These permits can require an applicant to collect substantial information in connection with the application process, which can be expensive and time consuming. In addition, there can be delays associated with notice and comment periods and the agencys processing of the application. Many of the delays associated with the permitting process are beyond the control of the applicant. Many states and foreign countries where we operate also have, or are developing, similar environmental laws and regulations governing these same types of activities. While similar, in some cases these regulations may 57 Table of Contents impose additional, or more stringent, requirements that can add to the cost and difficulty of marketing or transporting products across state and international borders. The ultimate financial impact arising from environmental laws and regulations is neither clearly known nor easily determinable as new standards, such as air emission standards, water quality standards and stricter fuel regulations, continue to evolve. However, environmental laws and regulations, including those that may arise to address concerns about global climate change, are expected to continue to have an increasing impact on our operations in the United States and in other countries in which we operate. Notable areas of potential impacts include air emission compliance and remediation obligations in the United States. An example in the fuels area is the Energy Policy Act of 2005, which imposed obligations to provide increasing volumes of renewable fuels in transportation motor fuels through 2012. These obligations were changed with the enactment of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. The 2007 law requires fuel producers and importers to provide additional renewable fuels for transportation motor fuels that include a mix of various types to be included through 2022. We have met the increased requirements to date while establishing implementation, operating and capital strategies, along with advanced technology development, to address projected future requirements. We also are subject to certain laws and regulations relating to environmental remediation obligations associated with current and past operations. Such laws and regulations include CERCLA and RCRA and their state equivalents. Remediation obligations include cleanup responsibility arising from petroleum releases from underground storage tanks located at numerous past and present ConocoPhillips owned and or operated petroleum marketing outlets throughout the United States. Federal and state laws require contamination caused by such underground storage tank releases be assessed and remediated to meet applicable standards. In addition to other cleanup standards, many states adopted cleanup criteria for methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) for both soil and groundwater. At RCRA permitted facilities, we are required to assess environmental conditions. If conditions warrant, we may be required to remediate contamination caused by prior operations. In contrast to CERCLA, which is often referred to as Superfund, the cost of corrective action activities under RCRA corrective action programs typically is borne solely by us. We anticipate increased expenditures for RCRA remediation activities may be required, but such annual expenditures for the near term are not expected to vary significantly from the range of such expenditures we have experienced over the past few years. Longer term expenditures are subject to considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly. We, from time to time, receive requests for information or notices of potential liability from the EPA and state environmental agencies alleging that we are a potentially responsible party under CERCLA or an equivalent state statute. On occasion, we also have been made a party to cost recovery litigation by those agencies or by private parties. These requests, notices and lawsuits assert potential liability for remediation costs at various sites that typically are not owned by us, but allegedly contain wastes attributable to our past operations. As of December 31, 2009, we reported we had been notified of potential liability under CERCLA and comparable state laws at 65 sites around the United States. At December 31, 2010, we had been notified of seven new sites, re opened three sites and settled two sites, bringing the number to 73 unresolved sites with potential liability. For most Superfund sites, our potential liability will be significantly less than the total site remediation costs because the percentage of waste attributable to us, versus that attributable to all other potentially responsible parties, is relatively low. Although liability of those potentially responsible is generally joint and several for federal sites and frequently so for state sites, other potentially responsible parties at sites where we are a party typically have had the financial strength to meet their obligations, and where they have not, or where potentially responsible parties could not be located, our share of liability has not increased materially. Many of the sites at which we are potentially responsible are still under investigation by the EPA or the state agencies concerned. Prior to actual cleanup, those potentially responsible normally assess site conditions, apportion responsibility and determine the appropriate remediation. In some instances, we may have no liability or attain a settlement of liability. Actual cleanup costs generally occur after the parties obtain EPA or equivalent state agency approval. There are relatively few sites where we are a major participant, and given the timing and 58 Table of Contents amounts of anticipated expenditures, neither the cost of remediation at those sites nor such costs at all CERCLA sites, in the aggregate, is expected to have a material adverse effect on our competitive or financial condition. Expensed environmental costs were $928 million in 2010 and are expected to be about $1,100 million per year in 2011 and 2012. Capitalized environmental costs were $574 million in 2010 and are expected to be about $650 million per year in 2011 and 2012. Accrued liabilities for remediation activities are not reduced for potential recoveries from insurers or other third parties and are not discounted (except those assumed in a purchase business combination, which we do record on a discounted basis). Many of these liabilities result from CERCLA, RCRA and similar state laws that require us to undertake certain investigative and remedial activities at sites where we conduct, or once conducted, operations or at sites where ConocoPhillips generated waste was disposed. The accrual also includes a number of sites we identified that may require environmental remediation, but which are not currently the subject of CERCLA, RCRA or state enforcement activities. If applicable, we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third party recoveries. In the future, we may incur significant costs under both CERCLA and RCRA. Remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site, depending on the mix of unique site characteristics, evolving remediation technologies, diverse regulatory agencies and enforcement policies, and the presence or absence of potentially liable third parties. Therefore, it is difficult to develop reasonable estimates of future site remediation costs. At December 31, 2010, our balance sheet included total accrued environmental costs of $994 million, compared with $1,017 million at December 31, 2009. We expect to incur a substantial amount of these expenditures within the next 30 years. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, and as with other companies engaged in similar businesses, environmental costs and liabilities are inherent concerns in our operations and products, and there can be no assurance that material costs and liabilities will not be incurred. However, we currently do not expect any material adverse effect upon our results of operations or financial position as a result of compliance with current environmental laws and regulations. Climate Change There has been a broad range of proposed or promulgated state, national and international laws focusing on greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction. These proposed or promulgated laws apply or could apply in countries where we have interests or may have interests in the future. Laws in this field continue to evolve, and while it is not possible to accurately estimate either a timetable for implementation or our future compliance costs relating to implementation, such laws, if enacted, could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition. Examples of legislation or precursors for possible regulation that do or could affect our operations include: European Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS), the program through which many of the European Union (EU) member states are implementing the Kyoto Protocol. Californias Global Warming Solutions Act, which requires the California Air Resources Board to develop regulations and market mechanisms that will ultimately reduce Californias GHG emissions by 25 percent by 2020. Two regulations issued by the Alberta government in 2007 under the Climate Change and Emissions Act. These regulations require any existing facility with emissions equal to or greater than 100,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide or equivalent per year to reduce the net emissions intensity of that facility by 2 percent per year beginning July 1, 2007, with an ultimate reduction target of 12 percent of baseline emissions. The U.S. Supreme Court decision in Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. 497, 127 S.Ct. 1438 (2007), confirming that the EPA has the authority to regulate carbon dioxide as an air pollutant under the Federal Clean Air Act. 59 Table of Contents The EPAs announcement on December 7, 2009, Endangerment and Cause or Contribute Findings for Greenhouse Gases Under Section 202(a) of the Clean Air Act, 74, Fed. Reg. 66,495, finalizing its findings that GHG emissions threaten public health and the environment and that cars and light trucks cause or contribute to this threat. While these findings do not themselves impose any requirements on any industry or company at this time, these findings may lead to greater regulation of GHG emissions by the EPA, may trigger more climate based claims for damages, and may result in longer agency review time for development projects to determine the extent of climate change. In the EU, we have assets that are subject to the ETS. The first phase of the EU ETS was completed at the end of 2007, with EU ETS Phase II running from 2008 through 2012. The European Commission has approved most of the Phase II national allocation plans. We are actively engaged to minimize any financial impact from the trading scheme. In the United States, there is growing consensus that some form of regulation will be forthcoming at the federal level with respect to GHG emissions. Such regulation could take any of several forms that may result in the creation of additional costs in the form of taxes, the restriction of output, investments of capital to maintain compliance with laws and regulations, or required acquisition or trading of emission allowances. We are working to continuously improve operational and energy efficiency through resource and energy conservation throughout our operations. Compliance with changes in laws and regulations that create a GHG emission trading scheme or GHG reduction policies could significantly increase our costs, reduce demand for fossil energy derived products, impact the cost and availability of capital and increase our exposure to litigation. Such laws and regulations could also increase demand for less carbon intensive energy sources, including natural gas. The ultimate impact on our financial performance, either positive or negative, will depend on a number of factors, including but not limited to: Whether and to what extent legislation is enacted. The nature of the legislation (such as a cap and trade system or a tax on emissions). The GHG reductions required. The price and availability of offsets. The amount and allocation of allowances. Technological and scientific developments leading to new products or services. Any potential significant physical effects of climate change (such as increased severe weather events, changes in sea levels and changes in temperature). Whether, and the extent to which, increased compliance costs are ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services. Other We have deferred tax assets related to certain accrued liabilities, loss carryforwards and credit carryforwards. Valuation allowances have been established to reduce these deferred tax assets to an amount that will, more likely than not, be realized. Based on our historical taxable income, our expectations for the future, and available tax planning strategies, management expects that the net deferred tax assets will be realized as offsets to reversing deferred tax liabilities and as reductions in future taxable income. 60 Table of Contents CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to select appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. See Note 1 Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for descriptions of our major accounting policies. Certain of these accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is a reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts would have been reported under different conditions, or if different assumptions had been used. These critical accounting estimates are discussed with the Audit and Finance Committee of the Board of Directors at least annually. We believe the following discussions of critical accounting estimates, along with the discussions of contingencies and of deferred tax asset valuation allowances in this report, address all important accounting areas where the nature of accounting estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change. Oil and Gas Accounting Accounting for oil and gas exploratory activity is subject to special accounting rules unique to the oil and gas industry. The acquisition of geological and geophysical seismic information, prior to the discovery of proved reserves, is expensed as incurred, similar to accounting for research and development costs. However, leasehold acquisition costs and exploratory well costs are capitalized on the balance sheet pending determination of whether proved oil and gas reserves have been discovered on the prospect. Property Acquisition Costs For individually significant leaseholds, management periodically assesses for impairment based on exploration and drilling efforts to date. For leasehold acquisition costs that individually are relatively small, management exercises judgment and determines a percentage probability that the prospect ultimately will fail to find proved oil and gas reserves and pools that leasehold information with others in the geographic area. For prospects in areas that have had limited, or no, previous exploratory drilling, the percentage probability of ultimate failure is normally judged to be quite high. This judgmental percentage is multiplied by the leasehold acquisition cost, and that product is divided by the contractual period of the leasehold to determine a periodic leasehold impairment charge that is reported in exploration expense. This judgmental probability percentage is reassessed and adjusted throughout the contractual period of the leasehold based on favorable or unfavorable exploratory activity on the leasehold or on adjacent leaseholds, and leasehold impairment amortization expense is adjusted prospectively. At year end 2010, the book value of the pools of property acquisition costs that individually are relatively small and thus subject to the above described periodic leasehold impairment calculation was $1,581 million and the accumulated impairment reserve was $497 million. The weighted average judgmental percentage probability of ultimate failure was approximately 58 percent, and the weighted average amortization period was approximately three years. If that judgmental percentage were to be raised by 5 percent across all calculations, pretax leasehold impairment expense in 2011 would increase by approximately $23 million. The remaining $5,374 million of gross capitalized unproved property costs at year end 2010 consisted of individually significant leaseholds, mineral rights held in perpetuity by title ownership, exploratory wells currently drilling, and suspended exploratory wells. Management periodically assesses individually significant leaseholds for impairment based on the results of exploration and drilling efforts and the outlook for project commercialization. Of this amount, approximately $2.8 billion is concentrated in 10 major development areas. One of these major assets totaling $118 million is expected to move to proved properties in 2011. Exploratory Costs For exploratory wells, drilling costs are temporarily capitalized, or suspended, on the balance sheet, pending a determination of whether potentially economic oil and gas reserves have been discovered by the drilling effort to justify completion of the find as a producing well. If exploratory wells encounter potentially economic quantities of oil and gas, the well costs remain capitalized on the balance sheet as long as sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made. The accounting notion of sufficient progress is a judgmental area, but 61 Table of Contents the accounting rules do prohibit continued capitalization of suspended well costs on the mere chance that future market conditions will improve or new technologies will be found that would make the projects development economically profitable. Often, the ability to move the project into the development phase and record proved reserves is dependent on obtaining permits and government or co venturer approvals, the timing of which is ultimately beyond our control. Exploratory well costs remain suspended as long as we are actively pursuing such approvals and permits, and believe they will be obtained. Once all required approvals and permits have been obtained, the projects are moved into the development phase, and the oil and gas reserves are designated as proved reserves. For complex exploratory discoveries, it is not unusual to have exploratory wells remain suspended on the balance sheet for several years while we perform additional appraisal drilling and seismic work on the potential oil and gas field or while we seek government or co venturer approval of development plans or seek environmental permitting. Once a determination is made the well did not encounter potentially economic oil and gas quantities, the well costs are expensed as a dry hole and reported in exploration expense. Management reviews suspended well balances quarterly, continuously monitors the results of the additional appraisal drilling and seismic work, and expenses the suspended well costs as a dry hole when it determines the potential field does not warrant further investment in the near term. Criteria utilized in making this determination include evaluation of the reservoir characteristics and hydrocarbon properties, expected development costs, ability to apply existing technology to produce the reserves, fiscal terms, regulations or contract negotiations, and our required return on investment. At year end 2010, total suspended well costs were $1,013 million, compared with $908 million at year end 2009. For additional information on suspended wells, including an aging analysis, see Note 8 Suspended Wells, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Proved Reserves Engineering estimates of the quantities of proved reserves are inherently imprecise and represent only approximate amounts because of the judgments involved in developing such information. Reserve estimates are based on geological and engineering assessments of in place hydrocarbon volumes, the production plan, historical extraction recovery and processing yield factors, installed plant operating capacity and approved operating limits. The reliability of these estimates at any point in time depends on both the quality and quantity of the technical and economic data and the efficiency of extracting and processing the hydrocarbons. Despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates, accounting rules require disclosure of proved reserve estimates due to the importance of these estimates to better understand the perceived value and future cash flows of a companys EP operations. There are several authoritative guidelines regarding the engineering criteria that must be met before estimated reserves can be designated as proved. Our reservoir engineering organization has policies and procedures in place consistent with these authoritative guidelines. We have trained and experienced internal engineering personnel who estimate our proved reserves held by consolidated companies, as well as our share of equity affiliates. Proved reserve estimates are adjusted annually in the fourth quarter and during the year if significant changes occur, and take into account recent production and subsurface information about each field. Also, as required by current authoritative guidelines, the estimated future date when a field will be permanently shut down for economic reasons is based on 12 month average prices and year end costs. This estimated date when production will end affects the amount of estimated reserves. Therefore, as prices and cost levels change from year to year, the estimate of proved reserves also changes. Our proved reserves include estimated quantities related to production sharing contracts, which are reported under the economic interest method and are subject to fluctuations in prices of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids; recoverable operating expenses; and capital costs. If costs remain stable, reserve quantities attributable to recovery of costs will change inversely to changes in commodity prices. For example, if prices increase, then our applicable reserve quantities would decline. The estimation of proved developed reserves also is important to the statement of operations because the proved developed reserve estimate for a field serves as the denominator in the unit of production calculation of depreciation, depletion and amortization of the capitalized costs for that asset. At year end 2010, the net book value of productive EP properties, plants and equipment subject to a unit of production calculation was approximately $56 billion and the depreciation, 62 Table of Contents depletion and amortization recorded on these assets in 2010 was approximately $7.8 billion. The estimated proved developed reserves for our consolidated operations were 5.6 billion BOE at the beginning of 2010 and were 5.2 billion BOE at the end of 2010. If the estimates of proved reserves used in the unit of production calculations had been lower by 5 percent across all calculations, pretax depreciation, depletion and amortization in 2010 would have increased by an estimated $410 million. Impairments of producing properties resulting from downward revisions of proved reserves due to reservoir performance were not material in the last three years. Impairments Long lived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in future cash flows expected to be generated by an asset group and annually in the fourth quarter following updates to corporate planning assumptions. If, upon review, the sum of the undiscounted pretax cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset group, the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value. Individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes based on a judgmental assessment of the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets generally on a field by field basis for exploration and production assets, or at an entire complex level for downstream assets. Because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for long lived assets, the fair value of impaired assets is typically determined based on the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants, or based on a multiple of operating cash flow validated with historical market transactions of similar assets where possible. The expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are based on judgmental assessments of future production volumes, commodity prices, operating costs, refining margins and capital project decisions, considering all available information at the date of review. See Note 10 Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. Investments in nonconsolidated entities accounted for under the equity method are reviewed for impairment when there is evidence of a loss in value and annually following updates to corporate planning assumptions. Such evidence of a loss in value might include our inability to recover the carrying amount, the lack of sustained earnings capacity which would justify the current investment amount, or a current fair value less than the investments carrying amount. When it is determined such a loss in value is other than temporary, an impairment charge is recognized for the difference between the investments carrying value and its estimated fair value. When determining whether a decline in value is other than temporary, management considers factors such as the length of time and extent of the decline, the investees financial condition and near term prospects, and our ability and intention to retain our investment for a period that will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the market value of the investment. When quoted market prices are not available, the fair value is usually based on the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants, plus market analysis of comparable assets owned by the investee, if appropriate. Differing assumptions could affect the timing and the amount of an impairment of an investment in any period. For additional information, see the LUKOIL and NMNG sections of Note 6 Investments, Loans and Long Term Receivables, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Asset Retirement Obligations and Environmental Costs Under various contracts, permits and regulations, we have material legal obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore the land or seabed at the end of operations at operational sites. Our largest asset removal obligations involve removal and disposal of offshore oil and gas platforms around the world, oil and gas production facilities and pipelines in Alaska, and asbestos abatement at refineries. The fair values of obligations for dismantling and removing these facilities are accrued at the installation of the asset based on estimated discounted costs. Estimating the future asset removal costs necessary for this accounting calculation is difficult. Most of these removal obligations are many years, or decades, in the future and the contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what removal practices and criteria must be met when the removal event actually occurs. Asset removal technologies and costs, regulatory and other compliance considerations, 63 Table of Contents expenditure timing, and other inputs into valuation of the obligation, including discount and inflation rates, are also subject to change. In addition, under the above or similar contracts, permits and regulations, we have certain obligations to complete environmental related projects. These projects are primarily related to cleanup at domestic refineries and remediation activities required by Canada and the state of Alaska at exploration and production sites. Future environmental remediation costs are difficult to estimate because they are subject to change due to such factors as the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs, the unknown time and extent of such remedial actions that may be required, and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other responsible parties. Business Acquisitions Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed Accounting for the acquisition of a business requires the recognition of the consideration paid, as well as the various assets and liabilities of the acquired business. For most assets and liabilities, the asset or liability is recorded at its estimated fair value. The most difficult estimates of individual fair values are those involving properties, plants and equipment and identifiable intangible assets. We use all available information to make these fair value determinations. We have, if necessary, up to one year after the acquisition closing date to finalize these fair value determinations. Intangible Assets and Goodwill At December 31, 2010, we had $739 million of intangible assets determined to have indefinite useful lives, thus they are not amortized. This judgmental assessment of an indefinite useful life must be continuously evaluated in the future. If, due to changes in facts and circumstances, management determines these intangible assets have definite useful lives, amortization will have to commence at that time on a prospective basis. As long as these intangible assets are judged to have indefinite lives, they will be subject to periodic lower of cost or market tests that require managements judgment of the estimated fair value of these intangible assets. In the fourth quarter of 2008, we fully impaired the recorded goodwill associated with our Worldwide EP reporting unit. At December 31, 2010, we had $3,633 million of goodwill remaining on our balance sheet, all of which was attributable to the Worldwide RM reporting unit. See Note 9 Goodwill and Intangibles, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information on intangibles and goodwill, including a detailed discussion of the facts and circumstances leading to the goodwill impairment, as well as the judgments required by management in the analysis leading to the impairment determination. Projected Benefit Obligations Determination of the projected benefit obligations for our defined benefit pension and postretirement plans are important to the recorded amounts for such obligations on the balance sheet and to the amount of benefit expense in the statement of operations. The actuarial determination of projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements involves judgment about uncertain future events, including estimated retirement dates, salary levels at retirement, mortality rates, lump sum election rates, rates of return on plan assets, future health care cost trend rates, and rates of utilization of health care services by retirees. Due to the specialized nature of these calculations, we engage outside actuarial firms to assist in the determination of these projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements. For Employee Retirement Income Security Act qualified pension plans, the actuary exercises fiduciary care on behalf of plan participants in the determination of the judgmental assumptions used in determining required company contributions into the plan. Due to differing objectives and requirements between financial accounting rules and the pension plan funding regulations promulgated by governmental agencies, the actuarial methods and assumptions for the two purposes differ in certain important respects. Ultimately, we will be required to fund all promised benefits under pension and postretirement benefit plans not funded by plan assets or investment returns, but the judgmental assumptions used in the actuarial calculations significantly affect periodic financial statements and funding patterns over time. Benefit expense is particularly sensitive to the discount rate and return on plan assets assumptions. A 1 percent decrease in the discount rate assumption would increase annual benefit expense by $130 million, while a 1 percent decrease in the return on plan assets assumption would increase annual benefit expense by $70 million. In determining the discount rate, we use yields on high quality fixed income investments matched to the estimated benefit cash flows of our plans. 64 Table of Contents CAUTIONARY STATEMENT FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE SAFE HARBOR PROVISIONS OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995 This report includes forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. You can identify our forward looking statements by the words anticipate, estimate, believe, budget, continue, could, intend, may, plan, potential, predict, seek, should, will, would, expect, objective, projection, forecast, goal, guidance, outlook, effort, target and similar expressions. We based the forward looking statements on our current expectations, estimates and projections about ourselves and the industries in which we operate in general. We caution you these statements are not guarantees of future performance as they involve assumptions that, while made in good faith, may prove to be incorrect, and involve risks and uncertainties we cannot predict. In addition, we based many of these forward looking statements on assumptions about future events that may prove to be inaccurate. Accordingly, our actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what we have expressed or forecast in the forward looking statements. Any differences could result from a variety of factors, including the following: Fluctuations in crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG and natural gas liquids prices, refining and marketing margins and margins for our chemicals business. Potential failures or delays in achieving expected reserve or production levels from existing and future oil and gas development projects due to operating hazards, drilling risks and the inherent uncertainties in predicting reserves and reservoir performance. Unsuccessful exploratory drilling activities or the inability to obtain access to exploratory acreage. Failure of new products and services to achieve market acceptance. Unexpected changes in costs or technical requirements for constructing, modifying or operating facilities for exploration and production, manufacturing, refining or transportation projects. Unexpected technological or commercial difficulties in manufacturing, refining or transporting our products, including chemicals products. Lack of, or disruptions in, adequate and reliable transportation for our crude oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids, bitumen, LNG and refined products. Inability to timely obtain or maintain permits, including those necessary for construction of LNG terminals or regasification facilities, or refinery projects; comply with government regulations; or make capital expenditures required to maintain compliance. Failure to complete definitive agreements and feasibility studies for, and to timely complete construction of, announced and future exploration and production, LNG, refinery and transportation projects. Potential disruption or interruption of our operations due to accidents, extraordinary weather events, civil unrest, political events or terrorism. International monetary conditions and exchange controls. Substantial investment or reduced demand for products as a result of existing or future environmental rules and regulations. Liability for remedial actions, including removal and reclamation obligations, under environmental regulations. Liability resulting from litigation. General domestic and international economic and political developments, including armed hostilities; expropriation of assets; changes in governmental policies relating to crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG, natural gas liquids or refined product pricing, regulation or taxation; other political, economic or diplomatic developments; and international monetary fluctuations. Changes in tax and other laws, regulations (including alternative energy mandates), or royalty rules applicable to our business. Limited access to capital or significantly higher cost of capital related to illiquidity or uncertainty in the domestic or international financial markets. Delays in, or our inability to implement, our asset disposition plan. Inability to obtain economical financing for projects, construction or modification of facilities and general corporate purposes. 65 Table of Contents The operation and financing of our midstream and chemicals joint ventures.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Financial Instrument Market Risk We and certain of our subsidiaries hold and issue derivative contracts and financial instruments that expose our cash flows or earnings to changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates. We may use financial and commodity based derivative contracts to manage the risks produced by changes in the prices of electric power, natural gas, crude oil and related products; fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates; or to capture market opportunities. Our use of derivative instruments is governed by an Authority Limitations document approved by our Board of Directors that prohibits the use of highly leveraged derivatives or derivative instruments without sufficient liquidity for comparable valuations. The Authority Limitations document also establishes the Value at Risk (VaR) limits for the company, and compliance with these limits is monitored daily. The Chief Financial Officer monitors risks resulting from foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates and reports to the Chief Executive Officer. The Senior Vice President of Refining, Marketing and Transportation and Commercial monitors commodity price risk and also reports to the Chief Executive Officer. The Commercial organization manages our commercial marketing, optimizes our commodity flows and positions, and monitors related risks of our upstream and downstream businesses. Commodity Price Risk We operate in the worldwide crude oil, bitumen, refined products, natural gas, natural gas liquids, LNG and electric power markets and are exposed to fluctuations in the prices for these commodities. These fluctuations can affect our revenues, as well as the cost of operating, investing and financing activities. Generally, our policy is to remain exposed to the market prices of commodities. Our Commercial organization uses futures, forwards, swaps and options in various markets to optimize the value of our supply chain, which may move our risk profile away from market average prices to accomplish the following objectives: Balance physical systems. In addition to cash settlement prior to contract expiration, exchange traded futures contracts also may be settled by physical delivery of the commodity, providing another source of supply to meet our refinery requirements or marketing demand. Meet customer needs. Consistent with our policy to generally remain exposed to market prices, we use swap contracts to convert fixed price sales contracts, which are often requested by natural gas and refined product consumers, to a floating market price. Manage the risk to our cash flows from price exposures on specific crude oil, natural gas, refined product and electric power transactions. Enable us to use the market knowledge gained from these activities to capture market opportunities such as moving physical commodities to more profitable locations, storing commodities to capture seasonal or time premiums, and blending commodities to capture quality upgrades. Derivatives may be utilized to optimize these activities. We use a VaR model to estimate the loss in fair value that could potentially result on a single day from the effect of adverse changes in market conditions on the derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments held or issued, including commodity purchase and sales contracts recorded on the balance sheet at December 31, 2010, as derivative instruments. Using Monte Carlo simulation, a 95 percent confidence level and a one day holding period, the VaR for those instruments issued or held for trading purposes at December 31, 2010 and 2009, was immaterial to our cash flows and net income attributable to ConocoPhillips. 66 Table of Contents The VaR for instruments held for purposes other than trading at December 31, 2010 and 2009, was also immaterial to our cash flows and net income attributable to ConocoPhillips. Interest Rate Risk The following table provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in U.S. interest rates. The debt portion of the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates. Weighted average variable rates are based on effective rates at the reporting date. The carrying amount of our floating rate debt approximates its fair value. The fair value of the fixed rate financial instruments is estimated based on quoted market prices. The joint venture acquisition obligation portion of the table presents principal cash flows of the fixed rate 5.3 percent joint venture acquisition obligation owed to FCCL Partnership. The fair value of the obligation is estimated based on the net present value of the future cash flows, discounted at a year end 2010 and 2009 effective yield rate of 2.33 percent and 2.63 percent, respectively, based on yields of U.S. Treasury securities of a similar average duration adjusted for ConocoPhillips average credit risk spread and the amortizing nature of the obligation principal.

These swaps qualify for and are designated as fair value hedges using the short cut method of hedge accounting. The short cut method permits the assumption that changes in the value of the derivative perfectly offset changes in the value of the debt; therefore, no gain or loss has been recognized due to hedge ineffectiveness. 67 Table of Contents The average pay rate is comprised of the LIBOR index rate and the swap spread. The swap spread consists primarily of the difference between the 4.60% fixed receive rate and the fixed rates for similar instruments at the time of execution.

We do not comprehensively hedge the exposure to currency rate changes although we may choose to selectively hedge certain foreign currency exchange rate exposures, such as firm commitments for capital projects or local currency tax payments, dividends and cash returns from net investments in foreign affiliates to be remitted within the coming year. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, we held foreign currency exchange forwards hedging cross border commercial activity and foreign currency exchange swaps hedging short term intercompany loans between European subsidiaries and a U.S. subsidiary. Although these forwards and swaps hedge exposures to fluctuations in exchange rates, we elected not to utilize hedge accounting. As a result, the change in the fair value of these foreign currency exchange derivatives is recorded directly in earnings. Since the gain or loss on the swaps is offset by the gain or loss from remeasuring the intercompany loans into the functional currency of the lender or borrower, and since our aggregate position in the forwards was not material, there would be no material impact to our income from an adverse hypothetical 10 percent change in the December 31, 2010 or 2009, exchange rates. The notional and fair market values of these positions at December 31, 2010 and 2009, were as follows: In Millions Foreign Currency Exchange Derivatives Notional* Fair Market Value** 2010 2009 2010 2009 Sell U.S. dollar, buy euro USD 246 $ (2 ) Sell U.S. dollar, buy British pound USD 4 1,664 (3 ) (16 ) Sell U.S. dollar, buy Canadian dollar USD 562 554 8 34 Sell U.S. dollar, buy Norwegian kroner USD 3 744 (4 ) Sell U.S. dollar, buy Australian dollar USD 3 Sell euro, buy British pound EUR 253 267 1 (14 ) *Denominated in U.S. dollars (USD) and euro (EUR). **Denominated in U.S. dollars.
