The terms earnings and loss as used in Managements Discussion and Analysis refer to net income (loss) attributable to ConocoPhillips. BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW ConocoPhillips is an international, integrated energy company. We are the third largest integrated energy company in the United States, based on market capitalization. We have approximately 29,800 employees worldwide, and at year end 2011 had assets of $153 billion. Our stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol COP. Our business is organized into six operating segments: Exploration and Production (E&P) This segment primarily explores for, produces, transports and markets crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, liquefied natural gas (LNG) and natural gas liquids on a worldwide basis. Midstream This segment gathers, processes and markets natural gas produced by ConocoPhillips and others, and fractionates and markets natural gas liquids, predominantly in the United States and Trinidad. The Midstream segment primarily consists of our 50 percent equity investment in DCP Midstream, LLC. Refining and Marketing (R&M) This segment purchases, refines, markets and transports crude oil and petroleum products, mainly in the United States, Europe and Asia. LUKOIL Investment This segment consists of our past investment in the ordinary shares of OAO LUKOIL, an international, integrated oil and gas company headquartered in Russia. We completed the divestiture of our entire interest in LUKOIL in the first quarter of 2011. Chemicals This segment manufactures and markets petrochemicals and plastics on a worldwide basis. The Chemicals segment consists of our 50 percent equity investment in Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC (CPChem). Emerging Businesses This segment represents our investment in new technologies or businesses outside our normal scope of operations. 39 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Our earnings depend largely on the profitability of our E&P and R&M segments. Crude oil and natural gas prices, along with refining margins, are the most significant factors affecting our profitability. In recent years, the business environment for the energy industry has experienced extreme volatility. As a result, in late 2009, we announced several strategic initiatives designed to improve our financial position and increase returns on capital. We have made significant progress on our three year strategic plan through portfolio optimization, debt reduction and increased shareholder distributions. During 2011, we announced plans to sell an additional $5$10 billion of noncore assets over the next two years, bringing the total asset divestiture program target to $15$20 billion for the years 2010 through 2012. As of year end 2011, we have generated approximately $10.7 billion from asset dispositions, the proceeds of which were primarily targeted toward share repurchases and debt reduction. We also completed the sale of our entire interest in LUKOIL in the first quarter of 2011, which generated total proceeds of $9.5 billion in 2010 and 2011. These proceeds were largely used to fund share repurchases. In December 2011, our Board authorized the additional purchase of up to $10 billion of our common stock over the next two years. This increased the share repurchase program from $15 billion to $25 billion. Since the inception of the share repurchase programs, we have repurchased 15 percent of our shares outstanding for a total of $15 billion. During 2011, we also increased the amount of our quarterly dividend rate by 20 percent, paid dividends on our common stock of $3.6 billion for the full year and reduced our debt by 4 percent. Our total capital program in 2012 is expected to be $15.5 billion, a $1.5 billion increase from $14.0 billion in 2011. We also expect 2012 production to be approximately 1.6 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOED), excluding the impact of any additional asset sales. Consistent with our strategy to focus on value creation for our shareholders, in July 2011, our Board approved pursuing the separation of our refining, marketing and transportation businesses into a stand alone, publicly traded corporation via a tax free distribution. The new downstream company, named Phillips 66, will also include most of our Midstream segment, our Chemicals segment, as well as our power generation and certain technology operations included in our Emerging Businesses segment. We believe the separation will enable each company to pursue a more focused strategy, which will enable the management of each company to concentrate their resources on its particular market segments, customers and core businesses. The separation is subject to market conditions, customary regulatory approvals, the receipt of an affirmative Internal Revenue Service private letter ruling and final Board approval, and is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2012. Upon completion of the separation, ConocoPhillips will be a large and geographically diverse pure play exploration and production company. Our strategy of enhancing returns on capital through developing new resources, growing reserves and production per share, continuing the asset sale program and increasing shareholder distributions will not change. Phillips 66 will be an integrated downstream company, with operations encompassing natural gas gathering and processing, crude oil refining, petroleum products marketing, transportation, power generation and petrochemicals manufacturing and marketing. We believe the execution of our strategic plan will position the two companies to be successful and competitive in the long term. Other important factors that we must continue to manage well in order to sustain our long term competitive position include: Operating our producing properties and refining and marketing operations safely, consistently and in an environmentally sound manner. Safety is our first priority, and we are committed to protecting the health and safety of everyone who has a role in our operations and the communities in which we operate. Optimizing utilization rates at our refineries and minimizing downtime in producing fields enable us to capture the value available in the market in terms of prices and margins. During 2011, our worldwide refining capacity utilization rate was 92 percent, compared with 81 percent in 2010. The increase in 2011 primarily resulted from the removal of the Wilhelmshaven Refinery (WRG) from our refining capacities effective January 1, 2011, and lower turnaround activity, partially offset by higher planned maintenance. 40 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements There has been heightened public focus on the safety of the oil and gas industry as a result of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon incident in the Gulf of Mexico. Safety and environmental stewardship, including the operating integrity of our assets, remain our highest priorities. In 2010, we formed a non profit organization, the Marine Well Containment Company LLC (MWCC), with Exxon Mobil Corporation, Chevron Corporation and Royal Dutch Shell plc, to develop a new oil spill containment system and improve industry spill response in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. To complement this work internationally, in 2011, we and several leading oil and gas companies established the Subsea Well Response Project in Norway, and we participated in the Oil Spill Prevention and Response Advisory Group in the United Kingdom. Adding to our proved reserve base. We primarily add to our proved reserve base in three ways: o Successful exploration and development of new fields. o Acquisition of existing fields. o Application of new technologies and processes to improve recovery from existing fields. Through a combination of the methods listed above, we have been successful in the past in maintaining or adding to our production and proved reserve base, and we anticipate being able to do so in the future. In the five years ended December 31, 2011, our reserve replacement was 102 percent, excluding LUKOIL and the impact of acquisitions, dispositions and expropriations. Access to additional resources has become increasingly difficult as direct investment is prohibited in some nations, while fiscal and other terms in other countries can make projects uneconomic or unattractive. In addition, political instability, competition from national oil companies, and lack of access to high potential areas due to environmental or other regulation may negatively impact our ability to increase our reserve base. As such, the timing and level at which we add to our reserve base may, or may not, allow us to replace our production over subsequent years. Controlling costs and expenses. Since we cannot control the prices of the commodity products we sell, controlling operating and overhead costs, within the context of our commitment to safety and environmental stewardship, is a high priority. We monitor these costs using various methodologies that are reported to senior management monthly, on both an absolute dollar basis and a per unit basis. Because managing operating and overhead costs is critical to maintaining competitive positions in our industries, cost control is a component of our variable compensation programs. Operating and overhead costs increased 1 percent in 2011, compared with 2010. Selecting the appropriate projects in which to invest our capital dollars. We participate in capital intensive industries. As a result, we must often invest significant capital dollars to explore for new oil and gas fields, develop newly discovered fields, maintain existing fields, construct pipelines and LNG facilities, or continue to maintain and improve our refinery complexes. We invest in projects that are expected to provide an adequate financial return on invested dollars. However, there are often long lead times from the time we make an investment to the time the investment is operational and begins generating financial returns. The capital expenditures and investments portion of our capital program totaled $13.3 billion in 2011, and we anticipate capital expenditures and investments to be approximately $14.8 billion in 2012. The increase reflects our strategic emphasis on delivering value by investing in the most profitable opportunities. We expect competitive returns from increased investments in unconventional resource projects, such as our oil sands business in Canada, liquids rich shale plays in the U.S. Lower 48 and the Australia Pacific LNG (APLNG) joint venture. As our production profile adjusts over time to reflect our increased levels of investment in liquids plays and lower levels in North American conventional natural gas, we expect higher returns in E&P, absent changes in market factors. Managing our asset portfolio. We continually evaluate our assets to determine whether they fit our strategic plans or should be sold or otherwise disposed. As part of our $15$20 billion asset divestiture program for 20102012, during 2010, we sold our 9.03 percent interest in the Syncrude oil 41 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements sands mining operation; our 50 percent interest in CFJ Properties, a joint venture which owned and operated Flying J branded truck and travel plazas; and several E&P properties located in the Lower 48 and western Canada. In 2011, we continued to divest low return, noncore assets in the Lower 48 and western Canada. We also sold WRG, Seaway Products Pipeline Company, and our equity interests in Colonial Pipeline Company and Seaway Crude Pipeline Company. Additionally, we completed the divestiture of our entire interest in LUKOIL in the first quarter of 2011. East Coast refining has been under severe market pressure for several years. As a result, in September 2011, we announced our intention to sell the Trainer Refinery located in Trainer, Pennsylvania. The refinery has been idled and will permanently close by the end of the first quarter of 2012 if a sales transaction is unsuccessful. In addition, in E&P we recently entered into agreements to sell our Vietnam business, as well as certain North Sea assets. These sales are expected to close in the first half of 2012. Developing and retaining a talented work force. We strive to attract, train, develop and retain individuals with the knowledge and skills to implement our business strategy and who support our values and ethics. Throughout the company, we focus on the continued learning, development and technical training of our employees. Professional new hires participate in structured development programs designed to accelerate their technical and functional skills. Other significant factors that can affect our profitability include: Commodity prices. In 2011, the global economic rate of growth slowed, leading to lower oil demand growth. Oil prices, however, increased in 2011, as supply concerns, including concerns over the loss of Libyan production, outweighed the economic uncertainty in the United States and Europe. U.S. natural gas prices remained under pressure during 2011, as increased production from shale plays outpaced demand growth. As a result, storage inventory levels reached record highs by the end of 2011. We expect these factors will continue to moderate natural gas prices, resulting in limited U.S. LNG imports in the near to mid term. In recent years, the use of hydraulic fracturing in shale natural gas formations has led to increased industry actual and forecasted natural gas production in the United States. Although providing short and long term significant growth opportunities for our company, the increased abundance of natural gas due to development of shale plays could also have adverse financial implications to us, including: an extended period of low natural gas prices; production curtailments on properties that produce primarily natural gas; cancelation or delay of plans to develop Alaska North Slope and Canadian Arctic natural gas fields; and underutilization of LNG regasification facilities and certain natural gas pipelines. Should one or more of these events occur, our revenues would be reduced and additional impairments might be possible. Impairments. As mentioned above, we participate in capital intensive industries. At times, our investments become impaired when, for example, our reserve estimates are revised downward, commodity prices or refining margins decline significantly for long periods of time, or a decision to dispose of an asset leads to a write down to its fair market value. We may also invest large amounts of money in exploration which, if exploratory drilling proves unsuccessful, could lead to a material impairment of leasehold values. Before tax impairments in 2011 totaled $1.3 billion and primarily resulted from the impairments of the Trainer Refinery, our equity investment in Naraynmarneftegaz (NMNG) and certain Canadian natural gas properties. Before tax impairments in 2010 totaled $2.4 billion and primarily related to the $1.5 billion property impairment of WRG and the $0.6 billion impairment of our equity investment in NMNG. Effective tax rate. Our operations are located in countries with different tax rates and fiscal structures. Accordingly, even in a stable commodity price and fiscal/regulatory environment, our overall effective tax rate can vary significantly between periods based on the mix of pretax earnings within our global operations. 42 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Fiscal and regulatory environment. Our operations, primarily in E&P, can be affected by changing economic, regulatory and political environments in the various countries in which we operate, including the United States. Civil unrest or strained relationships with governments may impact our operations or investments. These changing environments have generally negatively impacted our results of operations, and further changes to government fiscal take could have a negative impact on future operations. Our production operations in Libya and related oil exports were temporarily suspended in 2011 during Libyas period of civil unrest. Our assets in Venezuela and Ecuador were expropriated in 2007 and 2009, respectively. In Canada, the Alberta provincial government changed the royalty structure in 2009 to tie a component of the new rate to prevailing prices. Our management carefully considers these events when evaluating projects or determining the level of activity in such countries. Segment Analysis Earnings for the E&P segment are generally closely aligned with industry price levels for crude oil and natural gas. These are commodity products, the prices of which are subject to factors external to our company and over which we have no control. Industry crude oil prices for West Texas Intermediate (WTI) were higher in 2011, compared with 2010, averaging $95.05 per barrel in 2011, an increase of 20 percent. Industry natural gas prices at Henry Hub decreased 8 percent during 2011 to an average price of $4.04 per million British thermal units. The Midstream segments results are most closely linked to natural gas liquids prices. The most important factor affecting the profitability of this segment is the results from our 50 percent equity investment in DCP Midstream. DCP Midstreams natural gas liquids prices increased 23 percent in 2011. Refining margins, refinery capacity utilization and cost control primarily drive the R&M segments results. Refining margins are subject to movements in the cost of crude oil and other feedstocks and the sales prices for refined products, both of which are subject to market factors over which we have no control. Global refining margins significantly improved during 2011, compared with 2010. The U.S. 3:2:1 crack spread, which is primarily WTI based, increased 126 percent in 2011, while the N.W. Europe benchmark increased 20 percent. The improvement in domestic refining margins primarily resulted from increased production from shale plays and high inventory levels in the Midcontinent area, causing WTI to trade at a deeper discount relative to waterborne crudes for most of 2011. This discount, however, began to narrow toward the end of 2011. During the periods of large WTI Brent spreads, refineries capable of processing WTI and crude oils that are WTI based benefitted from the lower regional feedstock prices. In contrast, East Coast refining, which relies primarily on Brent based crudes, has been under severe market pressure. Product imports, weakness in motor fuel demand, and costly regulatory requirements are key challenges in this difficult environment. The LUKOIL Investment segment consisted of our prior investment in the ordinary shares of LUKOIL. We disposed of our remaining interest in LUKOIL in the first quarter of 2011. The Chemicals segment consists of our 50 percent interest in CPChem. The chemicals and plastics industry is mainly a commodity based industry where the margins for key products are based on market factors over which CPChem has little or no control. CPChem is investing in feedstock advantaged areas in the Middle East with access to large, growing markets, such as Asia. The Emerging Businesses segment represents our investment in new technologies or businesses outside our normal scope of operations. Activities within this segment are currently focused on power generation and innovation of new technologies, such as those related to conventional and nonconventional hydrocarbon recovery, refining, alternative energy, biofuels and the environment. Some of these technologies have the potential to become important drivers of profitability in future years. Our key performance indicators are shown in the statistical tables provided at the beginning of the operating segment sections that follow. These include commodity prices, production and refining capacity utilization. 43 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Consolidated Results A summary of the companys net income attributable to ConocoPhillips by business segment follows: Millions of Dollars Years Ended December 31 2011 2010 2009 E&P $ 8,242 9,198 3,604 Midstream 458 306 313 R&M 3,751 192 37 LUKOIL Investment 239 2,503 1,219 Chemicals 745 498 248 Emerging Businesses (26 ) (59 ) 3 Corporate and Other (973 ) (1,280 ) (1,010 ) Net income attributable to ConocoPhillips $ 12,436 11,358 4,414 2011 vs. 2010 Earnings for ConocoPhillips increased 9 percent in 2011. The improvement was mainly due to: Higher commodity prices in our E&P segment. Commodity price benefits were somewhat offset by increased production taxes. Improved results from our R&M operations, reflecting significantly higher U.S. refining margins. Lower impairments. In 2011, impairments totaled $1,004 million after tax, compared with 2010 impairments of $1,928 million after tax. These items were partially offset by: Lower gains from asset sales. In 2011, gains from asset dispositions and LUKOIL share sales were $1,637 million after tax, compared with 2010 gains of $4,583 million after tax. The absence of equity earnings from LUKOIL due to the divestiture of our interest. Lower production volumes from our E&P segment. 2010 vs. 2009 The improved results in 2010 were primarily the result of: Higher prices for crude oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids (NGL) and LNG in our E&P segment. Commodity price benefits were somewhat offset by increased production taxes. Gains of $4,583 million after tax from asset dispositions and LUKOIL share sales. Improved results from our domestic R&M operations, reflecting higher refining margins. These items were partially offset by: Impairments totaling $1,928 million after tax. Lower production volumes from our E&P segment. 44 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Income Statement Analysis 2011 vs. 2010 Sales and other operating revenues increased 29 percent in 2011, while purchased crude oil, natural gas and products increased 37 percent. The increases were mainly due to significantly higher prices for petroleum products, crude oil and NGLs. Equity in earnings of affiliates increased 30 percent in 2011. The increase primarily resulted from: Earnings from Qatar Liquefied Gas Company Limited (3) (QG3), primarily due to sales of LNG following production startup, which occurred in October 2010. Improved earnings from WRB Refining LP, primarily due to higher refining margins. Improved earnings from CPChem, mainly due to higher margins in the olefins and polyolefins business line. Lower impairments from NMNG. In 2011, equity earnings included a $395 million impairment of our equity investment, and 2010 equity earnings included a $645 million impairment. Improved earnings from FCCL Partnership, mostly due to higher commodity prices and volumes. Improved earnings from DCP Midstream, LLC, mainly as a result of higher NGL prices. These increases were partially offset by the absence of equity earnings from LUKOIL due to the divestiture of our interest. Gain on dispositions decreased 65 percent in 2011. Gains in 2011 primarily resulted from the disposition of Seaway Products Pipeline Company, our interests in Seaway Crude Pipeline Company and Colonial Pipeline Company, certain E&P assets located in the Lower 48 and Canada, and the remaining divestiture of our LUKOIL shares. These gains were partially offset by the loss on dilution of our equity interest in APLNG from 50 percent to 42.5 percent and the loss on disposition of WRG. Gains in 2010 primarily reflected the $2,878 million gain realized from the sale of our interest in Syncrude, the $1,749 million gain on the divestiture of our LUKOIL shares, gains on the disposition of certain E&P assets located in the Lower 48 and Canada, and the gain on sale of our 50 percent interest in CFJ Properties. For additional information, see Note 5 Assets Held for Sale or Sold and Note 6 Investments, Loans and Long Term Receivables, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) decreased 12 percent in 2011. The decrease was mostly associated with our E&P segment, reflecting lower production volumes and lower unit of production rates related to reserve bookings in 2011. Impairments decreased 56 percent in 2011, primarily due to the $1,514 million impairment of WRG in 2010. This decrease was partially offset by the impairment of the Trainer Refinery and various North American E&P natural gas properties in 2011. For additional information, see Note 10 Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Taxes other than income taxes increased 9 percent in 2011, primarily due to higher production taxes as a result of higher crude oil prices and higher excise taxes on petroleum product sales. Interest and debt expense decreased 18 percent in 2011, primarily due to lower debt levels. See Note 20 Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for information regarding our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate. 45 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements 2010 vs. 2009 Sales and other operating revenues increased 27 percent in 2010, while purchased crude oil, natural gas and products increased 33 percent. These increases were primarily due to higher prices for petroleum products, crude oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids and LNG. Equity in earnings of affiliates increased 24 percent in 2010. The increase primarily resulted from: Improved earnings from CPChem primarily due to higher margins in the olefins and polyolefins business line. Improved earnings from FCCL Partnership due to higher commodity prices and volumes. Improved earnings from Merey Sweeny, L.P. (MSLP) as a result of improved margins and volumes. These increases were partially offset by a $645 million impairment of our equity investment in NMNG. Gain on dispositions increased $5,643 million in 2010. The increase was primarily due to the $2,878 million gain realized from the Syncrude sale, the $1,749 million gain on the divestiture of our LUKOIL shares, gains on the disposition of certain E&P assets located in the Lower 48 and Canada, and the gain on sale of our 50 percent interest in CFJ Properties. Impairments increased $1,245 million in 2010, primarily as a result of the 2010 WRG impairment. Taxes other than income taxes increased 8 percent during 2010, primarily due to higher production taxes as a result of higher crude oil prices and higher excise taxes on petroleum product sales. Interest and debt expense decreased 8 percent during 2010, primarily due to lower debt levels. See Note 20 Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for information regarding our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate. 46 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Segment Results E&P 2011 2010 2009 Millions of Dollars Net Income (Loss) Attributable to ConocoPhillips Alaska $ 1,983 1,735 1,540 Lower 48 1,271 1,033 (37 ) United States 3,254 2,768 1,503 International 4,988 6,430 2,101 $ 8,242 9,198 3,604 Dollars Per Unit Average Sales Prices Crude oil and natural gas liquids (per barrel) United States $ 91.77 69.73 53.21 International 102.68 74.95 57.40 Total consolidated operations 97.12 72.63 55.47 Equity affiliates 98.60 74.81 58.23 Total E&P 97.22 72.77 55.63 Bitumen (per barrel) International 55.16 51.10 39.67 Equity affiliates 63.93 53.43 45.69 Total E&P 62.56 53.06 44.84 Natural gas (per thousand cubic feet) United States 4.01 4.27 3.50 International 6.73 5.60 5.06 Total consolidated operations 5.64 5.07 4.40 Equity affiliates 2.89 2.79 2.35 Total E&P 5.34 4.98 4.37 Average Production Costs Per Barrel of Oil Equivalent United States $ 9.70 8.30 7.73 International 9.70 7.96 7.72 Total consolidated operations 9.70 8.10 7.73 Equity affiliates 7.85 8.11 7.68 Total E&P 9.48 8.10 7.72 Millions of Dollars Worldwide Exploration Expenses General and administrative; geological and geophysical; and lease rentals $ 596 678 576 Leasehold impairment 161 241 247 Dry holes 309 236 359 $ 1,066 1,155 1,182 47 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements 2011 2010 2009 Thousands of Barrels Daily Operating Statistics Crude oil and natural gas liquids produced Alaska 215 230 252 Lower 48 168 160 166 United States 383 390 418 Canada 38 38 40 Europe 175 211 241 Asia Pacific/Middle East 111 140 132 Africa 40 79 78 Other areas 4 Total consolidated operations 747 858 913 Equity affiliates Russia 29 52 55 Asia Pacific/Middle East 23 3 799 913 968 Synthetic oil produced Consolidated operations Canada 12 23 Bitumen produced Consolidated operations Canada 10 10 7 Equity affiliates Canada 57 49 43 67 59 50 Millions of Cubic Feet Daily Natural gas produced* Alaska 61 82 94 Lower 48 1,556 1,695 1,927 United States 1,617 1,777 2,021 Canada 928 984 1,062 Europe 626 815 876 Asia Pacific/Middle East 695 712 713 Africa 158 149 121 Total consolidated operations 4,024 4,437 4,793 Equity affiliates Asia Pacific/Middle East 492 169 84 4,516 4,606 4,877 *Represents quantities available for sale. Excludes gas equivalent of natural gas liquids included above. The E&P segment primarily explores for, produces, transports and markets crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG and natural gas liquids on a worldwide basis. At December 31, 2011, our E&P operations were producing in the United States, Norway, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, offshore Timor Leste in the Timor Sea, Indonesia, China, Vietnam, Libya, Nigeria, Algeria, Qatar and Russia. Total E&P production averaged 1,619,000 BOED in 2011, compared with 1,752,000 BOED in 2010. 48 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements 2011 vs. 2010 Earnings from our E&P segment were $8,242 million in 2011, a 10 percent decrease compared with earnings of $9,198 million in 2010. See the Business Environment and Executive Overview section for additional information on industry crude oil and natural gas prices. U.S. E&P U.S. E&P earnings were $3,254 million in 2011, an 18 percent increase compared with earnings of $2,768 million in 2010. The increase primarily resulted from higher crude oil and NGL prices, and, to a lesser extent, lower DD&A. These increases were partially offset by higher production taxes, mainly in Alaska, lower sales volumes, higher operating expenses and lower gains from asset sales in the Lower 48. U.S. E&P production averaged 653,000 BOED in 2011, a decrease of 5 percent from 686,000 BOED in 2010. The decrease was primarily due to field decline and asset dispositions, which was partially offset by new production, mostly from the Lower 48. International E&P International E&P earnings were $4,988 million in 2011, a 22 percent decrease compared with earnings of $6,430 million in 2010. Earnings in 2011 included $316 million in additional income tax expense, as a result of legislation enacted in the United Kingdom in July 2011. This additional tax expense consisted of $106 million for the revaluation of deferred tax liabilities and $210 million to reflect the higher tax rates from the effective date of the legislation, March 24, 2011, through December 31, 2011. In 2011, earnings also included impairments of our investment in NMNG and various natural gas properties located in Canada, in addition to a $279 million loss on the dilution of our equity interest in APLNG from 50 percent to 42.5 percent. Earnings in 2010 included gains from the sale of Syncrude and certain Canadian properties and an impairment of NMNG. Excluding the impact from these items, earnings increased in 2011, primarily due to higher prices, a full year of LNG sales from QG3 and lower DD&A. These increases to earnings were partially offset by lower volumes and higher taxes. International E&P production averaged 966,000 BOED in 2011, a decrease of 9 percent from 1,066,000 BOED in 2010. The decrease primarily resulted from suspended operations in Libya and in Bohai Bay, China, asset dispositions and unplanned downtime. Normal field decline was largely offset by new production. 2010 vs. 2009 Earnings from our E&P segment were $9,198 million in 2010, compared with earnings of $3,604 million in 2009. U.S. E&P U.S. E&P earnings increased 84 percent in 2010, from $1,503 million in 2009 to $2,768 million in 2010. The increase was primarily the result of higher prices for crude oil, natural gas and NGLs. Earnings also benefitted from higher gains from asset sales in our Lower 48 portfolio and lower DD&A. These increases were partially offset by lower crude oil and natural gas volumes, higher production taxes, primarily in Alaska, and an unfavorable tax ruling. U.S. E&P production averaged 686,000 BOED in 2010, a decrease of 9 percent from 755,000 BOED in 2009. The decrease was primarily due to field decline and unplanned downtime, which was somewhat offset by new production. 49 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements International E&P International E&P earnings were $6,430 million in 2010, compared with $2,101 million in 2009. The increase in 2010 was mostly due to gains from the sale of Syncrude and other assets and higher crude oil, natural gas and LNG prices. These increases were partially offset by the NMNG impairment, lower synthetic oil and natural gas volumes, higher petroleum taxes as a result of higher prices and an $81 million after tax charge to exploration expenses for project costs resulting from our decision to end participation in the Shah Gas Field Project in Abu Dhabi. International E&P production averaged 1,066,000 BOED in 2010, a decrease of 3 percent from 1,099,000 BOED in 2009. The decrease was largely due to field decline, the impact of higher prices on production sharing arrangements and the sale of Syncrude. These decreases were partially offset by production from major projects, primarily in China, Canada, Qatar and Australia.

The Midstream segment purchases raw natural gas from producers and gathers natural gas through an extensive network of pipeline gathering systems. The natural gas is then processed to extract NGLs from the raw gas stream. The remaining residue gas is marketed to electrical utilities, industrial users, and gas marketing companies. Most of the NGLs are fractionated separated into individual components like ethane, butane and propane and marketed as chemical feedstock, fuel or refinery blendstock. The Midstream segment consists of our 50 percent equity investment in DCP Midstream, as well as our other natural gas gathering and processing operations, and NGL fractionation, trading and marketing businesses, primarily in the United States and Trinidad. 2011 vs. 2010 Earnings from the Midstream segment increased 50 percent in 2011, reflecting higher equity earnings from DCP Midstream and improved results from our other Midstream operations. Both DCP Midstream and our equity affiliate in Trinidad benefited from significantly higher NGL prices, which generally tracked the improved crude oil price environment in 2011. Also benefiting 2011 earnings were higher fees received for NGL fractionation services, reflecting favorably renegotiated contracts. These items were partially offset by higher costs at DCP Midstream, primarily due to higher maintenance and repair costs and increased DD&A. 50 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements 2010 vs. 2009 Midstream earnings decreased 2 percent in 2010. Higher NGL prices and, to a lesser extent, improved volumes from our equity affiliate in Trinidad, were more than offset by the absence of the 2009 recognition of an $88 million after tax benefit, which resulted from a DCP Midstream subsidiary converting subordinated units to common units. In addition, higher operating expenses contributed to the decrease in earnings.

R&M has operations mainly in the United States, Europe and Asia. 2011 vs. 2010 R&M reported earnings of $3,751 million in 2011, compared with earnings of $192 million in 2010. See the Business Environment and Executive Overview section for additional information on industry refining margins. U.S. R&M Earnings from U.S. R&M were $3,595 million in 2011, compared with earnings of $1,022 million in 2010. The increase in earnings primarily resulted from significantly higher refining margins and gains from asset sales. In 2011, gains from asset sales of $1,577 million after tax mainly resulted from the sales of Seaway Products Pipeline Company and our equity investments in Seaway Crude Pipeline Company and Colonial Pipeline Company, while 2010 included the $113 million after tax gain on sale of our 50 percent interest in CFJ Properties. These increases were partially offset by the $303 million after tax impairment and warehouse inventory write down associated with our Trainer Refinery in 2011. Our U.S. refining crude oil capacity utilization rate was 91 percent in 2011, compared with 90 percent in 2010. The increase mainly resulted from lower turnaround activity, partially offset by higher planned and unplanned downtime. International R&M International R&M reported earnings of $156 million in 2011, compared with a loss of $830 million in 2010. The increase in earnings was mostly due to the absence of the 2010 WRG impairment, in addition to higher refining volumes and foreign currency gains in 2011. These increases were partially offset by lower refining margins and the $86 million after tax loss on sale of WRG and related warehouse inventory write downs in 2011. Our international refining crude oil capacity utilization rate was 96 percent in 2011, compared with 56 percent in 2010. The increase primarily resulted from the removal of WRG from our refining capacities effective January 1, 2011, and lower turnaround activity. 2010 vs. 2009 R&M reported earnings of $192 million in 2010, compared with earnings of $37 million in 2009. U.S. R&M Earnings from U.S. R&M were $1,022 million in 2010, compared with a loss of $192 million in 2009. The increase in 2010 primarily resulted from significantly higher refining margins and the gain on sale of CFJ. Higher refining and marketing volumes also contributed to the improvement in earnings. Our U.S. refining crude oil capacity utilization rate was 90 percent in 2010, compared with 87 percent in 2009. The increase in 2010 was largely due to lower turnaround activity, lower run reductions due to market conditions, and less unplanned downtime. International R&M International R&M reported a loss of $830 million in 2010, compared with earnings of $229 million in 2009. The loss in 2010 mainly resulted from the WRG impairment and a $29 million after tax impairment resulting from our decision to end participation in the Yanbu Refinery Project. Excluding these impairments, earnings were improved due to higher refining margins, partially offset by foreign currency losses. Our international refining crude oil capacity utilization rate was 56 percent in 2010, compared with 74 percent in 2009. The 2010 rate primarily reflected run reductions at WRG in response to market conditions. 52 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements LUKOIL Investment $00,0000 $00,0000 $00,0000 Millions of Dollars 2011 2010 2009 Net Income Attributable to ConocoPhillips $ 239 2,503 1,219 Operating Statistics Crude oil production (thousands of barrels daily) 284 388 Natural gas production (millions of cubic feet daily) 254 295 Refinery crude oil processed (thousands of barrels daily) 189 240 This segment represents our former investment in the ordinary shares of OAO LUKOIL, an international, integrated oil and gas company headquartered in Russia. We sold our remaining interest in LUKOIL in the first quarter of 2011. 2011 vs. 2010 Earnings in 2011 primarily represented the realized gain on remaining share sales. Earnings in 2010 primarily reflected earnings from the equity investment in LUKOIL we held at the time, in addition to gains on the partial sale of our LUKOIL investment. 2010 vs. 2009 LUKOIL segment earnings increased $1,284 million in 2010, which primarily resulted from the $1,251 million after tax gain on our LUKOIL shares sold during 2010.

CPChem uses natural gas liquids and other feedstocks to produce petrochemicals. These products are then marketed and sold, or used as feedstocks, to produce plastics and commodity chemicals. 2011 vs. 2010 Earnings from the Chemicals segment increased 50 percent in 2011, primarily due to higher margins, volumes and equity earnings in the olefins and polyolefins business line. The specialties, aromatics and styrenics business line also contributed to the increase in earnings due to higher margins. 2010 vs. 2009 Earnings from the Chemicals segment increased $250 million in 2010, primarily due to substantially higher margins in the olefins and polyolefins business line and, to a lesser extent, improved margins from the specialties, aromatics and styrenics business line. Higher operating costs partially offset these increases. 53 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Emerging Businesses $00,0000 $00,0000 $00,0000 Millions of Dollars 2011 2010 2009 Net Income (Loss) Attributable to ConocoPhillips Power $ 115 49 105 Other (141 ) (108 ) (102 ) $ (26 ) (59 ) 3 The Emerging Businesses segment represents our investment in new technologies or businesses outside our normal scope of operations. Activities within this segment are currently focused on power generation and innovation of new technologies, such as those related to conventional and nonconventional hydrocarbon recovery, refining, alternative energy, biofuels, and the environment. 2011 vs. 2010 The Emerging Businesses segment reported a loss of $26 million in 2011, compared with a loss of $59 million in 2010. The increase in Power earnings was primarily due to the absence of 2010 impairment charges related to a U.S. cogeneration plant, which was sold in December 2010, combined with higher international power generation results. Higher technology development expenses contributed to the increase in Other losses in 2011. 2010 vs. 2009 The Emerging Businesses segment reported a loss of $59 million in 2010, compared with earnings of $3 million in 2009. The decrease in Power earnings was mainly due to higher operating costs and lower margins in international power generation, in addition to the impairment charges and loss on sale of the U.S. cogeneration plant. Higher technology development expenses contributed to the increase in Other losses in 2010.

Net interest decreased 31 percent in 2011, mostly due to lower interest expense, which resulted from lower debt levels; the absence of a $114 million after tax premium on early debt retirement, which occurred in 2010; and slightly higher interest income. Separation costs consist of expenses incurred for the planned separation of our downstream businesses into a stand alone, publicly traded company, Phillips 66. Expenses incurred in 2011 primarily included legal, accounting and information systems costs. 54 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The category Other includes certain foreign currency transaction gains and losses, environmental costs associated with sites no longer in operation, and other costs not directly associated with an operating segment. Changes in the Other category primarily resulted from foreign currency transaction gains and lower environmental costs, partially offset by a $20 million after tax property impairment. 2010 vs. 2009 Net interest increased 13 percent in 2010, mostly due to the $114 million after tax premium on early debt retirement and a lower effective tax rate. These increases were partially offset by lower interest expense due to lower debt levels. Corporate general and administrative expenses increased $101 million in 2010, primarily as a result of costs related to compensation and benefit plans. Changes in the Other category primarily reflected foreign currency transaction losses. 55 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Financial Indicators Millions of DollarsExcept as Indicated 2011 2010 2009 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 19,646 17,045 12,479 Short term debt 1,013 936 1,728 Total debt 22,623 23,592 28,653 Total equity 65,734 69,109 62,613 Percent of total debt to capital* 26 % 25 31 Percent of floating rate debt to total debt** 10 % 10 9 *Capital includes total debt and total equity. **Includes effect of interest rate swaps. To meet our short and long term liquidity requirements, we look to a variety of funding sources. Cash generated from operating activities is the primary source of funding. In addition, during 2011, we received $4,820 million in proceeds from asset sales. During 2011, the primary uses of our available cash were $13,266 million to support our ongoing capital expenditures and investments program; $11,123 million to repurchase common stock; $3,632 million to pay dividends on our common stock; and $961 million to repay debt. During 2011, cash and cash equivalents decreased by $3,674 million to $5,780 million. In addition to cash flows from operating activities and proceeds from asset sales, we rely on our commercial paper and credit facility programs and our shelf registration statement to support our short and long term liquidity requirements. We believe current cash and short term investment balances and cash generated by operations, together with access to external sources of funds as described below in the Significant Sources of Capital section, will be sufficient to meet our funding requirements in the near and long term, including our capital spending program, dividend payments, required debt payments and the funding requirements to FCCL. Significant Sources of Capital Operating Activities During 2011, cash of $19,646 million was provided by operating activities, a 15 percent increase from cash from operations of $17,045 million in 2010. The increase was primarily due to higher commodity prices in our E&P segment and higher U.S. refining margins in our R&M segment. During 2010, cash flow from operations increased $4,566 million, compared with 2009. The increase was primarily due to significantly higher crude oil prices in our E&P segment and higher refining margins in our R&M segment. While the stability of our cash flows from operating activities benefits from geographic diversity, our short and long term operating cash flows are highly dependent upon prices for crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG and natural gas liquids, as well as refining and marketing margins. Crude oil prices increased in 2009, 2010 and 2011, although natural gas prices remained weak. Global refining margins were under pressure during 2009 and 2010. Domestic refining margins significantly improved during the first three quarters of 2011, followed by a sharp decline in the fourth quarter of 2011. Prices and margins in our industry are typically volatile, and are driven by market conditions over which we have no control. Absent other mitigating factors, as these prices and margins fluctuate, we would expect a corresponding change in our operating cash flows. 56 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The level of our production volumes of crude oil, bitumen, natural gas and natural gas liquids also impacts our cash flows. These production levels are impacted by such factors as acquisitions and dispositions of fields, field production decline rates, new technologies, operating efficiency, weather conditions, the addition of proved reserves through exploratory success and their timely and cost effective development. While we actively manage these factors, production levels can cause variability in cash flows, although historically this variability has not been as significant as that caused by commodity prices. Our E&P production for 2011 averaged 1.62 million BOED. Future production is subject to numerous uncertainties, including, among others, the volatile crude oil and natural gas price environment, which may impact project investment decisions; the effects of price changes on production sharing and variable royalty contracts; timing of project startups and major turnarounds; and weather related disruptions. Our production in 2012, excluding the impact of any additional dispositions, is expected to be approximately 1.6 million BOED. We continue to evaluate various properties as potential candidates for our disposition program. The makeup and timing of our disposition program will also impact 2012 and future years production levels. To maintain or grow our production volumes, we must continue to add to our proved reserve base. Our total reserve replacement in 2011 was 112 percent, including 117 percent from consolidated operations. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and dispositions, the reserve replacement was 120 percent of 2011 production. Over the five year period ended December 31, 2011, our reserve replacement was 30 percent (including 64 percent from consolidated operations) reflecting the disposition of our interest in LUKOIL, the expropriation of our assets in Venezuela and the impact of our asset disposition program. Excluding these items and acquisitions, our five year reserve replacement was 102 percent. The total reserve replacement amount above is based on the sum of our net additions (revisions, improved recovery, purchases, extensions and discoveries, and sales) divided by our production, as shown in our reserve table disclosures. For additional information about our proved reserves, including both developed and undeveloped reserves, see the Oil and Gas Operations section of this report. We are developing and pursuing projects we anticipate will allow us to add to our reserve base. However, access to additional resources has become increasingly difficult as direct investment is prohibited in some nations, while fiscal and other terms in other countries can make projects uneconomic or unattractive. In addition, political instability, competition from national oil companies, and lack of access to high potential areas due to environmental or other regulation may negatively impact our ability to increase our reserve base. As such, the timing and level at which we add to our reserve base may, or may not, allow us to replace our production over subsequent years. As discussed in the Critical Accounting Estimates section, engineering estimates of proved reserves are imprecise; therefore, each year reserves may be revised upward or downward due to the impact of changes in commodity prices or as more technical data becomes available on reservoirs. In 2011, 2010 and 2009, revisions increased reserves. It is not possible to reliably predict how revisions will impact reserve quantities in the future. In our R&M segment, the level and quality of output from our refineries impacts our cash flows. The output at our refineries is impacted by such factors as operating efficiency, maintenance turnarounds, market conditions, feedstock availability and weather conditions. We actively manage the operations of our refineries, and typically, any variability in their operations has not been as significant to cash flows as that caused by refining margins. Asset Sales Proceeds from asset sales in 2011 were $4.8 billion, compared with $15.4 billion in 2010. The 2011 proceeds from asset sales included $2.0 billion from the sale of our ownership interests in Colonial Pipeline Company and Seaway Crude Pipeline Company and $1.2 billion from the sale of our remaining interest in LUKOIL. Other asset sales primarily included mature North American natural gas assets and a products pipeline. We plan to raise an additional $5 billion to $10 billion from asset sales in 2012. 57 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Commercial Paper and Credit Facilities In August 2011, we increased our revolving credit facilities from $7.85 billion to $8.0 billion by replacing our $7.35 billion revolving credit facility with a $7.5 billion facility expiring in August 2016. The terms of the new revolving credit facility are similar to the terms of the replaced facility. We also have a $500 million facility expiring in July 2012. Our revolving credit facilities may be used as direct bank borrowings, as support for issuances of letters of credit totaling up to $750 million, or as support for our commercial paper programs. The revolving credit facilities are broadly syndicated among financial institutions and do not contain any material adverse change provisions or any covenants requiring maintenance of specified financial ratios or ratings. The facility agreements contain a cross default provision relating to the failure to pay principal or interest on other debt obligations of $200 million or more by ConocoPhillips, or by any of its consolidated subsidiaries. Credit facility borrowings may bear interest at a margin above rates offered by certain designated banks in the London interbank market or at a margin above the overnight federal funds rate or prime rates offered by certain designated banks in the United States. The agreements call for commitment fees on available, but unused, amounts. The agreements also contain early termination rights if our current directors or their approved successors cease to be a majority of the Board of Directors. Our primary funding source for short term working capital needs is the ConocoPhillips $6.35 billion commercial paper program. Commercial paper maturities are generally limited to 90 days. We also have the ConocoPhillips Qatar Funding Ltd. $1.5 billion commercial paper program, which is used to fund commitments relating to the QG3 Project. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, we had no direct borrowings under the revolving credit facilities, but $40 million in letters of credit had been issued at both periods. In addition, under the two ConocoPhillips commercial paper programs, $1,128 million of commercial paper was outstanding at December 31, 2011, compared with $1,182 million at December 31, 2010. Since we had $1,128 million of commercial paper outstanding and had issued $40 million of letters of credit, we had access to $6.8 billion in borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facilities at December 31, 2011. Our senior long term debt is rated A1 by Moodys Investors Service and A by both Standard and Poors Rating Service and by Fitch. We do not have any ratings triggers on any of our corporate debt that would cause an automatic default, and thereby impact our access to liquidity, in the event of a downgrade of our credit rating. If our credit rating were to deteriorate to a level prohibiting us from accessing the commercial paper market, we would still be able to access funds under our $7.5 billion and $500 million revolving credit facilities. Shelf Registration We have a universal shelf registration statement on file with the SEC under which we, as a well known seasoned issuer, have the ability to issue and sell an indeterminate amount of various types of debt and equity securities. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As part of our normal ongoing business operations and consistent with normal industry practice, we enter into numerous agreements with other parties to pursue business opportunities, which share costs and apportion risks among the parties as governed by the agreements. We own a 30 percent interest in QG3, an integrated project to produce and liquefy natural gas from Qatars North Field. The other participants in the project are affiliates of Qatar Petroleum (68.5 percent) and Mitsui & Co., Ltd. (1.5 percent). Our interest is held through a jointly owned company, Qatar Liquefied Gas Company Limited (3), for which we use the equity method of accounting. QG3 secured project financing of $4 billion in 2005, consisting of $1.3 billion of loans from export credit agencies (ECA), $1.5 billion from commercial banks, and $1.2 billion from ConocoPhillips. The ConocoPhillips loan facilities have substantially the same terms as the ECA and commercial bank facilities. On December 15, 2011, QG3 achieved financial completion and all project loan facilities became nonrecourse to the project participants. At December 31, 2011, QG3 had approximately $3.9 billion outstanding under all the loan facilities, including $1.2 billion owed to ConocoPhillips. 58 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements For additional information about guarantees, see Note 14 Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which is incorporated herein by reference. Capital Requirements Our debt balance at December 31, 2011, was $22.6 billion, a decrease of $1.0 billion during 2011, and our debt to capital ratio was 26 percent at year end 2011, versus 25 percent at the end of 2010. The slight increase in the debt to capital ratio was due to a decrease in total equity resulting from the share repurchase programs in 2011, partially offset by the debt reduction. Our debt to capital ratio target range is 20 to 25 percent. In 2007, we closed on a business venture with Cenovus Energy Inc. As part of this transaction, we are obligated to contribute $7.5 billion, plus accrued interest, over a 10 year period that began in 2007, to the upstream business venture, FCCL, formed as a result of the transaction. Quarterly principal and interest payments of $237 million began in the second quarter of 2007, and will continue until the balance is paid. Of the principal obligation amount, approximately $732 million was short term and was included in the Accounts payable related parties line on our December 31, 2011, consolidated balance sheet. The principal portion of these payments, which totaled $695 million in 2011, is included in the Other line in the financing activities section of our consolidated statement of cash flows. Interest accrues at a fixed annual rate of 5.3 percent on the unpaid principal balance. Fifty percent of the quarterly interest payment is reflected as a capital contribution and is included in the Capital expenditures and investments line on our consolidated statement of cash flows. During 2011, WRB Refining LP repaid $550 million of loan financing to ConocoPhillips that had been provided to assist WRB in meeting its operating and capital spending requirements. No outstanding balance remained at December 31, 2011. In February 2012, we announced a dividend of 66 cents per share. The dividend is payable March 1, 2012, to stockholders of record at the close of business February 21, 2012. On March 24, 2010, our Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to $5 billion of our common stock through 2011. Repurchase of shares under this authorization was completed in the first quarter of 2011. On February 11, 2011, the Board authorized the additional purchase of up to $10 billion of our common stock over the subsequent two years. Repurchase of shares under this authorization was completed in the fourth quarter of 2011. Under both programs, repurchases totaled 220 million shares at a cost of $15 billion through December 31, 2011. On December 2, 2011, our Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to an additional $10 billion of our common stock over the subsequent two years. 59 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our aggregate contractual fixed and variable obligations as of December 31, 2011: Millions of Dollars Payments Due by Period Total Up to 1Year Years 2 3 Years 4 5 After 5 Years Debt obligations (a) $ 22,592 1,005 2,799 3,933 14,855 Capital lease obligations 31 8 3 2 18 Total debt 22,623 1,013 2,802 3,935 14,873 Interest on debt and other obligations 19,798 1,319 2,567 2,227 13,685 Operating lease obligations 2,761 767 901 502 591 Purchase obligations (b) 145,114 60,105 13,142 8,101 63,766 Joint venture acquisition obligation (c) 4,314 732 1,586 1,762 234 Other long term liabilities (d) Asset retirement obligations 8,920 387 668 505 7,360 Accrued environmental costs 922 126 147 97 552 Unrecognized tax benefits (e) 153 153 (e) (e ) (e ) Total $ 204,605 64,602 21,813 17,129 101,061 (a) Includes $449 million of net unamortized premiums and discounts.

(b) Represents any agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding and that specifies all significant terms. Does not include purchase commitments for jointly owned fields and facilities where we are not the operator. The majority of the purchase obligations are market based contracts, including exchanges and futures, for the purchase of products such as crude oil, unfractionated natural gas liquids, natural gas and power. The products are mostly used to supply our refineries and fractionators, optimize the supply chain, and resell to customers. Product purchase commitments with third parties totaled $71,737 million. In addition, $50,741 million are product purchases from CPChem, mostly for natural gas and natural gas liquids over the remaining term of 88 years, and Excel Paralubes, for base oil over the remaining initial term of 14 years. Purchase obligations of $17,044 million are related to agreements to access and utilize the capacity of third party equipment and facilities, including pipelines and LNG and product terminals, to transport, process, treat and store products. The remainder is primarily our net share of purchase commitments for materials and services for jointly owned fields and facilities where we are the operator. (c) Represents the remaining amount of contributions, excluding interest, due over a six year period to the FCCL upstream joint venture with Cenovus. (d) Does not include: Pensions for the 2012 through 2016 time period, we expect to contribute an average of $490 million per year to our qualified and nonqualified pension and postretirement benefit plans in the United States and an average of $250 million per year to our non U.S. plans, which are expected to be in excess of required minimums in many cases. The U.S. five year average consists of $690 million for 2012 and then approximately $445 million per year for the remaining four years. Our required minimum funding in 2012 is expected to be $530 million in the United States and $220 million outside the United States. 60 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements (e) Excludes unrecognized tax benefits of $918 million because the ultimate disposition and timing of any payments to be made with regard to such amounts are not reasonably estimable. Although unrecognized tax benefits are not a contractual obligation, they are presented in this table because they represent potential demands on our liquidity.

For information on proved undeveloped reserves and the associated costs to develop these reserves, see the Oil and Gas Operations section. 62 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements R&M Capital spending for R&M during the three year period ended December 31, 2011, was primarily for air emission reduction and clean fuels projects to meet new environmental standards, refinery upgrade projects to improve product yields and increase heavy crude oil processing capability, improving the operating integrity of key processing units, as well as for safety projects. During this three year period, R&M capital spending was $3.8 billion, which represented 11 percent of our total capital expenditures and investments. Key projects during the three year period included: Installation of a 20,000 barrel per day hydrocracker at the Rodeo facility of our San Francisco Refinery. Installation of a 225 ton per day sulfur plant at the Sweeny Refinery. Installation of facilities to reduce emissions from the Fluid Catalytic Crackers at the Alliance and Sweeny refineries. Installation of facilities to reduce nitrous oxide emissions from the crude furnace and installation of a new vacuum furnace at the Bayway Refinery. Completion of gasoline benzene reduction projects at the Alliance and Ponca City refineries. Major construction activities in progress include: Installation, revamp and expansion of equipment at the Bayway Refinery to enable production of low benzene gasoline. U.S. programs aimed at air emission reductions. 2012 CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND INVESTMENTS BUDGET R&Ms 2012 capital expenditures and investments budget is $1.2 billion, a 21 percent increase from actual spending in 2011, with about $1.0 billion targeted in the United States and $0.2 billion internationally. These funds will be used primarily for projects related to sustaining and improving the existing business with a focus on safety, regulatory compliance, efficiency and reliability. Emerging Businesses Capital spending for Emerging Businesses during the three year period ended December 31, 2011, was primarily for an expansion and other capital improvements at the Immingham combined heat and power cogeneration plant near our Humber Refinery in the United Kingdom. Contingencies A number of lawsuits involving a variety of claims have been made against ConocoPhillips that arise in the ordinary course of business. We also may be required to remove or mitigate the effects on the environment of the placement, storage, disposal or release of certain chemical, mineral and petroleum substances at various active and inactive sites. We regularly assess the need for accounting recognition or disclosure of these contingencies. In the case of all known contingencies (other than those related to income taxes), we accrue a liability when the loss is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable. If a range of amounts can be reasonably estimated and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, then the minimum of the range is accrued. We do not reduce these liabilities for potential insurance or third party recoveries. If applicable, we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third party recoveries. In the case of income tax related contingencies, we use a cumulative probability weighted loss accrual in cases where sustaining a tax position is less than certain. Based on currently available information, we believe it is remote that future costs related to known contingent liability exposures will exceed current accruals by an amount that would have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements. As we learn new facts concerning contingencies, we reassess our position both with respect to accrued liabilities and other potential exposures. Estimates particularly sensitive to future changes include contingent liabilities recorded for environmental remediation, tax and legal matters. Estimated future environmental remediation costs are subject to change due to such factors as the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs, the unknown time and extent of such remedial actions that may be required, and 63 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other responsible parties. Estimated future costs related to tax and legal matters are subject to change as events evolve and as additional information becomes available during the administrative and litigation processes. Legal and Tax Matters Our legal organization applies its knowledge, experience and professional judgment to the specific characteristics of our cases, employing a litigation management process to manage and monitor the legal proceedings against us. Our process facilitates the early evaluation and quantification of potential exposures in individual cases. This process also enables us to track those cases that have been scheduled for trial and or mediation. Based on professional judgment and experience in using these litigation management tools and available information about current developments in all our cases, our legal organization regularly assesses the adequacy of current accruals and determines if adjustment of existing accruals, or establishment of new accruals, are required. See Note 20 Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information about income tax related contingencies. Environmental We are subject to the same numerous international, federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations as other companies in our industry. The most significant of these environmental laws and regulations include, among others, the: U.S. Federal Clean Air Act, which governs air emissions. U.S. Federal Clean Water Act, which governs discharges to water bodies. European Union Regulation for Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH). U.S. Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), which imposes liability on generators, transporters and arrangers of hazardous substances at sites where hazardous substance releases have occurred or are threatening to occur. U.S. Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), which governs the treatment, storage and disposal of solid waste. U.S. Federal Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA90), under which owners and operators of onshore facilities and pipelines, lessees or permittees of an area in which an offshore facility is located, and owners and operators of vessels are liable for removal costs and damages that result from a discharge of oil into navigable waters of the United States. U.S. Federal Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act (EPCRA), which requires facilities to report toxic chemical inventories with local emergency planning committees and response departments. U.S. Federal Safe Drinking Water Act, which governs the disposal of wastewater in underground injection wells. U.S. Department of the Interior regulations, which relate to offshore oil and gas operations in U.S. waters and impose liability for the cost of pollution cleanup resulting from operations, as well as potential liability for pollution damages. European Union Trading Directive resulting in European Emissions Trading Scheme. These laws and their implementing regulations set limits on emissions and, in the case of discharges to water, establish water quality limits. They also, in most cases, require permits in association with new or modified operations. These permits can require an applicant to collect substantial information in connection with the application process, which can be expensive and time consuming. In addition, there can be delays associated with notice and comment periods and the agencys processing of the application. Many of the delays associated with the permitting process are beyond the control of the applicant. 64 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Many states and foreign countries where we operate also have, or are developing, similar environmental laws and regulations governing these same types of activities. While similar, in some cases these regulations may impose additional, or more stringent, requirements that can add to the cost and difficulty of marketing or transporting products across state and international borders. The ultimate financial impact arising from environmental laws and regulations is neither clearly known nor easily determinable as new standards, such as air emission standards, water quality standards and stricter fuel regulations, continue to evolve. However, environmental laws and regulations, including those that may arise to address concerns about global climate change, are expected to continue to have an increasing impact on our operations in the United States and in other countries in which we operate. Notable areas of potential impacts include air emission compliance and remediation obligations in the United States. An example in the fuels area is the Energy Policy Act of 2005, which imposed obligations to provide increasing volumes of renewable fuels in transportation motor fuels through 2012. These obligations were changed with the enactment of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. The 2007 law requires fuel producers and importers to provide additional renewable fuels for transportation motor fuels that include a mix of various types to be included through 2022. We have met the increased requirements to date while establishing implementation, operating and capital strategies, along with advanced technology development, to address projected future requirements. Another example is the use of hydraulic fracturing, an essential completion technique that facilitates production of oil and natural gas that is otherwise trapped in lower permeability rock formations. A range of local, state, federal or national laws and regulations currently govern hydraulic fracturing operations. Although hydraulic fracturing has been conducted for many decades, a number of new laws, regulations and permitting requirements are under consideration by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Department of the Interior, and others which could result in increased costs, operating restrictions, operational delays and or limit the ability to develop oil and natural gas resources. Governmental restrictions on hydraulic fracturing could impact the overall profitability or viability of certain of our oil and natural gas investments. We have adopted operating principles that incorporate established industry standards designed to meet or exceed government requirements. Our practices continually evolve as technology improves and regulations change. We also are subject to certain laws and regulations relating to environmental remediation obligations associated with current and past operations. Such laws and regulations include CERCLA and RCRA and their state equivalents. Remediation obligations include cleanup responsibility arising from petroleum releases from underground storage tanks located at numerous past and present ConocoPhillips owned and or operated petroleum marketing outlets throughout the United States. Federal and state laws require contamination caused by such underground storage tank releases be assessed and remediated to meet applicable standards. In addition to other cleanup standards, many states adopted cleanup criteria for methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) for both soil and groundwater. At RCRA permitted facilities, we are required to assess environmental conditions. If conditions warrant, we may be required to remediate contamination caused by prior operations. In contrast to CERCLA, which is often referred to as Superfund, the cost of corrective action activities under RCRA corrective action programs typically is borne solely by us. We anticipate increased expenditures for RCRA remediation activities may be required, but such annual expenditures for the near term are not expected to vary significantly from the range of such expenditures we have experienced over the past few years. Longer term expenditures are subject to considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly. We occasionally receive requests for information or notices of potential liability from the EPA and state environmental agencies alleging that we are a potentially responsible party under CERCLA or an equivalent state statute. On occasion, we also have been made a party to cost recovery litigation by those agencies or by private parties. These requests, notices and lawsuits assert potential liability for remediation costs at various sites that typically are not owned by us, but allegedly contain wastes attributable to our past operations. As of December 31, 2010, we reported we had been notified of potential liability under CERCLA and comparable state laws at 73 sites around the United States. At December 31, 2011, we had been notified of 8 new sites, settled 5 sites and closed 2 sites, bringing the number to 74 unresolved sites with potential liability. 65 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements For most Superfund sites, our potential liability will be significantly less than the total site remediation costs because the percentage of waste attributable to us, versus that attributable to all other potentially responsible parties, is relatively low. Although liability of those potentially responsible is generally joint and several for federal sites and frequently so for state sites, other potentially responsible parties at sites where we are a party typically have had the financial strength to meet their obligations, and where they have not, or where potentially responsible parties could not be located, our share of liability has not increased materially. Many of the sites at which we are potentially responsible are still under investigation by the EPA or the state agencies concerned. Prior to actual cleanup, those potentially responsible normally assess site conditions, apportion responsibility and determine the appropriate remediation. In some instances, we may have no liability or attain a settlement of liability. Actual cleanup costs generally occur after the parties obtain EPA or equivalent state agency approval. There are relatively few sites where we are a major participant, and given the timing and amounts of anticipated expenditures, neither the cost of remediation at those sites nor such costs at all CERCLA sites, in the aggregate, is expected to have a material adverse effect on our competitive or financial condition. Expensed environmental costs were $1,039 million in 2011 and are expected to be about $1,100 million per year in 2012 and 2013. Capitalized environmental costs were $573 million in 2011 and are expected to be about $875 million per year in 2012 and 2013. Accrued liabilities for remediation activities are not reduced for potential recoveries from insurers or other third parties and are not discounted (except those assumed in a purchase business combination, which we do record on a discounted basis). Many of these liabilities result from CERCLA, RCRA and similar state laws that require us to undertake certain investigative and remedial activities at sites where we conduct, or once conducted, operations or at sites where ConocoPhillips generated waste was disposed. The accrual also includes a number of sites we identified that may require environmental remediation, but which are not currently the subject of CERCLA, RCRA or state enforcement activities. If applicable, we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third party recoveries. In the future, we may incur significant costs under both CERCLA and RCRA. Remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site, depending on the mix of unique site characteristics, evolving remediation technologies, diverse regulatory agencies and enforcement policies, and the presence or absence of potentially liable third parties. Therefore, it is difficult to develop reasonable estimates of future site remediation costs. At December 31, 2011, our balance sheet included total accrued environmental costs of $922 million, compared with $994 million at December 31, 2010. We expect to incur a substantial amount of these expenditures within the next 30 years. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, and as with other companies engaged in similar businesses, environmental costs and liabilities are inherent concerns in our operations and products, and there can be no assurance that material costs and liabilities will not be incurred. However, we currently do not expect any material adverse effect upon our results of operations or financial position as a result of compliance with current environmental laws and regulations. Climate Change There has been a broad range of proposed or promulgated state, national and international laws focusing on greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction. These proposed or promulgated laws apply or could apply in countries where we have interests or may have interests in the future. Laws in this field continue to evolve, and while it is not possible to accurately estimate either a timetable for implementation or our future compliance costs relating to implementation, such laws, if enacted, could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition. Examples of legislation or precursors for possible regulation that do or could affect our operations include: European Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS), the program through which many of the European Union (EU) member states are implementing the Kyoto Protocol. 66 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Californias Global Warming Solutions Act, which requires the California Air Resources Board to develop regulations and market mechanisms that will target reduction of Californias GHG emissions by 25 percent by 2020. Two regulations issued by the Alberta government in 2007 under the Climate Change and Emissions Act. These regulations require any existing facility with emissions equal to or greater than 100,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide or equivalent per year to reduce the net emissions intensity of that facility by 2 percent per year beginning July 1, 2007, with an ultimate reduction target of 12 percent of baseline emissions. The U.S. Supreme Court decision in Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. 497, 127 S.Ct. 1438 (2007), confirming that the EPA has the authority to regulate carbon dioxide as an air pollutant under the Federal Clean Air Act. The EPAs announcement on March 29, 2010 (published as Interpretation of Regulations that Determine Pollutants Covered by Clean Air Act Permitting Programs, 75 Fed. Reg. 17004 (April 2, 2010)), and the EPAs and U.S. Department of Transportations joint promulgation of a Final Rule on April 1, 2010, that triggers regulation of GHGs under the Clean Air Act, may trigger more climate based claims for damages, and may result in longer agency review time for development projects. Carbon taxes in certain jurisdictions. Cap and trade programs in certain jurisdictions, including the Australian Clean Energy Legislation which is scheduled to take effect July 2012. In the EU, we have assets that are subject to the ETS. The first phase of the EU ETS was completed at the end of 2007, with EU ETS Phase II running from 2008 through 2012. The European Commission has approved most of the Phase II national allocation plans. We are actively engaged to minimize any financial impact from the trading scheme. In the United States, some additional form of regulation may be forthcoming in the future at the federal and state levels with respect to GHG emissions. Such regulation could take any of several forms that may result in the creation of additional costs in the form of taxes, the restriction of output, investments of capital to maintain compliance with laws and regulations, or required acquisition or trading of emission allowances. We are working to continuously improve operational and energy efficiency through resource and energy conservation throughout our operations. Compliance with changes in laws and regulations that create a GHG emission trading scheme or GHG reduction policies could significantly increase our costs, reduce demand for fossil energy derived products, impact the cost and availability of capital and increase our exposure to litigation. Such laws and regulations could also increase demand for less carbon intensive energy sources, including natural gas. The ultimate impact on our financial performance, either positive or negative, will depend on a number of factors, including but not limited to: Whether and to what extent legislation is enacted. The nature of the legislation (such as a cap and trade system or a tax on emissions). The GHG reductions required. The price and availability of offsets. The amount and allocation of allowances. Technological and scientific developments leading to new products or services. Any potential significant physical effects of climate change (such as increased severe weather events, changes in sea levels and changes in temperature). Whether, and the extent to which, increased compliance costs are ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services. Other We have deferred tax assets related to certain accrued liabilities, loss carryforwards and credit carryforwards. Valuation allowances have been established to reduce these deferred tax assets to an amount that will, more likely than not, be realized. Based on our historical taxable income, our expectations for the future, and available tax planning strategies, management expects that the net deferred tax assets will be realized as offsets to reversing deferred tax liabilities and as reductions in future taxable income. 67 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to select appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. See Note 1 Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for descriptions of our major accounting policies. Certain of these accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent there is a reasonable likelihood materially different amounts would have been reported under different conditions, or if different assumptions had been used. These critical accounting estimates are discussed with the Audit and Finance Committee of the Board of Directors at least annually. We believe the following discussions of critical accounting estimates, along with the discussions of contingencies and of deferred tax asset valuation allowances in this report, address all important accounting areas where the nature of accounting estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change. Oil and Gas Accounting Accounting for oil and gas exploratory activity is subject to special accounting rules unique to the oil and gas industry. The acquisition of geological and geophysical seismic information, prior to the discovery of proved reserves, is expensed as incurred, similar to accounting for research and development costs. However, leasehold acquisition costs and exploratory well costs are capitalized on the balance sheet pending determination of whether proved oil and gas reserves have been discovered on the prospect. Property Acquisition Costs For individually significant leaseholds, management periodically assesses for impairment based on exploration and drilling efforts to date. For leasehold acquisition costs that individually are relatively small, management exercises judgment and determines a percentage probability that the prospect ultimately will fail to find proved oil and gas reserves and pools that leasehold information with others in the geographic area. For prospects in areas that have had limited, or no, previous exploratory drilling, the percentage probability of ultimate failure is normally judged to be quite high. This judgmental percentage is multiplied by the leasehold acquisition cost, and that product is divided by the contractual period of the leasehold to determine a periodic leasehold impairment charge that is reported in exploration expense. This judgmental probability percentage is reassessed and adjusted throughout the contractual period of the leasehold based on favorable or unfavorable exploratory activity on the leasehold or on adjacent leaseholds, and leasehold impairment amortization expense is adjusted prospectively. At year end 2011, the book value of the pools of property acquisition costs that individually are relatively small and thus subject to the above described periodic leasehold impairment calculation was $1,880 million and the accumulated impairment reserve was $487 million. The weighted average judgmental percentage probability of ultimate failure was approximately 47 percent, and the weighted average amortization period was approximately four years. If that judgmental percentage were to be raised by 5 percent across all calculations, pretax leasehold impairment expense in 2012 would increase by approximately $22 million. The remaining $5,966 million of gross capitalized unproved property costs at year end 2011 consisted of individually significant leaseholds, mineral rights held in perpetuity by title ownership, exploratory wells currently drilling, suspended exploratory wells, and capitalized interest. Management periodically assesses individually significant leaseholds for impairment based on the results of exploration and drilling efforts and the outlook for project commercialization. Of this amount, approximately $3.0 billion is concentrated in 10 major development areas. One of these major assets totaling $97 million is expected to move to proved properties in 2012. Exploratory Costs For exploratory wells, drilling costs are temporarily capitalized, or suspended, on the balance sheet, pending a determination of whether potentially economic oil and gas reserves have been discovered by the drilling effort to justify completion of the find as a producing well. If exploratory wells encounter potentially economic quantities of oil and gas, the well costs remain capitalized on the balance sheet as long as sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made. The accounting notion of sufficient progress is a judgmental area, but 68 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements the accounting rules do prohibit continued capitalization of suspended well costs on the mere chance that future market conditions will improve or new technologies will be found that would make the projects development economically profitable. Often, the ability to move the project into the development phase and record proved reserves is dependent on obtaining permits and government or co venturer approvals, the timing of which is ultimately beyond our control. Exploratory well costs remain suspended as long as we are actively pursuing such approvals and permits, and believe they will be obtained. Once all required approvals and permits have been obtained, the projects are moved into the development phase, and the oil and gas reserves are designated as proved reserves. For complex exploratory discoveries, it is not unusual to have exploratory wells remain suspended on the balance sheet for several years while we perform additional appraisal drilling and seismic work on the potential oil and gas field or while we seek government or co venturer approval of development plans or seek environmental permitting. Once a determination is made the well did not encounter potentially economic oil and gas quantities, the well costs are expensed as a dry hole and reported in exploration expense. Management reviews suspended well balances quarterly, continuously monitors the results of the additional appraisal drilling and seismic work, and expenses the suspended well costs as a dry hole when it determines the potential field does not warrant further investment in the near term. Criteria utilized in making this determination include evaluation of the reservoir characteristics and hydrocarbon properties, expected development costs, ability to apply existing technology to produce the reserves, fiscal terms, regulations or contract negotiations, and our required return on investment. At year end 2011, total suspended well costs were $1,037 million, compared with $1,013 million at year end 2010. For additional information on suspended wells, including an aging analysis, see Note 8 Suspended Wells, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Proved Reserves Engineering estimates of the quantities of proved reserves are inherently imprecise and represent only approximate amounts because of the judgments involved in developing such information. Reserve estimates are based on geological and engineering assessments of in place hydrocarbon volumes, the production plan, historical extraction recovery and processing yield factors, installed plant operating capacity and approved operating limits. The reliability of these estimates at any point in time depends on both the quality and quantity of the technical and economic data and the efficiency of extracting and processing the hydrocarbons. Despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates, accounting rules require disclosure of proved reserve estimates due to the importance of these estimates to better understand the perceived value and future cash flows of a companys E&P operations. There are several authoritative guidelines regarding the engineering criteria that must be met before estimated reserves can be designated as proved. Our reservoir engineering organization has policies and procedures in place consistent with these authoritative guidelines. We have trained and experienced internal engineering personnel who estimate our proved reserves held by consolidated companies, as well as our share of equity affiliates. Proved reserve estimates are adjusted annually in the fourth quarter and during the year if significant changes occur, and take into account recent production and subsurface information about each field. Also, as required by current authoritative guidelines, the estimated future date when a field will be permanently shut down for economic reasons is based on 12 month average prices and year end costs. This estimated date when production will end affects the amount of estimated reserves. Therefore, as prices and cost levels change from year to year, the estimate of proved reserves also changes. Our proved reserves include estimated quantities related to production sharing contracts, which are reported under the economic interest method and are subject to fluctuations in commodity prices; recoverable operating expenses; and capital costs. If costs remain stable, reserve quantities attributable to recovery of costs will change inversely to changes in commodity prices. For example, if prices increase, then our applicable reserve quantities would decline. The estimation of proved developed reserves also is important to the income statement because the proved developed reserve estimate for a field serves as the denominator in the unit of production calculation of DD&A of the capitalized costs for that asset. At year end 2011, the net book value of productive E&P properties, plants and equipment (PP&E) subject to a unit of production calculation was approximately $57 billion and the DD&A 69 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements recorded on these assets in 2011 was approximately $6.6 billion. The estimated proved developed reserves for our consolidated operations were 5.2 billion BOE at the end of 2010 and 5.1 billion BOE at the end of 2011. If the estimates of proved reserves used in the unit of production calculations had been lower by 5 percent across all calculations, pretax DD&A in 2011 would have increased by an estimated $347 million. Impairments Long lived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in future cash flows expected to be generated by an asset group and annually in the fourth quarter following updates to corporate planning assumptions. If, upon review, the sum of the undiscounted pretax cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset group, the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value. Individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes based on a judgmental assessment of the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets generally on a field by field basis for exploration and production assets, or at an entire complex level for downstream assets. Because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for long lived assets, the fair value of impaired assets is typically determined based on the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants, or based on a multiple of operating cash flow validated with historical market transactions of similar assets where possible. The expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are based on judgmental assessments of future production volumes, commodity prices, operating costs, refining margins and capital project decisions, considering all available information at the date of review. See Note 10 Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. Investments in nonconsolidated entities accounted for under the equity method are reviewed for impairment when there is evidence of a loss in value and annually following updates to corporate planning assumptions. Such evidence of a loss in value might include our inability to recover the carrying amount, the lack of sustained earnings capacity which would justify the current investment amount, or a current fair value less than the investments carrying amount. When it is determined such a loss in value is other than temporary, an impairment charge is recognized for the difference between the investments carrying value and its estimated fair value. When determining whether a decline in value is other than temporary, management considers factors such as the length of time and extent of the decline, the investees financial condition and near term prospects, and our ability and intention to retain our investment for a period that will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the market value of the investment. When quoted market prices are not available, the fair value is usually based on the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants, plus market analysis of comparable assets owned by the investee, if appropriate. Differing assumptions could affect the timing and the amount of an impairment of an investment in any period. Asset Retirement Obligations and Environmental Costs Under various contracts, permits and regulations, we have material legal obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore the land or seabed at the end of operations at operational sites. Our largest asset removal obligations involve plugging and abandonment of wells, removal and disposal of offshore oil and gas platforms around the world, oil and gas production facilities and pipelines in Alaska, and asbestos abatement at refineries. The fair values of obligations for dismantling and removing these facilities are accrued into PP&E at the installation of the asset based on estimated discounted costs. Estimating the future asset removal costs necessary for this accounting calculation is difficult. Most of these removal obligations are many years, or decades, in the future and the contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what removal practices and criteria must be met when the removal event actually occurs. Asset removal technologies and costs, regulatory and other compliance considerations, expenditure timing, and other inputs into valuation of the obligation, including discount and inflation rates, are also subject to change. Normally, changes in asset removal obligations are reflected in the income statement as increases or decreases to DD&A over the remaining life of the assets. However, for assets at or nearing the end of their operations, as well as previously sold assets for which we retained the asset removal obligation, an increase in the asset 70 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements removal obligation can result in an immediate charge to earnings, because any increase in PP&E due to the increased obligation would immediately be subject to impairment, due to the low fair value of these properties. In addition to asset removal obligations, under the above or similar contracts, permits and regulations, we have certain obligations to complete environmental related projects. These projects are primarily related to cleanup at domestic refineries and remediation activities required by Canada and the state of Alaska at exploration and production sites. Future environmental remediation costs are difficult to estimate because they are subject to change due to such factors as the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs, the unknown time and extent of such remedial actions that may be required, and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other responsible parties. Business Acquisitions Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed Accounting for the acquisition of a business requires the recognition of the consideration paid, as well as the various assets and liabilities of the acquired business. For most assets and liabilities, the asset or liability is recorded at its estimated fair value. The most difficult estimates of individual fair values are those involving PP&E and identifiable intangible assets. We use all available information to make these fair value determinations. We have, if necessary, up to one year after the acquisition closing date to finalize these fair value determinations. Intangible Assets and Goodwill At December 31, 2011, we had $701 million of intangible assets determined to have indefinite useful lives, thus they are not amortized. This judgmental assessment of an indefinite useful life must be continuously evaluated in the future. If, due to changes in facts and circumstances, management determines these intangible assets have definite useful lives, amortization will have to commence at that time on a prospective basis. As long as these intangible assets are judged to have indefinite lives, they will be subject to periodic lower of cost or market tests that require managements judgment of the estimated fair value of these intangible assets. At December 31, 2011, we had $3,332 million of goodwill on our balance sheet, all of which was attributable to the Worldwide R&M reporting unit. See Note 9 Goodwill and Intangibles, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information on intangibles and goodwill. Projected Benefit Obligations Determination of the projected benefit obligations for our defined benefit pension and postretirement plans are important to the recorded amounts for such obligations on the balance sheet and to the amount of benefit expense in the income statement. The actuarial determination of projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements involves judgment about uncertain future events, including estimated retirement dates, salary levels at retirement, mortality rates, lump sum election rates, rates of return on plan assets, future health care cost trend rates, and rates of utilization of health care services by retirees. Due to the specialized nature of these calculations, we engage outside actuarial firms to assist in the determination of these projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements. For Employee Retirement Income Security Act qualified pension plans, the actuary exercises fiduciary care on behalf of plan participants in the determination of the judgmental assumptions used in determining required company contributions into the plan. Due to differing objectives and requirements between financial accounting rules and the pension plan funding regulations promulgated by governmental agencies, the actuarial methods and assumptions for the two purposes differ in certain important respects. Ultimately, we will be required to fund all promised benefits under pension and postretirement benefit plans not funded by plan assets or investment returns, but the judgmental assumptions used in the actuarial calculations significantly affect periodic financial statements and funding patterns over time. Benefit expense is particularly sensitive to the discount rate and return on plan assets assumptions. A 1 percent decrease in the discount rate assumption would increase annual benefit expense by $130 million, while a 1 percent decrease in the return on plan assets assumption would increase annual benefit expense by $70 million. In determining the discount rate, we use yields on high quality fixed income investments matched to the estimated benefit cash flows of our plans. 71 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements OUTLOOK Planned Separation of Downstream Businesses On July 14, 2011, we announced approval by our Board of Directors to pursue the separation of our refining, marketing and transportation businesses into a stand alone, publicly traded corporation via a tax free distribution. The new downstream company, named Phillips 66, will be headquartered in Houston, Texas. In addition to the refining, marketing and transportation businesses, we expect Phillips 66 will also include most of our Midstream segment, our Chemicals segment, as well as our power generation and certain technology operations included in our Emerging Businesses segment, to create an integrated downstream company. The separation is to be accomplished by the pro rata distribution of one share of Phillips 66 stock for every two shares of ConocoPhillips stock held by ConocoPhillips shareholders on the record date for the share distribution. In October 2011, we requested a private letter ruling from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, which is expected to confirm the distribution will qualify as a tax free reorganization for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In addition, we filed the initial Phillips 66 Form 10 registration statement with the SEC on November 14, 2011, and an amendment on January 3, 2012. The separation is subject to market conditions, customary regulatory approvals, the receipt of an affirmative Internal Revenue Service private letter ruling and final Board approval, and is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2012. As part of the separation, we expect to receive a cash distribution from Phillips 66. These funds will primarily be used to repay debt, with the balance directed to share repurchases and dividends. In conjunction with the separation, we expect to incur one time legal, information technology, audit, advisor, and deferred and cash tax costs, resulting in an estimated pre separation earnings impact of approximately $150 million after tax, of which $25 million was incurred in 2011. China Bohai Bay On July 13, 2011, the State Oceanic Administration (SOA) in the Peoples Republic of China instructed us to suspend production from the Peng Lai 19 3 Field Platforms B and C, as a result of two separate seepage incidents which occurred near the platforms. On September 2, 2011, the SOA ordered us to halt operations at the Peng Lai 19 3 Field, pending additional cleanup efforts and reservoir depressurization activities to ensure any residual seepage had stopped. The incidents resulted in a total release of approximately 700 barrels of oil into Bohai Bay and approximately 2,600 barrels of mineral oil based drilling mud onto the seafloor. The mineral oil based drilling mud was recovered and cleaned up from the seafloor. The sources of the seeps have been sealed and containment devices deployed as a preventative measure to capture any residue. The SOA also required implementation of preventative measures to avoid recurrence, in addition to the filing of an updated environmental impact assessment and development plan for approval. A revised development plan was submitted to Chinas National Development and Reform Commission in November 2011 and is currently under review. A revised environmental impact assessment was submitted to the SOA in February 2012. The approved depressurization plan, combined with limited development and field optimization, reduced 2011 average daily net production from the field by 14,000 barrels of oil per day, compared to 2010 production levels. Future impacts on our business are not known at this time. In January 2012, we and the China National Offshore Oil Corp. (CNOOC) announced an agreement with Chinas Ministry of Agriculture to resolve fishery related issues in connection with the seepage incidents. Under this agreement, approximately $160 million will be paid as compensation to settle private claims of potentially affected fishermen in relevant Bohai Bay communities, and public claims for alleged fishery damage. We hold a 49 percent ownership interest in the Peng Lai fields. The agreement fulfills the objectives of the compensation fund we announced in September 2011. As part of this agreement, we have also designated approximately $16 million of our previously announced environmental fund to be used to improve fishery resources and for related projects. 72 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements CAUTIONARY STATEMENT FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE SAFE HARBOR PROVISIONS OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995 This report includes forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

Inability to timely obtain or maintain permits, including those necessary for drilling and or development projects, construction of LNG terminals or regasification facilities, or refinery projects; comply with government regulations; or make capital expenditures required to maintain compliance. Failure to complete definitive agreements and feasibility studies for, and to timely complete construction of, announced and future exploration and production, LNG, refinery and transportation projects. Potential disruption or interruption of our operations due to accidents, extraordinary weather events, civil unrest, political events, terrorism or cyber attacks. International monetary conditions and exchange controls. Substantial investment or reduced demand for products as a result of existing or future environmental rules and regulations. Liability for remedial actions, including removal and reclamation obligations, under environmental regulations. Liability resulting from litigation. General domestic and international economic and political developments, including armed hostilities; expropriation of assets; changes in governmental policies relating to crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG, natural gas liquids or refined product pricing, regulation or taxation; other political, economic or diplomatic developments; and international monetary fluctuations. Changes in tax and other laws, regulations (including alternative energy mandates), or royalty rules applicable to our business. Limited access to capital or significantly higher cost of capital related to illiquidity or uncertainty in the domestic or international financial markets.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Financial Instrument Market Risk We and certain of our subsidiaries hold and issue derivative contracts and financial instruments that expose our cash flows or earnings to changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates. We may use financial and commodity based derivative contracts to manage the risks produced by changes in the prices of electric power, natural gas, crude oil and related products; fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates; or to capture market opportunities. Our use of derivative instruments is governed by an Authority Limitations document approved by our Board of Directors that prohibits the use of highly leveraged derivatives or derivative instruments without sufficient liquidity for comparable valuations. The Authority Limitations document also establishes the Value at Risk (VaR) limits for the company, and compliance with these limits is monitored daily. The chief financial officer monitors risks resulting from foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates and reports to the Chief Executive Officer. The senior vice president of Commercial monitors commodity price risk and also reports to the Chief Executive Officer. The Commercial organization manages our commercial marketing, optimizes our commodity flows and positions, and monitors risks related to our upstream and downstream businesses. Commodity Price Risk We operate in the worldwide crude oil, bitumen, refined products, natural gas, natural gas liquids, LNG and electric power markets and are exposed to fluctuations in the prices for these commodities. These fluctuations can affect our revenues, as well as the cost of operating, investing and financing activities. Generally, our policy is to remain exposed to the market prices of commodities. Our Commercial organization uses futures, forwards, swaps and options in various markets to optimize the value of our supply chain, which may move our risk profile away from market average prices to accomplish the following objectives: Balance physical systems. In addition to cash settlement prior to contract expiration, exchange traded futures contracts also may be settled by physical delivery of the commodity, providing another source of supply to meet our refinery requirements or marketing demands. Meet customer needs. Consistent with our policy to generally remain exposed to market prices, we use swap contracts to convert fixed price sales contracts, which are often requested by natural gas and refined product consumers, to floating market prices. Manage the risk to our cash flows from price exposures on specific crude oil, natural gas, refined product and electric power transactions. Enable us to use the market knowledge gained from these activities to capture market opportunities such as moving physical commodities to more profitable locations, storing commodities to capture seasonal or time premiums, and blending commodities to capture quality upgrades. We may use derivatives to optimize these activities. We use a VaR model to estimate the loss in fair value that could potentially result on a single day from the effect of adverse changes in market conditions on the derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments we hold or issue, including commodity purchases and sales contracts recorded on the balance sheet at December 31, 2011, as derivative instruments. Using Monte Carlo simulation, a 95 percent confidence level and a one day holding period, the VaR for those instruments issued or held for trading purposes at December 31, 2011 and 2010, was immaterial to our consolidated cash flows and net income attributable to ConocoPhillips. The VaR for instruments held for purposes other than trading at December 31, 2011 and 2010, was also immaterial to our cash flows and net income attributable to ConocoPhillips. 74 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Interest Rate Risk The following table provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in U.S. interest rates. The debt portion of the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates. Weighted average variable rates are based on effective rates at the reporting date. The carrying amount of our floating rate debt approximates its fair value. The fair value of the fixed rate financial instruments is estimated based on quoted market prices. The joint venture acquisition obligation portion of the table presents principal cash flows of the fixed rate 5.3 percent joint venture acquisition obligation owed to FCCL Partnership. The fair value of the obligation is estimated based on the net present value of the future cash flows, discounted at year end 2011 and 2010 effective yield rates of 1.24 percent and 1.87 percent, respectively, based on yields of U.S. Treasury securities of a similar average duration adjusted for ConocoPhillips average credit risk spread and the amortizing nature of the obligation principal.

These swaps qualify for and are designated as fair value hedges using the short cut method of hedge accounting. The short cut method permits the assumption that changes in the value of the derivative perfectly offset changes in the value of the debt; therefore, no gain or loss has been recognized due to hedge ineffectiveness. These adjustments to the fair values of the interest rate swaps and hedged debt have not been material. 75 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Foreign Currency Exchange Risk We have foreign currency exchange rate risk resulting from international operations. We do not comprehensively hedge the exposure to currency rate changes although we may choose to selectively hedge certain foreign currency exchange rate exposures, such as firm commitments for capital projects or local currency tax payments, dividends and cash returns from net investments in foreign affiliates to be remitted within the coming year. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, we held foreign currency exchange forwards hedging cross border commercial activity and foreign currency exchange swaps hedging short term intercompany loans between European subsidiaries and a U.S. subsidiary. Although these forwards and swaps hedge exposures to fluctuations in exchange rates, we elected not to utilize hedge accounting. As a result, the change in the fair value of these foreign currency exchange derivatives is recorded directly in earnings. Since the gain or loss on the swaps is offset by the gain or loss from remeasuring the intercompany loans into the functional currency of the lender or borrower, and since our aggregate position in the forwards was not material, there would be no material impact to our income from an adverse hypothetical 10 percent change in the December 31, 2011, or 2010, exchange rates. The notional and fair market values of these positions at December 31, 2011 and 2010, were as follows: USD00000 USD00000 USD00000 USD00000 In Millions Foreign Currency Exchange Derivatives Notional* Fair Market Value** 2011 2010 2011 2010 Sell U.S. dollar, buy euro USD 219 $ (8 ) Sell U.S. dollar, buy British pound USD 790 4 (3 ) Sell U.S. dollar, buy Canadian dollar USD 648 562 8 Sell U.S. dollar, buy Norwegian krone USD 292 3 (7 ) Buy euro, sell the Norwegian krone EUR 3 Sell euro, buy British pound EUR 64 253 5 1 *Denominated in U.S. dollars (USD) and euro (EUR). **Denominated in U.S. dollars.
