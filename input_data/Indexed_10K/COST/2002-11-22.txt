For these purposes, forward looking statements are statements that address activities, events, conditions or developments that the Company expects or anticipates may occur in the future. Such forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, domestic and international economic conditions including exchange rates, the effects of competition and regulation, conditions affecting the acquisition, development, ownership or use of real estate, actions of vendors, and other risks identified from time to time in the Companys public statements and reports filed with the SEC. Comparison of Fiscal 2002 (52 weeks) and Fiscal 2001 (52 weeks): (dollars in thousands, except earnings per share) Net income for fiscal 2002 increased 16% to $699,983, or $1.48 per diluted share, from $602,089, or $1.29 per diluted share during fiscal year 2001. Net sales increased 11% to $37,993,093 in fiscal 2002 from $34,137,021 in fiscal 2001. This increase was due to higher sales at existing locations opened prior to fiscal 2001; increased sales at the 32 new warehouses opened (39 opened, 7 closed) during fiscal 2001; and first year sales at the 29 new warehouses opened (35 opened, 6 closed) during fiscal 2002. Changes in prices did not materially impact sales levels. Comparable sales, that is sales in warehouses open for at least a year, increased at a 6% annual rate in fiscal 2002 compared to a 4% annual rate during fiscal 2001. Membership fees and other revenue increased 17% to $769,406, or 2.03% of net sales, in fiscal 2002 from $660,016, or 1.93% of net sales, in fiscal 2001. This increase was primarily due to the increase in membership fees across all member categories beginning with renewals on October 1, 2000, averaging approximately five dollars per member; additional membership sign ups at the 29 new warehouses opened in fiscal 2002; and increased penetration of the Companys Executive Membership. Overall, member renewal rates remained consistent with the prior year, currently at 86%. Gross margin (defined as net sales minus merchandise costs) increased 13% to $4,009,972, or 10.55% of net sales, in fiscal 2002 from $3,538,881, or 10.37% of net sales, in fiscal 2001. The increase in gross margin as a percentage of net sales reflects merchandise gross margin improvement within the Companys core merchandising business, with fresh foods and foods and sundries categories being the primary contributors. Additionally, a reduction in the LIFO reserve, improved purchasing resulting from expanded depot operations and improved international operations had a positive effect on margins, while increased costs related to the Executive Membership Two Percent Reward Program had a negative impact. The gross margin figures reflect accounting for most U.S. merchandise inventories on the last in, first out (LIFO) method. The effect of the LIFO adjustment for fiscal 2002 was to increase gross margin by $13,500, compared to a gross margin decrease of $5,500 in fiscal 2001. If all inventories had been valued using the first in, first out (FIFO) method, inventories would have been higher by $150 at September 1, 2002 and $13,650 at September 2, 2001. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales increased to 9.41% during fiscal 2002 from 9.17% during fiscal 2001. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales was primarily due to higher expense ratios at new warehouses, where such expense ratios to sales are typically higher than at more mature warehouses; and also due to increases in salary, healthcare and workers compensation costs. Preopening expenses totaled $51,257, or 0.13% of net sales, during fiscal 2002 and $59,571, or 0.17% of net sales, during fiscal 2001. During fiscal 2002, the Company opened 35 new warehouses (including relocations) compared to 39 new warehouses (including relocations) during fiscal 2001. Pre opening expenses also include 13 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) costs related to remodels and expanded ancillary operations at existing warehouses, as well as expanded international operations. The provision for impaired assets and closing costs was $21,050 in fiscal 2002 compared to $18,000 in fiscal 2001. The fiscal 2002 provision included charges of $7,765 for the Canadian administrative reorganization (See Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources) and $13,683 for warehouse closing expenses which were offset by net gains on the sale of real property totaling $398. The fiscal 2001 provision included charges of $19,000 for the Canadian administrative reorganization, $15,231 for the impairment of long lived assets and $2,412 for warehouse closing expense, which were offset by $18,643 of gains on the sale of real property. At September 1, 2002, the reserve for warehouse closing costs was $11,845, of which $10,395 related to future lease obligations. This compares to a reserve for warehouse closing costs of $15,434 at September 2, 2001, of which $6,538 related to future lease obligations. The increase in future lease obligations is attributable to leased warehouses constituting a larger percentage of the closed locations. (See Part II,

Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Membership fees and other revenue increased 21% to $660,016, or 1.93% of net sales, in fiscal 2001 from $543,573, or 1.72% of net sales, in fiscal 2000. This increase was primarily due to the increase in membership fees across most membership categories, averaging approximately $5 per member, which became effective beginning with renewals on October 1, 2000. Additionally, membership sign ups at the 32 new warehouses opened in fiscal 2001 were also a factor in this increase. Gross margin (defined as net sales minus merchandise costs) increased 7% to $3,538,881, or 10.37% of net sales, in fiscal 2001 from $3,298,553, or 10.43% of net sales, in fiscal 2000. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales decreased by six basis points due to costs related to the Executive Membership two percent reward program, which was somewhat offset by gross margin improvement in the Companys core merchandising activities and ancillary operations. The gross margin figures reflect accounting for most U.S. merchandise inventories on the last in, first out (LIFO) method. If all inventories had been valued using the first in, first out (FIFO) method, inventories would have been higher by $13,650 at September 2, 2001, and $8,150 at September 3, 2000. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales increased to 9.17% during fiscal 2001 from 8.71% during fiscal 2000, due to a number of a factors, including an increase in the entry level wage rate of hourly employees beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000; continued expansion of the Companys co branded credit card program; higher utility and energy costs; and higher expenses associated with an increase in new warehouse openings year over year (a net of 32 and 21 warehouses opened in fiscal 2001 and 2000, respectively) where expense ratios to sales are typically higher than in more mature warehouses. Preopening expenses totaled $59,571, or 0.17% of net sales, during fiscal 2001 and $42,321, or 0.13% of net sales, during fiscal 2000. During fiscal 2001, the Company opened 39 new warehouses (including relocations) compared to 25 new warehouses (including relocations) during fiscal 2000. Pre opening expenses also include costs related to remodels and expanded ancillary operations at existing warehouses, as well as expanded international operations. The provision for impaired assets and closing costs was $18,000 in fiscal 2001 compared to $7,000 in fiscal 2000. The fiscal 2001 provision includes charges of $19,000 for the Canadian administrative reorganization (See Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources), $15,231 for the impairment of long lived assets and $2,412 for warehouse closing expense, which were offset by $18,643 of gains on the sale of real property. At September 2, 2001, the reserve for warehouse closing costs was $15,434, of which $6,538 related to future lease obligations. This compares to a reserve for warehouse closing costs of $11,762 at September 3, 2000, of which $8,887 related to future lease obligations. (See Part II, 
 
Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (dollars in thousands) Expansion Plans Costcos primary requirement for capital is the financing of the land, building and equipment costs for new warehouses plus the costs of initial warehouse operations and working capital requirements, as well as additional capital for international expansion through investments in foreign subsidiaries and joint ventures. While there can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized, and plans are subject to change upon further review, it is managements current intention to spend an aggregate of approximately $1,000,000 to $1,100,000 during fiscal 2003 in the United States and Canada for real estate, construction, remodeling and equipment for warehouse clubs and related operations; and approximately $100,000 to $150,000 for international expansion, including the United Kingdom, Asia, Mexico and other potential ventures. These expenditures will be financed with a combination of cash provided from operations, the use of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments, short term borrowings under the Companys commercial paper program, Senior Notes and other financing sources as required. Expansion plans for the United States and Canada during fiscal 2003 are to open approximately 28 to 30 new warehouse clubs, including three to five relocations to larger and better located warehouses. The Company expects to continue expansion of its international operations and plans to open two additional warehouses in the United Kingdom through its 80% owned subsidiary, and two additional warehouses in Japan. Other international markets are being assessed. Costco and its Mexico based joint venture partner, Controladora Comercial Mexicana, each own a 50% interest in Costco Mexico. As of September 1, 2002, Costco Mexico operated 20 warehouses in Mexico and plans to open one or two new warehouse clubs during fiscal 2003. Reorganization of Canadian Administrative Operations On January 17, 2001, the Company announced plans to reorganize and consolidate the administration of its operations in Canada. Total costs related to the reorganization were $26,765 pre tax, of which $7,765 pre tax ($4,775 after tax, or $.01 per diluted share) was expensed in fiscal 2002 and $19,000 pre tax ($11,400 after tax, or $.02 per diluted share) was expensed in fiscal 2001 and reported as part of the provision for impaired assets and closing costs. These costs consisted primarily of employee severance, implementation and consolidation of support systems and employee relocation. The reorganization was completed in the first quarter of fiscal 2002. Bank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs (all amounts stated in thousands of US dollars) The Company has in place a $500,000 commercial paper program supported by a $400,000 bank credit facility with a group of 10 banks, of which $200,000 expires on November 11, 2003 and $200,000 expires on November 15, 2005. At September 1, 2002, no amounts were outstanding under the commercial paper program and no amounts were outstanding under the credit facility. In addition, a wholly owned Canadian subsidiary has a $128,000 commercial paper program supported by a $51,000 bank credit facility with a group of three Canadian banks, which expires in March, 2003. At September 1, 2002, no amounts were outstanding under the Canadian commercial paper program or the bank credit facility. The Company is evaluating the business need to renew this commercial paper program and bank credit facility. The Company has agreed to limit the combined amount outstanding under the U.S. and Canadian commercial paper programs to the $451,000 combined amounts of the respective supporting bank credit facilities. 16 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) The Companys wholly owned Japanese subsidiary has a short term &yen;4 billion bank line of credit, equal to approximately $33,600, of which &yen;1 billion ($8,400) expires in April 2003 and &yen;3 billion ($25,200) expires in November 2003. At September 1, 2002, $18,480 was outstanding under the line of credit with an applicable interest rate of 1.375%. The Companys 80% owned UK subsidiary has a &pound;60 million ($93,048) bank revolving credit facility and a &pound;20 million ($31,016) bank overdraft facility, both expiring in February 2007. At September 1, 2002, $85,294 was outstanding under the revolving credit facility with an applicable interest rate of 4.413% and no balance was outstanding under the bank overdraft facility. Letters of Credit The Company has separate letter of credit facilities (for commercial and standby letters of credit), totaling approximately $373,000. The outstanding commitments under these facilities at September 1, 2002 totaled approximately $142,000, including approximately $32,000 in standby letters of credit. Contractual Obligations The Companys commitment to make future payments under long term contractual obligations was as follows, as of September 1, 2002. Payments Due by Period Contractual obligations Total Less than 1 year 1 to 3 years 4 to 5 years After5 years Long term debt(1) $ 1,659,030 (2) $ 40,446 $ 369,906 $ 337,843 $ 910,835 (2) Capital lease obligations 14,409 7,244 3,168 1,115 2,882 Operating leases 1,095,780 67,955 129,275 127,202 771,348 Total $ 2,769,219 $ 115,645 $ 502,349 $ 466,160 $ 1,685,065 (1) Amounts include contractual interest payments. (2) The amount includes the amount of interest accreted to maturity for the Companys Zero Coupon 3% Convertible Subordinated Notes due August 2017, totaling $851,860. The balance sheet as of September 1, 2002 reflects the current balance outstanding of $506,883. Financing Activities During April 2001, the Company retired its unsecured note payable to banks of $140,000 using cash provided from operations, cash and cash equivalents and short term borrowings under its commercial paper program. In October 2000, the Companys wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued 2.070% promissory notes in the aggregate amount of 3.5 billion Yen, equal to $29,400, through a private placement. Interest is payable annually and principal is due on October 23, 2007. In July 2001, the Companys wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued 1.187% promissory notes in the aggregate amount of 3 billion Yen, equal to $25,200, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due on July 9, 2008. In March 2002, the Company issued $300,000 of 5 1/2% Senior Notes due March 15, 2007. Interest is payable semi annually. Simultaneous with the issuance of the Senior Notes, the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements converting the interest from fixed to floating. 17 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) In February 1996, the Company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a shelf registration statement for $500,000 of senior debt securities. On October 23, 2001, an additional $100,000 in debt securities were registered, bringing the total amount of debt registered under the shelf registration to $600,000. The $300,000 of 5 1/2% Senior Notes issued in March 2002, reduced the amount of registered securities available for future issuance to $300,000. Derivatives The Company has limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and uses them only to manage well defined interest rate and foreign exchange risks. Forward foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on inventory purchases and typically have very short terms. The aggregate amount of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at September 1, 2002 was not material. The only significant derivative instruments the Company holds are interest rate swaps, which the Company uses to manage the interest rate risk associated with its borrowings and to manage the Companys mix of fixed and variable rate debt. As of September 1, 2002, the Company had fixed to floating interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $600,000 and an aggregate fair value of $35,926, which is recorded in other assets. These swaps were entered into effective November 13, 2001, and March 25, 2002, and are designated and qualify as fair value hedges of the Companys $300,000 7 1/8% Senior Notes and the Companys $300,000 5 1/2% Senior Notes, respectively. As the terms of the swaps match those of the underlying hedged debt, the changes in the fair value of these swaps are offset by corresponding changes in the carrying amount of the hedged debt, and result in no net earnings impact. Financial Position and Cash Flows Working capital totaled $180,806 at September 1, 2002, compared to a negative working capital position of $229,732 at September 2, 2001. The increase of $410,538 was primarily due to an increase in net inventory levels (inventories less accounts payable) of $232,087; increases in cash and cash equivalents of $202,933; an increase in receivables of $150,093; and a decrease in short term borrowings of $90,778, offset by increases in other current liabilities of $116,897; accrued salaries and benefits of $106,454 and deferred membership income of $37,932. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $1,018,243 in fiscal 2002, compared to $1,032,563 in fiscal 2001. The decrease of $14,320 is primarily a result of the change in the increase in net inventories (inventories less accounts payable) of $256,258 and a decrease in the change in deferred income taxes of $28,618; offset by a decrease in the receivables, other current assets, accrued and other current liabilities of approximately $136,042; higher net income in fiscal 2002 over fiscal 2001 of $97,894 and a larger add back for depreciation and amortization of $40,484. Net cash used in investing activities totaled $1,033,815 in fiscal 2002, compared to $1,339,843 in fiscal 2001, a decrease of $306,028. This decrease is primarily a result of decreases in additions to property and equipment for new and remodeled warehouses of $408,944 and investments in unconsolidated joint ventures of $27,500, which was offset by the decrease in the net cash proceeds from the sale of property and equipment of $77,153 and the net cash proceeds from the sale of short term investments of $36,671. Net cash provided by financing activities totaled $217,828 in fiscal 2002 compared to $394,345 in fiscal 2001, a decrease of $176,517. The decrease primarily resulted from an increase in the net repayments of short term borrowings of $285,117 and a change in bank overdrafts of $251,797, offset by an overall increase in the proceeds from the issuance of long term debt of $218,049 and a decrease in repayments of long term debt of $140,788. 18 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Stock Repurchase Program (dollars in thousands except per share data) On November 30, 2001, the Companys Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of up to $500,000 of Costco Common Stock through November 30, 2004. Under the program, the Company can repurchase shares at any time in the open market or in private transactions as market conditions warrant. The repurchased shares would constitute authorized, but non issued shares and would be used for general corporate purposes, including stock option grants under stock option programs. To date, no shares have been repurchased under this program. Under a previous stock purchase program which expired in November, 2001, the Company repurchased 3.13 million shares of common stock at an average price of $31.96 per share, totaling approximately $99,946 (excluding commissions). The Companys repurchase of its common shares under this program was transacted entirely in fiscal 2000. Membership Fee Increases Beginning with renewals on October 1, 2000, the Company increased annual membership fees for its Gold Star (individual), Business, and Business Add on Members. These fee increases averaged approximately $5 per member across its member categories, and are recorded as income ratably using the deferred method of accounting. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the Companys financial statements requires that management make estimates and judgments that affect the financial position and results of operations. Management continues to review its accounting policies and evaluate its estimates, including those related to merchandise inventory, impairment of long lived assets and warehouse closing costs and insurance/self insurance reserves. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the present circumstances. Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market as determined primarily by the retail method of accounting, and are stated using the last in, first out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail method of accounting, and are stated using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. The Company records a provision each quarter for the estimated annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end. The Company includes in its calculation of the LIFO provision the net realizable value of those inventory pools where deflation exists. The Company provides for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts on the basis of a percentage of sales. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect the trend of the actual physical inventory count results, which generally occur in the second and fourth fiscal quarters. Impairment of long lived assets and warehouse closing costs The Company periodically evaluates its long lived assets for indicators of impairment. Managements judgments are based on market and operational conditions at the present time. Future events could cause management to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring an adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value. The Company provides estimates for warehouse closing costs when it is appropriate to do so based on accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Future circumstances may result in the Companys 19 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) actual future closing costs or the amount recognized upon the sale of the property to differ substantially from the original estimates. Insurance/Self Insurance Reserve The Company uses a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms to provide for the potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property insurance, director and officers liability insurance, vehicle liability and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by the Company are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Stock Options The Company applies Accounting Principles Board Opinion (APB) No. 25 and related interpretations in accounting for stock options. The Company grants stock options to employees at exercise prices equal to fair market value on the date of grant. Accordingly, no compensation cost has been recognized for the plans. On August 13, 2002 the Company announced that it would adopt the fair value based method of recording stock options consistent with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (SFAS No. 123) for all employee stock options granted subsequent to fiscal year end 2002. All future employee stock option grants will be expensed over the option vesting period based on the estimated fair value at the date the options are granted. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, Accounting for Goodwill and Other Intangibles, which specifies that goodwill and some intangible assets will no longer be amortized, but instead will be subject to periodic impairment testing. On September 3, 2001, the Company adopted SFAS No. 142 and accordingly will continue to test previously reported goodwill for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if circumstances dictate. The overall effect of the adoption of SFAS No. 142 on the Companys financial statements was not material and the Company recorded no impairment charge. The reduction in amortization expense going forward, as a result of the adoption, is not material. In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, which provides the accounting requirements for retirement obligations associated with tangible long lived assets. SFAS No. 143 requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred. SFAS No. 143 is effective for the Companys 2003 fiscal year. The adoption of SFAS No. 143 is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, effective for the Companys 2003 fiscal year. This Statement supersedes FASB Statement No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of and other related accounting guidance. The adoption of SFAS No. 144 is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. In April 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 145, Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44 and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections. Among other things, this statement rescinds FASB Statement No. 4, Reporting Gains and Losses from Extinguishment of Debt, which required all gains and losses from the early extinguishment of debt to be aggregated and, if material, classified as an extraordinary item, net of the related income tax effect. As a result, the criteria in Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion 20 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) No. 30, Reporting the Results of Operations Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions, will now be used to classify those gains and losses. The statement was effective upon issuance in April 2002 for prospective transactions. The adoption of this statement had no impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations in fiscal 2002. In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. This statement addresses financial accounting and reporting of costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 94 3, Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring). This statement requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity should be recognized at fair value when the liability is incurred. SFAS No. 146 is effective for the Companys 2003 fiscal year. The adoption of SFAS No. 146 is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure of Market Risk The Company is exposed to financial market risk resulting from changes in interest and currency rates. As a policy, the Company does not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions, nor hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. The nature and amount of the Companys long and short term debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As of September 1, 2002, the Companys fixed rate long term debt includes its $851,860 principal amount at maturity Zero Coupon Subordinated Notes and additional notes and capital lease obligations totaling $75,413. The Companys debt also includes $300,000 7 1/8% Senior Notes and $300,000 5 1/2% Senior Notes. The Company has entered into fixed to floating interest rate swaps on the Senior Notes, effectively converting these fixed interest rate securities to variable rate securities. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt and may affect the interest expense related to the variable rate debt. The Company holds interest bearing instruments that are classified as cash and cash equivalents. As these investments are of a short term nature and are held until maturity, if interest rates were to increase or decrease immediately, there is no material risk of a valuation adjustment related to these instruments. In addition, changes in interest rates would not likely have a material impact on interest income. Most foreign currency transactions have been conducted in local currencies, limiting the Companys exposure to changes in currency rates. The Company periodically enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates on inventory purchases. The fair value of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at September 1, 2002 were not material to the Companys results of operations or its financial position. 21 Table of Contents

The nature and amount of the Companys long and short term debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As of September 1, 2002, the Companys fixed rate long term debt includes its $851,860 principal amount at maturity Zero Coupon Subordinated Notes and additional notes and capital lease obligations totaling $75,413. The Companys debt also includes $300,000 7 1/8% Senior Notes and $300,000 5 1/2% Senior Notes. The Company has entered into fixed to floating interest rate swaps on the Senior Notes, effectively converting these fixed interest rate securities to variable rate securities. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt and may affect the interest expense related to the variable rate debt. The Company holds interest bearing instruments that are classified as cash and cash equivalents. As these investments are of a short term nature and are held until maturity, if interest rates were to increase or decrease immediately, there is no material risk of a valuation adjustment related to these instruments. In addition, changes in interest rates would not likely have a material impact on interest income. Most foreign currency transactions have been conducted in local currencies, limiting the Companys exposure to changes in currency rates. The Company periodically enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates on inventory purchases. The fair value of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at September 1, 2002 were not material to the Companys results of operations or its financial position. 21 Table of Contents 
 
Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) In February 1996, the Company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a shelf registration statement for $500,000 of senior debt securities. On October 23, 2001, an additional $100,000 in debt securities were registered, bringing the total amount of debt registered under the shelf registration to $600,000. The $300,000 of 5 1/2% Senior Notes issued in March 2002, reduced the amount of registered securities available for future issuance to $300,000. Derivatives The Company has limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and uses them only to manage well defined interest rate and foreign exchange risks. Forward foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on inventory purchases and typically have very short terms. The aggregate amount of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at September 1, 2002 was not material. The only significant derivative instruments the Company holds are interest rate swaps, which the Company uses to manage the interest rate risk associated with its borrowings and to manage the Companys mix of fixed and variable rate debt. As of September 1, 2002, the Company had fixed to floating interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $600,000 and an aggregate fair value of $35,926, which is recorded in other assets. These swaps were entered into effective November 13, 2001, and March 25, 2002, and are designated and qualify as fair value hedges of the Companys $300,000 7 1/8% Senior Notes and the Companys $300,000 5 1/2% Senior Notes, respectively. As the terms of the swaps match those of the underlying hedged debt, the changes in the fair value of these swaps are offset by corresponding changes in the carrying amount of the hedged debt, and result in no net earnings impact. Financial Position and Cash Flows Working capital totaled $180,806 at September 1, 2002, compared to a negative working capital position of $229,732 at September 2, 2001. The increase of $410,538 was primarily due to an increase in net inventory levels (inventories less accounts payable) of $232,087; increases in cash and cash equivalents of $202,933; an increase in receivables of $150,093; and a decrease in short term borrowings of $90,778, offset by increases in other current liabilities of $116,897; accrued salaries and benefits of $106,454 and deferred membership income of $37,932. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $1,018,243 in fiscal 2002, compared to $1,032,563 in fiscal 2001. The decrease of $14,320 is primarily a result of the change in the increase in net inventories (inventories less accounts payable) of $256,258 and a decrease in the change in deferred income taxes of $28,618; offset by a decrease in the receivables, other current assets, accrued and other current liabilities of approximately $136,042; higher net income in fiscal 2002 over fiscal 2001 of $97,894 and a larger add back for depreciation and amortization of $40,484. Net cash used in investing activities totaled $1,033,815 in fiscal 2002, compared to $1,339,843 in fiscal 2001, a decrease of $306,028. This decrease is primarily a result of decreases in additions to property and equipment for new and remodeled warehouses of $408,944 and investments in unconsolidated joint ventures of $27,500, which was offset by the decrease in the net cash proceeds from the sale of property and equipment of $77,153 and the net cash proceeds from the sale of short term investments of $36,671. Net cash provided by financing activities totaled $217,828 in fiscal 2002 compared to $394,345 in fiscal 2001, a decrease of $176,517. The decrease primarily resulted from an increase in the net repayments of short term borrowings of $285,117 and a change in bank overdrafts of $251,797, offset by an overall increase in the proceeds from the issuance of long term debt of $218,049 and a decrease in repayments of long term debt of $140,788. 18 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Stock Repurchase Program (dollars in thousands except per share data) On November 30, 2001, the Companys Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of up to $500,000 of Costco Common Stock through November 30, 2004. Under the program, the Company can repurchase shares at any time in the open market or in private transactions as market conditions warrant. The repurchased shares would constitute authorized, but non issued shares and would be used for general corporate purposes, including stock option grants under stock option programs. To date, no shares have been repurchased under this program. Under a previous stock purchase program which expired in November, 2001, the Company repurchased 3.13 million shares of common stock at an average price of $31.96 per share, totaling approximately $99,946 (excluding commissions). The Companys repurchase of its common shares under this program was transacted entirely in fiscal 2000. Membership Fee Increases Beginning with renewals on October 1, 2000, the Company increased annual membership fees for its Gold Star (individual), Business, and Business Add on Members. These fee increases averaged approximately $5 per member across its member categories, and are recorded as income ratably using the deferred method of accounting. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the Companys financial statements requires that management make estimates and judgments that affect the financial position and results of operations. Management continues to review its accounting policies and evaluate its estimates, including those related to merchandise inventory, impairment of long lived assets and warehouse closing costs and insurance/self insurance reserves. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the present circumstances. Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market as determined primarily by the retail method of accounting, and are stated using the last in, first out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail method of accounting, and are stated using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. The Company records a provision each quarter for the estimated annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end. The Company includes in its calculation of the LIFO provision the net realizable value of those inventory pools where deflation exists. The Company provides for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts on the basis of a percentage of sales. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect the trend of the actual physical inventory count results, which generally occur in the second and fourth fiscal quarters. Impairment of long lived assets and warehouse closing costs The Company periodically evaluates its long lived assets for indicators of impairment. Managements judgments are based on market and operational conditions at the present time. Future events could cause management to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring an adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value. The Company provides estimates for warehouse closing costs when it is appropriate to do so based on accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Future circumstances may result in the Companys 19 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) actual future closing costs or the amount recognized upon the sale of the property to differ substantially from the original estimates. Insurance/Self Insurance Reserve The Company uses a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms to provide for the potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property insurance, director and officers liability insurance, vehicle liability and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by the Company are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Stock Options The Company applies Accounting Principles Board Opinion (APB) No. 25 and related interpretations in accounting for stock options. The Company grants stock options to employees at exercise prices equal to fair market value on the date of grant. Accordingly, no compensation cost has been recognized for the plans. On August 13, 2002 the Company announced that it would adopt the fair value based method of recording stock options consistent with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (SFAS No. 123) for all employee stock options granted subsequent to fiscal year end 2002. All future employee stock option grants will be expensed over the option vesting period based on the estimated fair value at the date the options are granted. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, Accounting for Goodwill and Other Intangibles, which specifies that goodwill and some intangible assets will no longer be amortized, but instead will be subject to periodic impairment testing. On September 3, 2001, the Company adopted SFAS No. 142 and accordingly will continue to test previously reported goodwill for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if circumstances dictate. The overall effect of the adoption of SFAS No. 142 on the Companys financial statements was not material and the Company recorded no impairment charge. The reduction in amortization expense going forward, as a result of the adoption, is not material. In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, which provides the accounting requirements for retirement obligations associated with tangible long lived assets. SFAS No. 143 requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred. SFAS No. 143 is effective for the Companys 2003 fiscal year. The adoption of SFAS No. 143 is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, effective for the Companys 2003 fiscal year. This Statement supersedes FASB Statement No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of and other related accounting guidance. The adoption of SFAS No. 144 is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. In April 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 145, Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44 and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections. Among other things, this statement rescinds FASB Statement No. 4, Reporting Gains and Losses from Extinguishment of Debt, which required all gains and losses from the early extinguishment of debt to be aggregated and, if material, classified as an extraordinary item, net of the related income tax effect. As a result, the criteria in Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion 20 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) No. 30, Reporting the Results of Operations Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions, will now be used to classify those gains and losses. The statement was effective upon issuance in April 2002 for prospective transactions. The adoption of this statement had no impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations in fiscal 2002. In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. This statement addresses financial accounting and reporting of costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 94 3, Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring). This statement requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity should be recognized at fair value when the liability is incurred. SFAS No. 146 is effective for the Companys 2003 fiscal year. The adoption of SFAS No. 146 is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

The nature and amount of the Companys long and short term debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As of September 1, 2002, the Companys fixed rate long term debt includes its $851,860 principal amount at maturity Zero Coupon Subordinated Notes and additional notes and capital lease obligations totaling $75,413. The Companys debt also includes $300,000 7 1/8% Senior Notes and $300,000 5 1/2% Senior Notes. The Company has entered into fixed to floating interest rate swaps on the Senior Notes, effectively converting these fixed interest rate securities to variable rate securities. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt and may affect the interest expense related to the variable rate debt. The Company holds interest bearing instruments that are classified as cash and cash equivalents. As these investments are of a short term nature and are held until maturity, if interest rates were to increase or decrease immediately, there is no material risk of a valuation adjustment related to these instruments. In addition, changes in interest rates would not likely have a material impact on interest income. Most foreign currency transactions have been conducted in local currencies, limiting the Companys exposure to changes in currency rates. The Company periodically enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates on inventory purchases. The fair value of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at September 1, 2002 were not material to the Companys results of operations or its financial position. 21 Table of Contents
