For these purposes, forward looking statements are statements that address activities, events, conditions or developments that the Company expects or anticipates may occur in the future. Such forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, domestic and international economic conditions including exchange rates, the effects of competition and regulation, conditions affecting the acquisition, development, ownership or use of real estate, actions of vendors, rising costs associated with employees (including health care and workers compensation costs), consumer and small business debt levels and spending patterns, and other risks identified from time to time in the Companys public statements and reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Comparison of Fiscal 2003 (52 weeks) and Fiscal 2002 (52 weeks): (dollars in thousands, except earnings per share) Net income for fiscal 2003 increased 3% to $721,000, or $1.53 per diluted share, from $699,983, or $1.48 per diluted share during fiscal year 2002. Net sales increased 10% to $41,692,699 in fiscal 2003 from $37,993,093 in fiscal 2002. Approximately 55% of the increase was due to an increase in comparable warehouse sales, that is sales in warehouses open for at least a year, and approximately 45% of the increase was due to opening a net of 23 new warehouses (29 opened, 6 closed) during fiscal 2003 and a net of 29 new warehouses (35 opened, 6 closed) during fiscal 2002, a portion of which is not included in comparable warehouse sales. With the exception of gasoline, which accounted for a comparable sales increase of approximately 70 basis points, changes in prices of merchandise did not materially contribute to sales increases. In addition, due to the weaker US dollar, translation of foreign sales into US dollars contributed to the increase in sales, accounting for a comparable sales increase of approximately one percent year over year. Comparable sales increased at a 5% annual rate in fiscal 2003 compared to a 6% annual rate during fiscal 2002. Membership fees and other revenue increased 11% to $852,853, or 2.05% of net sales, in fiscal 2003 from $769,406, or 2.03% of net sales, in fiscal 2002. This increase was primarily due to additional membership sign ups at the 23 new warehouses opened in fiscal 2003, and increased penetration of the Companys Executive Membership. Overall, member renewal rates remained consistent with the prior year, currently at 86%. Gross margin (defined as net sales minus merchandise costs) increased 11% to $4,457,316, or 10.69% of net sales, in fiscal 2003 from $4,009,972, or 10.55% of net sales, in fiscal 2002. The increase in gross margin as a percentage of net sales reflects merchandise gross margin improvement within the Companys ancillary warehouse businesses and international operations accounting for increases of 15 and 8 basis points, respectively. Additionally, increased rewards related to the Executive Membership Two Percent Reward Program reduced gross margin by 7 basis points. The gross margin figures reflect accounting for most U.S. merchandise inventories on the last in, first out (LIFO) method. The effect of the LIFO adjustment for fiscal 2003 was to increase gross margin by $19,650, compared to a gross margin increase of $13,500 in fiscal 2002. If all inventories had been valued using the first in, first out (FIFO) method, inventories would have been lower by $19,500 at August 31, 2003 and higher by $150 at September 1, 2002. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales increased to 9.83% during fiscal 2003 from 9.41% during fiscal 2002. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales was primarily due to increases in healthcare, workers compensation (primarily in the state of California) and salary costs within the Companys domestic operations. International expenses also increased, accounting for approximately 7 basis points of the 42 basis points year over year increase. Preopening expenses totaled $36,643, or 0.09% of net sales, during fiscal 2003 and $51,257, or 0.13% of net sales, during fiscal 2002. During fiscal 2003, the Company opened 29 new warehouses (including 5 relocations) compared to 35 new warehouses (including 6 relocations) during fiscal 2002. Pre opening expenses also include 12 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) costs related to remodels and expanded ancillary operations at existing warehouses, as well as expanded international operations. The provision for impaired assets and closing costs was $19,500 in fiscal 2003 compared to $21,050 in fiscal 2002. The provision includes costs related to impairment of long lived assets, future lease obligations of warehouses that have been relocated to new facilities and any losses or gains resulting from the sale of real property. The provision for fiscal 2003 included charges of $11,836 for warehouse closing expenses, $4,697 for impairment of long lived assets and $2,967 for net losses on the sale of real property. The fiscal 2002 provision included charges of $13,683 for warehouse closing expenses and $7,765 for Canadian administrative reorganization, which were offset by $398 of net gains on the sale of real property. At August 31, 2003 the reserve for warehouse closing costs was $8,609, of which $7,833 related to lease obligations. This compares to a reserve for warehouse closing costs of $11,845 at September 1, 2002, of which $10,395 related to lease obligations. Interest expense totaled $36,920 in fiscal 2003, and $29,096 in fiscal 2002. Interest expense in fiscal 2003 includes interest on the 3 1/2% Zero Coupon Notes, 7 1/8% and 5 1/2% Senior Notes and on balances outstanding under the Companys bank credit facilities and promissory notes. The increase is primarily related to the reduction in interest capitalized related to warehouse construction, as the overall cost of projects under construction was lower than in fiscal 2002. The increase was also attributed to the Companys issuance of $300,000 5 1/2% Senior Notes in March 2002, which were simultaneously swapped to a floating interest rate. This increase was partially offset by an interest rate reduction in the Companys $300,000 7 1/8% Senior Notes, resulting from interest rate swap agreements entered into effective November 13, 2001, converting the interest rate from fixed to floating, and to the fact that the Company had little interest expense related to borrowings under its commercial paper program in fiscal 2003. Interest income and other totaled $38,525 in fiscal 2003, compared to $35,745 in fiscal 2002. The increase primarily reflects greater interest earned on higher cash and cash equivalents balances on hand throughout fiscal 2003, as compared to fiscal 2002, which was partially offset by an increase in the expense to record the minority interest in earnings of foreign subsidiaries. The effective income tax rate on earnings was 37.75% in fiscal 2003 and 38.50% in fiscal 2002. The decrease in the effective income tax rate, year over year, is primarily attributable to lower statutory income tax rates for foreign operations. Comparison of Fiscal 2002 (52 weeks) and Fiscal 2001 (52 weeks): (dollars in thousands, except earnings per share) Net income for fiscal 2002 increased 16% to $699,983, or $1.48 per diluted share, from $602,089, or $1.29 per diluted share during fiscal year 2001. Net sales increased 11% to $37,993,093 in fiscal 2002 from $34,137,021 in fiscal 2001. This increase was due to higher sales at existing locations opened prior to fiscal 2001; increased sales at the 32 new warehouses opened (39 opened, 7 closed) during fiscal 2001; and first year sales at the 29 new warehouses opened (35 opened, 6 closed) during fiscal 2002. Changes in prices did not materially impact sales levels. Comparable sales, that is sales in warehouses open for at least a year, increased at a 6% annual rate in fiscal 2002 compared to a 4% annual rate during fiscal 2001. Membership fees and other revenue increased 17% to $769,406, or 2.03% of net sales, in fiscal 2002 from $660,016, or 1.93% of net sales, in fiscal 2001. This increase was primarily due to the increase in membership fees across all member categories beginning with renewals on October 1, 2000, averaging approximately five dollars per member; additional membership sign ups at the 29 new warehouses opened in fiscal 2002; and increased penetration of the Companys Executive Membership. Overall, member renewal rates remained consistent with the prior year, currently at 86%. 13 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Gross margin (defined as net sales minus merchandise costs) increased 13% to $4,009,972, or 10.55% of net sales, in fiscal 2002 from $3,538,881, or 10.37% of net sales, in fiscal 2001. The increase in gross margin as a percentage of net sales reflects merchandise gross margin improvement within the Companys core merchandising business, with fresh foods and foods and sundries categories being the primary contributors. Additionally, a reduction in the LIFO reserve, improved purchasing resulting from expanded depot operations and improved international operations had a positive effect on margins, while increased costs related to the Executive Membership Two Percent Reward Program had a negative impact. The gross margin figures reflect accounting for most U.S. merchandise inventories on the last in, first out (LIFO) method. The effect of the LIFO adjustment for fiscal 2002 was to increase gross margin by $13,500, compared to a gross margin decrease of $5,500 in fiscal 2001. If all inventories had been valued using the first in, first out (FIFO) method, inventories would have been higher by $150 at September 1, 2002 and $13,650 at September 2, 2001. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales increased to 9.41% during fiscal 2002 from 9.17% during fiscal 2001. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales was primarily due to higher expense ratios at new warehouses, where such expense ratios to sales are typically higher than at more mature warehouses; and also due to increases in salary, healthcare and workers compensation costs. Preopening expenses totaled $51,257, or 0.13% of net sales, during fiscal 2002 and $59,571, or 0.17% of net sales, during fiscal 2001. During fiscal 2002, the Company opened 35 new warehouses (including relocations) compared to 39 new warehouses (including relocations) during fiscal 2001. Pre opening expenses also include costs related to remodels and expanded ancillary operations at existing warehouses, as well as expanded international operations. The provision for impaired assets and closing costs was $21,050 in fiscal 2002 compared to $18,000 in fiscal 2001. The fiscal 2002 provision included charges of $7,765 for the Canadian administrative reorganization (See Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources) and $13,683 for warehouse closing expenses which were offset by net gains on the sale of real property totaling $398. The fiscal 2001 provision included charges of $19,000 for the Canadian administrative reorganization, $15,231 for the impairment of long lived assets and $2,412 for warehouse closing expense, which were offset by $18,643 of gains on the sale of real property. At September 1, 2002, the reserve for warehouse closing costs was $11,845, of which $10,395 related to future lease obligations. This compares to a reserve for warehouse closing costs of $15,434 at September 1, 2001, of which $6,538 related to future lease obligations. The increase in future lease obligations is attributable to leased warehouses constituting a larger percentage of the closed locations. (See Part II,

For these purposes, forward looking statements are statements that address activities, events, conditions or developments that the Company expects or anticipates may occur in the future. Such forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, domestic and international economic conditions including exchange rates, the effects of competition and regulation, conditions affecting the acquisition, development, ownership or use of real estate, actions of vendors, rising costs associated with employees (including health care and workers compensation costs), consumer and small business debt levels and spending patterns, and other risks identified from time to time in the Companys public statements and reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Comparison of Fiscal 2003 (52 weeks) and Fiscal 2002 (52 weeks): (dollars in thousands, except earnings per share) Net income for fiscal 2003 increased 3% to $721,000, or $1.53 per diluted share, from $699,983, or $1.48 per diluted share during fiscal year 2002. Net sales increased 10% to $41,692,699 in fiscal 2003 from $37,993,093 in fiscal 2002. Approximately 55% of the increase was due to an increase in comparable warehouse sales, that is sales in warehouses open for at least a year, and approximately 45% of the increase was due to opening a net of 23 new warehouses (29 opened, 6 closed) during fiscal 2003 and a net of 29 new warehouses (35 opened, 6 closed) during fiscal 2002, a portion of which is not included in comparable warehouse sales. With the exception of gasoline, which accounted for a comparable sales increase of approximately 70 basis points, changes in prices of merchandise did not materially contribute to sales increases. In addition, due to the weaker US dollar, translation of foreign sales into US dollars contributed to the increase in sales, accounting for a comparable sales increase of approximately one percent year over year. Comparable sales increased at a 5% annual rate in fiscal 2003 compared to a 6% annual rate during fiscal 2002. Membership fees and other revenue increased 11% to $852,853, or 2.05% of net sales, in fiscal 2003 from $769,406, or 2.03% of net sales, in fiscal 2002.

The increase in gross margin as a percentage of net sales reflects merchandise gross margin improvement within the Companys ancillary warehouse businesses and international operations accounting for increases of 15 and 8 basis points, respectively.

Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales increased to 9.83% during fiscal 2003 from 9.41% during fiscal 2002. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales was primarily due to increases in healthcare, workers compensation (primarily in the state of California) and salary costs within the Companys domestic operations. International expenses also increased, accounting for approximately 7 basis points of the 42 basis points year over year increase. Preopening expenses totaled $36,643, or 0.09% of net sales, during fiscal 2003 and $51,257, or 0.13% of net sales, during fiscal 2002. During fiscal 2003, the Company opened 29 new warehouses (including 5 relocations) compared to 35 new warehouses (including 6 relocations) during fiscal 2002. Pre opening expenses also include 12 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) costs related to remodels and expanded ancillary operations at existing warehouses, as well as expanded international operations. The provision for impaired assets and closing costs was $19,500 in fiscal 2003 compared to $21,050 in fiscal 2002. The provision includes costs related to impairment of long lived assets, future lease obligations of warehouses that have been relocated to new facilities and any losses or gains resulting from the sale of real property. The provision for fiscal 2003 included charges of $11,836 for warehouse closing expenses, $4,697 for impairment of long lived assets and $2,967 for net losses on the sale of real property. The fiscal 2002 provision included charges of $13,683 for warehouse closing expenses and $7,765 for Canadian administrative reorganization, which were offset by $398 of net gains on the sale of real property. At August 31, 2003 the reserve for warehouse closing costs was $8,609, of which $7,833 related to lease obligations. This compares to a reserve for warehouse closing costs of $11,845 at September 1, 2002, of which $10,395 related to lease obligations. Interest expense totaled $36,920 in fiscal 2003, and $29,096 in fiscal 2002. Interest expense in fiscal 2003 includes interest on the 3 1/2% Zero Coupon Notes, 7 1/8% and 5 1/2% Senior Notes and on balances outstanding under the Companys bank credit facilities and promissory notes. The increase is primarily related to the reduction in interest capitalized related to warehouse construction, as the overall cost of projects under construction was lower than in fiscal 2002. The increase was also attributed to the Companys issuance of $300,000 5 1/2% Senior Notes in March 2002, which were simultaneously swapped to a floating interest rate. This increase was partially offset by an interest rate reduction in the Companys $300,000 7 1/8% Senior Notes, resulting from interest rate swap agreements entered into effective November 13, 2001, converting the interest rate from fixed to floating, and to the fact that the Company had little interest expense related to borrowings under its commercial paper program in fiscal 2003. Interest income and other totaled $38,525 in fiscal 2003, compared to $35,745 in fiscal 2002. The increase primarily reflects greater interest earned on higher cash and cash equivalents balances on hand throughout fiscal 2003, as compared to fiscal 2002, which was partially offset by an increase in the expense to record the minority interest in earnings of foreign subsidiaries. The effective income tax rate on earnings was 37.75% in fiscal 2003 and 38.50% in fiscal 2002. The decrease in the effective income tax rate, year over year, is primarily attributable to lower statutory income tax rates for foreign operations. Comparison of Fiscal 2002 (52 weeks) and Fiscal 2001 (52 weeks): (dollars in thousands, except earnings per share) Net income for fiscal 2002 increased 16% to $699,983, or $1.48 per diluted share, from $602,089, or $1.29 per diluted share during fiscal year 2001. Net sales increased 11% to $37,993,093 in fiscal 2002 from $34,137,021 in fiscal 2001. This increase was due to higher sales at existing locations opened prior to fiscal 2001; increased sales at the 32 new warehouses opened (39 opened, 7 closed) during fiscal 2001; and first year sales at the 29 new warehouses opened (35 opened, 6 closed) during fiscal 2002. Changes in prices did not materially impact sales levels. Comparable sales, that is sales in warehouses open for at least a year, increased at a 6% annual rate in fiscal 2002 compared to a 4% annual rate during fiscal 2001. Membership fees and other revenue increased 17% to $769,406, or 2.03% of net sales, in fiscal 2002 from $660,016, or 1.93% of net sales, in fiscal 2001. This increase was primarily due to the increase in membership fees across all member categories beginning with renewals on October 1, 2000, averaging approximately five dollars per member; additional membership sign ups at the 29 new warehouses opened in fiscal 2002; and increased penetration of the Companys Executive Membership. Overall, member renewal rates remained consistent with the prior year, currently at 86%. 13 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Gross margin (defined as net sales minus merchandise costs) increased 13% to $4,009,972, or 10.55% of net sales, in fiscal 2002 from $3,538,881, or 10.37% of net sales, in fiscal 2001. The increase in gross margin as a percentage of net sales reflects merchandise gross margin improvement within the Companys core merchandising business, with fresh foods and foods and sundries categories being the primary contributors. Additionally, a reduction in the LIFO reserve, improved purchasing resulting from expanded depot operations and improved international operations had a positive effect on margins, while increased costs related to the Executive Membership Two Percent Reward Program had a negative impact. The gross margin figures reflect accounting for most U.S. merchandise inventories on the last in, first out (LIFO) method. The effect of the LIFO adjustment for fiscal 2002 was to increase gross margin by $13,500, compared to a gross margin decrease of $5,500 in fiscal 2001. If all inventories had been valued using the first in, first out (FIFO) method, inventories would have been higher by $150 at September 1, 2002 and $13,650 at September 2, 2001. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales increased to 9.41% during fiscal 2002 from 9.17% during fiscal 2001. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales was primarily due to higher expense ratios at new warehouses, where such expense ratios to sales are typically higher than at more mature warehouses; and also due to increases in salary, healthcare and workers compensation costs. Preopening expenses totaled $51,257, or 0.13% of net sales, during fiscal 2002 and $59,571, or 0.17% of net sales, during fiscal 2001. During fiscal 2002, the Company opened 35 new warehouses (including relocations) compared to 39 new warehouses (including relocations) during fiscal 2001. Pre opening expenses also include costs related to remodels and expanded ancillary operations at existing warehouses, as well as expanded international operations. The provision for impaired assets and closing costs was $21,050 in fiscal 2002 compared to $18,000 in fiscal 2001. The fiscal 2002 provision included charges of $7,765 for the Canadian administrative reorganization (See Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources) and $13,683 for warehouse closing expenses which were offset by net gains on the sale of real property totaling $398. The fiscal 2001 provision included charges of $19,000 for the Canadian administrative reorganization, $15,231 for the impairment of long lived assets and $2,412 for warehouse closing expense, which were offset by $18,643 of gains on the sale of real property. At September 1, 2002, the reserve for warehouse closing costs was $11,845, of which $10,395 related to future lease obligations. This compares to a reserve for warehouse closing costs of $15,434 at September 1, 2001, of which $6,538 related to future lease obligations. The increase in future lease obligations is attributable to leased warehouses constituting a larger percentage of the closed locations. (See Part II, 
 
Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) costs related to remodels and expanded ancillary operations at existing warehouses, as well as expanded international operations. The provision for impaired assets and closing costs was $19,500 in fiscal 2003 compared to $21,050 in fiscal 2002. The provision includes costs related to impairment of long lived assets, future lease obligations of warehouses that have been relocated to new facilities and any losses or gains resulting from the sale of real property. The provision for fiscal 2003 included charges of $11,836 for warehouse closing expenses, $4,697 for impairment of long lived assets and $2,967 for net losses on the sale of real property. The fiscal 2002 provision included charges of $13,683 for warehouse closing expenses and $7,765 for Canadian administrative reorganization, which were offset by $398 of net gains on the sale of real property. At August 31, 2003 the reserve for warehouse closing costs was $8,609, of which $7,833 related to lease obligations. This compares to a reserve for warehouse closing costs of $11,845 at September 1, 2002, of which $10,395 related to lease obligations. Interest expense totaled $36,920 in fiscal 2003, and $29,096 in fiscal 2002. Interest expense in fiscal 2003 includes interest on the 3 1/2% Zero Coupon Notes, 7 1/8% and 5 1/2% Senior Notes and on balances outstanding under the Companys bank credit facilities and promissory notes. The increase is primarily related to the reduction in interest capitalized related to warehouse construction, as the overall cost of projects under construction was lower than in fiscal 2002. The increase was also attributed to the Companys issuance of $300,000 5 1/2% Senior Notes in March 2002, which were simultaneously swapped to a floating interest rate. This increase was partially offset by an interest rate reduction in the Companys $300,000 7 1/8% Senior Notes, resulting from interest rate swap agreements entered into effective November 13, 2001, converting the interest rate from fixed to floating, and to the fact that the Company had little interest expense related to borrowings under its commercial paper program in fiscal 2003. Interest income and other totaled $38,525 in fiscal 2003, compared to $35,745 in fiscal 2002.

Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) The effective income tax rate on earnings was 38.5% in fiscal 2002 and 40% in fiscal 2001. The decrease in the effective income tax rate, year over year, is primarily attributable to lower statutory rates for foreign operations, the effect of which is expected, substantially, to continue to impact the effective tax rate on a prospective basis. Liquidity and Capital Resources (dollars in thousands) Expansion Plans Costcos primary requirement for capital is the financing of the land, building and equipment costs for new warehouses plus the costs of initial warehouse operations and working capital requirements, as well as additional capital for international expansion through investments in foreign subsidiaries and joint ventures. While there can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized, and plans are subject to change upon further review, it is managements current intention to spend an aggregate of approximately $900,000 to $1,000,000 during fiscal 2004 in the United States and Canada for real estate, construction, remodeling and equipment for warehouse clubs and related operations; and approximately $75,000 to $125,000 for international expansion, including the United Kingdom, Asia, Mexico and other potential ventures. These expenditures will be financed with a combination of cash provided from operations, the use of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments, short term borrowings under the Companys commercial paper program and other financing sources as required. Expansion plans for the United States and Canada during fiscal 2004 are to open approximately 25 new warehouse clubs, including two relocations to larger and better located warehouses. The Company expects to continue its review of expansion plans in its international operations in existing markets including the United Kingdom and in Asia along with other international markets. Costco and its Mexico based joint venture partner, Controladora Comercial Mexicana, each own a 50% interest in Costco Mexico. As of August 31, 2003, Costco Mexico operated 21 warehouses in Mexico and planned to open two new warehouse clubs during fiscal 2004. Reorganization of Canadian Administrative Operations On January 17, 2001, the Company announced plans to reorganize and consolidate the administration of its operations in Canada. Total costs related to the reorganization were $26,765 pre tax, of which $7,765 pre tax ($4,775 after tax, or $.01 per diluted share) was expensed in fiscal 2002 and $19,000 pre tax ($11,400 after tax, or $.02 per diluted share) was expensed in fiscal 2001 and reported as part of the provision for impaired assets and closing costs. These costs consisted primarily of employee severance, implementation and consolidation of support systems and employee relocation. The reorganization was completed in the first quarter of fiscal 2002. Bank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs (all amounts stated in thousands of US dollars) The Company has in place a $500,000 commercial paper program supported by a $300,000 bank credit facility with a group of ten banks, of which $150,000 expires on November 9, 2004 and $150,000 expires on November 15, 2005. At August 31, 2003, no amounts were outstanding under the commercial paper program and no amounts were outstanding under the credit facility. A wholly owned Canadian subsidiary has a $144,000 commercial paper program supported by a $43,000 bank credit facility with a Canadian bank, which expires in March 2004. At August 31, 2003, no amounts were outstanding under the Canadian commercial paper program or the bank credit facility. The Company has agreed to limit the combined amount outstanding under the U.S. and Canadian commercial paper programs to the $343,000 combined amounts of the supporting bank credit facilities. The Companys wholly owned Japanese subsidiary has a short term &yen;3 billion ($25,782) bank line of credit, which expires in November 2004. At August 31, 2003, no amounts were outstanding under the line of credit. 15 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) The Companys UK subsidiary has a &pound;60 million ($94,842) bank revolving credit facility and a &pound;20 million ($31,614) bank overdraft facility, both expiring in February 2007. At August 31, 2003, $47,421 was outstanding under the revolving credit facility with an applicable interest rate of 4.413% and no amounts were outstanding under the bank overdraft facility. Letters of Credit The Company has letter of credit facilities (for commercial and standby letters of credit), totaling approximately $369,000. The outstanding commitments under these facilities at August 31, 2003 totaled approximately $125,000, including approximately $44,000 in standby letters of credit. Contractual Obligations The Companys commitment to make future payments under long term contractual obligations was as follows, as of August 31, 2003. Payments Due by Period Contractual obligations Total Less than1 year 1 to 3years 4 to 5years After 5 years Long term debt(1) $ 1,702,618 (2) $ 44,368 $ 361,542 $ 379,528 $ 917,180 (2) Capital lease obligations 12,116 6,427 2,250 1,115 2,324 Operating leases 1,405,262 (3) 85,862 173,996 162,101 983,303 Total $ 3,119,996 $ 136,657 $ 537,788 $ 542,744 $ 1,902,807 (1) Amounts include contractual interest payments. (2) The amount includes interest accreted to maturity for the Companys Zero Coupon 3 1/2% Convertible Subordinated Notes due August 2017, totaling $851,860. The consolidated balance sheet as of August 31, 2003 reflects the current balance outstanding of $524,735. (3) Operating lease obligations have been reduced by $142,975 to reflect sub lease income. Financing Activities In April 2003, the Companys wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.92% in the aggregate amount of approximately $34,376, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due on April 26, 2010. In November 2002, the Companys wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.88% in the aggregate amount of approximately $25,782, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due on November 7, 2009. In March 2002, the Company issued $300,000 of 5 1/2% Senior Notes due March 15, 2007. Interest is payable semi annually. Simultaneous with the issuance of the Senior Notes, the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements converting the interest from fixed to floating. In February 1996, the Company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a shelf registration statement for $500,000 of senior debt securities. On October 23, 2001, additional debt securities of $100,000 were registered, bringing the total amount of debt registered under the shelf registration to $600,000. The $300,000 of 5 1/2% Senior Notes issued in March 2002 reduced the amount of registered securities available for future issuance to $300,000. 16 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Derivatives The Company has limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and uses them only to manage well defined interest rate and foreign exchange risks. Forward foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on inventory purchases and typically have very short terms. The aggregate amount of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at August 31, 2003 was not material. The only significant derivative instruments the Company holds are interest rate swaps, which the Company uses to manage the interest rate risk associated with its borrowings and to manage the Companys mix of fixed and variable rate debt. As of August 31, 2003, the Company had fixed to floating interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $600,000 and an aggregate fair value of $34,204, which is recorded in other assets. These swaps were entered into effective November 13, 2001, and March 25, 2002, and are designated and qualify as fair value hedges of the Companys $300,000 7 1/8% Senior Notes and the Companys $300,000 5 1/2% Senior Notes, respectively. As the terms of the swaps match those of the underlying hedged debt, the changes in the fair value of these swaps are offset by corresponding changes in the carrying amount of the hedged debt, and result in no net earnings impact. Financial Position and Cash Flows Working capital totaled $700,431 at August 31, 2003, compared to $180,806 at September 1, 2002. The increase of $519,625 was primarily due to an increase in cash and cash equivalents of $739,921, an increase in receivables of $81,229 and a reduction in short term borrowing of $56,353, which was offset by increases in accrued salaries and benefits and in other current liabilities of $144,334 and $141,381, respectively, and a decrease in net inventory levels (inventories less accounts payable) of $34,844. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $1,507,208 in fiscal 2003, compared to $1,018,243 in fiscal 2002. The increase of $488,965 is primarily a result of a decrease in the change in net inventories (inventories less accounts payable) of $256,288; an increase in the change in the aggregation of receivables, other current assets, deferred income and accrued and other current liabilities of $102,284, an increase in the change in deferred income taxes of $56,514 and an increase in depreciation and amortization of $49,521 between fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002. Net cash used in investing activities totaled $790,588 in fiscal 2003, compared to $1,033,815 in fiscal 2002, a decrease of $243,227. This decrease is primarily a result of a reduction in the acquisition of property and equipment and the construction of facilities for new and remodeled warehouses of $227,940 and an increase in the proceeds received from the sale of property and equipment between fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002 of $18,980. Net cash used in financing activities totaled $1,428 in fiscal 2003 compared to cash provided by financing activities of $217,828 in fiscal 2002, a decrease of $219,256. The decrease in cash provided by financing activities primarily resulted from a decrease in net proceeds from the issuance of long term debt of $240,576 and a reduction in proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $32,104 offset by a decrease in repayments of short term borrowings of $41,031 between fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002. Stock Repurchase Program On November 30, 2001, the Companys Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program, authorizing the repurchase of up to $500,000 of Costco Common Stock through November 30, 2004. Under the program, the Company can repurchase shares at any time in the open market or in private transactions as market conditions warrant. The repurchased shares would constitute authorized, but non issued shares and would be used for general corporate purposes, including stock option grants under stock option programs. To date, no shares have been repurchased under this program. 17 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Additional Equity Investments in Subsidiary Subsequent to Year End Subsequent to the Companys fiscal year end, the Company, on October 3, 2003 acquired from Carrefour Nederland B.V. its 20% equity interest in Costco Wholesale UK Limited for cash of approximately $95,000, bringing Costcos ownership in Costco Wholesale UK Limited to 100%. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the Companys financial statements requires that management make estimates and judgments that affect the financial position and results of operations. Management continues to review its accounting policies and evaluate its estimates, including those related to merchandise inventory, impairment of long lived assets and warehouse closing costs and insurance/self insurance liabilities. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the present circumstances. Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market as determined primarily by the retail method of accounting and are stated using the last in, first out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail method of accounting, and are stated using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. The Company believes the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. The Company records an adjustment each quarter for the expected annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end. The Company considers in its calculation of the LIFO cost the estimated net realizable value of inventory in those inventory pools where deflation exists and records a write down of inventory where estimated net realizable value is less than LIFO inventory. The Company provides for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts on the basis of a percentage of sales. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect the trend of the actual physical inventory count results, which generally occur in the second and fourth fiscal quarters. Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates earned when those rebates are deemed to be probable and reasonably estimable. Other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of agreement, or other systematic and rational approach. Impairment of long lived assets and warehouse closing costs The Company periodically evaluates its long lived assets for indicators of impairment. Managements judgments are based on market and operational conditions at the present time. Future events could cause management to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring an adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value. The Company provides estimates for warehouse closing costs when it is appropriate to do so based on accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Future circumstances may result in the Companys actual future closing costs or the amount recognized upon the sale of the property to differ substantially from the original estimates. Insurance/Self Insurance Liabilities The Company uses a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms to provide for the potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property insurance, director and officers liability, vehicle liability and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by the Company 18 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience and outside expertise, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143 (SFAS No. 143), Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, which provides the accounting requirements for retirement obligations associated with tangible long lived assets. SFAS No. 143 requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred. SFAS No. 143 was effective for the Companys 2003 fiscal year. The adoption of SFAS No. 143 did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, effective for the Companys 2003 fiscal year. This Statement supersedes FASB Statement No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of and other related accounting guidance. The adoption of SFAS No. 144 did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. This statement addresses financial accounting and reporting of costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 94 3, Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (Including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring). This statement requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity should be recognized at fair value when the liability is incurred. SFAS No. 146 was effective for the Companys 2003 fiscal year. The adoption of SFAS No. 146 did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows, other than to impact the timing of charges related to future warehouse relocations. In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure, which provides guidance for transition to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the required financial statement disclosure. Effective September 3, 2002 the Company adopted the fair value based method of accounting for stock based compensation. See Note (1) and Note (5) of the Companys consolidated financial statements. In November 2002, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. This interpretation established financial statement disclosure requirements for companies that enter into or modify certain types of guarantees subsequent to December 31, 2002. Beginning in calendar 2003, the standard requires that companies record the fair value of certain types of guarantees as a liability in the financial statements. The adoption of this interpretation did not have a material impact on the Companys results of operations, consolidated financial position or cash flows. In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. In general, a variable interest entity is a corporation, partnership, trust, or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either does not have equity investors with voting rights or has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities. Interpretation No. 46 requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entitys activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entitys residual returns or both. The consolidation requirements of Interpretation No. 46 apply immediately to variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003. The consolidation requirements apply to older entities in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after June 15, 2003. Certain of the disclosure requirements apply in all financial statements issued after January 31, 2003, regardless of when the variable interest entity was established. The adoption 19 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) of this interpretation did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. In November 2002, the EITF reached a consensus on EITF 00 21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables, with respect to determining when and how to allocate revenue from sales with multiple deliverables. The EITF 00 21 consensus provides a framework for determining when and how to allocate revenue from sales with multiple deliverables based on a determination of whether the multiple deliverables qualify to be accounted for as separate units of accounting. The consensus is effective prospectively for arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2003. The adoption of this consensus did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. In November 2002, the EITF reached consensus on certain issues discussed in EITF 02 16, Accounting by a Customer (Including a Reseller) for Certain Consideration Received from a Vendor, with respect to determining how a reseller should characterize consideration received from a vendor and when to recognize and how to measure that consideration in its income statement. Requirements for recognizing volume based rebates are effective for arrangements entered into or modified after November 21, 2002, and resellers with other supplier payments should generally apply the new rules prospectively for agreements entered into or modified after December 31, 2002. The adoption of this consensus did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows in fiscal 2003. However, the Company does expect the adoption of this consensus to impact interim quarterly financial information, commencing with the first quarter of fiscal 2004, as the application of the consensus will result in a change in the timing for the recognition of some vendor allowances for certain agreements entered into subsequent to December 31, 2002. Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure of Market Risk The Company is exposed to financial market risk resulting from changes in interest and currency rates. As a policy, the Company does not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions, nor hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. The nature and amount of the Companys long and short term debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As of August 31, 2003, the Companys fixed rate long term debt includes its $851,860 principal amount at maturity Zero Coupon Subordinated Notes and additional notes and capital lease obligations totaling $137,761. The Companys debt also includes $300,000 7 1/8% Senior Notes and $300,000 5 1/2% Senior Notes. The Company has entered into fixed to floating interest rate swaps on the Senior Notes, effectively converting these fixed interest rate securities to variable rate securities. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt and may affect the interest expense related to the variable rate debt. The Company holds interest bearing instruments that are classified as cash and cash equivalents. As these investments are of a short term nature, if interest rates were to increase or decrease immediately, there is no material risk of a valuation adjustment related to these instruments. In addition, changes in interest rates would not likely have a material impact on interest income. Most foreign currency transactions have been conducted in local currencies, limiting the Companys exposure to changes in currency rates. The Company periodically enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates on inventory purchases. The fair value of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at August 31, 2003 was not material to the Companys results of operations or its financial position. 20 Table of Contents 
 
Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) The Companys UK subsidiary has a &pound;60 million ($94,842) bank revolving credit facility and a &pound;20 million ($31,614) bank overdraft facility, both expiring in February 2007. At August 31, 2003, $47,421 was outstanding under the revolving credit facility with an applicable interest rate of 4.413% and no amounts were outstanding under the bank overdraft facility. Letters of Credit The Company has letter of credit facilities (for commercial and standby letters of credit), totaling approximately $369,000. The outstanding commitments under these facilities at August 31, 2003 totaled approximately $125,000, including approximately $44,000 in standby letters of credit. Contractual Obligations The Companys commitment to make future payments under long term contractual obligations was as follows, as of August 31, 2003. Payments Due by Period Contractual obligations Total Less than1 year 1 to 3years 4 to 5years After 5 years Long term debt(1) $ 1,702,618 (2) $ 44,368 $ 361,542 $ 379,528 $ 917,180 (2) Capital lease obligations 12,116 6,427 2,250 1,115 2,324 Operating leases 1,405,262 (3) 85,862 173,996 162,101 983,303 Total $ 3,119,996 $ 136,657 $ 537,788 $ 542,744 $ 1,902,807 (1) Amounts include contractual interest payments. (2) The amount includes interest accreted to maturity for the Companys Zero Coupon 3 1/2% Convertible Subordinated Notes due August 2017, totaling $851,860. The consolidated balance sheet as of August 31, 2003 reflects the current balance outstanding of $524,735. (3) Operating lease obligations have been reduced by $142,975 to reflect sub lease income. Financing Activities In April 2003, the Companys wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.92% in the aggregate amount of approximately $34,376, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due on April 26, 2010. In November 2002, the Companys wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.88% in the aggregate amount of approximately $25,782, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due on November 7, 2009. In March 2002, the Company issued $300,000 of 5 1/2% Senior Notes due March 15, 2007. Interest is payable semi annually. Simultaneous with the issuance of the Senior Notes, the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements converting the interest from fixed to floating. In February 1996, the Company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a shelf registration statement for $500,000 of senior debt securities. On October 23, 2001, additional debt securities of $100,000 were registered, bringing the total amount of debt registered under the shelf registration to $600,000. The $300,000 of 5 1/2% Senior Notes issued in March 2002 reduced the amount of registered securities available for future issuance to $300,000. 16 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Derivatives The Company has limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and uses them only to manage well defined interest rate and foreign exchange risks. Forward foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on inventory purchases and typically have very short terms. The aggregate amount of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at August 31, 2003 was not material. The only significant derivative instruments the Company holds are interest rate swaps, which the Company uses to manage the interest rate risk associated with its borrowings and to manage the Companys mix of fixed and variable rate debt. As of August 31, 2003, the Company had fixed to floating interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $600,000 and an aggregate fair value of $34,204, which is recorded in other assets. These swaps were entered into effective November 13, 2001, and March 25, 2002, and are designated and qualify as fair value hedges of the Companys $300,000 7 1/8% Senior Notes and the Companys $300,000 5 1/2% Senior Notes, respectively. As the terms of the swaps match those of the underlying hedged debt, the changes in the fair value of these swaps are offset by corresponding changes in the carrying amount of the hedged debt, and result in no net earnings impact. Financial Position and Cash Flows Working capital totaled $700,431 at August 31, 2003, compared to $180,806 at September 1, 2002. The increase of $519,625 was primarily due to an increase in cash and cash equivalents of $739,921, an increase in receivables of $81,229 and a reduction in short term borrowing of $56,353, which was offset by increases in accrued salaries and benefits and in other current liabilities of $144,334 and $141,381, respectively, and a decrease in net inventory levels (inventories less accounts payable) of $34,844. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $1,507,208 in fiscal 2003, compared to $1,018,243 in fiscal 2002. The increase of $488,965 is primarily a result of a decrease in the change in net inventories (inventories less accounts payable) of $256,288; an increase in the change in the aggregation of receivables, other current assets, deferred income and accrued and other current liabilities of $102,284, an increase in the change in deferred income taxes of $56,514 and an increase in depreciation and amortization of $49,521 between fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002. Net cash used in investing activities totaled $790,588 in fiscal 2003, compared to $1,033,815 in fiscal 2002, a decrease of $243,227. This decrease is primarily a result of a reduction in the acquisition of property and equipment and the construction of facilities for new and remodeled warehouses of $227,940 and an increase in the proceeds received from the sale of property and equipment between fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002 of $18,980. Net cash used in financing activities totaled $1,428 in fiscal 2003 compared to cash provided by financing activities of $217,828 in fiscal 2002, a decrease of $219,256. The decrease in cash provided by financing activities primarily resulted from a decrease in net proceeds from the issuance of long term debt of $240,576 and a reduction in proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $32,104 offset by a decrease in repayments of short term borrowings of $41,031 between fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002. Stock Repurchase Program On November 30, 2001, the Companys Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program, authorizing the repurchase of up to $500,000 of Costco Common Stock through November 30, 2004. Under the program, the Company can repurchase shares at any time in the open market or in private transactions as market conditions warrant. The repurchased shares would constitute authorized, but non issued shares and would be used for general corporate purposes, including stock option grants under stock option programs. To date, no shares have been repurchased under this program. 17 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Additional Equity Investments in Subsidiary Subsequent to Year End Subsequent to the Companys fiscal year end, the Company, on October 3, 2003 acquired from Carrefour Nederland B.V. its 20% equity interest in Costco Wholesale UK Limited for cash of approximately $95,000, bringing Costcos ownership in Costco Wholesale UK Limited to 100%. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the Companys financial statements requires that management make estimates and judgments that affect the financial position and results of operations. Management continues to review its accounting policies and evaluate its estimates, including those related to merchandise inventory, impairment of long lived assets and warehouse closing costs and insurance/self insurance liabilities. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the present circumstances. Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market as determined primarily by the retail method of accounting and are stated using the last in, first out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail method of accounting, and are stated using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. The Company believes the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. The Company records an adjustment each quarter for the expected annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end. The Company considers in its calculation of the LIFO cost the estimated net realizable value of inventory in those inventory pools where deflation exists and records a write down of inventory where estimated net realizable value is less than LIFO inventory. The Company provides for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts on the basis of a percentage of sales. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect the trend of the actual physical inventory count results, which generally occur in the second and fourth fiscal quarters. Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates earned when those rebates are deemed to be probable and reasonably estimable. Other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of agreement, or other systematic and rational approach. Impairment of long lived assets and warehouse closing costs The Company periodically evaluates its long lived assets for indicators of impairment. Managements judgments are based on market and operational conditions at the present time. Future events could cause management to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring an adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value. The Company provides estimates for warehouse closing costs when it is appropriate to do so based on accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Future circumstances may result in the Companys actual future closing costs or the amount recognized upon the sale of the property to differ substantially from the original estimates. Insurance/Self Insurance Liabilities The Company uses a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms to provide for the potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property insurance, director and officers liability, vehicle liability and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by the Company 18 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience and outside expertise, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143 (SFAS No. 143), Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, which provides the accounting requirements for retirement obligations associated with tangible long lived assets. SFAS No. 143 requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred. SFAS No. 143 was effective for the Companys 2003 fiscal year. The adoption of SFAS No. 143 did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, effective for the Companys 2003 fiscal year. This Statement supersedes FASB Statement No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of and other related accounting guidance. The adoption of SFAS No. 144 did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. This statement addresses financial accounting and reporting of costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 94 3, Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (Including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring). This statement requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity should be recognized at fair value when the liability is incurred. SFAS No. 146 was effective for the Companys 2003 fiscal year. The adoption of SFAS No. 146 did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows, other than to impact the timing of charges related to future warehouse relocations. In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure, which provides guidance for transition to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the required financial statement disclosure. Effective September 3, 2002 the Company adopted the fair value based method of accounting for stock based compensation. See Note (1) and Note (5) of the Companys consolidated financial statements. In November 2002, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. This interpretation established financial statement disclosure requirements for companies that enter into or modify certain types of guarantees subsequent to December 31, 2002. Beginning in calendar 2003, the standard requires that companies record the fair value of certain types of guarantees as a liability in the financial statements. The adoption of this interpretation did not have a material impact on the Companys results of operations, consolidated financial position or cash flows. In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. In general, a variable interest entity is a corporation, partnership, trust, or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either does not have equity investors with voting rights or has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities. Interpretation No. 46 requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entitys activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entitys residual returns or both. The consolidation requirements of Interpretation No. 46 apply immediately to variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003. The consolidation requirements apply to older entities in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after June 15, 2003. Certain of the disclosure requirements apply in all financial statements issued after January 31, 2003, regardless of when the variable interest entity was established. The adoption 19 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) of this interpretation did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. In November 2002, the EITF reached a consensus on EITF 00 21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables, with respect to determining when and how to allocate revenue from sales with multiple deliverables. The EITF 00 21 consensus provides a framework for determining when and how to allocate revenue from sales with multiple deliverables based on a determination of whether the multiple deliverables qualify to be accounted for as separate units of accounting. The consensus is effective prospectively for arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2003.

However, the Company does expect the adoption of this consensus to impact interim quarterly financial information, commencing with the first quarter of fiscal 2004, as the application of the consensus will result in a change in the timing for the recognition of some vendor allowances for certain agreements entered into subsequent to December 31, 2002. Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure of Market Risk The Company is exposed to financial market risk resulting from changes in interest and currency rates. As a policy, the Company does not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions, nor hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. The nature and amount of the Companys long and short term debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As of August 31, 2003, the Companys fixed rate long term debt includes its $851,860 principal amount at maturity Zero Coupon Subordinated Notes and additional notes and capital lease obligations totaling $137,761. The Companys debt also includes $300,000 7 1/8% Senior Notes and $300,000 5 1/2% Senior Notes. The Company has entered into fixed to floating interest rate swaps on the Senior Notes, effectively converting these fixed interest rate securities to variable rate securities. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt and may affect the interest expense related to the variable rate debt.

Future events could cause management to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring an adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value. The Company provides estimates for warehouse closing costs when it is appropriate to do so based on accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Future circumstances may result in the Companys actual future closing costs or the amount recognized upon the sale of the property to differ substantially from the original estimates. Insurance/Self Insurance Liabilities The Company uses a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms to provide for the potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property insurance, director and officers liability, vehicle liability and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by the Company 18 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience and outside expertise, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143 (SFAS No. 143), Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, which provides the accounting requirements for retirement obligations associated with tangible long lived assets. SFAS No. 143 requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred. SFAS No. 143 was effective for the Companys 2003 fiscal year. The adoption of SFAS No. 143 did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, effective for the Companys 2003 fiscal year. This Statement supersedes FASB Statement No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of and other related accounting guidance. The adoption of SFAS No. 144 did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. This statement addresses financial accounting and reporting of costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 94 3, Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (Including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring). This statement requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity should be recognized at fair value when the liability is incurred. SFAS No. 146 was effective for the Companys 2003 fiscal year. The adoption of SFAS No. 146 did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows, other than to impact the timing of charges related to future warehouse relocations. In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure, which provides guidance for transition to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the required financial statement disclosure. Effective September 3, 2002 the Company adopted the fair value based method of accounting for stock based compensation. See Note (1) and Note (5) of the Companys consolidated financial statements. In November 2002, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. This interpretation established financial statement disclosure requirements for companies that enter into or modify certain types of guarantees subsequent to December 31, 2002. Beginning in calendar 2003, the standard requires that companies record the fair value of certain types of guarantees as a liability in the financial statements. The adoption of this interpretation did not have a material impact on the Companys results of operations, consolidated financial position or cash flows. In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. In general, a variable interest entity is a corporation, partnership, trust, or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either does not have equity investors with voting rights or has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities. Interpretation No. 46 requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entitys activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entitys residual returns or both. The consolidation requirements of Interpretation No. 46 apply immediately to variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003. The consolidation requirements apply to older entities in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after June 15, 2003. Certain of the disclosure requirements apply in all financial statements issued after January 31, 2003, regardless of when the variable interest entity was established. The adoption 19 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) of this interpretation did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. In November 2002, the EITF reached a consensus on EITF 00 21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables, with respect to determining when and how to allocate revenue from sales with multiple deliverables. The EITF 00 21 consensus provides a framework for determining when and how to allocate revenue from sales with multiple deliverables based on a determination of whether the multiple deliverables qualify to be accounted for as separate units of accounting. The consensus is effective prospectively for arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2003. The adoption of this consensus did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. In November 2002, the EITF reached consensus on certain issues discussed in EITF 02 16, Accounting by a Customer (Including a Reseller) for Certain Consideration Received from a Vendor, with respect to determining how a reseller should characterize consideration received from a vendor and when to recognize and how to measure that consideration in its income statement. Requirements for recognizing volume based rebates are effective for arrangements entered into or modified after November 21, 2002, and resellers with other supplier payments should generally apply the new rules prospectively for agreements entered into or modified after December 31, 2002. The adoption of this consensus did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows in fiscal 2003. However, the Company does expect the adoption of this consensus to impact interim quarterly financial information, commencing with the first quarter of fiscal 2004, as the application of the consensus will result in a change in the timing for the recognition of some vendor allowances for certain agreements entered into subsequent to December 31, 2002. Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure of Market Risk The Company is exposed to financial market risk resulting from changes in interest and currency rates. As a policy, the Company does not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions, nor hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. The nature and amount of the Companys long and short term debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As of August 31, 2003, the Companys fixed rate long term debt includes its $851,860 principal amount at maturity Zero Coupon Subordinated Notes and additional notes and capital lease obligations totaling $137,761. The Companys debt also includes $300,000 7 1/8% Senior Notes and $300,000 5 1/2% Senior Notes. The Company has entered into fixed to floating interest rate swaps on the Senior Notes, effectively converting these fixed interest rate securities to variable rate securities. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt and may affect the interest expense related to the variable rate debt. The Company holds interest bearing instruments that are classified as cash and cash equivalents. As these investments are of a short term nature, if interest rates were to increase or decrease immediately, there is no material risk of a valuation adjustment related to these instruments. In addition, changes in interest rates would not likely have a material impact on interest income. Most foreign currency transactions have been conducted in local currencies, limiting the Companys exposure to changes in currency rates. The Company periodically enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates on inventory purchases. The fair value of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at August 31, 2003 was not material to the Companys results of operations or its financial position. 20 Table of Contents 
 
Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Additional Equity Investments in Subsidiary Subsequent to Year End Subsequent to the Companys fiscal year end, the Company, on October 3, 2003 acquired from Carrefour Nederland B.V. its 20% equity interest in Costco Wholesale UK Limited for cash of approximately $95,000, bringing Costcos ownership in Costco Wholesale UK Limited to 100%. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the Companys financial statements requires that management make estimates and judgments that affect the financial position and results of operations. Management continues to review its accounting policies and evaluate its estimates, including those related to merchandise inventory, impairment of long lived assets and warehouse closing costs and insurance/self insurance liabilities. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the present circumstances. Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market as determined primarily by the retail method of accounting and are stated using the last in, first out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail method of accounting, and are stated using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. The Company believes the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. The Company records an adjustment each quarter for the expected annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end. The Company considers in its calculation of the LIFO cost the estimated net realizable value of inventory in those inventory pools where deflation exists and records a write down of inventory where estimated net realizable value is less than LIFO inventory. The Company provides for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts on the basis of a percentage of sales. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect the trend of the actual physical inventory count results, which generally occur in the second and fourth fiscal quarters. Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates earned when those rebates are deemed to be probable and reasonably estimable. Other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of agreement, or other systematic and rational approach. Impairment of long lived assets and warehouse closing costs The Company periodically evaluates its long lived assets for indicators of impairment. Managements judgments are based on market and operational conditions at the present time. Future events could cause management to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring an adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value. The Company provides estimates for warehouse closing costs when it is appropriate to do so based on accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Future circumstances may result in the Companys actual future closing costs or the amount recognized upon the sale of the property to differ substantially from the original estimates. Insurance/Self Insurance Liabilities The Company uses a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms to provide for the potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property insurance, director and officers liability, vehicle liability and employee health care benefits.
