Executive Overview and Selected Consolidated Statements of Income Data (dollars in thousands, except earnings per share) Overview Costco operates membership warehouses based on the concept that offering members very low prices on a limited selection of nationally branded and selected private label products in a wide range of merchandise categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover. This rapid inventory turnover, when combined with the operating efficiencies achieved by volume purchasing, efficient distribution and reduced handling of merchandise in no frills, self service warehouse facilities, enables Costco to operate profitably at significantly lower gross margins than traditional wholesalers, discount retailers and supermarkets. Key items for fiscal year 2004 included: Net sales increased 13.1% over the prior year, driven by an increase in comparable sales of 10% and the opening of 20 new warehouses; Membership fees for fiscal 2004 increased 12.7% to $961,280 representing new member sign ups at new warehouses opened during the fiscal year, increasing penetration of the Companys Executive Membership program, and continued strong member renewal rates; Gross margin (net sales less merchandise costs) improved three basis points as a percent of net sales over the prior year, resulting in part from a fourteen basis point improvement in margin in merchandise and ancillary departments; Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales improved eight basis points over the prior year, largely due to higher sales, changes to our health care plans and a flattening of the rising trend in our workers compensation costs; Net income for fiscal 2004 increased 22.4% to $882,393, or $1.85 per diluted share; and For the first time, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend, and the Company issued quarterly dividends in the third and fourth quarters of $0.10 per share. 13 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) SELECTED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME DATA The table below presents selected operational data, the percentage relationship between net sales and major categories in the Consolidated Statements of Income and the percentage change in the dollar amounts of each of the items. Percent of Net Sales Percentage Increase/(Decrease) (of dollar amounts) Fiscal 2004 Fiscal 2003 Fiscal 2002 Fiscal 2004vs. Fiscal 2003 Fiscal 2003 vs. Fiscal 2002 Net sales 100.00 % 100.00 % 100.00 % 13.1 % 9.7 % Membership fees 2.04 2.05 2.03 12.7 10.8 Gross margin (a) 10.72 10.69 10.55 13.4 11.2 Selling, general and administrative 9.75 9.83 9.41 12.2 14.6 Preopening expenses 0.07 0.09 0.13 (16.9 ) (28.5 ) Provision for impaired assets and closing costs, net 0.05 0.06 (94.9 ) (7.4 ) Operating income 2.94 2.77 2.98 19.8 2.2 Interest expense (0.08 ) (0.08 ) (0.08 ) (0.7 ) 26.9 Interest income and other 0.11 0.09 0.09 34.0 7.8 Income before income taxes 2.97 2.78 2.99 20.9 1.8 Provision for income taxes 1.10 1.05 1.15 18.5 (0.2 ) Net Income 1.87 % 1.73 % 1.84 % 22.4 % 3.0 % (a) Defined as net sales less merchandise costs. Comparison of Fiscal 2004 (52 weeks) and Fiscal 2003 (52 weeks): (dollars in thousands, except earnings per share) Net Income Net income for fiscal 2004 increased 22.4% to $882,393, or $1.85 per diluted share, from $721,000, or $1.53 per diluted share during fiscal year 2003. Net Sales Net sales increased 13.1% to $47,145,712 in fiscal 2004 from $41,692,699 in fiscal 2003. Approximately 78% of the increase was due to an increase in comparable warehouse sales, that is sales in warehouses open for at least a year. The balance of the increase was due to opening 20 new warehouses during fiscal 2004 and a net of 23 new warehouses (29 opened, 6 closed) during fiscal 2003, a portion of which is not included in comparable warehouse sales. Net sales were reduced by the implementation of Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 03 10, Application of Issue No. 02 16, Accounting by a Customer (Including a Reseller) for Certain Consideration Received from a Vendor, by Resellers to Sales Incentives Offered to Consumers by Manufacturers, which was effective at the beginning of the Companys fiscal 2004 third quarter. EITF 03 10, which primarily impacts the Companys vendor coupon programs, reduces net sales and merchandise costs by an equal amount and does not affect the Companys consolidated gross margin or net income. Had EITF 03 10 been in effect for the comparable periods in fiscal 2003, the net sales increase in fiscal 2004 would have been 13.8%. (See Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements, EITF 03 10.) For fiscal 2004, comparable sales increased 10% from fiscal 2003. Had EITF 03 10 been in effect for the comparable periods in fiscal 2003, the comparable sales increase for fiscal 2004 would have been 11%. 14 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Changes in prices of merchandise did not materially affect the sales increases, with the exception of gasoline, where price increases accounted for a sales increase of approximately 70 basis points. In addition, due to the weaker U.S. dollar throughout fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003, translation of foreign sales into U.S. dollars contributed to the increase in sales, accounting for a comparable sales increase of approximately 190 basis points year over year. Sales were also positively impacted by the supermarket strikes in Southern California during the first half of the Companys fiscal year. The positive impact to sales for the entire fiscal year was estimated to be 35 to 50 basis points. Membership Fees Membership fees increased 12.7% to $961,280, or 2.04% of net sales, in fiscal 2004 from $852,853, or 2.05% of net sales, in fiscal 2003. This increase was primarily due to additional membership sign ups at the 20 new warehouses opened in fiscal 2004; increased penetration of the Companys Executive membership, including the rollout of the program into Canada, which began in the first quarter of fiscal 2004; and high overall member renewal rates consistent with recent years, currently at 86%. Gross Margin Gross margin increased 13.4% to $5,053,696, or 10.72% of net sales, in fiscal 2004 from $4,457,316, or 10.69% of net sales, in fiscal 2003. The three basis point increase, as a percent of net sales, reflected a 14 basis point increase in gross margin in the Companys merchandise departments, helped by strong year over year gross margin gains in the Companys ancillary business operations, particularly gasoline and pharmacy. Year over year gross margin, as a percentage of net sales, was also positively impacted by the implementation of EITF 03 10, whereby net sales and merchandise costs were reduced, resulting in an eight basis point increase. The year over year gross margin percentage was reduced by 12 basis points due to the increased rewards related to the Executive Membership Two Percent Reward Program, resulting from an increase in the penetration of the Executive Member program. The gross margin figures reflect accounting for most U.S. merchandise inventories on the last in, first out (LIFO) method. Fiscal 2004 included a $6,090 LIFO charge (increase in merchandise costs), while fiscal 2003 included a $19,650 LIFO credit (reduction in merchandise costs). The impact of the LIFO adjustment on a year over year basis negatively impacted margin by an additional six basis points. If all inventories had been valued using the first in, first out (FIFO) method, inventories would have been lower by $13,410 and $19,500 at August 29, 2004 and August 31, 2003, respectively. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses as a percent of net sales decreased to 9.75% during fiscal 2004 from 9.83% during fiscal 2003. Had EITF 03 10 been in effect in fiscal 2003, SG&A expenses as a percent to net sales would have shown additional improvement of seven basis points in fiscal 2004. For fiscal 2004, warehouse and central operating costs positively impacted SG&A comparisons year over year by approximately 21 basis points, primarily due to increased expense leverage of warehouse payroll, benefits (primarily health care), utility and workers compensation costs. During the latter half of fiscal 2004, the Company implemented changes to its employee healthcare plans that reduced its overall healthcare costs, primarily in the fourth quarter. This improvement was partially offset by the seven basis point increase resulting from the adoption of EITF 03 10, a two basis point increase in expense related to the establishment of additional insurance liabilities resulting from financial difficulties being experienced by one of the Companys third party insurance providers, and an increase in stock based compensation costs following the Companys prospective adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, during fiscal 2003, of four basis points. 15 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Preopening Expenses Preopening expenses totaled $30,451, or 0.07% of net sales, during fiscal 2004 compared to $36,643, or 0.09% of net sales, during fiscal 2003. This reduction was due to fewer warehouse openings. During fiscal 2004, the Company opened 20 new warehouses compared to 29 new warehouses (including 5 relocations) during fiscal 2003. Pre opening expenses also include costs related to remodels and expanded ancillary operations at existing warehouses. Provision for Impaired Assets and Closing Costs, net The net provision for impaired assets and closing costs was $1,000 in fiscal 2004, compared to $19,500 in fiscal 2003. The provision includes costs related to impairment of long lived assets, future lease obligations of warehouses that have been relocated to new facilities, and losses or gains resulting from the sale of real property. The provision for fiscal 2004 included charges of $16,548 for warehouse closing expenses that were offset by gains of $15,548 on the sale of real property. The provision for fiscal 2003 included charges of $11,836 for warehouse closing expenses, $4,697 for impairment of long lived assets and $2,967 for net losses on the sale of real property. At August 29, 2004, the reserve for warehouse closing costs was $10,367, of which $9,184 related to future lease obligations. This compares to a reserve for warehouse closing costs of $8,609 at August 31, 2003, of which $7,833 related to future lease obligations. Interest Expense Interest expense totaled $36,651 in fiscal 2004, compared to $36,920 in fiscal 2003. Interest expense in both fiscal 2004 and 2003 includes interest on the 3 1/2% Zero Coupon Notes, 7 1/8% and 5 1/2% Senior Notes and on balances outstanding under the Companys bank credit facilities and promissory notes. The decrease was primarily a result of the Companys reduction in short term borrowings, principally related to its foreign subsidiaries. This decrease was substantially offset by increases in interest rates on the Senior Notes due to interest rate swap agreements converting the interest rate from fixed to floating. Interest Income and Other Interest income and other totaled $51,627 in fiscal 2004, compared to $38,525 in fiscal 2003. The increase primarily reflects greater interest earned on higher cash and cash equivalents balances and short term investments. In addition, a reduction in the expense to record minority interest in the earnings of foreign subsidiaries was reported in fiscal 2004 as the Company increased its ownership in Costco Wholesale UK Limited to 100%. Provision for Income Taxes The effective income tax rate on earnings was 37% in fiscal 2004 and 37.75% in fiscal 2003. The decrease in the effective income tax rate is primarily attributable to lower statutory income tax rates for foreign operations and one time benefits associated with certain tax planning strategies. Comparison of Fiscal 2003 (52 weeks) and Fiscal 2002 (52 weeks): (dollars in thousands, except earnings per share) Net Income Net income for fiscal 2003 increased 3.0% to $721,000, or $1.53 per diluted share, from $699,983, or $1.48 per diluted share during fiscal year 2002. Net Sales Net sales increased 9.7% to $41,692,699 in fiscal 2003 from $37,993,093 in fiscal 2002. Approximately 55% of the increase was due to an increase in comparable warehouse sales, that is sales in warehouses open for at 16 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) least a year, and approximately 45% of the increase was due to opening a net of 23 new warehouses (29 opened, 6 closed) during fiscal 2003 and a net of 29 new warehouses (35 opened, 6 closed) during fiscal 2002, a portion of which is not included in comparable warehouse sales. With the exception of price increases in gasoline, which accounted for a comparable sales increase of approximately 70 basis points, changes in prices of merchandise did not materially contribute to sales increases. In addition, due to the weaker U.S. dollar in fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002, translation of foreign sales into U.S. dollars contributed to the increase in sales, accounting for a comparable sales increase of approximately one percent year over year. Comparable sales increased at a five percent annual rate in fiscal 2003 compared to a six percent annual rate during fiscal 2002. Membership fees Membership fees increased 10.8% to $852,853, or 2.05% of net sales, in fiscal 2003 from $769,406, or 2.03% of net sales, in fiscal 2002. This increase was primarily due to additional membership sign ups at the 23 net new warehouses opened in fiscal 2003, and increased penetration of the Companys Executive Membership. Overall, member renewal rates remained consistent with the prior year, currently at 86%. Gross Margin Gross margin (defined as net sales minus merchandise costs) increased 11.2% to $4,457,316, or 10.69% of net sales, in fiscal 2003 from $4,009,972, or 10.55% of net sales, in fiscal 2002. The increase in gross margin as a percentage of net sales reflects merchandise gross margin improvement within the Companys ancillary warehouse businesses and international operations accounting for increases of 15 and eight basis points, respectively. Additionally, increased rewards related to the Executive Membership Two Percent Reward Program reduced gross margin by seven basis points. The gross margin figures reflect accounting for most U.S. merchandise inventories on the last in, first out (LIFO) method. The effect of the LIFO adjustment for fiscal 2003 was to increase gross margin by $19,650, compared to a gross margin increase of $13,500 in fiscal 2002. If all inventories had been valued using the first in, first out (FIFO) method, inventories would have been lower by $19,500 at August 31, 2003 and higher by $150 at September 1, 2002. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales increased to 9.83% during fiscal 2003 from 9.41% during fiscal 2002. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales was primarily due to increases in employee healthcare, workers compensation (primarily in the state of California) and salary costs within the Companys domestic operations. International expenses also increased, accounting for approximately seven basis points of the 42 basis points year over year increase. Preopening Expenses Preopening expenses totaled $36,643, or 0.09% of net sales, during fiscal 2003, compared to $51,257, or 0.13% of net sales, during fiscal 2002. During fiscal 2003, the Company opened 29 new warehouses (including five relocations) compared to 35 new warehouses (including six relocations) during fiscal 2002. Pre opening expenses also include costs related to remodels and expanded ancillary operations at existing warehouses. Provision for Impaired Assets and Closing Costs, net The net provision for impaired assets and closing costs was $19,500 in fiscal 2003 compared to $21,050 in fiscal 2002. The provision includes costs related to impairment of long lived assets, future lease obligations of warehouses that have been relocated to new facilities and any losses or gains resulting from the sale of real property. The provision for fiscal 2003 included charges of $11,836 for warehouse closing expenses, $4,697 for impairment of long lived assets and $2,967 for net losses on the sale of real property. The fiscal 2002 provision included charges of $13,683 for warehouse closing expenses and $7,765 for Canadian administrative reorganization, which were offset by $398 of net gains on the sale of real property. At August 31, 2003 the reserve for 17 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) warehouse closing costs was $8,609, of which $7,833 related to future lease obligations. This compares to a reserve for warehouse closing costs of $11,845 at September 1, 2002, of which $10,395 related to future lease obligations. Interest Expense Interest expense totaled $36,920 in fiscal 2003, compared to $29,096 in fiscal 2002. Interest expense in fiscal 2003 includes interest on the 3 1/2% Zero Coupon Notes, 7 1/8% and 5 1/2% Senior Notes and on balances outstanding under the Companys bank credit facilities and promissory notes. The increase is primarily related to the reduction in interest capitalized related to warehouse construction, as the overall cost of projects under construction was lower than in fiscal 2002. The increase was also attributed to the Companys issuance of $300,000 5 1/2% Senior Notes in March 2002, which were simultaneously swapped to a floating interest rate. This increase was partially offset by an interest rate reduction in the Companys $300,000 7 1/8% Senior Notes, resulting from interest rate swap agreements entered into effective November 13, 2001, converting the interest rate from fixed to floating, and to the fact that the Company had little interest expense related to borrowings under its commercial paper program in fiscal 2003. Interest Income and Other Interest income and other totaled $38,525 in fiscal 2003, compared to $35,745 in fiscal 2002. The increase primarily reflects greater interest earned on higher cash and cash equivalents balances on hand throughout fiscal 2003, as compared to fiscal 2002, which was partially offset by an increase in the expense to record the minority interest in earnings of foreign subsidiaries. Provision for Income Taxes The effective income tax rate on earnings was 37.75% in fiscal 2003 and 38.50% in fiscal 2002. The decrease in the effective income tax rate, year over year, is primarily attributable to lower statutory income tax rates for foreign operations. Liquidity and Capital Resources (dollars in thousands, except per share amounts) Cash Flows Cash flow generated from warehouse operations provides a significant source of liquidity. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $2,098,783 in fiscal 2004 compared to $1,507,208 in fiscal 2003. The increase of $591,575 is primarily a result of an increase in the change in receivables, other current assets, deferred income and accrued and other current liabilities of $507,860, due primarily to the collection of an operating tax receivable and increases in the workers compensation accrual, income taxes payable, executive membership two percent reward accrual and deferred membership income in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003. In addition, the increase in net income of $161,393 contributed to the increase in cash provided by operating activities. The primary investing activity continues to be the purchase of property and equipment and the construction of facilities related to the Companys warehouse expansion and remodel projects. Net cash used in investing activities totaled $1,048,481 in fiscal 2004 compared to $790,588 in fiscal 2003, an increase of $257,893. The increase in investing activities primarily relates to net purchases of short term investments of $303,945 and the purchase of the remaining 20% minority interest in Costco Wholesale UK Limited of $95,153, which was partially offset by a reduction in the acquisition of property and equipment and the construction of facilities for new and remodeled warehouses of $105,045 (from $810,665 to $705,620) between fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2004, as new warehouse openings decreased year over year from 29 (including five relocated warehouses) in fiscal 2003 to 20 in fiscal 2004. 18 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Net cash provided by financing activities totaled $209,569 in fiscal 2004 compared to net cash used of $1,428 in fiscal 2003. The increase of $210,997 primarily resulted from an increase in bank checks outstanding of $243,890 and the increase in proceeds received from the exercise of stock options of $90,077, which were offset by the payment of cash dividends in fiscal 2004 of $92,137 and from the reduction in the issuance of long term debt of $59,424 in fiscal 2003 to no additional issuances of long term debt in the current fiscal year. Dividends Costcos Board of Directors declared two quarterly cash dividends of $0.10 per share in fiscal 2004. The first quarterly cash dividend of $0.10 per share, in the amount of $45,939, was paid May 31, 2004 to shareholders of record at the close of business on May 10, 2004. The second quarterly cash dividend of $0.10 per share, in the amount of $46,198, was paid August 27, 2004, to shareholders of record at the close of business on July 23, 2004. Contractual Obligations The Companys commitment to make future payments under contractual obligations was as follows, as of August 29, 2004. Payments Due by Period Contractual obligations Total Less than 1 year 1 to 3years 4 to 5 years After 5 years Long term debt(1) $ 1,656,393 (2) $ 339,441 $ 336,632 $ 62,081 $ 918,239 (2) Capital lease obligations 5,449 1,451 1,117 1,115 1,766 Operating leases(3) 1,574,778 110,616 212,734 190,401 1,061,027 Purchase obligations (merchandise)(4) 3,509,786 3,153,157 356,629 Purchase obligations (building, equipment, services and other)(5) 232,212 213,823 16,556 1,833 Other(6) 6,235 476 594 418 4,747 Total $ 6,984,853 $ 3,818,964 $ 924,262 $ 255,848 $ 1,985,779 (1) Amounts include contractual interest payments.

(6) Primarily consists of asset retirement obligations. 19 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Expansion Plans Costcos primary requirement for capital is the financing of the land, building and equipment costs for new warehouses plus the costs of initial warehouse operations and working capital requirements, as well as additional capital for international expansion. While there can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized, and plans are subject to change upon further review, it is managements current intention to spend approximately $900,000 to $1,000,000 during fiscal 2005 in the United States and Canada for real estate, construction, remodeling and equipment for warehouse clubs and related operations; and approximately $100,000 to $150,000 for international expansion, including the United Kingdom, Asia, Mexico and other potential ventures. These expenditures are expected to be financed with a combination of cash provided from operations and the use of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. Expansion plans for the United States and Canada during fiscal 2005 are to open approximately 30 new warehouse clubs inclusive of seven relocations to larger and better located warehouses. The Company expects to continue its review of expansion plans in its international operations, including the United Kingdom and Asia, along with other international markets. At present, the Company is planning to open two additional warehouses in the U.K and one additional warehouse in both the Taiwan and Japan markets during fiscal 2005. Costco and its Mexico based joint venture partner, Controladora Comercial Mexicana, each own a 50% interest in Costco Mexico. Costco Mexico plans to open two to three new warehouse clubs during fiscal 2005. Additional Equity Investments in Subsidiary On October 3, 2003, the Company acquired from Carrefour Nederland B.V. its 20% equity interest in Costco Wholesale UK Limited for cash of $95,153, bringing Costcos ownership in Costco Wholesale UK Limited to 100%. Bank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs (all amounts stated in thousands of US dollars) The Company has a $500,000 commercial paper program supported by a $300,000 bank credit facility with a group of ten banks, of which $150,000 expired on November 9, 2004 and $150,000 expires on November 15, 2005. At August 29, 2004, no amounts were outstanding under the commercial paper program and no amounts were outstanding under the credit facility. The Company presently does not plan to renew the $150,000 portion of the credit facility that expired on November 9, 2004. A wholly owned Canadian subsidiary has a $152,000 commercial paper program supported by a $46,000 bank credit facility with a Canadian bank, that is guaranteed by the Company and expires in March 2005. At August 29, 2004, no amounts were outstanding under the Canadian commercial paper program or the bank credit facility. The Company has agreed to limit the combined amount outstanding under the U.S. and Canadian commercial paper programs to the combined amounts of the supporting bank credit facilities, which are $346,000 at August 29, 2004, decreased to $196,000 on November 9, 2004. The Companys wholly owned Japanese subsidiary has a short term $27,400 bank line of credit that originally expired in November 2004. Subsequent to the Companys fiscal year end, the bank line of credit was extended through February 10, 2005. At August 29, 2004, no amounts were outstanding under the line of credit. The Companys Korean subsidiary has a short term $10,400 bank line of credit, which expires in January 2005. At August 29, 2004, no amounts were outstanding under the line of credit. The Companys wholly owned UK subsidiary has a $108,000 bank revolving credit facility expiring in February 2007 and a $63,000 bank overdraft facility renewable on a yearly basis in March. At August 29, 2004, $21,595 was outstanding under the revolving credit facility with an applicable interest rate of 5.285% and no amounts were outstanding under the bank overdraft facility. 20 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Letters of Credit The Company has letter of credit facilities (for commercial and standby letters of credit), totaling approximately $338,000. The outstanding commitments under these facilities at August 29, 2004 totaled approximately $166,800, including approximately $52,900 in standby letters of credit. Financing Activities The Companys 7 1/8% Senior Notes of $304,350 at August 29, 2004 are due on June 15, 2005. The Company plans to repay the 7 1/8% Senior Notes from its cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances, which totaled $3,129,882 at August 29, 2004. In April 2003, the Companys wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.92% in the aggregate amount of approximately $36,576, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due on April 26, 2010. In November 2002, the Companys wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.88% in the aggregate amount of approximately $27,432, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due on November 7, 2009. The Company guarantees all of the promissory notes issued by its wholly owned Japanese subsidiary. In March 2002, the Company issued $300,000 of 5 1/2% Senior Notes due March 15, 2007. Interest is payable semi annually. Simultaneous with the issuance of the Senior Notes, the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements converting the interest from fixed to floating. In February 1996, the Company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a shelf registration statement for $500,000 of senior debt securities. On October 23, 2001, additional debt securities of $100,000 were registered. The $300,000 of 5 1/2% Senior Notes issued in March 2002 reduced the amount of registered securities available for future issuance to $300,000. Derivatives The Company has limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and uses them only to manage well defined interest rate and foreign exchange risks. Forward foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on inventory purchases and typically have very short terms. The aggregate amount of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at August 29, 2004 was not material. The only significant derivative instruments the Company holds are interest rate swaps, which the Company uses to manage the interest rate risk associated with its borrowings and to manage the Companys mix of fixed rate and variable rate debt. As of August 29, 2004, the Company had fixed to floating interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $600,000 and an aggregate fair value of $25,754, which is recorded in other assets on the Companys consolidated balance sheet. These swaps were entered into effective November 13, 2001, and March 25, 2002, and are designated and qualify as fair value hedges of the Companys $300,000 7 1/8% Senior Notes and the Companys $300,000 5 1/2% Senior Notes, respectively. As the terms of the swaps match those of the underlying hedged debt, the changes in the fair value of these swaps are offset by corresponding changes in the carrying amount of the hedged debt and result in no net earnings impact. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company has no off balance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on the Companys financial condition or consolidated financial statements. Stock Repurchase Program On November 30, 2001, the Companys Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program, authorizing the repurchase of up to $500,000 of Costco Common Stock through November 30, 2004. Under the program, 21 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) the Company could repurchase shares at any time in the open market or in private transactions as market conditions warrant. The repurchased shares would constitute authorized, but non issued shares and would be used for general corporate purposes, including stock option grants under stock option programs. On October 25, 2004, the Board of Directors renewed the program for another three years. To date, no shares have been repurchased under either program. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the Companys financial statements requires that management make estimates and judgments that affect the financial position and results of operations. Management continues to review its accounting policies and evaluate its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, merchandise inventory, impairment of long lived assets and warehouse closing costs and insurance/self insurance liabilities. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the present circumstances. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes sales, net of estimated returns, at the time customers take possession of merchandise or receive services. When the Company collects payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services, the amount received is recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed. The Company provides for estimated sales returns based on historical returns levels. Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market as determined primarily by the retail method of accounting and are stated using the last in, first out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail method of accounting, and are stated using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. The Company believes the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. The Company records an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the expected annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end. The Company considers in its calculation of the LIFO cost the estimated net realizable value of inventory in those inventory pools where deflation exists and records a write down of inventory where estimated net realizable value is less than LIFO inventory. The Company provides for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts on the basis of a percentage of sales. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect the trend of the actual physical inventory count results, which generally occur in the second and fourth fiscal quarters. Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as the Company progresses towards earning those rebates provided they are probable and reasonably estimable. Other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of agreement, or other systematic and rational approach. Impairment of long lived assets and warehouse closing costs The Company periodically evaluates its long lived assets for indicators of impairment. Managements judgments are based on market and operational conditions at the present time. Future events could cause management to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring an adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value. The Company provides estimates for warehouse closing costs when it is appropriate to do so based on the applicable accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Future circumstances may result in the Companys actual future closing costs or the amount recognized upon the sale of the property to differ substantially from the original estimates. 22 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Insurance/Self Insurance Liabilities The Company uses a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms to provide for the potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property insurance, director and officers liability, vehicle liability and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by the Company are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience and outside expertise, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In March 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Boards (FASB) Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) reached a consensus on EITF Issue No. 03 1, The Meaning of Other Than Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments, (EITF 03 1). The guidance prescribes a three step model for determining whether an investment is other than temporarily impaired and requires disclosures about unrealized losses on investments. The accounting guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after June 15, 2004, while the disclosure requirements are effective for annual reporting periods ending after June 15, 2004. In September 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position EITF 03 1 1, Effective Date of Paragraphs 10 20 of EITF Issue No. 03 1 The Meaning of Other Than Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments, (FSP EITF 03 01 1). FSP EITF 03 1 1 delays the effective date for the measurement and recognition guidance contained in paragraphs 10 20 of EITF Issue 03 01. During the period of the delay, FSP EITF 03 1 1 states that companies should continue to apply relevant other than temporary guidance. The adoption of EITF 03 1, excluding paragraphs 10 20, did not impact the Companys consolidated financial statements. The Company will assess the impact of paragraphs 10 20 of EITF 03 1 once the guidance has been finalized. In December 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46 (revised December 2003), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46R), which addresses how a business enterprise should evaluate whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity through means other than voting rights and accordingly should consolidate the entity. In general, a variable interest entity is a corporation, partnership, trust, or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either does not have equity investors with voting rights or has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities. FIN 46R requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entitys activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entitys residual returns or both. FIN 46R replaces FASB Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, which was issued in January 2003 and revised the implementation date to the first fiscal period ending after March 15, 2004, with the exception of special purpose entities. The adoption of this interpretation did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. In November 2003, the EITF reached consensus on Issue No. 03 10, Application of Issue No. 02 16 by Resellers to Sales Incentives Offered to Consumers by Manufacturers, with respect to determining if consideration received by a reseller from a vendor that is reimbursed by the vendor for honoring the vendors sale incentives offered directly to consumers should be recorded as a reduction in sales. These rules apply to transactions entered into by consumers in fiscal periods beginning after November 25, 2003 and, therefore, apply to such transactions starting with the Companys fiscal third quarter of 2004, which began February 16, 2004. The adoption of EITF 03 10 did not affect the Companys consolidated gross profit or net income, but did result in a reduction of both net sales and merchandise costs by an equal amount. For fiscal 2004, net sales and merchandise costs have been reduced by $334,065. Had the Companys comparable periods in fiscal 2003 and 2002 been reported under EITF 03 10 guidance, the sales and cost of sales would have been reduced by $282,288 and $248,155, respectively. 23 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) In November 2002, the EITF reached consensus on certain issues discussed in Issue No. 02 16, Accounting by a Customer (Including a Reseller) for Certain Consideration Received from a Vendor, with respect to determining how a reseller should characterize consideration received from a vendor and when to recognize and how to measure that consideration in its income statement. Requirements for recognizing volume based rebates are effective for arrangements entered into or modified after November 21, 2002 and resellers with other supplier payments should generally apply the new rules prospectively for agreements entered into or modified after December 31, 2002. The adoption of this consensus by the Company in fiscal 2003 did not have a significant impact on the Company on an annual basis, but resulted in a change in the timing for the recognition of some vendor allowances for certain agreements entered into subsequent to December 31, 2002 and extends the recognition time frame beyond that which was in effect for similar contracts entered into prior to December 31, 2002. Net income for fiscal 2004 was negatively impacted by approximately $2,808 (after tax) due to the adoption of EITF 02 16. Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company is exposed to financial market risk resulting from changes in interest and foreign currency rates. As a policy, the Company does not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions, nor hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. The nature and amount of the Companys long and short term debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As of August 29, 2004, the Companys fixed rate long term debt includes its $851,648 principal amount at maturity Zero Coupon Subordinated Notes and additional notes and capital lease obligations totaling $130,561. The Companys debt also includes $300,000 7 1/8% Senior Notes and $300,000 5 1/2% Senior Notes. The Company has entered into fixed to floating interest rate swaps on the Senior Notes, effectively converting these fixed interest rate securities to variable rate securities. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt and may affect the interest expense related to the variable rate debt. The Company holds interest bearing instruments that are classified as cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. Short term investments generally have a maturity of three months to five years from the purchase date. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. As the majority of these instruments are of a short term nature, if interest rates were to increase or decrease immediately, there is no material risk of a valuation adjustment related to these instruments. For those instruments that are classified as available for sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in interest rates are reflected in other accumulated comprehensive income or loss. Based on the Companys cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances at August 29, 2004, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $27,000 to interest income (pre tax) on an annual basis. Most foreign currency transactions have been conducted in local currencies, limiting the Companys exposure to changes in currency rates. The Company periodically enters into short term forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates on inventory purchases. The fair value of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at August 29, 2004 was not material to the Companys results of operations or its financial position. 24 Table of Contents 
 
Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Certain statements contained in this document constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. For these purposes, forward looking statements are statements that address activities, events, conditions or developments that the Company expects or anticipates may occur in the future. Such forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, domestic and international economic conditions including exchange rates, the effects of competition and regulation, consumer and small business spending patterns and debt levels, conditions affecting the acquisition, development, ownership or use of real estate, actions of vendors, rising costs associated with employees (including health care and workers compensation costs), geopolitical conditions and other risks identified from time to time in the Companys public statements and reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Executive Overview and Selected Consolidated Statements of Income Data (dollars in thousands, except earnings per share) Overview Costco operates membership warehouses based on the concept that offering members very low prices on a limited selection of nationally branded and selected private label products in a wide range of merchandise categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover. This rapid inventory turnover, when combined with the operating efficiencies achieved by volume purchasing, efficient distribution and reduced handling of merchandise in no frills, self service warehouse facilities, enables Costco to operate profitably at significantly lower gross margins than traditional wholesalers, discount retailers and supermarkets. Key items for fiscal year 2004 included: Net sales increased 13.1% over the prior year, driven by an increase in comparable sales of 10% and the opening of 20 new warehouses; Membership fees for fiscal 2004 increased 12.7% to $961,280 representing new member sign ups at new warehouses opened during the fiscal year, increasing penetration of the Companys Executive Membership program, and continued strong member renewal rates; Gross margin (net sales less merchandise costs) improved three basis points as a percent of net sales over the prior year, resulting in part from a fourteen basis point improvement in margin in merchandise and ancillary departments; Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales improved eight basis points over the prior year, largely due to higher sales, changes to our health care plans and a flattening of the rising trend in our workers compensation costs; Net income for fiscal 2004 increased 22.4% to $882,393, or $1.85 per diluted share; and For the first time, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend, and the Company issued quarterly dividends in the third and fourth quarters of $0.10 per share. 13 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) SELECTED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME DATA The table below presents selected operational data, the percentage relationship between net sales and major categories in the Consolidated Statements of Income and the percentage change in the dollar amounts of each of the items.

Comparison of Fiscal 2004 (52 weeks) and Fiscal 2003 (52 weeks): (dollars in thousands, except earnings per share) Net Income Net income for fiscal 2004 increased 22.4% to $882,393, or $1.85 per diluted share, from $721,000, or $1.53 per diluted share during fiscal year 2003. Net Sales Net sales increased 13.1% to $47,145,712 in fiscal 2004 from $41,692,699 in fiscal 2003. Approximately 78% of the increase was due to an increase in comparable warehouse sales, that is sales in warehouses open for at least a year. The balance of the increase was due to opening 20 new warehouses during fiscal 2004 and a net of 23 new warehouses (29 opened, 6 closed) during fiscal 2003, a portion of which is not included in comparable warehouse sales. Net sales were reduced by the implementation of Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 03 10, Application of Issue No. 02 16, Accounting by a Customer (Including a Reseller) for Certain Consideration Received from a Vendor, by Resellers to Sales Incentives Offered to Consumers by Manufacturers, which was effective at the beginning of the Companys fiscal 2004 third quarter. EITF 03 10, which primarily impacts the Companys vendor coupon programs, reduces net sales and merchandise costs by an equal amount and does not affect the Companys consolidated gross margin or net income. Had EITF 03 10 been in effect for the comparable periods in fiscal 2003, the net sales increase in fiscal 2004 would have been 13.8%. (See Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements, EITF 03 10.) For fiscal 2004, comparable sales increased 10% from fiscal 2003. Had EITF 03 10 been in effect for the comparable periods in fiscal 2003, the comparable sales increase for fiscal 2004 would have been 11%. 14 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Changes in prices of merchandise did not materially affect the sales increases, with the exception of gasoline, where price increases accounted for a sales increase of approximately 70 basis points. In addition, due to the weaker U.S. dollar throughout fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003, translation of foreign sales into U.S. dollars contributed to the increase in sales, accounting for a comparable sales increase of approximately 190 basis points year over year. Sales were also positively impacted by the supermarket strikes in Southern California during the first half of the Companys fiscal year. The positive impact to sales for the entire fiscal year was estimated to be 35 to 50 basis points. Membership Fees Membership fees increased 12.7% to $961,280, or 2.04% of net sales, in fiscal 2004 from $852,853, or 2.05% of net sales, in fiscal 2003. This increase was primarily due to additional membership sign ups at the 20 new warehouses opened in fiscal 2004; increased penetration of the Companys Executive membership, including the rollout of the program into Canada, which began in the first quarter of fiscal 2004; and high overall member renewal rates consistent with recent years, currently at 86%. Gross Margin Gross margin increased 13.4% to $5,053,696, or 10.72% of net sales, in fiscal 2004 from $4,457,316, or 10.69% of net sales, in fiscal 2003. The three basis point increase, as a percent of net sales, reflected a 14 basis point increase in gross margin in the Companys merchandise departments, helped by strong year over year gross margin gains in the Companys ancillary business operations, particularly gasoline and pharmacy. Year over year gross margin, as a percentage of net sales, was also positively impacted by the implementation of EITF 03 10, whereby net sales and merchandise costs were reduced, resulting in an eight basis point increase. The year over year gross margin percentage was reduced by 12 basis points due to the increased rewards related to the Executive Membership Two Percent Reward Program, resulting from an increase in the penetration of the Executive Member program. The gross margin figures reflect accounting for most U.S. merchandise inventories on the last in, first out (LIFO) method. Fiscal 2004 included a $6,090 LIFO charge (increase in merchandise costs), while fiscal 2003 included a $19,650 LIFO credit (reduction in merchandise costs). The impact of the LIFO adjustment on a year over year basis negatively impacted margin by an additional six basis points. If all inventories had been valued using the first in, first out (FIFO) method, inventories would have been lower by $13,410 and $19,500 at August 29, 2004 and August 31, 2003, respectively. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses as a percent of net sales decreased to 9.75% during fiscal 2004 from 9.83% during fiscal 2003. Had EITF 03 10 been in effect in fiscal 2003, SG&A expenses as a percent to net sales would have shown additional improvement of seven basis points in fiscal 2004. For fiscal 2004, warehouse and central operating costs positively impacted SG&A comparisons year over year by approximately 21 basis points, primarily due to increased expense leverage of warehouse payroll, benefits (primarily health care), utility and workers compensation costs. During the latter half of fiscal 2004, the Company implemented changes to its employee healthcare plans that reduced its overall healthcare costs, primarily in the fourth quarter. This improvement was partially offset by the seven basis point increase resulting from the adoption of EITF 03 10, a two basis point increase in expense related to the establishment of additional insurance liabilities resulting from financial difficulties being experienced by one of the Companys third party insurance providers, and an increase in stock based compensation costs following the Companys prospective adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, during fiscal 2003, of four basis points. 15 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Preopening Expenses Preopening expenses totaled $30,451, or 0.07% of net sales, during fiscal 2004 compared to $36,643, or 0.09% of net sales, during fiscal 2003. This reduction was due to fewer warehouse openings. During fiscal 2004, the Company opened 20 new warehouses compared to 29 new warehouses (including 5 relocations) during fiscal 2003. Pre opening expenses also include costs related to remodels and expanded ancillary operations at existing warehouses. Provision for Impaired Assets and Closing Costs, net The net provision for impaired assets and closing costs was $1,000 in fiscal 2004, compared to $19,500 in fiscal 2003. The provision includes costs related to impairment of long lived assets, future lease obligations of warehouses that have been relocated to new facilities, and losses or gains resulting from the sale of real property. The provision for fiscal 2004 included charges of $16,548 for warehouse closing expenses that were offset by gains of $15,548 on the sale of real property. The provision for fiscal 2003 included charges of $11,836 for warehouse closing expenses, $4,697 for impairment of long lived assets and $2,967 for net losses on the sale of real property. At August 29, 2004, the reserve for warehouse closing costs was $10,367, of which $9,184 related to future lease obligations. This compares to a reserve for warehouse closing costs of $8,609 at August 31, 2003, of which $7,833 related to future lease obligations. Interest Expense Interest expense totaled $36,651 in fiscal 2004, compared to $36,920 in fiscal 2003. Interest expense in both fiscal 2004 and 2003 includes interest on the 3 1/2% Zero Coupon Notes, 7 1/8% and 5 1/2% Senior Notes and on balances outstanding under the Companys bank credit facilities and promissory notes. The decrease was primarily a result of the Companys reduction in short term borrowings, principally related to its foreign subsidiaries. This decrease was substantially offset by increases in interest rates on the Senior Notes due to interest rate swap agreements converting the interest rate from fixed to floating. Interest Income and Other Interest income and other totaled $51,627 in fiscal 2004, compared to $38,525 in fiscal 2003. The increase primarily reflects greater interest earned on higher cash and cash equivalents balances and short term investments. In addition, a reduction in the expense to record minority interest in the earnings of foreign subsidiaries was reported in fiscal 2004 as the Company increased its ownership in Costco Wholesale UK Limited to 100%. Provision for Income Taxes The effective income tax rate on earnings was 37% in fiscal 2004 and 37.75% in fiscal 2003. The decrease in the effective income tax rate is primarily attributable to lower statutory income tax rates for foreign operations and one time benefits associated with certain tax planning strategies. Comparison of Fiscal 2003 (52 weeks) and Fiscal 2002 (52 weeks): (dollars in thousands, except earnings per share) Net Income Net income for fiscal 2003 increased 3.0% to $721,000, or $1.53 per diluted share, from $699,983, or $1.48 per diluted share during fiscal year 2002. Net Sales Net sales increased 9.7% to $41,692,699 in fiscal 2003 from $37,993,093 in fiscal 2002. Approximately 55% of the increase was due to an increase in comparable warehouse sales, that is sales in warehouses open for at 16 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) least a year, and approximately 45% of the increase was due to opening a net of 23 new warehouses (29 opened, 6 closed) during fiscal 2003 and a net of 29 new warehouses (35 opened, 6 closed) during fiscal 2002, a portion of which is not included in comparable warehouse sales. With the exception of price increases in gasoline, which accounted for a comparable sales increase of approximately 70 basis points, changes in prices of merchandise did not materially contribute to sales increases. In addition, due to the weaker U.S. dollar in fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002, translation of foreign sales into U.S. dollars contributed to the increase in sales, accounting for a comparable sales increase of approximately one percent year over year. Comparable sales increased at a five percent annual rate in fiscal 2003 compared to a six percent annual rate during fiscal 2002. Membership fees Membership fees increased 10.8% to $852,853, or 2.05% of net sales, in fiscal 2003 from $769,406, or 2.03% of net sales, in fiscal 2002. This increase was primarily due to additional membership sign ups at the 23 net new warehouses opened in fiscal 2003, and increased penetration of the Companys Executive Membership. Overall, member renewal rates remained consistent with the prior year, currently at 86%. Gross Margin Gross margin (defined as net sales minus merchandise costs) increased 11.2% to $4,457,316, or 10.69% of net sales, in fiscal 2003 from $4,009,972, or 10.55% of net sales, in fiscal 2002. The increase in gross margin as a percentage of net sales reflects merchandise gross margin improvement within the Companys ancillary warehouse businesses and international operations accounting for increases of 15 and eight basis points, respectively. Additionally, increased rewards related to the Executive Membership Two Percent Reward Program reduced gross margin by seven basis points. The gross margin figures reflect accounting for most U.S. merchandise inventories on the last in, first out (LIFO) method. The effect of the LIFO adjustment for fiscal 2003 was to increase gross margin by $19,650, compared to a gross margin increase of $13,500 in fiscal 2002. If all inventories had been valued using the first in, first out (FIFO) method, inventories would have been lower by $19,500 at August 31, 2003 and higher by $150 at September 1, 2002. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales increased to 9.83% during fiscal 2003 from 9.41% during fiscal 2002. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales was primarily due to increases in employee healthcare, workers compensation (primarily in the state of California) and salary costs within the Companys domestic operations. International expenses also increased, accounting for approximately seven basis points of the 42 basis points year over year increase. Preopening Expenses Preopening expenses totaled $36,643, or 0.09% of net sales, during fiscal 2003, compared to $51,257, or 0.13% of net sales, during fiscal 2002. During fiscal 2003, the Company opened 29 new warehouses (including five relocations) compared to 35 new warehouses (including six relocations) during fiscal 2002. Pre opening expenses also include costs related to remodels and expanded ancillary operations at existing warehouses. Provision for Impaired Assets and Closing Costs, net The net provision for impaired assets and closing costs was $19,500 in fiscal 2003 compared to $21,050 in fiscal 2002. The provision includes costs related to impairment of long lived assets, future lease obligations of warehouses that have been relocated to new facilities and any losses or gains resulting from the sale of real property. The provision for fiscal 2003 included charges of $11,836 for warehouse closing expenses, $4,697 for impairment of long lived assets and $2,967 for net losses on the sale of real property. The fiscal 2002 provision included charges of $13,683 for warehouse closing expenses and $7,765 for Canadian administrative reorganization, which were offset by $398 of net gains on the sale of real property. At August 31, 2003 the reserve for 17 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) warehouse closing costs was $8,609, of which $7,833 related to future lease obligations. This compares to a reserve for warehouse closing costs of $11,845 at September 1, 2002, of which $10,395 related to future lease obligations. Interest Expense Interest expense totaled $36,920 in fiscal 2003, compared to $29,096 in fiscal 2002. Interest expense in fiscal 2003 includes interest on the 3 1/2% Zero Coupon Notes, 7 1/8% and 5 1/2% Senior Notes and on balances outstanding under the Companys bank credit facilities and promissory notes. The increase is primarily related to the reduction in interest capitalized related to warehouse construction, as the overall cost of projects under construction was lower than in fiscal 2002. The increase was also attributed to the Companys issuance of $300,000 5 1/2% Senior Notes in March 2002, which were simultaneously swapped to a floating interest rate. This increase was partially offset by an interest rate reduction in the Companys $300,000 7 1/8% Senior Notes, resulting from interest rate swap agreements entered into effective November 13, 2001, converting the interest rate from fixed to floating, and to the fact that the Company had little interest expense related to borrowings under its commercial paper program in fiscal 2003. Interest Income and Other Interest income and other totaled $38,525 in fiscal 2003, compared to $35,745 in fiscal 2002. The increase primarily reflects greater interest earned on higher cash and cash equivalents balances on hand throughout fiscal 2003, as compared to fiscal 2002, which was partially offset by an increase in the expense to record the minority interest in earnings of foreign subsidiaries. Provision for Income Taxes The effective income tax rate on earnings was 37.75% in fiscal 2003 and 38.50% in fiscal 2002. The decrease in the effective income tax rate, year over year, is primarily attributable to lower statutory income tax rates for foreign operations. Liquidity and Capital Resources (dollars in thousands, except per share amounts) Cash Flows Cash flow generated from warehouse operations provides a significant source of liquidity. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $2,098,783 in fiscal 2004 compared to $1,507,208 in fiscal 2003. The increase of $591,575 is primarily a result of an increase in the change in receivables, other current assets, deferred income and accrued and other current liabilities of $507,860, due primarily to the collection of an operating tax receivable and increases in the workers compensation accrual, income taxes payable, executive membership two percent reward accrual and deferred membership income in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003. In addition, the increase in net income of $161,393 contributed to the increase in cash provided by operating activities. The primary investing activity continues to be the purchase of property and equipment and the construction of facilities related to the Companys warehouse expansion and remodel projects. Net cash used in investing activities totaled $1,048,481 in fiscal 2004 compared to $790,588 in fiscal 2003, an increase of $257,893. The increase in investing activities primarily relates to net purchases of short term investments of $303,945 and the purchase of the remaining 20% minority interest in Costco Wholesale UK Limited of $95,153, which was partially offset by a reduction in the acquisition of property and equipment and the construction of facilities for new and remodeled warehouses of $105,045 (from $810,665 to $705,620) between fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2004, as new warehouse openings decreased year over year from 29 (including five relocated warehouses) in fiscal 2003 to 20 in fiscal 2004. 18 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Net cash provided by financing activities totaled $209,569 in fiscal 2004 compared to net cash used of $1,428 in fiscal 2003. The increase of $210,997 primarily resulted from an increase in bank checks outstanding of $243,890 and the increase in proceeds received from the exercise of stock options of $90,077, which were offset by the payment of cash dividends in fiscal 2004 of $92,137 and from the reduction in the issuance of long term debt of $59,424 in fiscal 2003 to no additional issuances of long term debt in the current fiscal year. Dividends Costcos Board of Directors declared two quarterly cash dividends of $0.10 per share in fiscal 2004. The first quarterly cash dividend of $0.10 per share, in the amount of $45,939, was paid May 31, 2004 to shareholders of record at the close of business on May 10, 2004. The second quarterly cash dividend of $0.10 per share, in the amount of $46,198, was paid August 27, 2004, to shareholders of record at the close of business on July 23, 2004. Contractual Obligations The Companys commitment to make future payments under contractual obligations was as follows, as of August 29, 2004. Payments Due by Period Contractual obligations Total Less than 1 year 1 to 3years 4 to 5 years After 5 years Long term debt(1) $ 1,656,393 (2) $ 339,441 $ 336,632 $ 62,081 $ 918,239 (2) Capital lease obligations 5,449 1,451 1,117 1,115 1,766 Operating leases(3) 1,574,778 110,616 212,734 190,401 1,061,027 Purchase obligations (merchandise)(4) 3,509,786 3,153,157 356,629 Purchase obligations (building, equipment, services and other)(5) 232,212 213,823 16,556 1,833 Other(6) 6,235 476 594 418 4,747 Total $ 6,984,853 $ 3,818,964 $ 924,262 $ 255,848 $ 1,985,779 (1) Amounts include contractual interest payments. (2) The amount includes interest accreted to maturity for the Companys Zero Coupon 3 1/2% Convertible Subordinated Notes due August 2017, totaling $851,648. The consolidated balance sheet as of August 29, 2004 reflects a balance outstanding of $543,025. (3) Operating lease obligations have been reduced by $148,339 to reflect sub lease income. (4) Includes open merchandise purchase orders at fiscal year end, including those supported by letters of credit. (5) The amounts presented above as purchase obligations include an analysis of all known contracts with the exception of minor outsourced services negotiated at the individual warehouse level that are not significant and generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty. (6) Primarily consists of asset retirement obligations. 19 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Expansion Plans Costcos primary requirement for capital is the financing of the land, building and equipment costs for new warehouses plus the costs of initial warehouse operations and working capital requirements, as well as additional capital for international expansion. While there can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized, and plans are subject to change upon further review, it is managements current intention to spend approximately $900,000 to $1,000,000 during fiscal 2005 in the United States and Canada for real estate, construction, remodeling and equipment for warehouse clubs and related operations; and approximately $100,000 to $150,000 for international expansion, including the United Kingdom, Asia, Mexico and other potential ventures. These expenditures are expected to be financed with a combination of cash provided from operations and the use of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. Expansion plans for the United States and Canada during fiscal 2005 are to open approximately 30 new warehouse clubs inclusive of seven relocations to larger and better located warehouses. The Company expects to continue its review of expansion plans in its international operations, including the United Kingdom and Asia, along with other international markets. At present, the Company is planning to open two additional warehouses in the U.K and one additional warehouse in both the Taiwan and Japan markets during fiscal 2005. Costco and its Mexico based joint venture partner, Controladora Comercial Mexicana, each own a 50% interest in Costco Mexico. Costco Mexico plans to open two to three new warehouse clubs during fiscal 2005. Additional Equity Investments in Subsidiary On October 3, 2003, the Company acquired from Carrefour Nederland B.V. its 20% equity interest in Costco Wholesale UK Limited for cash of $95,153, bringing Costcos ownership in Costco Wholesale UK Limited to 100%. Bank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs (all amounts stated in thousands of US dollars) The Company has a $500,000 commercial paper program supported by a $300,000 bank credit facility with a group of ten banks, of which $150,000 expired on November 9, 2004 and $150,000 expires on November 15, 2005. At August 29, 2004, no amounts were outstanding under the commercial paper program and no amounts were outstanding under the credit facility. The Company presently does not plan to renew the $150,000 portion of the credit facility that expired on November 9, 2004. A wholly owned Canadian subsidiary has a $152,000 commercial paper program supported by a $46,000 bank credit facility with a Canadian bank, that is guaranteed by the Company and expires in March 2005. At August 29, 2004, no amounts were outstanding under the Canadian commercial paper program or the bank credit facility. The Company has agreed to limit the combined amount outstanding under the U.S. and Canadian commercial paper programs to the combined amounts of the supporting bank credit facilities, which are $346,000 at August 29, 2004, decreased to $196,000 on November 9, 2004. The Companys wholly owned Japanese subsidiary has a short term $27,400 bank line of credit that originally expired in November 2004. Subsequent to the Companys fiscal year end, the bank line of credit was extended through February 10, 2005. At August 29, 2004, no amounts were outstanding under the line of credit. The Companys Korean subsidiary has a short term $10,400 bank line of credit, which expires in January 2005. At August 29, 2004, no amounts were outstanding under the line of credit. The Companys wholly owned UK subsidiary has a $108,000 bank revolving credit facility expiring in February 2007 and a $63,000 bank overdraft facility renewable on a yearly basis in March. At August 29, 2004, $21,595 was outstanding under the revolving credit facility with an applicable interest rate of 5.285% and no amounts were outstanding under the bank overdraft facility. 20 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Letters of Credit The Company has letter of credit facilities (for commercial and standby letters of credit), totaling approximately $338,000. The outstanding commitments under these facilities at August 29, 2004 totaled approximately $166,800, including approximately $52,900 in standby letters of credit. Financing Activities The Companys 7 1/8% Senior Notes of $304,350 at August 29, 2004 are due on June 15, 2005. The Company plans to repay the 7 1/8% Senior Notes from its cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances, which totaled $3,129,882 at August 29, 2004. In April 2003, the Companys wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.92% in the aggregate amount of approximately $36,576, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due on April 26, 2010. In November 2002, the Companys wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.88% in the aggregate amount of approximately $27,432, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due on November 7, 2009. The Company guarantees all of the promissory notes issued by its wholly owned Japanese subsidiary. In March 2002, the Company issued $300,000 of 5 1/2% Senior Notes due March 15, 2007. Interest is payable semi annually. Simultaneous with the issuance of the Senior Notes, the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements converting the interest from fixed to floating. In February 1996, the Company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a shelf registration statement for $500,000 of senior debt securities. On October 23, 2001, additional debt securities of $100,000 were registered. The $300,000 of 5 1/2% Senior Notes issued in March 2002 reduced the amount of registered securities available for future issuance to $300,000. Derivatives The Company has limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and uses them only to manage well defined interest rate and foreign exchange risks. Forward foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on inventory purchases and typically have very short terms. The aggregate amount of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at August 29, 2004 was not material. The only significant derivative instruments the Company holds are interest rate swaps, which the Company uses to manage the interest rate risk associated with its borrowings and to manage the Companys mix of fixed rate and variable rate debt. As of August 29, 2004, the Company had fixed to floating interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $600,000 and an aggregate fair value of $25,754, which is recorded in other assets on the Companys consolidated balance sheet. These swaps were entered into effective November 13, 2001, and March 25, 2002, and are designated and qualify as fair value hedges of the Companys $300,000 7 1/8% Senior Notes and the Companys $300,000 5 1/2% Senior Notes, respectively. As the terms of the swaps match those of the underlying hedged debt, the changes in the fair value of these swaps are offset by corresponding changes in the carrying amount of the hedged debt and result in no net earnings impact. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company has no off balance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on the Companys financial condition or consolidated financial statements. Stock Repurchase Program On November 30, 2001, the Companys Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program, authorizing the repurchase of up to $500,000 of Costco Common Stock through November 30, 2004. Under the program, 21 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) the Company could repurchase shares at any time in the open market or in private transactions as market conditions warrant. The repurchased shares would constitute authorized, but non issued shares and would be used for general corporate purposes, including stock option grants under stock option programs. On October 25, 2004, the Board of Directors renewed the program for another three years. To date, no shares have been repurchased under either program. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the Companys financial statements requires that management make estimates and judgments that affect the financial position and results of operations. Management continues to review its accounting policies and evaluate its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, merchandise inventory, impairment of long lived assets and warehouse closing costs and insurance/self insurance liabilities. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the present circumstances. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes sales, net of estimated returns, at the time customers take possession of merchandise or receive services. When the Company collects payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services, the amount received is recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed. The Company provides for estimated sales returns based on historical returns levels. Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market as determined primarily by the retail method of accounting and are stated using the last in, first out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail method of accounting, and are stated using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. The Company believes the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. The Company records an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the expected annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end. The Company considers in its calculation of the LIFO cost the estimated net realizable value of inventory in those inventory pools where deflation exists and records a write down of inventory where estimated net realizable value is less than LIFO inventory. The Company provides for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts on the basis of a percentage of sales. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect the trend of the actual physical inventory count results, which generally occur in the second and fourth fiscal quarters. Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as the Company progresses towards earning those rebates provided they are probable and reasonably estimable. Other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of agreement, or other systematic and rational approach. Impairment of long lived assets and warehouse closing costs The Company periodically evaluates its long lived assets for indicators of impairment. Managements judgments are based on market and operational conditions at the present time. Future events could cause management to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring an adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value. The Company provides estimates for warehouse closing costs when it is appropriate to do so based on the applicable accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Future circumstances may result in the Companys actual future closing costs or the amount recognized upon the sale of the property to differ substantially from the original estimates. 22 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Insurance/Self Insurance Liabilities The Company uses a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms to provide for the potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property insurance, director and officers liability, vehicle liability and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by the Company are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience and outside expertise, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In March 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Boards (FASB) Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) reached a consensus on EITF Issue No. 03 1, The Meaning of Other Than Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments, (EITF 03 1). The guidance prescribes a three step model for determining whether an investment is other than temporarily impaired and requires disclosures about unrealized losses on investments. The accounting guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after June 15, 2004, while the disclosure requirements are effective for annual reporting periods ending after June 15, 2004. In September 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position EITF 03 1 1, Effective Date of Paragraphs 10 20 of EITF Issue No. 03 1 The Meaning of Other Than Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments, (FSP EITF 03 01 1). FSP EITF 03 1 1 delays the effective date for the measurement and recognition guidance contained in paragraphs 10 20 of EITF Issue 03 01. During the period of the delay, FSP EITF 03 1 1 states that companies should continue to apply relevant other than temporary guidance. The adoption of EITF 03 1, excluding paragraphs 10 20, did not impact the Companys consolidated financial statements. The Company will assess the impact of paragraphs 10 20 of EITF 03 1 once the guidance has been finalized. In December 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46 (revised December 2003), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46R), which addresses how a business enterprise should evaluate whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity through means other than voting rights and accordingly should consolidate the entity. In general, a variable interest entity is a corporation, partnership, trust, or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either does not have equity investors with voting rights or has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities. FIN 46R requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entitys activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entitys residual returns or both. FIN 46R replaces FASB Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, which was issued in January 2003 and revised the implementation date to the first fiscal period ending after March 15, 2004, with the exception of special purpose entities. The adoption of this interpretation did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. In November 2003, the EITF reached consensus on Issue No. 03 10, Application of Issue No. 02 16 by Resellers to Sales Incentives Offered to Consumers by Manufacturers, with respect to determining if consideration received by a reseller from a vendor that is reimbursed by the vendor for honoring the vendors sale incentives offered directly to consumers should be recorded as a reduction in sales. These rules apply to transactions entered into by consumers in fiscal periods beginning after November 25, 2003 and, therefore, apply to such transactions starting with the Companys fiscal third quarter of 2004, which began February 16, 2004. The adoption of EITF 03 10 did not affect the Companys consolidated gross profit or net income, but did result in a reduction of both net sales and merchandise costs by an equal amount. For fiscal 2004, net sales and merchandise costs have been reduced by $334,065. Had the Companys comparable periods in fiscal 2003 and 2002 been reported under EITF 03 10 guidance, the sales and cost of sales would have been reduced by $282,288 and $248,155, respectively. 23 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) In November 2002, the EITF reached consensus on certain issues discussed in Issue No. 02 16, Accounting by a Customer (Including a Reseller) for Certain Consideration Received from a Vendor, with respect to determining how a reseller should characterize consideration received from a vendor and when to recognize and how to measure that consideration in its income statement. Requirements for recognizing volume based rebates are effective for arrangements entered into or modified after November 21, 2002 and resellers with other supplier payments should generally apply the new rules prospectively for agreements entered into or modified after December 31, 2002. The adoption of this consensus by the Company in fiscal 2003 did not have a significant impact on the Company on an annual basis, but resulted in a change in the timing for the recognition of some vendor allowances for certain agreements entered into subsequent to December 31, 2002 and extends the recognition time frame beyond that which was in effect for similar contracts entered into prior to December 31, 2002. Net income for fiscal 2004 was negatively impacted by approximately $2,808 (after tax) due to the adoption of EITF 02 16. Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company is exposed to financial market risk resulting from changes in interest and foreign currency rates. As a policy, the Company does not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions, nor hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. The nature and amount of the Companys long and short term debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As of August 29, 2004, the Companys fixed rate long term debt includes its $851,648 principal amount at maturity Zero Coupon Subordinated Notes and additional notes and capital lease obligations totaling $130,561. The Companys debt also includes $300,000 7 1/8% Senior Notes and $300,000 5 1/2% Senior Notes. The Company has entered into fixed to floating interest rate swaps on the Senior Notes, effectively converting these fixed interest rate securities to variable rate securities. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt and may affect the interest expense related to the variable rate debt. The Company holds interest bearing instruments that are classified as cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. Short term investments generally have a maturity of three months to five years from the purchase date. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. As the majority of these instruments are of a short term nature, if interest rates were to increase or decrease immediately, there is no material risk of a valuation adjustment related to these instruments. For those instruments that are classified as available for sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in interest rates are reflected in other accumulated comprehensive income or loss. Based on the Companys cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances at August 29, 2004, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $27,000 to interest income (pre tax) on an annual basis. Most foreign currency transactions have been conducted in local currencies, limiting the Companys exposure to changes in currency rates. The Company periodically enters into short term forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates on inventory purchases. The fair value of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at August 29, 2004 was not material to the Companys results of operations or its financial position. 24 Table of Contents 
 
Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) SELECTED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME DATA The table below presents selected operational data, the percentage relationship between net sales and major categories in the Consolidated Statements of Income and the percentage change in the dollar amounts of each of the items. Percent of Net Sales Percentage Increase/(Decrease) (of dollar amounts) Fiscal 2004 Fiscal 2003 Fiscal 2002 Fiscal 2004vs. Fiscal 2003 Fiscal 2003 vs. Fiscal 2002 Net sales 100.00 % 100.00 % 100.00 % 13.1 % 9.7 % Membership fees 2.04 2.05 2.03 12.7 10.8 Gross margin (a) 10.72 10.69 10.55 13.4 11.2 Selling, general and administrative 9.75 9.83 9.41 12.2 14.6 Preopening expenses 0.07 0.09 0.13 (16.9 ) (28.5 ) Provision for impaired assets and closing costs, net 0.05 0.06 (94.9 ) (7.4 ) Operating income 2.94 2.77 2.98 19.8 2.2 Interest expense (0.08 ) (0.08 ) (0.08 ) (0.7 ) 26.9 Interest income and other 0.11 0.09 0.09 34.0 7.8 Income before income taxes 2.97 2.78 2.99 20.9 1.8 Provision for income taxes 1.10 1.05 1.15 18.5 (0.2 ) Net Income 1.87 % 1.73 % 1.84 % 22.4 % 3.0 % (a) Defined as net sales less merchandise costs. Comparison of Fiscal 2004 (52 weeks) and Fiscal 2003 (52 weeks): (dollars in thousands, except earnings per share) Net Income Net income for fiscal 2004 increased 22.4% to $882,393, or $1.85 per diluted share, from $721,000, or $1.53 per diluted share during fiscal year 2003. Net Sales Net sales increased 13.1% to $47,145,712 in fiscal 2004 from $41,692,699 in fiscal 2003. Approximately 78% of the increase was due to an increase in comparable warehouse sales, that is sales in warehouses open for at least a year. The balance of the increase was due to opening 20 new warehouses during fiscal 2004 and a net of 23 new warehouses (29 opened, 6 closed) during fiscal 2003, a portion of which is not included in comparable warehouse sales. Net sales were reduced by the implementation of Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 03 10, Application of Issue No. 02 16, Accounting by a Customer (Including a Reseller) for Certain Consideration Received from a Vendor, by Resellers to Sales Incentives Offered to Consumers by Manufacturers, which was effective at the beginning of the Companys fiscal 2004 third quarter. EITF 03 10, which primarily impacts the Companys vendor coupon programs, reduces net sales and merchandise costs by an equal amount and does not affect the Companys consolidated gross margin or net income. Had EITF 03 10 been in effect for the comparable periods in fiscal 2003, the net sales increase in fiscal 2004 would have been 13.8%. (See Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements, EITF 03 10.) For fiscal 2004, comparable sales increased 10% from fiscal 2003. Had EITF 03 10 been in effect for the comparable periods in fiscal 2003, the comparable sales increase for fiscal 2004 would have been 11%. 14 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Changes in prices of merchandise did not materially affect the sales increases, with the exception of gasoline, where price increases accounted for a sales increase of approximately 70 basis points. In addition, due to the weaker U.S. dollar throughout fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003, translation of foreign sales into U.S. dollars contributed to the increase in sales, accounting for a comparable sales increase of approximately 190 basis points year over year. Sales were also positively impacted by the supermarket strikes in Southern California during the first half of the Companys fiscal year. The positive impact to sales for the entire fiscal year was estimated to be 35 to 50 basis points. Membership Fees Membership fees increased 12.7% to $961,280, or 2.04% of net sales, in fiscal 2004 from $852,853, or 2.05% of net sales, in fiscal 2003. This increase was primarily due to additional membership sign ups at the 20 new warehouses opened in fiscal 2004; increased penetration of the Companys Executive membership, including the rollout of the program into Canada, which began in the first quarter of fiscal 2004; and high overall member renewal rates consistent with recent years, currently at 86%. Gross Margin Gross margin increased 13.4% to $5,053,696, or 10.72% of net sales, in fiscal 2004 from $4,457,316, or 10.69% of net sales, in fiscal 2003. The three basis point increase, as a percent of net sales, reflected a 14 basis point increase in gross margin in the Companys merchandise departments, helped by strong year over year gross margin gains in the Companys ancillary business operations, particularly gasoline and pharmacy. Year over year gross margin, as a percentage of net sales, was also positively impacted by the implementation of EITF 03 10, whereby net sales and merchandise costs were reduced, resulting in an eight basis point increase. The year over year gross margin percentage was reduced by 12 basis points due to the increased rewards related to the Executive Membership Two Percent Reward Program, resulting from an increase in the penetration of the Executive Member program. The gross margin figures reflect accounting for most U.S. merchandise inventories on the last in, first out (LIFO) method. Fiscal 2004 included a $6,090 LIFO charge (increase in merchandise costs), while fiscal 2003 included a $19,650 LIFO credit (reduction in merchandise costs). The impact of the LIFO adjustment on a year over year basis negatively impacted margin by an additional six basis points. If all inventories had been valued using the first in, first out (FIFO) method, inventories would have been lower by $13,410 and $19,500 at August 29, 2004 and August 31, 2003, respectively. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses as a percent of net sales decreased to 9.75% during fiscal 2004 from 9.83% during fiscal 2003. Had EITF 03 10 been in effect in fiscal 2003, SG&A expenses as a percent to net sales would have shown additional improvement of seven basis points in fiscal 2004. For fiscal 2004, warehouse and central operating costs positively impacted SG&A comparisons year over year by approximately 21 basis points, primarily due to increased expense leverage of warehouse payroll, benefits (primarily health care), utility and workers compensation costs. During the latter half of fiscal 2004, the Company implemented changes to its employee healthcare plans that reduced its overall healthcare costs, primarily in the fourth quarter. This improvement was partially offset by the seven basis point increase resulting from the adoption of EITF 03 10, a two basis point increase in expense related to the establishment of additional insurance liabilities resulting from financial difficulties being experienced by one of the Companys third party insurance providers, and an increase in stock based compensation costs following the Companys prospective adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, during fiscal 2003, of four basis points. 15 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Preopening Expenses Preopening expenses totaled $30,451, or 0.07% of net sales, during fiscal 2004 compared to $36,643, or 0.09% of net sales, during fiscal 2003. This reduction was due to fewer warehouse openings. During fiscal 2004, the Company opened 20 new warehouses compared to 29 new warehouses (including 5 relocations) during fiscal 2003. Pre opening expenses also include costs related to remodels and expanded ancillary operations at existing warehouses. Provision for Impaired Assets and Closing Costs, net The net provision for impaired assets and closing costs was $1,000 in fiscal 2004, compared to $19,500 in fiscal 2003. The provision includes costs related to impairment of long lived assets, future lease obligations of warehouses that have been relocated to new facilities, and losses or gains resulting from the sale of real property. The provision for fiscal 2004 included charges of $16,548 for warehouse closing expenses that were offset by gains of $15,548 on the sale of real property. The provision for fiscal 2003 included charges of $11,836 for warehouse closing expenses, $4,697 for impairment of long lived assets and $2,967 for net losses on the sale of real property. At August 29, 2004, the reserve for warehouse closing costs was $10,367, of which $9,184 related to future lease obligations. This compares to a reserve for warehouse closing costs of $8,609 at August 31, 2003, of which $7,833 related to future lease obligations. Interest Expense Interest expense totaled $36,651 in fiscal 2004, compared to $36,920 in fiscal 2003. Interest expense in both fiscal 2004 and 2003 includes interest on the 3 1/2% Zero Coupon Notes, 7 1/8% and 5 1/2% Senior Notes and on balances outstanding under the Companys bank credit facilities and promissory notes. The decrease was primarily a result of the Companys reduction in short term borrowings, principally related to its foreign subsidiaries. This decrease was substantially offset by increases in interest rates on the Senior Notes due to interest rate swap agreements converting the interest rate from fixed to floating. Interest Income and Other Interest income and other totaled $51,627 in fiscal 2004, compared to $38,525 in fiscal 2003. The increase primarily reflects greater interest earned on higher cash and cash equivalents balances and short term investments. In addition, a reduction in the expense to record minority interest in the earnings of foreign subsidiaries was reported in fiscal 2004 as the Company increased its ownership in Costco Wholesale UK Limited to 100%. Provision for Income Taxes The effective income tax rate on earnings was 37% in fiscal 2004 and 37.75% in fiscal 2003. The decrease in the effective income tax rate is primarily attributable to lower statutory income tax rates for foreign operations and one time benefits associated with certain tax planning strategies. Comparison of Fiscal 2003 (52 weeks) and Fiscal 2002 (52 weeks): (dollars in thousands, except earnings per share) Net Income Net income for fiscal 2003 increased 3.0% to $721,000, or $1.53 per diluted share, from $699,983, or $1.48 per diluted share during fiscal year 2002. Net Sales Net sales increased 9.7% to $41,692,699 in fiscal 2003 from $37,993,093 in fiscal 2002. Approximately 55% of the increase was due to an increase in comparable warehouse sales, that is sales in warehouses open for at 16 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) least a year, and approximately 45% of the increase was due to opening a net of 23 new warehouses (29 opened, 6 closed) during fiscal 2003 and a net of 29 new warehouses (35 opened, 6 closed) during fiscal 2002, a portion of which is not included in comparable warehouse sales. With the exception of price increases in gasoline, which accounted for a comparable sales increase of approximately 70 basis points, changes in prices of merchandise did not materially contribute to sales increases. In addition, due to the weaker U.S. dollar in fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002, translation of foreign sales into U.S. dollars contributed to the increase in sales, accounting for a comparable sales increase of approximately one percent year over year. Comparable sales increased at a five percent annual rate in fiscal 2003 compared to a six percent annual rate during fiscal 2002. Membership fees Membership fees increased 10.8% to $852,853, or 2.05% of net sales, in fiscal 2003 from $769,406, or 2.03% of net sales, in fiscal 2002. This increase was primarily due to additional membership sign ups at the 23 net new warehouses opened in fiscal 2003, and increased penetration of the Companys Executive Membership. Overall, member renewal rates remained consistent with the prior year, currently at 86%. Gross Margin Gross margin (defined as net sales minus merchandise costs) increased 11.2% to $4,457,316, or 10.69% of net sales, in fiscal 2003 from $4,009,972, or 10.55% of net sales, in fiscal 2002. The increase in gross margin as a percentage of net sales reflects merchandise gross margin improvement within the Companys ancillary warehouse businesses and international operations accounting for increases of 15 and eight basis points, respectively. Additionally, increased rewards related to the Executive Membership Two Percent Reward Program reduced gross margin by seven basis points. The gross margin figures reflect accounting for most U.S. merchandise inventories on the last in, first out (LIFO) method. The effect of the LIFO adjustment for fiscal 2003 was to increase gross margin by $19,650, compared to a gross margin increase of $13,500 in fiscal 2002. If all inventories had been valued using the first in, first out (FIFO) method, inventories would have been lower by $19,500 at August 31, 2003 and higher by $150 at September 1, 2002. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales increased to 9.83% during fiscal 2003 from 9.41% during fiscal 2002. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales was primarily due to increases in employee healthcare, workers compensation (primarily in the state of California) and salary costs within the Companys domestic operations. International expenses also increased, accounting for approximately seven basis points of the 42 basis points year over year increase. Preopening Expenses Preopening expenses totaled $36,643, or 0.09% of net sales, during fiscal 2003, compared to $51,257, or 0.13% of net sales, during fiscal 2002. During fiscal 2003, the Company opened 29 new warehouses (including five relocations) compared to 35 new warehouses (including six relocations) during fiscal 2002. Pre opening expenses also include costs related to remodels and expanded ancillary operations at existing warehouses. Provision for Impaired Assets and Closing Costs, net The net provision for impaired assets and closing costs was $19,500 in fiscal 2003 compared to $21,050 in fiscal 2002. The provision includes costs related to impairment of long lived assets, future lease obligations of warehouses that have been relocated to new facilities and any losses or gains resulting from the sale of real property. The provision for fiscal 2003 included charges of $11,836 for warehouse closing expenses, $4,697 for impairment of long lived assets and $2,967 for net losses on the sale of real property. The fiscal 2002 provision included charges of $13,683 for warehouse closing expenses and $7,765 for Canadian administrative reorganization, which were offset by $398 of net gains on the sale of real property. At August 31, 2003 the reserve for 17 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) warehouse closing costs was $8,609, of which $7,833 related to future lease obligations. This compares to a reserve for warehouse closing costs of $11,845 at September 1, 2002, of which $10,395 related to future lease obligations. Interest Expense Interest expense totaled $36,920 in fiscal 2003, compared to $29,096 in fiscal 2002. Interest expense in fiscal 2003 includes interest on the 3 1/2% Zero Coupon Notes, 7 1/8% and 5 1/2% Senior Notes and on balances outstanding under the Companys bank credit facilities and promissory notes. The increase is primarily related to the reduction in interest capitalized related to warehouse construction, as the overall cost of projects under construction was lower than in fiscal 2002. The increase was also attributed to the Companys issuance of $300,000 5 1/2% Senior Notes in March 2002, which were simultaneously swapped to a floating interest rate. This increase was partially offset by an interest rate reduction in the Companys $300,000 7 1/8% Senior Notes, resulting from interest rate swap agreements entered into effective November 13, 2001, converting the interest rate from fixed to floating, and to the fact that the Company had little interest expense related to borrowings under its commercial paper program in fiscal 2003. Interest Income and Other Interest income and other totaled $38,525 in fiscal 2003, compared to $35,745 in fiscal 2002. The increase primarily reflects greater interest earned on higher cash and cash equivalents balances on hand throughout fiscal 2003, as compared to fiscal 2002, which was partially offset by an increase in the expense to record the minority interest in earnings of foreign subsidiaries. Provision for Income Taxes The effective income tax rate on earnings was 37.75% in fiscal 2003 and 38.50% in fiscal 2002. The decrease in the effective income tax rate, year over year, is primarily attributable to lower statutory income tax rates for foreign operations. Liquidity and Capital Resources (dollars in thousands, except per share amounts) Cash Flows Cash flow generated from warehouse operations provides a significant source of liquidity. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $2,098,783 in fiscal 2004 compared to $1,507,208 in fiscal 2003. The increase of $591,575 is primarily a result of an increase in the change in receivables, other current assets, deferred income and accrued and other current liabilities of $507,860, due primarily to the collection of an operating tax receivable and increases in the workers compensation accrual, income taxes payable, executive membership two percent reward accrual and deferred membership income in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003. In addition, the increase in net income of $161,393 contributed to the increase in cash provided by operating activities. The primary investing activity continues to be the purchase of property and equipment and the construction of facilities related to the Companys warehouse expansion and remodel projects. Net cash used in investing activities totaled $1,048,481 in fiscal 2004 compared to $790,588 in fiscal 2003, an increase of $257,893. The increase in investing activities primarily relates to net purchases of short term investments of $303,945 and the purchase of the remaining 20% minority interest in Costco Wholesale UK Limited of $95,153, which was partially offset by a reduction in the acquisition of property and equipment and the construction of facilities for new and remodeled warehouses of $105,045 (from $810,665 to $705,620) between fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2004, as new warehouse openings decreased year over year from 29 (including five relocated warehouses) in fiscal 2003 to 20 in fiscal 2004. 18 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Net cash provided by financing activities totaled $209,569 in fiscal 2004 compared to net cash used of $1,428 in fiscal 2003. The increase of $210,997 primarily resulted from an increase in bank checks outstanding of $243,890 and the increase in proceeds received from the exercise of stock options of $90,077, which were offset by the payment of cash dividends in fiscal 2004 of $92,137 and from the reduction in the issuance of long term debt of $59,424 in fiscal 2003 to no additional issuances of long term debt in the current fiscal year. Dividends Costcos Board of Directors declared two quarterly cash dividends of $0.10 per share in fiscal 2004. The first quarterly cash dividend of $0.10 per share, in the amount of $45,939, was paid May 31, 2004 to shareholders of record at the close of business on May 10, 2004. The second quarterly cash dividend of $0.10 per share, in the amount of $46,198, was paid August 27, 2004, to shareholders of record at the close of business on July 23, 2004. Contractual Obligations The Companys commitment to make future payments under contractual obligations was as follows, as of August 29, 2004. Payments Due by Period Contractual obligations Total Less than 1 year 1 to 3years 4 to 5 years After 5 years Long term debt(1) $ 1,656,393 (2) $ 339,441 $ 336,632 $ 62,081 $ 918,239 (2) Capital lease obligations 5,449 1,451 1,117 1,115 1,766 Operating leases(3) 1,574,778 110,616 212,734 190,401 1,061,027 Purchase obligations (merchandise)(4) 3,509,786 3,153,157 356,629 Purchase obligations (building, equipment, services and other)(5) 232,212 213,823 16,556 1,833 Other(6) 6,235 476 594 418 4,747 Total $ 6,984,853 $ 3,818,964 $ 924,262 $ 255,848 $ 1,985,779 (1) Amounts include contractual interest payments.

(6) Primarily consists of asset retirement obligations. 19 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Expansion Plans Costcos primary requirement for capital is the financing of the land, building and equipment costs for new warehouses plus the costs of initial warehouse operations and working capital requirements, as well as additional capital for international expansion. While there can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized, and plans are subject to change upon further review, it is managements current intention to spend approximately $900,000 to $1,000,000 during fiscal 2005 in the United States and Canada for real estate, construction, remodeling and equipment for warehouse clubs and related operations; and approximately $100,000 to $150,000 for international expansion, including the United Kingdom, Asia, Mexico and other potential ventures. These expenditures are expected to be financed with a combination of cash provided from operations and the use of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. Expansion plans for the United States and Canada during fiscal 2005 are to open approximately 30 new warehouse clubs inclusive of seven relocations to larger and better located warehouses. The Company expects to continue its review of expansion plans in its international operations, including the United Kingdom and Asia, along with other international markets. At present, the Company is planning to open two additional warehouses in the U.K and one additional warehouse in both the Taiwan and Japan markets during fiscal 2005. Costco and its Mexico based joint venture partner, Controladora Comercial Mexicana, each own a 50% interest in Costco Mexico. Costco Mexico plans to open two to three new warehouse clubs during fiscal 2005. Additional Equity Investments in Subsidiary On October 3, 2003, the Company acquired from Carrefour Nederland B.V. its 20% equity interest in Costco Wholesale UK Limited for cash of $95,153, bringing Costcos ownership in Costco Wholesale UK Limited to 100%. Bank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs (all amounts stated in thousands of US dollars) The Company has a $500,000 commercial paper program supported by a $300,000 bank credit facility with a group of ten banks, of which $150,000 expired on November 9, 2004 and $150,000 expires on November 15, 2005. At August 29, 2004, no amounts were outstanding under the commercial paper program and no amounts were outstanding under the credit facility. The Company presently does not plan to renew the $150,000 portion of the credit facility that expired on November 9, 2004. A wholly owned Canadian subsidiary has a $152,000 commercial paper program supported by a $46,000 bank credit facility with a Canadian bank, that is guaranteed by the Company and expires in March 2005. At August 29, 2004, no amounts were outstanding under the Canadian commercial paper program or the bank credit facility. The Company has agreed to limit the combined amount outstanding under the U.S. and Canadian commercial paper programs to the combined amounts of the supporting bank credit facilities, which are $346,000 at August 29, 2004, decreased to $196,000 on November 9, 2004. The Companys wholly owned Japanese subsidiary has a short term $27,400 bank line of credit that originally expired in November 2004. Subsequent to the Companys fiscal year end, the bank line of credit was extended through February 10, 2005. At August 29, 2004, no amounts were outstanding under the line of credit. The Companys Korean subsidiary has a short term $10,400 bank line of credit, which expires in January 2005. At August 29, 2004, no amounts were outstanding under the line of credit. The Companys wholly owned UK subsidiary has a $108,000 bank revolving credit facility expiring in February 2007 and a $63,000 bank overdraft facility renewable on a yearly basis in March. At August 29, 2004, $21,595 was outstanding under the revolving credit facility with an applicable interest rate of 5.285% and no amounts were outstanding under the bank overdraft facility. 20 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Letters of Credit The Company has letter of credit facilities (for commercial and standby letters of credit), totaling approximately $338,000. The outstanding commitments under these facilities at August 29, 2004 totaled approximately $166,800, including approximately $52,900 in standby letters of credit. Financing Activities The Companys 7 1/8% Senior Notes of $304,350 at August 29, 2004 are due on June 15, 2005. The Company plans to repay the 7 1/8% Senior Notes from its cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances, which totaled $3,129,882 at August 29, 2004. In April 2003, the Companys wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.92% in the aggregate amount of approximately $36,576, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due on April 26, 2010. In November 2002, the Companys wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.88% in the aggregate amount of approximately $27,432, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due on November 7, 2009. The Company guarantees all of the promissory notes issued by its wholly owned Japanese subsidiary. In March 2002, the Company issued $300,000 of 5 1/2% Senior Notes due March 15, 2007. Interest is payable semi annually. Simultaneous with the issuance of the Senior Notes, the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements converting the interest from fixed to floating. In February 1996, the Company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a shelf registration statement for $500,000 of senior debt securities. On October 23, 2001, additional debt securities of $100,000 were registered. The $300,000 of 5 1/2% Senior Notes issued in March 2002 reduced the amount of registered securities available for future issuance to $300,000. Derivatives The Company has limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and uses them only to manage well defined interest rate and foreign exchange risks. Forward foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on inventory purchases and typically have very short terms. The aggregate amount of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at August 29, 2004 was not material. The only significant derivative instruments the Company holds are interest rate swaps, which the Company uses to manage the interest rate risk associated with its borrowings and to manage the Companys mix of fixed rate and variable rate debt. As of August 29, 2004, the Company had fixed to floating interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $600,000 and an aggregate fair value of $25,754, which is recorded in other assets on the Companys consolidated balance sheet. These swaps were entered into effective November 13, 2001, and March 25, 2002, and are designated and qualify as fair value hedges of the Companys $300,000 7 1/8% Senior Notes and the Companys $300,000 5 1/2% Senior Notes, respectively. As the terms of the swaps match those of the underlying hedged debt, the changes in the fair value of these swaps are offset by corresponding changes in the carrying amount of the hedged debt and result in no net earnings impact. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company has no off balance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on the Companys financial condition or consolidated financial statements. Stock Repurchase Program On November 30, 2001, the Companys Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program, authorizing the repurchase of up to $500,000 of Costco Common Stock through November 30, 2004. Under the program, 21 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) the Company could repurchase shares at any time in the open market or in private transactions as market conditions warrant. The repurchased shares would constitute authorized, but non issued shares and would be used for general corporate purposes, including stock option grants under stock option programs. On October 25, 2004, the Board of Directors renewed the program for another three years. To date, no shares have been repurchased under either program. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the Companys financial statements requires that management make estimates and judgments that affect the financial position and results of operations. Management continues to review its accounting policies and evaluate its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, merchandise inventory, impairment of long lived assets and warehouse closing costs and insurance/self insurance liabilities. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the present circumstances. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes sales, net of estimated returns, at the time customers take possession of merchandise or receive services. When the Company collects payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services, the amount received is recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed. The Company provides for estimated sales returns based on historical returns levels. Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market as determined primarily by the retail method of accounting and are stated using the last in, first out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail method of accounting, and are stated using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. The Company believes the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. The Company records an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the expected annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end. The Company considers in its calculation of the LIFO cost the estimated net realizable value of inventory in those inventory pools where deflation exists and records a write down of inventory where estimated net realizable value is less than LIFO inventory. The Company provides for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts on the basis of a percentage of sales. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect the trend of the actual physical inventory count results, which generally occur in the second and fourth fiscal quarters. Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as the Company progresses towards earning those rebates provided they are probable and reasonably estimable. Other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of agreement, or other systematic and rational approach. Impairment of long lived assets and warehouse closing costs The Company periodically evaluates its long lived assets for indicators of impairment. Managements judgments are based on market and operational conditions at the present time. Future events could cause management to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring an adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value. The Company provides estimates for warehouse closing costs when it is appropriate to do so based on the applicable accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Future circumstances may result in the Companys actual future closing costs or the amount recognized upon the sale of the property to differ substantially from the original estimates. 22 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Insurance/Self Insurance Liabilities The Company uses a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms to provide for the potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property insurance, director and officers liability, vehicle liability and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by the Company are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience and outside expertise, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In March 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Boards (FASB) Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) reached a consensus on EITF Issue No. 03 1, The Meaning of Other Than Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments, (EITF 03 1). The guidance prescribes a three step model for determining whether an investment is other than temporarily impaired and requires disclosures about unrealized losses on investments. The accounting guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after June 15, 2004, while the disclosure requirements are effective for annual reporting periods ending after June 15, 2004. In September 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position EITF 03 1 1, Effective Date of Paragraphs 10 20 of EITF Issue No. 03 1 The Meaning of Other Than Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments, (FSP EITF 03 01 1). FSP EITF 03 1 1 delays the effective date for the measurement and recognition guidance contained in paragraphs 10 20 of EITF Issue 03 01. During the period of the delay, FSP EITF 03 1 1 states that companies should continue to apply relevant other than temporary guidance. The adoption of EITF 03 1, excluding paragraphs 10 20, did not impact the Companys consolidated financial statements. The Company will assess the impact of paragraphs 10 20 of EITF 03 1 once the guidance has been finalized. In December 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46 (revised December 2003), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46R), which addresses how a business enterprise should evaluate whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity through means other than voting rights and accordingly should consolidate the entity. In general, a variable interest entity is a corporation, partnership, trust, or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either does not have equity investors with voting rights or has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities. FIN 46R requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entitys activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entitys residual returns or both. FIN 46R replaces FASB Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, which was issued in January 2003 and revised the implementation date to the first fiscal period ending after March 15, 2004, with the exception of special purpose entities. The adoption of this interpretation did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. In November 2003, the EITF reached consensus on Issue No. 03 10, Application of Issue No. 02 16 by Resellers to Sales Incentives Offered to Consumers by Manufacturers, with respect to determining if consideration received by a reseller from a vendor that is reimbursed by the vendor for honoring the vendors sale incentives offered directly to consumers should be recorded as a reduction in sales. These rules apply to transactions entered into by consumers in fiscal periods beginning after November 25, 2003 and, therefore, apply to such transactions starting with the Companys fiscal third quarter of 2004, which began February 16, 2004. The adoption of EITF 03 10 did not affect the Companys consolidated gross profit or net income, but did result in a reduction of both net sales and merchandise costs by an equal amount. For fiscal 2004, net sales and merchandise costs have been reduced by $334,065. Had the Companys comparable periods in fiscal 2003 and 2002 been reported under EITF 03 10 guidance, the sales and cost of sales would have been reduced by $282,288 and $248,155, respectively. 23 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) In November 2002, the EITF reached consensus on certain issues discussed in Issue No. 02 16, Accounting by a Customer (Including a Reseller) for Certain Consideration Received from a Vendor, with respect to determining how a reseller should characterize consideration received from a vendor and when to recognize and how to measure that consideration in its income statement. Requirements for recognizing volume based rebates are effective for arrangements entered into or modified after November 21, 2002 and resellers with other supplier payments should generally apply the new rules prospectively for agreements entered into or modified after December 31, 2002. The adoption of this consensus by the Company in fiscal 2003 did not have a significant impact on the Company on an annual basis, but resulted in a change in the timing for the recognition of some vendor allowances for certain agreements entered into subsequent to December 31, 2002 and extends the recognition time frame beyond that which was in effect for similar contracts entered into prior to December 31, 2002. Net income for fiscal 2004 was negatively impacted by approximately $2,808 (after tax) due to the adoption of EITF 02 16. Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company is exposed to financial market risk resulting from changes in interest and foreign currency rates. As a policy, the Company does not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions, nor hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. The nature and amount of the Companys long and short term debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As of August 29, 2004, the Companys fixed rate long term debt includes its $851,648 principal amount at maturity Zero Coupon Subordinated Notes and additional notes and capital lease obligations totaling $130,561. The Companys debt also includes $300,000 7 1/8% Senior Notes and $300,000 5 1/2% Senior Notes. The Company has entered into fixed to floating interest rate swaps on the Senior Notes, effectively converting these fixed interest rate securities to variable rate securities. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt and may affect the interest expense related to the variable rate debt. The Company holds interest bearing instruments that are classified as cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. Short term investments generally have a maturity of three months to five years from the purchase date. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. As the majority of these instruments are of a short term nature, if interest rates were to increase or decrease immediately, there is no material risk of a valuation adjustment related to these instruments. For those instruments that are classified as available for sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in interest rates are reflected in other accumulated comprehensive income or loss. Based on the Companys cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances at August 29, 2004, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $27,000 to interest income (pre tax) on an annual basis. Most foreign currency transactions have been conducted in local currencies, limiting the Companys exposure to changes in currency rates. The Company periodically enters into short term forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates on inventory purchases. The fair value of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at August 29, 2004 was not material to the Companys results of operations or its financial position. 24 Table of Contents 
 
Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Changes in prices of merchandise did not materially affect the sales increases, with the exception of gasoline, where price increases accounted for a sales increase of approximately 70 basis points. In addition, due to the weaker U.S. dollar throughout fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003, translation of foreign sales into U.S. dollars contributed to the increase in sales, accounting for a comparable sales increase of approximately 190 basis points year over year. Sales were also positively impacted by the supermarket strikes in Southern California during the first half of the Companys fiscal year. The positive impact to sales for the entire fiscal year was estimated to be 35 to 50 basis points. Membership Fees Membership fees increased 12.7% to $961,280, or 2.04% of net sales, in fiscal 2004 from $852,853, or 2.05% of net sales, in fiscal 2003. This increase was primarily due to additional membership sign ups at the 20 new warehouses opened in fiscal 2004; increased penetration of the Companys Executive membership, including the rollout of the program into Canada, which began in the first quarter of fiscal 2004; and high overall member renewal rates consistent with recent years, currently at 86%. Gross Margin Gross margin increased 13.4% to $5,053,696, or 10.72% of net sales, in fiscal 2004 from $4,457,316, or 10.69% of net sales, in fiscal 2003. The three basis point increase, as a percent of net sales, reflected a 14 basis point increase in gross margin in the Companys merchandise departments, helped by strong year over year gross margin gains in the Companys ancillary business operations, particularly gasoline and pharmacy. Year over year gross margin, as a percentage of net sales, was also positively impacted by the implementation of EITF 03 10, whereby net sales and merchandise costs were reduced, resulting in an eight basis point increase. The year over year gross margin percentage was reduced by 12 basis points due to the increased rewards related to the Executive Membership Two Percent Reward Program, resulting from an increase in the penetration of the Executive Member program. The gross margin figures reflect accounting for most U.S. merchandise inventories on the last in, first out (LIFO) method. Fiscal 2004 included a $6,090 LIFO charge (increase in merchandise costs), while fiscal 2003 included a $19,650 LIFO credit (reduction in merchandise costs). The impact of the LIFO adjustment on a year over year basis negatively impacted margin by an additional six basis points. If all inventories had been valued using the first in, first out (FIFO) method, inventories would have been lower by $13,410 and $19,500 at August 29, 2004 and August 31, 2003, respectively. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses as a percent of net sales decreased to 9.75% during fiscal 2004 from 9.83% during fiscal 2003. Had EITF 03 10 been in effect in fiscal 2003, SG&A expenses as a percent to net sales would have shown additional improvement of seven basis points in fiscal 2004. For fiscal 2004, warehouse and central operating costs positively impacted SG&A comparisons year over year by approximately 21 basis points, primarily due to increased expense leverage of warehouse payroll, benefits (primarily health care), utility and workers compensation costs. During the latter half of fiscal 2004, the Company implemented changes to its employee healthcare plans that reduced its overall healthcare costs, primarily in the fourth quarter. This improvement was partially offset by the seven basis point increase resulting from the adoption of EITF 03 10, a two basis point increase in expense related to the establishment of additional insurance liabilities resulting from financial difficulties being experienced by one of the Companys third party insurance providers, and an increase in stock based compensation costs following the Companys prospective adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, during fiscal 2003, of four basis points. 15 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Preopening Expenses Preopening expenses totaled $30,451, or 0.07% of net sales, during fiscal 2004 compared to $36,643, or 0.09% of net sales, during fiscal 2003. This reduction was due to fewer warehouse openings. During fiscal 2004, the Company opened 20 new warehouses compared to 29 new warehouses (including 5 relocations) during fiscal 2003. Pre opening expenses also include costs related to remodels and expanded ancillary operations at existing warehouses. Provision for Impaired Assets and Closing Costs, net The net provision for impaired assets and closing costs was $1,000 in fiscal 2004, compared to $19,500 in fiscal 2003. The provision includes costs related to impairment of long lived assets, future lease obligations of warehouses that have been relocated to new facilities, and losses or gains resulting from the sale of real property. The provision for fiscal 2004 included charges of $16,548 for warehouse closing expenses that were offset by gains of $15,548 on the sale of real property. The provision for fiscal 2003 included charges of $11,836 for warehouse closing expenses, $4,697 for impairment of long lived assets and $2,967 for net losses on the sale of real property. At August 29, 2004, the reserve for warehouse closing costs was $10,367, of which $9,184 related to future lease obligations. This compares to a reserve for warehouse closing costs of $8,609 at August 31, 2003, of which $7,833 related to future lease obligations. Interest Expense Interest expense totaled $36,651 in fiscal 2004, compared to $36,920 in fiscal 2003. Interest expense in both fiscal 2004 and 2003 includes interest on the 3 1/2% Zero Coupon Notes, 7 1/8% and 5 1/2% Senior Notes and on balances outstanding under the Companys bank credit facilities and promissory notes. The decrease was primarily a result of the Companys reduction in short term borrowings, principally related to its foreign subsidiaries. This decrease was substantially offset by increases in interest rates on the Senior Notes due to interest rate swap agreements converting the interest rate from fixed to floating. Interest Income and Other Interest income and other totaled $51,627 in fiscal 2004, compared to $38,525 in fiscal 2003. The increase primarily reflects greater interest earned on higher cash and cash equivalents balances and short term investments. In addition, a reduction in the expense to record minority interest in the earnings of foreign subsidiaries was reported in fiscal 2004 as the Company increased its ownership in Costco Wholesale UK Limited to 100%. Provision for Income Taxes The effective income tax rate on earnings was 37% in fiscal 2004 and 37.75% in fiscal 2003. The decrease in the effective income tax rate is primarily attributable to lower statutory income tax rates for foreign operations and one time benefits associated with certain tax planning strategies. Comparison of Fiscal 2003 (52 weeks) and Fiscal 2002 (52 weeks): (dollars in thousands, except earnings per share) Net Income Net income for fiscal 2003 increased 3.0% to $721,000, or $1.53 per diluted share, from $699,983, or $1.48 per diluted share during fiscal year 2002. Net Sales Net sales increased 9.7% to $41,692,699 in fiscal 2003 from $37,993,093 in fiscal 2002. Approximately 55% of the increase was due to an increase in comparable warehouse sales, that is sales in warehouses open for at 16 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) least a year, and approximately 45% of the increase was due to opening a net of 23 new warehouses (29 opened, 6 closed) during fiscal 2003 and a net of 29 new warehouses (35 opened, 6 closed) during fiscal 2002, a portion of which is not included in comparable warehouse sales. With the exception of price increases in gasoline, which accounted for a comparable sales increase of approximately 70 basis points, changes in prices of merchandise did not materially contribute to sales increases. In addition, due to the weaker U.S. dollar in fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002, translation of foreign sales into U.S. dollars contributed to the increase in sales, accounting for a comparable sales increase of approximately one percent year over year. Comparable sales increased at a five percent annual rate in fiscal 2003 compared to a six percent annual rate during fiscal 2002. Membership fees Membership fees increased 10.8% to $852,853, or 2.05% of net sales, in fiscal 2003 from $769,406, or 2.03% of net sales, in fiscal 2002. This increase was primarily due to additional membership sign ups at the 23 net new warehouses opened in fiscal 2003, and increased penetration of the Companys Executive Membership. Overall, member renewal rates remained consistent with the prior year, currently at 86%. Gross Margin Gross margin (defined as net sales minus merchandise costs) increased 11.2% to $4,457,316, or 10.69% of net sales, in fiscal 2003 from $4,009,972, or 10.55% of net sales, in fiscal 2002. The increase in gross margin as a percentage of net sales reflects merchandise gross margin improvement within the Companys ancillary warehouse businesses and international operations accounting for increases of 15 and eight basis points, respectively. Additionally, increased rewards related to the Executive Membership Two Percent Reward Program reduced gross margin by seven basis points. The gross margin figures reflect accounting for most U.S. merchandise inventories on the last in, first out (LIFO) method. The effect of the LIFO adjustment for fiscal 2003 was to increase gross margin by $19,650, compared to a gross margin increase of $13,500 in fiscal 2002. If all inventories had been valued using the first in, first out (FIFO) method, inventories would have been lower by $19,500 at August 31, 2003 and higher by $150 at September 1, 2002. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales increased to 9.83% during fiscal 2003 from 9.41% during fiscal 2002. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales was primarily due to increases in employee healthcare, workers compensation (primarily in the state of California) and salary costs within the Companys domestic operations. International expenses also increased, accounting for approximately seven basis points of the 42 basis points year over year increase. Preopening Expenses Preopening expenses totaled $36,643, or 0.09% of net sales, during fiscal 2003, compared to $51,257, or 0.13% of net sales, during fiscal 2002. During fiscal 2003, the Company opened 29 new warehouses (including five relocations) compared to 35 new warehouses (including six relocations) during fiscal 2002. Pre opening expenses also include costs related to remodels and expanded ancillary operations at existing warehouses. Provision for Impaired Assets and Closing Costs, net The net provision for impaired assets and closing costs was $19,500 in fiscal 2003 compared to $21,050 in fiscal 2002. The provision includes costs related to impairment of long lived assets, future lease obligations of warehouses that have been relocated to new facilities and any losses or gains resulting from the sale of real property. The provision for fiscal 2003 included charges of $11,836 for warehouse closing expenses, $4,697 for impairment of long lived assets and $2,967 for net losses on the sale of real property. The fiscal 2002 provision included charges of $13,683 for warehouse closing expenses and $7,765 for Canadian administrative reorganization, which were offset by $398 of net gains on the sale of real property. At August 31, 2003 the reserve for 17 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) warehouse closing costs was $8,609, of which $7,833 related to future lease obligations. This compares to a reserve for warehouse closing costs of $11,845 at September 1, 2002, of which $10,395 related to future lease obligations. Interest Expense Interest expense totaled $36,920 in fiscal 2003, compared to $29,096 in fiscal 2002. Interest expense in fiscal 2003 includes interest on the 3 1/2% Zero Coupon Notes, 7 1/8% and 5 1/2% Senior Notes and on balances outstanding under the Companys bank credit facilities and promissory notes. The increase is primarily related to the reduction in interest capitalized related to warehouse construction, as the overall cost of projects under construction was lower than in fiscal 2002. The increase was also attributed to the Companys issuance of $300,000 5 1/2% Senior Notes in March 2002, which were simultaneously swapped to a floating interest rate. This increase was partially offset by an interest rate reduction in the Companys $300,000 7 1/8% Senior Notes, resulting from interest rate swap agreements entered into effective November 13, 2001, converting the interest rate from fixed to floating, and to the fact that the Company had little interest expense related to borrowings under its commercial paper program in fiscal 2003. Interest Income and Other Interest income and other totaled $38,525 in fiscal 2003, compared to $35,745 in fiscal 2002. The increase primarily reflects greater interest earned on higher cash and cash equivalents balances on hand throughout fiscal 2003, as compared to fiscal 2002, which was partially offset by an increase in the expense to record the minority interest in earnings of foreign subsidiaries. Provision for Income Taxes The effective income tax rate on earnings was 37.75% in fiscal 2003 and 38.50% in fiscal 2002. The decrease in the effective income tax rate, year over year, is primarily attributable to lower statutory income tax rates for foreign operations. Liquidity and Capital Resources (dollars in thousands, except per share amounts) Cash Flows Cash flow generated from warehouse operations provides a significant source of liquidity. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $2,098,783 in fiscal 2004 compared to $1,507,208 in fiscal 2003. The increase of $591,575 is primarily a result of an increase in the change in receivables, other current assets, deferred income and accrued and other current liabilities of $507,860, due primarily to the collection of an operating tax receivable and increases in the workers compensation accrual, income taxes payable, executive membership two percent reward accrual and deferred membership income in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003. In addition, the increase in net income of $161,393 contributed to the increase in cash provided by operating activities. The primary investing activity continues to be the purchase of property and equipment and the construction of facilities related to the Companys warehouse expansion and remodel projects. Net cash used in investing activities totaled $1,048,481 in fiscal 2004 compared to $790,588 in fiscal 2003, an increase of $257,893. The increase in investing activities primarily relates to net purchases of short term investments of $303,945 and the purchase of the remaining 20% minority interest in Costco Wholesale UK Limited of $95,153, which was partially offset by a reduction in the acquisition of property and equipment and the construction of facilities for new and remodeled warehouses of $105,045 (from $810,665 to $705,620) between fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2004, as new warehouse openings decreased year over year from 29 (including five relocated warehouses) in fiscal 2003 to 20 in fiscal 2004. 18 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Net cash provided by financing activities totaled $209,569 in fiscal 2004 compared to net cash used of $1,428 in fiscal 2003. The increase of $210,997 primarily resulted from an increase in bank checks outstanding of $243,890 and the increase in proceeds received from the exercise of stock options of $90,077, which were offset by the payment of cash dividends in fiscal 2004 of $92,137 and from the reduction in the issuance of long term debt of $59,424 in fiscal 2003 to no additional issuances of long term debt in the current fiscal year. Dividends Costcos Board of Directors declared two quarterly cash dividends of $0.10 per share in fiscal 2004. The first quarterly cash dividend of $0.10 per share, in the amount of $45,939, was paid May 31, 2004 to shareholders of record at the close of business on May 10, 2004. The second quarterly cash dividend of $0.10 per share, in the amount of $46,198, was paid August 27, 2004, to shareholders of record at the close of business on July 23, 2004. Contractual Obligations The Companys commitment to make future payments under contractual obligations was as follows, as of August 29, 2004. Payments Due by Period Contractual obligations Total Less than 1 year 1 to 3years 4 to 5 years After 5 years Long term debt(1) $ 1,656,393 (2) $ 339,441 $ 336,632 $ 62,081 $ 918,239 (2) Capital lease obligations 5,449 1,451 1,117 1,115 1,766 Operating leases(3) 1,574,778 110,616 212,734 190,401 1,061,027 Purchase obligations (merchandise)(4) 3,509,786 3,153,157 356,629 Purchase obligations (building, equipment, services and other)(5) 232,212 213,823 16,556 1,833 Other(6) 6,235 476 594 418 4,747 Total $ 6,984,853 $ 3,818,964 $ 924,262 $ 255,848 $ 1,985,779 (1) Amounts include contractual interest payments.

While there can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized, and plans are subject to change upon further review, it is managements current intention to spend approximately $900,000 to $1,000,000 during fiscal 2005 in the United States and Canada for real estate, construction, remodeling and equipment for warehouse clubs and related operations; and approximately $100,000 to $150,000 for international expansion, including the United Kingdom, Asia, Mexico and other potential ventures. These expenditures are expected to be financed with a combination of cash provided from operations and the use of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. Expansion plans for the United States and Canada during fiscal 2005 are to open approximately 30 new warehouse clubs inclusive of seven relocations to larger and better located warehouses. The Company expects to continue its review of expansion plans in its international operations, including the United Kingdom and Asia, along with other international markets. At present, the Company is planning to open two additional warehouses in the U.K and one additional warehouse in both the Taiwan and Japan markets during fiscal 2005. Costco and its Mexico based joint venture partner, Controladora Comercial Mexicana, each own a 50% interest in Costco Mexico. Costco Mexico plans to open two to three new warehouse clubs during fiscal 2005. Additional Equity Investments in Subsidiary On October 3, 2003, the Company acquired from Carrefour Nederland B.V. its 20% equity interest in Costco Wholesale UK Limited for cash of $95,153, bringing Costcos ownership in Costco Wholesale UK Limited to 100%. Bank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs (all amounts stated in thousands of US dollars) The Company has a $500,000 commercial paper program supported by a $300,000 bank credit facility with a group of ten banks, of which $150,000 expired on November 9, 2004 and $150,000 expires on November 15, 2005. At August 29, 2004, no amounts were outstanding under the commercial paper program and no amounts were outstanding under the credit facility. The Company presently does not plan to renew the $150,000 portion of the credit facility that expired on November 9, 2004. A wholly owned Canadian subsidiary has a $152,000 commercial paper program supported by a $46,000 bank credit facility with a Canadian bank, that is guaranteed by the Company and expires in March 2005. At August 29, 2004, no amounts were outstanding under the Canadian commercial paper program or the bank credit facility. The Company has agreed to limit the combined amount outstanding under the U.S. and Canadian commercial paper programs to the combined amounts of the supporting bank credit facilities, which are $346,000 at August 29, 2004, decreased to $196,000 on November 9, 2004. The Companys wholly owned Japanese subsidiary has a short term $27,400 bank line of credit that originally expired in November 2004. Subsequent to the Companys fiscal year end, the bank line of credit was extended through February 10, 2005. At August 29, 2004, no amounts were outstanding under the line of credit. The Companys Korean subsidiary has a short term $10,400 bank line of credit, which expires in January 2005. At August 29, 2004, no amounts were outstanding under the line of credit. The Companys wholly owned UK subsidiary has a $108,000 bank revolving credit facility expiring in February 2007 and a $63,000 bank overdraft facility renewable on a yearly basis in March. At August 29, 2004, $21,595 was outstanding under the revolving credit facility with an applicable interest rate of 5.285% and no amounts were outstanding under the bank overdraft facility. 20 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Letters of Credit The Company has letter of credit facilities (for commercial and standby letters of credit), totaling approximately $338,000. The outstanding commitments under these facilities at August 29, 2004 totaled approximately $166,800, including approximately $52,900 in standby letters of credit. Financing Activities The Companys 7 1/8% Senior Notes of $304,350 at August 29, 2004 are due on June 15, 2005. The Company plans to repay the 7 1/8% Senior Notes from its cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances, which totaled $3,129,882 at August 29, 2004. In April 2003, the Companys wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.92% in the aggregate amount of approximately $36,576, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due on April 26, 2010. In November 2002, the Companys wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.88% in the aggregate amount of approximately $27,432, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due on November 7, 2009. The Company guarantees all of the promissory notes issued by its wholly owned Japanese subsidiary. In March 2002, the Company issued $300,000 of 5 1/2% Senior Notes due March 15, 2007. Interest is payable semi annually. Simultaneous with the issuance of the Senior Notes, the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements converting the interest from fixed to floating. In February 1996, the Company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a shelf registration statement for $500,000 of senior debt securities. On October 23, 2001, additional debt securities of $100,000 were registered. The $300,000 of 5 1/2% Senior Notes issued in March 2002 reduced the amount of registered securities available for future issuance to $300,000. Derivatives The Company has limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and uses them only to manage well defined interest rate and foreign exchange risks. Forward foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on inventory purchases and typically have very short terms. The aggregate amount of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at August 29, 2004 was not material. The only significant derivative instruments the Company holds are interest rate swaps, which the Company uses to manage the interest rate risk associated with its borrowings and to manage the Companys mix of fixed rate and variable rate debt. As of August 29, 2004, the Company had fixed to floating interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $600,000 and an aggregate fair value of $25,754, which is recorded in other assets on the Companys consolidated balance sheet. These swaps were entered into effective November 13, 2001, and March 25, 2002, and are designated and qualify as fair value hedges of the Companys $300,000 7 1/8% Senior Notes and the Companys $300,000 5 1/2% Senior Notes, respectively. As the terms of the swaps match those of the underlying hedged debt, the changes in the fair value of these swaps are offset by corresponding changes in the carrying amount of the hedged debt and result in no net earnings impact. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company has no off balance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on the Companys financial condition or consolidated financial statements. Stock Repurchase Program On November 30, 2001, the Companys Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program, authorizing the repurchase of up to $500,000 of Costco Common Stock through November 30, 2004. Under the program, 21 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) the Company could repurchase shares at any time in the open market or in private transactions as market conditions warrant. The repurchased shares would constitute authorized, but non issued shares and would be used for general corporate purposes, including stock option grants under stock option programs. On October 25, 2004, the Board of Directors renewed the program for another three years. To date, no shares have been repurchased under either program. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the Companys financial statements requires that management make estimates and judgments that affect the financial position and results of operations. Management continues to review its accounting policies and evaluate its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, merchandise inventory, impairment of long lived assets and warehouse closing costs and insurance/self insurance liabilities. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the present circumstances. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes sales, net of estimated returns, at the time customers take possession of merchandise or receive services. When the Company collects payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services, the amount received is recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed. The Company provides for estimated sales returns based on historical returns levels. Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market as determined primarily by the retail method of accounting and are stated using the last in, first out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail method of accounting, and are stated using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. The Company believes the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. The Company records an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the expected annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end. The Company considers in its calculation of the LIFO cost the estimated net realizable value of inventory in those inventory pools where deflation exists and records a write down of inventory where estimated net realizable value is less than LIFO inventory. The Company provides for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts on the basis of a percentage of sales. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect the trend of the actual physical inventory count results, which generally occur in the second and fourth fiscal quarters. Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as the Company progresses towards earning those rebates provided they are probable and reasonably estimable. Other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of agreement, or other systematic and rational approach. Impairment of long lived assets and warehouse closing costs The Company periodically evaluates its long lived assets for indicators of impairment. Managements judgments are based on market and operational conditions at the present time. Future events could cause management to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring an adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value. The Company provides estimates for warehouse closing costs when it is appropriate to do so based on the applicable accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Future circumstances may result in the Companys actual future closing costs or the amount recognized upon the sale of the property to differ substantially from the original estimates. 22 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Insurance/Self Insurance Liabilities The Company uses a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms to provide for the potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property insurance, director and officers liability, vehicle liability and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by the Company are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience and outside expertise, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In March 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Boards (FASB) Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) reached a consensus on EITF Issue No. 03 1, The Meaning of Other Than Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments, (EITF 03 1). The guidance prescribes a three step model for determining whether an investment is other than temporarily impaired and requires disclosures about unrealized losses on investments. The accounting guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after June 15, 2004, while the disclosure requirements are effective for annual reporting periods ending after June 15, 2004. In September 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position EITF 03 1 1, Effective Date of Paragraphs 10 20 of EITF Issue No. 03 1 The Meaning of Other Than Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments, (FSP EITF 03 01 1). FSP EITF 03 1 1 delays the effective date for the measurement and recognition guidance contained in paragraphs 10 20 of EITF Issue 03 01. During the period of the delay, FSP EITF 03 1 1 states that companies should continue to apply relevant other than temporary guidance. The adoption of EITF 03 1, excluding paragraphs 10 20, did not impact the Companys consolidated financial statements. The Company will assess the impact of paragraphs 10 20 of EITF 03 1 once the guidance has been finalized. In December 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46 (revised December 2003), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46R), which addresses how a business enterprise should evaluate whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity through means other than voting rights and accordingly should consolidate the entity. In general, a variable interest entity is a corporation, partnership, trust, or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either does not have equity investors with voting rights or has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities. FIN 46R requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entitys activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entitys residual returns or both. FIN 46R replaces FASB Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, which was issued in January 2003 and revised the implementation date to the first fiscal period ending after March 15, 2004, with the exception of special purpose entities. The adoption of this interpretation did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. In November 2003, the EITF reached consensus on Issue No. 03 10, Application of Issue No. 02 16 by Resellers to Sales Incentives Offered to Consumers by Manufacturers, with respect to determining if consideration received by a reseller from a vendor that is reimbursed by the vendor for honoring the vendors sale incentives offered directly to consumers should be recorded as a reduction in sales. These rules apply to transactions entered into by consumers in fiscal periods beginning after November 25, 2003 and, therefore, apply to such transactions starting with the Companys fiscal third quarter of 2004, which began February 16, 2004. The adoption of EITF 03 10 did not affect the Companys consolidated gross profit or net income, but did result in a reduction of both net sales and merchandise costs by an equal amount. For fiscal 2004, net sales and merchandise costs have been reduced by $334,065. Had the Companys comparable periods in fiscal 2003 and 2002 been reported under EITF 03 10 guidance, the sales and cost of sales would have been reduced by $282,288 and $248,155, respectively. 23 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) In November 2002, the EITF reached consensus on certain issues discussed in Issue No. 02 16, Accounting by a Customer (Including a Reseller) for Certain Consideration Received from a Vendor, with respect to determining how a reseller should characterize consideration received from a vendor and when to recognize and how to measure that consideration in its income statement. Requirements for recognizing volume based rebates are effective for arrangements entered into or modified after November 21, 2002 and resellers with other supplier payments should generally apply the new rules prospectively for agreements entered into or modified after December 31, 2002. The adoption of this consensus by the Company in fiscal 2003 did not have a significant impact on the Company on an annual basis, but resulted in a change in the timing for the recognition of some vendor allowances for certain agreements entered into subsequent to December 31, 2002 and extends the recognition time frame beyond that which was in effect for similar contracts entered into prior to December 31, 2002. Net income for fiscal 2004 was negatively impacted by approximately $2,808 (after tax) due to the adoption of EITF 02 16. Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company is exposed to financial market risk resulting from changes in interest and foreign currency rates. As a policy, the Company does not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions, nor hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. The nature and amount of the Companys long and short term debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As of August 29, 2004, the Companys fixed rate long term debt includes its $851,648 principal amount at maturity Zero Coupon Subordinated Notes and additional notes and capital lease obligations totaling $130,561. The Companys debt also includes $300,000 7 1/8% Senior Notes and $300,000 5 1/2% Senior Notes. The Company has entered into fixed to floating interest rate swaps on the Senior Notes, effectively converting these fixed interest rate securities to variable rate securities. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt and may affect the interest expense related to the variable rate debt. The Company holds interest bearing instruments that are classified as cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. Short term investments generally have a maturity of three months to five years from the purchase date. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. As the majority of these instruments are of a short term nature, if interest rates were to increase or decrease immediately, there is no material risk of a valuation adjustment related to these instruments. For those instruments that are classified as available for sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in interest rates are reflected in other accumulated comprehensive income or loss. Based on the Companys cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances at August 29, 2004, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $27,000 to interest income (pre tax) on an annual basis. Most foreign currency transactions have been conducted in local currencies, limiting the Companys exposure to changes in currency rates. The Company periodically enters into short term forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates on inventory purchases. The fair value of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at August 29, 2004 was not material to the Companys results of operations or its financial position. 24 Table of Contents 
 
Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Preopening Expenses Preopening expenses totaled $30,451, or 0.07% of net sales, during fiscal 2004 compared to $36,643, or 0.09% of net sales, during fiscal 2003. This reduction was due to fewer warehouse openings. During fiscal 2004, the Company opened 20 new warehouses compared to 29 new warehouses (including 5 relocations) during fiscal 2003. Pre opening expenses also include costs related to remodels and expanded ancillary operations at existing warehouses. Provision for Impaired Assets and Closing Costs, net The net provision for impaired assets and closing costs was $1,000 in fiscal 2004, compared to $19,500 in fiscal 2003. The provision includes costs related to impairment of long lived assets, future lease obligations of warehouses that have been relocated to new facilities, and losses or gains resulting from the sale of real property. The provision for fiscal 2004 included charges of $16,548 for warehouse closing expenses that were offset by gains of $15,548 on the sale of real property. The provision for fiscal 2003 included charges of $11,836 for warehouse closing expenses, $4,697 for impairment of long lived assets and $2,967 for net losses on the sale of real property. At August 29, 2004, the reserve for warehouse closing costs was $10,367, of which $9,184 related to future lease obligations. This compares to a reserve for warehouse closing costs of $8,609 at August 31, 2003, of which $7,833 related to future lease obligations. Interest Expense Interest expense totaled $36,651 in fiscal 2004, compared to $36,920 in fiscal 2003. Interest expense in both fiscal 2004 and 2003 includes interest on the 3 1/2% Zero Coupon Notes, 7 1/8% and 5 1/2% Senior Notes and on balances outstanding under the Companys bank credit facilities and promissory notes. The decrease was primarily a result of the Companys reduction in short term borrowings, principally related to its foreign subsidiaries. This decrease was substantially offset by increases in interest rates on the Senior Notes due to interest rate swap agreements converting the interest rate from fixed to floating. Interest Income and Other Interest income and other totaled $51,627 in fiscal 2004, compared to $38,525 in fiscal 2003. The increase primarily reflects greater interest earned on higher cash and cash equivalents balances and short term investments. In addition, a reduction in the expense to record minority interest in the earnings of foreign subsidiaries was reported in fiscal 2004 as the Company increased its ownership in Costco Wholesale UK Limited to 100%. Provision for Income Taxes The effective income tax rate on earnings was 37% in fiscal 2004 and 37.75% in fiscal 2003. The decrease in the effective income tax rate is primarily attributable to lower statutory income tax rates for foreign operations and one time benefits associated with certain tax planning strategies. Comparison of Fiscal 2003 (52 weeks) and Fiscal 2002 (52 weeks): (dollars in thousands, except earnings per share) Net Income Net income for fiscal 2003 increased 3.0% to $721,000, or $1.53 per diluted share, from $699,983, or $1.48 per diluted share during fiscal year 2002. Net Sales Net sales increased 9.7% to $41,692,699 in fiscal 2003 from $37,993,093 in fiscal 2002. Approximately 55% of the increase was due to an increase in comparable warehouse sales, that is sales in warehouses open for at 16 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) least a year, and approximately 45% of the increase was due to opening a net of 23 new warehouses (29 opened, 6 closed) during fiscal 2003 and a net of 29 new warehouses (35 opened, 6 closed) during fiscal 2002, a portion of which is not included in comparable warehouse sales. With the exception of price increases in gasoline, which accounted for a comparable sales increase of approximately 70 basis points, changes in prices of merchandise did not materially contribute to sales increases. In addition, due to the weaker U.S. dollar in fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002, translation of foreign sales into U.S. dollars contributed to the increase in sales, accounting for a comparable sales increase of approximately one percent year over year. Comparable sales increased at a five percent annual rate in fiscal 2003 compared to a six percent annual rate during fiscal 2002. Membership fees Membership fees increased 10.8% to $852,853, or 2.05% of net sales, in fiscal 2003 from $769,406, or 2.03% of net sales, in fiscal 2002. This increase was primarily due to additional membership sign ups at the 23 net new warehouses opened in fiscal 2003, and increased penetration of the Companys Executive Membership. Overall, member renewal rates remained consistent with the prior year, currently at 86%. Gross Margin Gross margin (defined as net sales minus merchandise costs) increased 11.2% to $4,457,316, or 10.69% of net sales, in fiscal 2003 from $4,009,972, or 10.55% of net sales, in fiscal 2002. The increase in gross margin as a percentage of net sales reflects merchandise gross margin improvement within the Companys ancillary warehouse businesses and international operations accounting for increases of 15 and eight basis points, respectively. Additionally, increased rewards related to the Executive Membership Two Percent Reward Program reduced gross margin by seven basis points. The gross margin figures reflect accounting for most U.S. merchandise inventories on the last in, first out (LIFO) method. The effect of the LIFO adjustment for fiscal 2003 was to increase gross margin by $19,650, compared to a gross margin increase of $13,500 in fiscal 2002. If all inventories had been valued using the first in, first out (FIFO) method, inventories would have been lower by $19,500 at August 31, 2003 and higher by $150 at September 1, 2002. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales increased to 9.83% during fiscal 2003 from 9.41% during fiscal 2002. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales was primarily due to increases in employee healthcare, workers compensation (primarily in the state of California) and salary costs within the Companys domestic operations. International expenses also increased, accounting for approximately seven basis points of the 42 basis points year over year increase. Preopening Expenses Preopening expenses totaled $36,643, or 0.09% of net sales, during fiscal 2003, compared to $51,257, or 0.13% of net sales, during fiscal 2002. During fiscal 2003, the Company opened 29 new warehouses (including five relocations) compared to 35 new warehouses (including six relocations) during fiscal 2002. Pre opening expenses also include costs related to remodels and expanded ancillary operations at existing warehouses. Provision for Impaired Assets and Closing Costs, net The net provision for impaired assets and closing costs was $19,500 in fiscal 2003 compared to $21,050 in fiscal 2002. The provision includes costs related to impairment of long lived assets, future lease obligations of warehouses that have been relocated to new facilities and any losses or gains resulting from the sale of real property. The provision for fiscal 2003 included charges of $11,836 for warehouse closing expenses, $4,697 for impairment of long lived assets and $2,967 for net losses on the sale of real property. The fiscal 2002 provision included charges of $13,683 for warehouse closing expenses and $7,765 for Canadian administrative reorganization, which were offset by $398 of net gains on the sale of real property. At August 31, 2003 the reserve for 17 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) warehouse closing costs was $8,609, of which $7,833 related to future lease obligations. This compares to a reserve for warehouse closing costs of $11,845 at September 1, 2002, of which $10,395 related to future lease obligations. Interest Expense Interest expense totaled $36,920 in fiscal 2003, compared to $29,096 in fiscal 2002. Interest expense in fiscal 2003 includes interest on the 3 1/2% Zero Coupon Notes, 7 1/8% and 5 1/2% Senior Notes and on balances outstanding under the Companys bank credit facilities and promissory notes. The increase is primarily related to the reduction in interest capitalized related to warehouse construction, as the overall cost of projects under construction was lower than in fiscal 2002. The increase was also attributed to the Companys issuance of $300,000 5 1/2% Senior Notes in March 2002, which were simultaneously swapped to a floating interest rate. This increase was partially offset by an interest rate reduction in the Companys $300,000 7 1/8% Senior Notes, resulting from interest rate swap agreements entered into effective November 13, 2001, converting the interest rate from fixed to floating, and to the fact that the Company had little interest expense related to borrowings under its commercial paper program in fiscal 2003. Interest Income and Other Interest income and other totaled $38,525 in fiscal 2003, compared to $35,745 in fiscal 2002. The increase primarily reflects greater interest earned on higher cash and cash equivalents balances on hand throughout fiscal 2003, as compared to fiscal 2002, which was partially offset by an increase in the expense to record the minority interest in earnings of foreign subsidiaries. Provision for Income Taxes The effective income tax rate on earnings was 37.75% in fiscal 2003 and 38.50% in fiscal 2002. The decrease in the effective income tax rate, year over year, is primarily attributable to lower statutory income tax rates for foreign operations. Liquidity and Capital Resources (dollars in thousands, except per share amounts) Cash Flows Cash flow generated from warehouse operations provides a significant source of liquidity. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $2,098,783 in fiscal 2004 compared to $1,507,208 in fiscal 2003. The increase of $591,575 is primarily a result of an increase in the change in receivables, other current assets, deferred income and accrued and other current liabilities of $507,860, due primarily to the collection of an operating tax receivable and increases in the workers compensation accrual, income taxes payable, executive membership two percent reward accrual and deferred membership income in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003. In addition, the increase in net income of $161,393 contributed to the increase in cash provided by operating activities. The primary investing activity continues to be the purchase of property and equipment and the construction of facilities related to the Companys warehouse expansion and remodel projects. Net cash used in investing activities totaled $1,048,481 in fiscal 2004 compared to $790,588 in fiscal 2003, an increase of $257,893. The increase in investing activities primarily relates to net purchases of short term investments of $303,945 and the purchase of the remaining 20% minority interest in Costco Wholesale UK Limited of $95,153, which was partially offset by a reduction in the acquisition of property and equipment and the construction of facilities for new and remodeled warehouses of $105,045 (from $810,665 to $705,620) between fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2004, as new warehouse openings decreased year over year from 29 (including five relocated warehouses) in fiscal 2003 to 20 in fiscal 2004. 18 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Net cash provided by financing activities totaled $209,569 in fiscal 2004 compared to net cash used of $1,428 in fiscal 2003. The increase of $210,997 primarily resulted from an increase in bank checks outstanding of $243,890 and the increase in proceeds received from the exercise of stock options of $90,077, which were offset by the payment of cash dividends in fiscal 2004 of $92,137 and from the reduction in the issuance of long term debt of $59,424 in fiscal 2003 to no additional issuances of long term debt in the current fiscal year. Dividends Costcos Board of Directors declared two quarterly cash dividends of $0.10 per share in fiscal 2004. The first quarterly cash dividend of $0.10 per share, in the amount of $45,939, was paid May 31, 2004 to shareholders of record at the close of business on May 10, 2004. The second quarterly cash dividend of $0.10 per share, in the amount of $46,198, was paid August 27, 2004, to shareholders of record at the close of business on July 23, 2004. Contractual Obligations The Companys commitment to make future payments under contractual obligations was as follows, as of August 29, 2004. Payments Due by Period Contractual obligations Total Less than 1 year 1 to 3years 4 to 5 years After 5 years Long term debt(1) $ 1,656,393 (2) $ 339,441 $ 336,632 $ 62,081 $ 918,239 (2) Capital lease obligations 5,449 1,451 1,117 1,115 1,766 Operating leases(3) 1,574,778 110,616 212,734 190,401 1,061,027 Purchase obligations (merchandise)(4) 3,509,786 3,153,157 356,629 Purchase obligations (building, equipment, services and other)(5) 232,212 213,823 16,556 1,833 Other(6) 6,235 476 594 418 4,747 Total $ 6,984,853 $ 3,818,964 $ 924,262 $ 255,848 $ 1,985,779 (1) Amounts include contractual interest payments.

(6) Primarily consists of asset retirement obligations. 19 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Expansion Plans Costcos primary requirement for capital is the financing of the land, building and equipment costs for new warehouses plus the costs of initial warehouse operations and working capital requirements, as well as additional capital for international expansion. While there can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized, and plans are subject to change upon further review, it is managements current intention to spend approximately $900,000 to $1,000,000 during fiscal 2005 in the United States and Canada for real estate, construction, remodeling and equipment for warehouse clubs and related operations; and approximately $100,000 to $150,000 for international expansion, including the United Kingdom, Asia, Mexico and other potential ventures. These expenditures are expected to be financed with a combination of cash provided from operations and the use of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. Expansion plans for the United States and Canada during fiscal 2005 are to open approximately 30 new warehouse clubs inclusive of seven relocations to larger and better located warehouses. The Company expects to continue its review of expansion plans in its international operations, including the United Kingdom and Asia, along with other international markets. At present, the Company is planning to open two additional warehouses in the U.K and one additional warehouse in both the Taiwan and Japan markets during fiscal 2005. Costco and its Mexico based joint venture partner, Controladora Comercial Mexicana, each own a 50% interest in Costco Mexico. Costco Mexico plans to open two to three new warehouse clubs during fiscal 2005. Additional Equity Investments in Subsidiary On October 3, 2003, the Company acquired from Carrefour Nederland B.V. its 20% equity interest in Costco Wholesale UK Limited for cash of $95,153, bringing Costcos ownership in Costco Wholesale UK Limited to 100%. Bank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs (all amounts stated in thousands of US dollars) The Company has a $500,000 commercial paper program supported by a $300,000 bank credit facility with a group of ten banks, of which $150,000 expired on November 9, 2004 and $150,000 expires on November 15, 2005. At August 29, 2004, no amounts were outstanding under the commercial paper program and no amounts were outstanding under the credit facility. The Company presently does not plan to renew the $150,000 portion of the credit facility that expired on November 9, 2004. A wholly owned Canadian subsidiary has a $152,000 commercial paper program supported by a $46,000 bank credit facility with a Canadian bank, that is guaranteed by the Company and expires in March 2005. At August 29, 2004, no amounts were outstanding under the Canadian commercial paper program or the bank credit facility. The Company has agreed to limit the combined amount outstanding under the U.S. and Canadian commercial paper programs to the combined amounts of the supporting bank credit facilities, which are $346,000 at August 29, 2004, decreased to $196,000 on November 9, 2004. The Companys wholly owned Japanese subsidiary has a short term $27,400 bank line of credit that originally expired in November 2004. Subsequent to the Companys fiscal year end, the bank line of credit was extended through February 10, 2005. At August 29, 2004, no amounts were outstanding under the line of credit. The Companys Korean subsidiary has a short term $10,400 bank line of credit, which expires in January 2005. At August 29, 2004, no amounts were outstanding under the line of credit. The Companys wholly owned UK subsidiary has a $108,000 bank revolving credit facility expiring in February 2007 and a $63,000 bank overdraft facility renewable on a yearly basis in March. At August 29, 2004, $21,595 was outstanding under the revolving credit facility with an applicable interest rate of 5.285% and no amounts were outstanding under the bank overdraft facility. 20 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Letters of Credit The Company has letter of credit facilities (for commercial and standby letters of credit), totaling approximately $338,000. The outstanding commitments under these facilities at August 29, 2004 totaled approximately $166,800, including approximately $52,900 in standby letters of credit. Financing Activities The Companys 7 1/8% Senior Notes of $304,350 at August 29, 2004 are due on June 15, 2005. The Company plans to repay the 7 1/8% Senior Notes from its cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances, which totaled $3,129,882 at August 29, 2004. In April 2003, the Companys wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.92% in the aggregate amount of approximately $36,576, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due on April 26, 2010. In November 2002, the Companys wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.88% in the aggregate amount of approximately $27,432, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due on November 7, 2009. The Company guarantees all of the promissory notes issued by its wholly owned Japanese subsidiary. In March 2002, the Company issued $300,000 of 5 1/2% Senior Notes due March 15, 2007. Interest is payable semi annually. Simultaneous with the issuance of the Senior Notes, the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements converting the interest from fixed to floating. In February 1996, the Company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a shelf registration statement for $500,000 of senior debt securities. On October 23, 2001, additional debt securities of $100,000 were registered. The $300,000 of 5 1/2% Senior Notes issued in March 2002 reduced the amount of registered securities available for future issuance to $300,000. Derivatives The Company has limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and uses them only to manage well defined interest rate and foreign exchange risks. Forward foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on inventory purchases and typically have very short terms. The aggregate amount of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at August 29, 2004 was not material. The only significant derivative instruments the Company holds are interest rate swaps, which the Company uses to manage the interest rate risk associated with its borrowings and to manage the Companys mix of fixed rate and variable rate debt. As of August 29, 2004, the Company had fixed to floating interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $600,000 and an aggregate fair value of $25,754, which is recorded in other assets on the Companys consolidated balance sheet. These swaps were entered into effective November 13, 2001, and March 25, 2002, and are designated and qualify as fair value hedges of the Companys $300,000 7 1/8% Senior Notes and the Companys $300,000 5 1/2% Senior Notes, respectively. As the terms of the swaps match those of the underlying hedged debt, the changes in the fair value of these swaps are offset by corresponding changes in the carrying amount of the hedged debt and result in no net earnings impact. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company has no off balance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on the Companys financial condition or consolidated financial statements. Stock Repurchase Program On November 30, 2001, the Companys Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program, authorizing the repurchase of up to $500,000 of Costco Common Stock through November 30, 2004. Under the program, 21 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) the Company could repurchase shares at any time in the open market or in private transactions as market conditions warrant. The repurchased shares would constitute authorized, but non issued shares and would be used for general corporate purposes, including stock option grants under stock option programs. On October 25, 2004, the Board of Directors renewed the program for another three years. To date, no shares have been repurchased under either program. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the Companys financial statements requires that management make estimates and judgments that affect the financial position and results of operations. Management continues to review its accounting policies and evaluate its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, merchandise inventory, impairment of long lived assets and warehouse closing costs and insurance/self insurance liabilities. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the present circumstances. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes sales, net of estimated returns, at the time customers take possession of merchandise or receive services. When the Company collects payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services, the amount received is recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed. The Company provides for estimated sales returns based on historical returns levels. Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market as determined primarily by the retail method of accounting and are stated using the last in, first out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail method of accounting, and are stated using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. The Company believes the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. The Company records an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the expected annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end. The Company considers in its calculation of the LIFO cost the estimated net realizable value of inventory in those inventory pools where deflation exists and records a write down of inventory where estimated net realizable value is less than LIFO inventory. The Company provides for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts on the basis of a percentage of sales. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect the trend of the actual physical inventory count results, which generally occur in the second and fourth fiscal quarters. Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as the Company progresses towards earning those rebates provided they are probable and reasonably estimable. Other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of agreement, or other systematic and rational approach. Impairment of long lived assets and warehouse closing costs The Company periodically evaluates its long lived assets for indicators of impairment. Managements judgments are based on market and operational conditions at the present time. Future events could cause management to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring an adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value. The Company provides estimates for warehouse closing costs when it is appropriate to do so based on the applicable accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Future circumstances may result in the Companys actual future closing costs or the amount recognized upon the sale of the property to differ substantially from the original estimates. 22 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Insurance/Self Insurance Liabilities The Company uses a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms to provide for the potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property insurance, director and officers liability, vehicle liability and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by the Company are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience and outside expertise, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In March 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Boards (FASB) Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) reached a consensus on EITF Issue No. 03 1, The Meaning of Other Than Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments, (EITF 03 1). The guidance prescribes a three step model for determining whether an investment is other than temporarily impaired and requires disclosures about unrealized losses on investments. The accounting guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after June 15, 2004, while the disclosure requirements are effective for annual reporting periods ending after June 15, 2004. In September 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position EITF 03 1 1, Effective Date of Paragraphs 10 20 of EITF Issue No. 03 1 The Meaning of Other Than Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments, (FSP EITF 03 01 1). FSP EITF 03 1 1 delays the effective date for the measurement and recognition guidance contained in paragraphs 10 20 of EITF Issue 03 01. During the period of the delay, FSP EITF 03 1 1 states that companies should continue to apply relevant other than temporary guidance. The adoption of EITF 03 1, excluding paragraphs 10 20, did not impact the Companys consolidated financial statements. The Company will assess the impact of paragraphs 10 20 of EITF 03 1 once the guidance has been finalized. In December 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46 (revised December 2003), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46R), which addresses how a business enterprise should evaluate whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity through means other than voting rights and accordingly should consolidate the entity. In general, a variable interest entity is a corporation, partnership, trust, or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either does not have equity investors with voting rights or has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities. FIN 46R requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entitys activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entitys residual returns or both. FIN 46R replaces FASB Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, which was issued in January 2003 and revised the implementation date to the first fiscal period ending after March 15, 2004, with the exception of special purpose entities. The adoption of this interpretation did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. In November 2003, the EITF reached consensus on Issue No. 03 10, Application of Issue No. 02 16 by Resellers to Sales Incentives Offered to Consumers by Manufacturers, with respect to determining if consideration received by a reseller from a vendor that is reimbursed by the vendor for honoring the vendors sale incentives offered directly to consumers should be recorded as a reduction in sales. These rules apply to transactions entered into by consumers in fiscal periods beginning after November 25, 2003 and, therefore, apply to such transactions starting with the Companys fiscal third quarter of 2004, which began February 16, 2004. The adoption of EITF 03 10 did not affect the Companys consolidated gross profit or net income, but did result in a reduction of both net sales and merchandise costs by an equal amount. For fiscal 2004, net sales and merchandise costs have been reduced by $334,065. Had the Companys comparable periods in fiscal 2003 and 2002 been reported under EITF 03 10 guidance, the sales and cost of sales would have been reduced by $282,288 and $248,155, respectively. 23 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) In November 2002, the EITF reached consensus on certain issues discussed in Issue No. 02 16, Accounting by a Customer (Including a Reseller) for Certain Consideration Received from a Vendor, with respect to determining how a reseller should characterize consideration received from a vendor and when to recognize and how to measure that consideration in its income statement. Requirements for recognizing volume based rebates are effective for arrangements entered into or modified after November 21, 2002 and resellers with other supplier payments should generally apply the new rules prospectively for agreements entered into or modified after December 31, 2002. The adoption of this consensus by the Company in fiscal 2003 did not have a significant impact on the Company on an annual basis, but resulted in a change in the timing for the recognition of some vendor allowances for certain agreements entered into subsequent to December 31, 2002 and extends the recognition time frame beyond that which was in effect for similar contracts entered into prior to December 31, 2002. Net income for fiscal 2004 was negatively impacted by approximately $2,808 (after tax) due to the adoption of EITF 02 16. Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company is exposed to financial market risk resulting from changes in interest and foreign currency rates. As a policy, the Company does not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions, nor hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. The nature and amount of the Companys long and short term debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As of August 29, 2004, the Companys fixed rate long term debt includes its $851,648 principal amount at maturity Zero Coupon Subordinated Notes and additional notes and capital lease obligations totaling $130,561. The Companys debt also includes $300,000 7 1/8% Senior Notes and $300,000 5 1/2% Senior Notes. The Company has entered into fixed to floating interest rate swaps on the Senior Notes, effectively converting these fixed interest rate securities to variable rate securities. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt and may affect the interest expense related to the variable rate debt. The Company holds interest bearing instruments that are classified as cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. Short term investments generally have a maturity of three months to five years from the purchase date. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. As the majority of these instruments are of a short term nature, if interest rates were to increase or decrease immediately, there is no material risk of a valuation adjustment related to these instruments. For those instruments that are classified as available for sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in interest rates are reflected in other accumulated comprehensive income or loss. Based on the Companys cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances at August 29, 2004, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $27,000 to interest income (pre tax) on an annual basis. Most foreign currency transactions have been conducted in local currencies, limiting the Companys exposure to changes in currency rates. The Company periodically enters into short term forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates on inventory purchases. The fair value of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at August 29, 2004 was not material to the Companys results of operations or its financial position. 24 Table of Contents 
 
Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) least a year, and approximately 45% of the increase was due to opening a net of 23 new warehouses (29 opened, 6 closed) during fiscal 2003 and a net of 29 new warehouses (35 opened, 6 closed) during fiscal 2002, a portion of which is not included in comparable warehouse sales. With the exception of price increases in gasoline, which accounted for a comparable sales increase of approximately 70 basis points, changes in prices of merchandise did not materially contribute to sales increases. In addition, due to the weaker U.S. dollar in fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002, translation of foreign sales into U.S. dollars contributed to the increase in sales, accounting for a comparable sales increase of approximately one percent year over year. Comparable sales increased at a five percent annual rate in fiscal 2003 compared to a six percent annual rate during fiscal 2002. Membership fees Membership fees increased 10.8% to $852,853, or 2.05% of net sales, in fiscal 2003 from $769,406, or 2.03% of net sales, in fiscal 2002. This increase was primarily due to additional membership sign ups at the 23 net new warehouses opened in fiscal 2003, and increased penetration of the Companys Executive Membership. Overall, member renewal rates remained consistent with the prior year, currently at 86%. Gross Margin Gross margin (defined as net sales minus merchandise costs) increased 11.2% to $4,457,316, or 10.69% of net sales, in fiscal 2003 from $4,009,972, or 10.55% of net sales, in fiscal 2002. The increase in gross margin as a percentage of net sales reflects merchandise gross margin improvement within the Companys ancillary warehouse businesses and international operations accounting for increases of 15 and eight basis points, respectively. Additionally, increased rewards related to the Executive Membership Two Percent Reward Program reduced gross margin by seven basis points. The gross margin figures reflect accounting for most U.S. merchandise inventories on the last in, first out (LIFO) method. The effect of the LIFO adjustment for fiscal 2003 was to increase gross margin by $19,650, compared to a gross margin increase of $13,500 in fiscal 2002. If all inventories had been valued using the first in, first out (FIFO) method, inventories would have been lower by $19,500 at August 31, 2003 and higher by $150 at September 1, 2002. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales increased to 9.83% during fiscal 2003 from 9.41% during fiscal 2002. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales was primarily due to increases in employee healthcare, workers compensation (primarily in the state of California) and salary costs within the Companys domestic operations. International expenses also increased, accounting for approximately seven basis points of the 42 basis points year over year increase. Preopening Expenses Preopening expenses totaled $36,643, or 0.09% of net sales, during fiscal 2003, compared to $51,257, or 0.13% of net sales, during fiscal 2002. During fiscal 2003, the Company opened 29 new warehouses (including five relocations) compared to 35 new warehouses (including six relocations) during fiscal 2002. Pre opening expenses also include costs related to remodels and expanded ancillary operations at existing warehouses. Provision for Impaired Assets and Closing Costs, net The net provision for impaired assets and closing costs was $19,500 in fiscal 2003 compared to $21,050 in fiscal 2002. The provision includes costs related to impairment of long lived assets, future lease obligations of warehouses that have been relocated to new facilities and any losses or gains resulting from the sale of real property. The provision for fiscal 2003 included charges of $11,836 for warehouse closing expenses, $4,697 for impairment of long lived assets and $2,967 for net losses on the sale of real property. The fiscal 2002 provision included charges of $13,683 for warehouse closing expenses and $7,765 for Canadian administrative reorganization, which were offset by $398 of net gains on the sale of real property. At August 31, 2003 the reserve for 17 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) warehouse closing costs was $8,609, of which $7,833 related to future lease obligations. This compares to a reserve for warehouse closing costs of $11,845 at September 1, 2002, of which $10,395 related to future lease obligations. Interest Expense Interest expense totaled $36,920 in fiscal 2003, compared to $29,096 in fiscal 2002. Interest expense in fiscal 2003 includes interest on the 3 1/2% Zero Coupon Notes, 7 1/8% and 5 1/2% Senior Notes and on balances outstanding under the Companys bank credit facilities and promissory notes. The increase is primarily related to the reduction in interest capitalized related to warehouse construction, as the overall cost of projects under construction was lower than in fiscal 2002. The increase was also attributed to the Companys issuance of $300,000 5 1/2% Senior Notes in March 2002, which were simultaneously swapped to a floating interest rate. This increase was partially offset by an interest rate reduction in the Companys $300,000 7 1/8% Senior Notes, resulting from interest rate swap agreements entered into effective November 13, 2001, converting the interest rate from fixed to floating, and to the fact that the Company had little interest expense related to borrowings under its commercial paper program in fiscal 2003. Interest Income and Other Interest income and other totaled $38,525 in fiscal 2003, compared to $35,745 in fiscal 2002. The increase primarily reflects greater interest earned on higher cash and cash equivalents balances on hand throughout fiscal 2003, as compared to fiscal 2002, which was partially offset by an increase in the expense to record the minority interest in earnings of foreign subsidiaries. Provision for Income Taxes The effective income tax rate on earnings was 37.75% in fiscal 2003 and 38.50% in fiscal 2002. The decrease in the effective income tax rate, year over year, is primarily attributable to lower statutory income tax rates for foreign operations. Liquidity and Capital Resources (dollars in thousands, except per share amounts) Cash Flows Cash flow generated from warehouse operations provides a significant source of liquidity. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $2,098,783 in fiscal 2004 compared to $1,507,208 in fiscal 2003. The increase of $591,575 is primarily a result of an increase in the change in receivables, other current assets, deferred income and accrued and other current liabilities of $507,860, due primarily to the collection of an operating tax receivable and increases in the workers compensation accrual, income taxes payable, executive membership two percent reward accrual and deferred membership income in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003. In addition, the increase in net income of $161,393 contributed to the increase in cash provided by operating activities. The primary investing activity continues to be the purchase of property and equipment and the construction of facilities related to the Companys warehouse expansion and remodel projects. Net cash used in investing activities totaled $1,048,481 in fiscal 2004 compared to $790,588 in fiscal 2003, an increase of $257,893. The increase in investing activities primarily relates to net purchases of short term investments of $303,945 and the purchase of the remaining 20% minority interest in Costco Wholesale UK Limited of $95,153, which was partially offset by a reduction in the acquisition of property and equipment and the construction of facilities for new and remodeled warehouses of $105,045 (from $810,665 to $705,620) between fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2004, as new warehouse openings decreased year over year from 29 (including five relocated warehouses) in fiscal 2003 to 20 in fiscal 2004. 18 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Net cash provided by financing activities totaled $209,569 in fiscal 2004 compared to net cash used of $1,428 in fiscal 2003. The increase of $210,997 primarily resulted from an increase in bank checks outstanding of $243,890 and the increase in proceeds received from the exercise of stock options of $90,077, which were offset by the payment of cash dividends in fiscal 2004 of $92,137 and from the reduction in the issuance of long term debt of $59,424 in fiscal 2003 to no additional issuances of long term debt in the current fiscal year. Dividends Costcos Board of Directors declared two quarterly cash dividends of $0.10 per share in fiscal 2004. The first quarterly cash dividend of $0.10 per share, in the amount of $45,939, was paid May 31, 2004 to shareholders of record at the close of business on May 10, 2004. The second quarterly cash dividend of $0.10 per share, in the amount of $46,198, was paid August 27, 2004, to shareholders of record at the close of business on July 23, 2004. Contractual Obligations The Companys commitment to make future payments under contractual obligations was as follows, as of August 29, 2004. Payments Due by Period Contractual obligations Total Less than 1 year 1 to 3years 4 to 5 years After 5 years Long term debt(1) $ 1,656,393 (2) $ 339,441 $ 336,632 $ 62,081 $ 918,239 (2) Capital lease obligations 5,449 1,451 1,117 1,115 1,766 Operating leases(3) 1,574,778 110,616 212,734 190,401 1,061,027 Purchase obligations (merchandise)(4) 3,509,786 3,153,157 356,629 Purchase obligations (building, equipment, services and other)(5) 232,212 213,823 16,556 1,833 Other(6) 6,235 476 594 418 4,747 Total $ 6,984,853 $ 3,818,964 $ 924,262 $ 255,848 $ 1,985,779 (1) Amounts include contractual interest payments. (2) The amount includes interest accreted to maturity for the Companys Zero Coupon 3 1/2% Convertible Subordinated Notes due August 2017, totaling $851,648.

(4) Includes open merchandise purchase orders at fiscal year end, including those supported by letters of credit. (5) The amounts presented above as purchase obligations include an analysis of all known contracts with the exception of minor outsourced services negotiated at the individual warehouse level that are not significant and generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty. (6) Primarily consists of asset retirement obligations. 19 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Expansion Plans Costcos primary requirement for capital is the financing of the land, building and equipment costs for new warehouses plus the costs of initial warehouse operations and working capital requirements, as well as additional capital for international expansion. While there can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized, and plans are subject to change upon further review, it is managements current intention to spend approximately $900,000 to $1,000,000 during fiscal 2005 in the United States and Canada for real estate, construction, remodeling and equipment for warehouse clubs and related operations; and approximately $100,000 to $150,000 for international expansion, including the United Kingdom, Asia, Mexico and other potential ventures. These expenditures are expected to be financed with a combination of cash provided from operations and the use of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. Expansion plans for the United States and Canada during fiscal 2005 are to open approximately 30 new warehouse clubs inclusive of seven relocations to larger and better located warehouses. The Company expects to continue its review of expansion plans in its international operations, including the United Kingdom and Asia, along with other international markets. At present, the Company is planning to open two additional warehouses in the U.K and one additional warehouse in both the Taiwan and Japan markets during fiscal 2005. Costco and its Mexico based joint venture partner, Controladora Comercial Mexicana, each own a 50% interest in Costco Mexico. Costco Mexico plans to open two to three new warehouse clubs during fiscal 2005. Additional Equity Investments in Subsidiary On October 3, 2003, the Company acquired from Carrefour Nederland B.V. its 20% equity interest in Costco Wholesale UK Limited for cash of $95,153, bringing Costcos ownership in Costco Wholesale UK Limited to 100%. Bank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs (all amounts stated in thousands of US dollars) The Company has a $500,000 commercial paper program supported by a $300,000 bank credit facility with a group of ten banks, of which $150,000 expired on November 9, 2004 and $150,000 expires on November 15, 2005. At August 29, 2004, no amounts were outstanding under the commercial paper program and no amounts were outstanding under the credit facility. The Company presently does not plan to renew the $150,000 portion of the credit facility that expired on November 9, 2004. A wholly owned Canadian subsidiary has a $152,000 commercial paper program supported by a $46,000 bank credit facility with a Canadian bank, that is guaranteed by the Company and expires in March 2005. At August 29, 2004, no amounts were outstanding under the Canadian commercial paper program or the bank credit facility. The Company has agreed to limit the combined amount outstanding under the U.S. and Canadian commercial paper programs to the combined amounts of the supporting bank credit facilities, which are $346,000 at August 29, 2004, decreased to $196,000 on November 9, 2004. The Companys wholly owned Japanese subsidiary has a short term $27,400 bank line of credit that originally expired in November 2004. Subsequent to the Companys fiscal year end, the bank line of credit was extended through February 10, 2005. At August 29, 2004, no amounts were outstanding under the line of credit. The Companys Korean subsidiary has a short term $10,400 bank line of credit, which expires in January 2005. At August 29, 2004, no amounts were outstanding under the line of credit. The Companys wholly owned UK subsidiary has a $108,000 bank revolving credit facility expiring in February 2007 and a $63,000 bank overdraft facility renewable on a yearly basis in March. At August 29, 2004, $21,595 was outstanding under the revolving credit facility with an applicable interest rate of 5.285% and no amounts were outstanding under the bank overdraft facility. 20 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Letters of Credit The Company has letter of credit facilities (for commercial and standby letters of credit), totaling approximately $338,000. The outstanding commitments under these facilities at August 29, 2004 totaled approximately $166,800, including approximately $52,900 in standby letters of credit. Financing Activities The Companys 7 1/8% Senior Notes of $304,350 at August 29, 2004 are due on June 15, 2005. The Company plans to repay the 7 1/8% Senior Notes from its cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances, which totaled $3,129,882 at August 29, 2004. In April 2003, the Companys wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.92% in the aggregate amount of approximately $36,576, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due on April 26, 2010. In November 2002, the Companys wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.88% in the aggregate amount of approximately $27,432, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due on November 7, 2009. The Company guarantees all of the promissory notes issued by its wholly owned Japanese subsidiary. In March 2002, the Company issued $300,000 of 5 1/2% Senior Notes due March 15, 2007. Interest is payable semi annually. Simultaneous with the issuance of the Senior Notes, the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements converting the interest from fixed to floating. In February 1996, the Company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a shelf registration statement for $500,000 of senior debt securities. On October 23, 2001, additional debt securities of $100,000 were registered. The $300,000 of 5 1/2% Senior Notes issued in March 2002 reduced the amount of registered securities available for future issuance to $300,000. Derivatives The Company has limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and uses them only to manage well defined interest rate and foreign exchange risks. Forward foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on inventory purchases and typically have very short terms. The aggregate amount of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at August 29, 2004 was not material. The only significant derivative instruments the Company holds are interest rate swaps, which the Company uses to manage the interest rate risk associated with its borrowings and to manage the Companys mix of fixed rate and variable rate debt. As of August 29, 2004, the Company had fixed to floating interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $600,000 and an aggregate fair value of $25,754, which is recorded in other assets on the Companys consolidated balance sheet. These swaps were entered into effective November 13, 2001, and March 25, 2002, and are designated and qualify as fair value hedges of the Companys $300,000 7 1/8% Senior Notes and the Companys $300,000 5 1/2% Senior Notes, respectively. As the terms of the swaps match those of the underlying hedged debt, the changes in the fair value of these swaps are offset by corresponding changes in the carrying amount of the hedged debt and result in no net earnings impact. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company has no off balance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on the Companys financial condition or consolidated financial statements. Stock Repurchase Program On November 30, 2001, the Companys Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program, authorizing the repurchase of up to $500,000 of Costco Common Stock through November 30, 2004. Under the program, 21 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) the Company could repurchase shares at any time in the open market or in private transactions as market conditions warrant. The repurchased shares would constitute authorized, but non issued shares and would be used for general corporate purposes, including stock option grants under stock option programs. On October 25, 2004, the Board of Directors renewed the program for another three years. To date, no shares have been repurchased under either program. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the Companys financial statements requires that management make estimates and judgments that affect the financial position and results of operations. Management continues to review its accounting policies and evaluate its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, merchandise inventory, impairment of long lived assets and warehouse closing costs and insurance/self insurance liabilities. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the present circumstances. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes sales, net of estimated returns, at the time customers take possession of merchandise or receive services. When the Company collects payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services, the amount received is recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed. The Company provides for estimated sales returns based on historical returns levels. Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market as determined primarily by the retail method of accounting and are stated using the last in, first out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail method of accounting, and are stated using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. The Company believes the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. The Company records an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the expected annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end. The Company considers in its calculation of the LIFO cost the estimated net realizable value of inventory in those inventory pools where deflation exists and records a write down of inventory where estimated net realizable value is less than LIFO inventory. The Company provides for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts on the basis of a percentage of sales. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect the trend of the actual physical inventory count results, which generally occur in the second and fourth fiscal quarters. Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as the Company progresses towards earning those rebates provided they are probable and reasonably estimable. Other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of agreement, or other systematic and rational approach. Impairment of long lived assets and warehouse closing costs The Company periodically evaluates its long lived assets for indicators of impairment. Managements judgments are based on market and operational conditions at the present time. Future events could cause management to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring an adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value. The Company provides estimates for warehouse closing costs when it is appropriate to do so based on the applicable accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Future circumstances may result in the Companys actual future closing costs or the amount recognized upon the sale of the property to differ substantially from the original estimates. 22 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Insurance/Self Insurance Liabilities The Company uses a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms to provide for the potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property insurance, director and officers liability, vehicle liability and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by the Company are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience and outside expertise, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In March 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Boards (FASB) Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) reached a consensus on EITF Issue No. 03 1, The Meaning of Other Than Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments, (EITF 03 1). The guidance prescribes a three step model for determining whether an investment is other than temporarily impaired and requires disclosures about unrealized losses on investments. The accounting guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after June 15, 2004, while the disclosure requirements are effective for annual reporting periods ending after June 15, 2004. In September 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position EITF 03 1 1, Effective Date of Paragraphs 10 20 of EITF Issue No. 03 1 The Meaning of Other Than Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments, (FSP EITF 03 01 1). FSP EITF 03 1 1 delays the effective date for the measurement and recognition guidance contained in paragraphs 10 20 of EITF Issue 03 01. During the period of the delay, FSP EITF 03 1 1 states that companies should continue to apply relevant other than temporary guidance. The adoption of EITF 03 1, excluding paragraphs 10 20, did not impact the Companys consolidated financial statements. The Company will assess the impact of paragraphs 10 20 of EITF 03 1 once the guidance has been finalized. In December 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46 (revised December 2003), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46R), which addresses how a business enterprise should evaluate whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity through means other than voting rights and accordingly should consolidate the entity. In general, a variable interest entity is a corporation, partnership, trust, or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either does not have equity investors with voting rights or has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities. FIN 46R requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entitys activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entitys residual returns or both. FIN 46R replaces FASB Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, which was issued in January 2003 and revised the implementation date to the first fiscal period ending after March 15, 2004, with the exception of special purpose entities. The adoption of this interpretation did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. In November 2003, the EITF reached consensus on Issue No. 03 10, Application of Issue No. 02 16 by Resellers to Sales Incentives Offered to Consumers by Manufacturers, with respect to determining if consideration received by a reseller from a vendor that is reimbursed by the vendor for honoring the vendors sale incentives offered directly to consumers should be recorded as a reduction in sales. These rules apply to transactions entered into by consumers in fiscal periods beginning after November 25, 2003 and, therefore, apply to such transactions starting with the Companys fiscal third quarter of 2004, which began February 16, 2004. The adoption of EITF 03 10 did not affect the Companys consolidated gross profit or net income, but did result in a reduction of both net sales and merchandise costs by an equal amount. For fiscal 2004, net sales and merchandise costs have been reduced by $334,065. Had the Companys comparable periods in fiscal 2003 and 2002 been reported under EITF 03 10 guidance, the sales and cost of sales would have been reduced by $282,288 and $248,155, respectively. 23 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) In November 2002, the EITF reached consensus on certain issues discussed in Issue No. 02 16, Accounting by a Customer (Including a Reseller) for Certain Consideration Received from a Vendor, with respect to determining how a reseller should characterize consideration received from a vendor and when to recognize and how to measure that consideration in its income statement. Requirements for recognizing volume based rebates are effective for arrangements entered into or modified after November 21, 2002 and resellers with other supplier payments should generally apply the new rules prospectively for agreements entered into or modified after December 31, 2002. The adoption of this consensus by the Company in fiscal 2003 did not have a significant impact on the Company on an annual basis, but resulted in a change in the timing for the recognition of some vendor allowances for certain agreements entered into subsequent to December 31, 2002 and extends the recognition time frame beyond that which was in effect for similar contracts entered into prior to December 31, 2002. Net income for fiscal 2004 was negatively impacted by approximately $2,808 (after tax) due to the adoption of EITF 02 16. Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company is exposed to financial market risk resulting from changes in interest and foreign currency rates. As a policy, the Company does not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions, nor hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. The nature and amount of the Companys long and short term debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As of August 29, 2004, the Companys fixed rate long term debt includes its $851,648 principal amount at maturity Zero Coupon Subordinated Notes and additional notes and capital lease obligations totaling $130,561. The Companys debt also includes $300,000 7 1/8% Senior Notes and $300,000 5 1/2% Senior Notes. The Company has entered into fixed to floating interest rate swaps on the Senior Notes, effectively converting these fixed interest rate securities to variable rate securities. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt and may affect the interest expense related to the variable rate debt. The Company holds interest bearing instruments that are classified as cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. Short term investments generally have a maturity of three months to five years from the purchase date. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. As the majority of these instruments are of a short term nature, if interest rates were to increase or decrease immediately, there is no material risk of a valuation adjustment related to these instruments. For those instruments that are classified as available for sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in interest rates are reflected in other accumulated comprehensive income or loss. Based on the Companys cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances at August 29, 2004, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $27,000 to interest income (pre tax) on an annual basis. Most foreign currency transactions have been conducted in local currencies, limiting the Companys exposure to changes in currency rates. The Company periodically enters into short term forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates on inventory purchases. The fair value of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at August 29, 2004 was not material to the Companys results of operations or its financial position. 24 Table of Contents 
 
Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) warehouse closing costs was $8,609, of which $7,833 related to future lease obligations. This compares to a reserve for warehouse closing costs of $11,845 at September 1, 2002, of which $10,395 related to future lease obligations. Interest Expense Interest expense totaled $36,920 in fiscal 2003, compared to $29,096 in fiscal 2002. Interest expense in fiscal 2003 includes interest on the 3 1/2% Zero Coupon Notes, 7 1/8% and 5 1/2% Senior Notes and on balances outstanding under the Companys bank credit facilities and promissory notes. The increase is primarily related to the reduction in interest capitalized related to warehouse construction, as the overall cost of projects under construction was lower than in fiscal 2002. The increase was also attributed to the Companys issuance of $300,000 5 1/2% Senior Notes in March 2002, which were simultaneously swapped to a floating interest rate. This increase was partially offset by an interest rate reduction in the Companys $300,000 7 1/8% Senior Notes, resulting from interest rate swap agreements entered into effective November 13, 2001, converting the interest rate from fixed to floating, and to the fact that the Company had little interest expense related to borrowings under its commercial paper program in fiscal 2003. Interest Income and Other Interest income and other totaled $38,525 in fiscal 2003, compared to $35,745 in fiscal 2002. The increase primarily reflects greater interest earned on higher cash and cash equivalents balances on hand throughout fiscal 2003, as compared to fiscal 2002, which was partially offset by an increase in the expense to record the minority interest in earnings of foreign subsidiaries. Provision for Income Taxes The effective income tax rate on earnings was 37.75% in fiscal 2003 and 38.50% in fiscal 2002. The decrease in the effective income tax rate, year over year, is primarily attributable to lower statutory income tax rates for foreign operations. Liquidity and Capital Resources (dollars in thousands, except per share amounts) Cash Flows Cash flow generated from warehouse operations provides a significant source of liquidity. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $2,098,783 in fiscal 2004 compared to $1,507,208 in fiscal 2003. The increase of $591,575 is primarily a result of an increase in the change in receivables, other current assets, deferred income and accrued and other current liabilities of $507,860, due primarily to the collection of an operating tax receivable and increases in the workers compensation accrual, income taxes payable, executive membership two percent reward accrual and deferred membership income in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003. In addition, the increase in net income of $161,393 contributed to the increase in cash provided by operating activities. The primary investing activity continues to be the purchase of property and equipment and the construction of facilities related to the Companys warehouse expansion and remodel projects. Net cash used in investing activities totaled $1,048,481 in fiscal 2004 compared to $790,588 in fiscal 2003, an increase of $257,893. The increase in investing activities primarily relates to net purchases of short term investments of $303,945 and the purchase of the remaining 20% minority interest in Costco Wholesale UK Limited of $95,153, which was partially offset by a reduction in the acquisition of property and equipment and the construction of facilities for new and remodeled warehouses of $105,045 (from $810,665 to $705,620) between fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2004, as new warehouse openings decreased year over year from 29 (including five relocated warehouses) in fiscal 2003 to 20 in fiscal 2004. 18 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Net cash provided by financing activities totaled $209,569 in fiscal 2004 compared to net cash used of $1,428 in fiscal 2003. The increase of $210,997 primarily resulted from an increase in bank checks outstanding of $243,890 and the increase in proceeds received from the exercise of stock options of $90,077, which were offset by the payment of cash dividends in fiscal 2004 of $92,137 and from the reduction in the issuance of long term debt of $59,424 in fiscal 2003 to no additional issuances of long term debt in the current fiscal year. Dividends Costcos Board of Directors declared two quarterly cash dividends of $0.10 per share in fiscal 2004. The first quarterly cash dividend of $0.10 per share, in the amount of $45,939, was paid May 31, 2004 to shareholders of record at the close of business on May 10, 2004. The second quarterly cash dividend of $0.10 per share, in the amount of $46,198, was paid August 27, 2004, to shareholders of record at the close of business on July 23, 2004. Contractual Obligations The Companys commitment to make future payments under contractual obligations was as follows, as of August 29, 2004. Payments Due by Period Contractual obligations Total Less than 1 year 1 to 3years 4 to 5 years After 5 years Long term debt(1) $ 1,656,393 (2) $ 339,441 $ 336,632 $ 62,081 $ 918,239 (2) Capital lease obligations 5,449 1,451 1,117 1,115 1,766 Operating leases(3) 1,574,778 110,616 212,734 190,401 1,061,027 Purchase obligations (merchandise)(4) 3,509,786 3,153,157 356,629 Purchase obligations (building, equipment, services and other)(5) 232,212 213,823 16,556 1,833 Other(6) 6,235 476 594 418 4,747 Total $ 6,984,853 $ 3,818,964 $ 924,262 $ 255,848 $ 1,985,779 (1) Amounts include contractual interest payments.

(4) Includes open merchandise purchase orders at fiscal year end, including those supported by letters of credit. (5) The amounts presented above as purchase obligations include an analysis of all known contracts with the exception of minor outsourced services negotiated at the individual warehouse level that are not significant and generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty. (6) Primarily consists of asset retirement obligations. 19 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Expansion Plans Costcos primary requirement for capital is the financing of the land, building and equipment costs for new warehouses plus the costs of initial warehouse operations and working capital requirements, as well as additional capital for international expansion. While there can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized, and plans are subject to change upon further review, it is managements current intention to spend approximately $900,000 to $1,000,000 during fiscal 2005 in the United States and Canada for real estate, construction, remodeling and equipment for warehouse clubs and related operations; and approximately $100,000 to $150,000 for international expansion, including the United Kingdom, Asia, Mexico and other potential ventures. These expenditures are expected to be financed with a combination of cash provided from operations and the use of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. Expansion plans for the United States and Canada during fiscal 2005 are to open approximately 30 new warehouse clubs inclusive of seven relocations to larger and better located warehouses. The Company expects to continue its review of expansion plans in its international operations, including the United Kingdom and Asia, along with other international markets. At present, the Company is planning to open two additional warehouses in the U.K and one additional warehouse in both the Taiwan and Japan markets during fiscal 2005. Costco and its Mexico based joint venture partner, Controladora Comercial Mexicana, each own a 50% interest in Costco Mexico. Costco Mexico plans to open two to three new warehouse clubs during fiscal 2005. Additional Equity Investments in Subsidiary On October 3, 2003, the Company acquired from Carrefour Nederland B.V. its 20% equity interest in Costco Wholesale UK Limited for cash of $95,153, bringing Costcos ownership in Costco Wholesale UK Limited to 100%. Bank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs (all amounts stated in thousands of US dollars) The Company has a $500,000 commercial paper program supported by a $300,000 bank credit facility with a group of ten banks, of which $150,000 expired on November 9, 2004 and $150,000 expires on November 15, 2005. At August 29, 2004, no amounts were outstanding under the commercial paper program and no amounts were outstanding under the credit facility. The Company presently does not plan to renew the $150,000 portion of the credit facility that expired on November 9, 2004. A wholly owned Canadian subsidiary has a $152,000 commercial paper program supported by a $46,000 bank credit facility with a Canadian bank, that is guaranteed by the Company and expires in March 2005. At August 29, 2004, no amounts were outstanding under the Canadian commercial paper program or the bank credit facility. The Company has agreed to limit the combined amount outstanding under the U.S. and Canadian commercial paper programs to the combined amounts of the supporting bank credit facilities, which are $346,000 at August 29, 2004, decreased to $196,000 on November 9, 2004. The Companys wholly owned Japanese subsidiary has a short term $27,400 bank line of credit that originally expired in November 2004. Subsequent to the Companys fiscal year end, the bank line of credit was extended through February 10, 2005. At August 29, 2004, no amounts were outstanding under the line of credit. The Companys Korean subsidiary has a short term $10,400 bank line of credit, which expires in January 2005. At August 29, 2004, no amounts were outstanding under the line of credit. The Companys wholly owned UK subsidiary has a $108,000 bank revolving credit facility expiring in February 2007 and a $63,000 bank overdraft facility renewable on a yearly basis in March. At August 29, 2004, $21,595 was outstanding under the revolving credit facility with an applicable interest rate of 5.285% and no amounts were outstanding under the bank overdraft facility. 20 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Letters of Credit The Company has letter of credit facilities (for commercial and standby letters of credit), totaling approximately $338,000. The outstanding commitments under these facilities at August 29, 2004 totaled approximately $166,800, including approximately $52,900 in standby letters of credit. Financing Activities The Companys 7 1/8% Senior Notes of $304,350 at August 29, 2004 are due on June 15, 2005. The Company plans to repay the 7 1/8% Senior Notes from its cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances, which totaled $3,129,882 at August 29, 2004. In April 2003, the Companys wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.92% in the aggregate amount of approximately $36,576, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due on April 26, 2010. In November 2002, the Companys wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.88% in the aggregate amount of approximately $27,432, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due on November 7, 2009. The Company guarantees all of the promissory notes issued by its wholly owned Japanese subsidiary. In March 2002, the Company issued $300,000 of 5 1/2% Senior Notes due March 15, 2007. Interest is payable semi annually. Simultaneous with the issuance of the Senior Notes, the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements converting the interest from fixed to floating. In February 1996, the Company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a shelf registration statement for $500,000 of senior debt securities. On October 23, 2001, additional debt securities of $100,000 were registered. The $300,000 of 5 1/2% Senior Notes issued in March 2002 reduced the amount of registered securities available for future issuance to $300,000. Derivatives The Company has limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and uses them only to manage well defined interest rate and foreign exchange risks. Forward foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on inventory purchases and typically have very short terms. The aggregate amount of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at August 29, 2004 was not material. The only significant derivative instruments the Company holds are interest rate swaps, which the Company uses to manage the interest rate risk associated with its borrowings and to manage the Companys mix of fixed rate and variable rate debt. As of August 29, 2004, the Company had fixed to floating interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $600,000 and an aggregate fair value of $25,754, which is recorded in other assets on the Companys consolidated balance sheet. These swaps were entered into effective November 13, 2001, and March 25, 2002, and are designated and qualify as fair value hedges of the Companys $300,000 7 1/8% Senior Notes and the Companys $300,000 5 1/2% Senior Notes, respectively. As the terms of the swaps match those of the underlying hedged debt, the changes in the fair value of these swaps are offset by corresponding changes in the carrying amount of the hedged debt and result in no net earnings impact. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company has no off balance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on the Companys financial condition or consolidated financial statements. Stock Repurchase Program On November 30, 2001, the Companys Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program, authorizing the repurchase of up to $500,000 of Costco Common Stock through November 30, 2004. Under the program, 21 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) the Company could repurchase shares at any time in the open market or in private transactions as market conditions warrant. The repurchased shares would constitute authorized, but non issued shares and would be used for general corporate purposes, including stock option grants under stock option programs. On October 25, 2004, the Board of Directors renewed the program for another three years. To date, no shares have been repurchased under either program. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the Companys financial statements requires that management make estimates and judgments that affect the financial position and results of operations. Management continues to review its accounting policies and evaluate its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, merchandise inventory, impairment of long lived assets and warehouse closing costs and insurance/self insurance liabilities. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the present circumstances. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes sales, net of estimated returns, at the time customers take possession of merchandise or receive services. When the Company collects payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services, the amount received is recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed. The Company provides for estimated sales returns based on historical returns levels. Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market as determined primarily by the retail method of accounting and are stated using the last in, first out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail method of accounting, and are stated using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. The Company believes the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. The Company records an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the expected annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end. The Company considers in its calculation of the LIFO cost the estimated net realizable value of inventory in those inventory pools where deflation exists and records a write down of inventory where estimated net realizable value is less than LIFO inventory. The Company provides for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts on the basis of a percentage of sales. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect the trend of the actual physical inventory count results, which generally occur in the second and fourth fiscal quarters. Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as the Company progresses towards earning those rebates provided they are probable and reasonably estimable. Other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of agreement, or other systematic and rational approach. Impairment of long lived assets and warehouse closing costs The Company periodically evaluates its long lived assets for indicators of impairment. Managements judgments are based on market and operational conditions at the present time. Future events could cause management to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring an adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value. The Company provides estimates for warehouse closing costs when it is appropriate to do so based on the applicable accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Future circumstances may result in the Companys actual future closing costs or the amount recognized upon the sale of the property to differ substantially from the original estimates. 22 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Insurance/Self Insurance Liabilities The Company uses a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms to provide for the potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property insurance, director and officers liability, vehicle liability and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by the Company are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience and outside expertise, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In March 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Boards (FASB) Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) reached a consensus on EITF Issue No. 03 1, The Meaning of Other Than Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments, (EITF 03 1). The guidance prescribes a three step model for determining whether an investment is other than temporarily impaired and requires disclosures about unrealized losses on investments. The accounting guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after June 15, 2004, while the disclosure requirements are effective for annual reporting periods ending after June 15, 2004. In September 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position EITF 03 1 1, Effective Date of Paragraphs 10 20 of EITF Issue No. 03 1 The Meaning of Other Than Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments, (FSP EITF 03 01 1). FSP EITF 03 1 1 delays the effective date for the measurement and recognition guidance contained in paragraphs 10 20 of EITF Issue 03 01. During the period of the delay, FSP EITF 03 1 1 states that companies should continue to apply relevant other than temporary guidance. The adoption of EITF 03 1, excluding paragraphs 10 20, did not impact the Companys consolidated financial statements. The Company will assess the impact of paragraphs 10 20 of EITF 03 1 once the guidance has been finalized. In December 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46 (revised December 2003), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46R), which addresses how a business enterprise should evaluate whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity through means other than voting rights and accordingly should consolidate the entity. In general, a variable interest entity is a corporation, partnership, trust, or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either does not have equity investors with voting rights or has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities. FIN 46R requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entitys activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entitys residual returns or both. FIN 46R replaces FASB Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, which was issued in January 2003 and revised the implementation date to the first fiscal period ending after March 15, 2004, with the exception of special purpose entities. The adoption of this interpretation did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. In November 2003, the EITF reached consensus on Issue No. 03 10, Application of Issue No. 02 16 by Resellers to Sales Incentives Offered to Consumers by Manufacturers, with respect to determining if consideration received by a reseller from a vendor that is reimbursed by the vendor for honoring the vendors sale incentives offered directly to consumers should be recorded as a reduction in sales. These rules apply to transactions entered into by consumers in fiscal periods beginning after November 25, 2003 and, therefore, apply to such transactions starting with the Companys fiscal third quarter of 2004, which began February 16, 2004. The adoption of EITF 03 10 did not affect the Companys consolidated gross profit or net income, but did result in a reduction of both net sales and merchandise costs by an equal amount. For fiscal 2004, net sales and merchandise costs have been reduced by $334,065. Had the Companys comparable periods in fiscal 2003 and 2002 been reported under EITF 03 10 guidance, the sales and cost of sales would have been reduced by $282,288 and $248,155, respectively. 23 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) In November 2002, the EITF reached consensus on certain issues discussed in Issue No. 02 16, Accounting by a Customer (Including a Reseller) for Certain Consideration Received from a Vendor, with respect to determining how a reseller should characterize consideration received from a vendor and when to recognize and how to measure that consideration in its income statement. Requirements for recognizing volume based rebates are effective for arrangements entered into or modified after November 21, 2002 and resellers with other supplier payments should generally apply the new rules prospectively for agreements entered into or modified after December 31, 2002. The adoption of this consensus by the Company in fiscal 2003 did not have a significant impact on the Company on an annual basis, but resulted in a change in the timing for the recognition of some vendor allowances for certain agreements entered into subsequent to December 31, 2002 and extends the recognition time frame beyond that which was in effect for similar contracts entered into prior to December 31, 2002. Net income for fiscal 2004 was negatively impacted by approximately $2,808 (after tax) due to the adoption of EITF 02 16. Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company is exposed to financial market risk resulting from changes in interest and foreign currency rates. As a policy, the Company does not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions, nor hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. The nature and amount of the Companys long and short term debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As of August 29, 2004, the Companys fixed rate long term debt includes its $851,648 principal amount at maturity Zero Coupon Subordinated Notes and additional notes and capital lease obligations totaling $130,561. The Companys debt also includes $300,000 7 1/8% Senior Notes and $300,000 5 1/2% Senior Notes. The Company has entered into fixed to floating interest rate swaps on the Senior Notes, effectively converting these fixed interest rate securities to variable rate securities. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt and may affect the interest expense related to the variable rate debt. The Company holds interest bearing instruments that are classified as cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. Short term investments generally have a maturity of three months to five years from the purchase date. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. As the majority of these instruments are of a short term nature, if interest rates were to increase or decrease immediately, there is no material risk of a valuation adjustment related to these instruments. For those instruments that are classified as available for sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in interest rates are reflected in other accumulated comprehensive income or loss. Based on the Companys cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances at August 29, 2004, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $27,000 to interest income (pre tax) on an annual basis. Most foreign currency transactions have been conducted in local currencies, limiting the Companys exposure to changes in currency rates. The Company periodically enters into short term forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates on inventory purchases. The fair value of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at August 29, 2004 was not material to the Companys results of operations or its financial position. 24 Table of Contents 
 
Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Net cash provided by financing activities totaled $209,569 in fiscal 2004 compared to net cash used of $1,428 in fiscal 2003. The increase of $210,997 primarily resulted from an increase in bank checks outstanding of $243,890 and the increase in proceeds received from the exercise of stock options of $90,077, which were offset by the payment of cash dividends in fiscal 2004 of $92,137 and from the reduction in the issuance of long term debt of $59,424 in fiscal 2003 to no additional issuances of long term debt in the current fiscal year. Dividends Costcos Board of Directors declared two quarterly cash dividends of $0.10 per share in fiscal 2004. The first quarterly cash dividend of $0.10 per share, in the amount of $45,939, was paid May 31, 2004 to shareholders of record at the close of business on May 10, 2004. The second quarterly cash dividend of $0.10 per share, in the amount of $46,198, was paid August 27, 2004, to shareholders of record at the close of business on July 23, 2004.

(6) Primarily consists of asset retirement obligations. 19 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Expansion Plans Costcos primary requirement for capital is the financing of the land, building and equipment costs for new warehouses plus the costs of initial warehouse operations and working capital requirements, as well as additional capital for international expansion. While there can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized, and plans are subject to change upon further review, it is managements current intention to spend approximately $900,000 to $1,000,000 during fiscal 2005 in the United States and Canada for real estate, construction, remodeling and equipment for warehouse clubs and related operations; and approximately $100,000 to $150,000 for international expansion, including the United Kingdom, Asia, Mexico and other potential ventures. These expenditures are expected to be financed with a combination of cash provided from operations and the use of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. Expansion plans for the United States and Canada during fiscal 2005 are to open approximately 30 new warehouse clubs inclusive of seven relocations to larger and better located warehouses. The Company expects to continue its review of expansion plans in its international operations, including the United Kingdom and Asia, along with other international markets. At present, the Company is planning to open two additional warehouses in the U.K and one additional warehouse in both the Taiwan and Japan markets during fiscal 2005. Costco and its Mexico based joint venture partner, Controladora Comercial Mexicana, each own a 50% interest in Costco Mexico. Costco Mexico plans to open two to three new warehouse clubs during fiscal 2005. Additional Equity Investments in Subsidiary On October 3, 2003, the Company acquired from Carrefour Nederland B.V. its 20% equity interest in Costco Wholesale UK Limited for cash of $95,153, bringing Costcos ownership in Costco Wholesale UK Limited to 100%. Bank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs (all amounts stated in thousands of US dollars) The Company has a $500,000 commercial paper program supported by a $300,000 bank credit facility with a group of ten banks, of which $150,000 expired on November 9, 2004 and $150,000 expires on November 15, 2005. At August 29, 2004, no amounts were outstanding under the commercial paper program and no amounts were outstanding under the credit facility. The Company presently does not plan to renew the $150,000 portion of the credit facility that expired on November 9, 2004. A wholly owned Canadian subsidiary has a $152,000 commercial paper program supported by a $46,000 bank credit facility with a Canadian bank, that is guaranteed by the Company and expires in March 2005. At August 29, 2004, no amounts were outstanding under the Canadian commercial paper program or the bank credit facility. The Company has agreed to limit the combined amount outstanding under the U.S. and Canadian commercial paper programs to the combined amounts of the supporting bank credit facilities, which are $346,000 at August 29, 2004, decreased to $196,000 on November 9, 2004. The Companys wholly owned Japanese subsidiary has a short term $27,400 bank line of credit that originally expired in November 2004. Subsequent to the Companys fiscal year end, the bank line of credit was extended through February 10, 2005. At August 29, 2004, no amounts were outstanding under the line of credit. The Companys Korean subsidiary has a short term $10,400 bank line of credit, which expires in January 2005. At August 29, 2004, no amounts were outstanding under the line of credit. The Companys wholly owned UK subsidiary has a $108,000 bank revolving credit facility expiring in February 2007 and a $63,000 bank overdraft facility renewable on a yearly basis in March. At August 29, 2004, $21,595 was outstanding under the revolving credit facility with an applicable interest rate of 5.285% and no amounts were outstanding under the bank overdraft facility. 20 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Letters of Credit The Company has letter of credit facilities (for commercial and standby letters of credit), totaling approximately $338,000. The outstanding commitments under these facilities at August 29, 2004 totaled approximately $166,800, including approximately $52,900 in standby letters of credit. Financing Activities The Companys 7 1/8% Senior Notes of $304,350 at August 29, 2004 are due on June 15, 2005. The Company plans to repay the 7 1/8% Senior Notes from its cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances, which totaled $3,129,882 at August 29, 2004.

Stock Repurchase Program On November 30, 2001, the Companys Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program, authorizing the repurchase of up to $500,000 of Costco Common Stock through November 30, 2004. Under the program, 21 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) the Company could repurchase shares at any time in the open market or in private transactions as market conditions warrant. The repurchased shares would constitute authorized, but non issued shares and would be used for general corporate purposes, including stock option grants under stock option programs. On October 25, 2004, the Board of Directors renewed the program for another three years. To date, no shares have been repurchased under either program. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the Companys financial statements requires that management make estimates and judgments that affect the financial position and results of operations. Management continues to review its accounting policies and evaluate its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, merchandise inventory, impairment of long lived assets and warehouse closing costs and insurance/self insurance liabilities. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the present circumstances.

Managements judgments are based on market and operational conditions at the present time. Future events could cause management to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring an adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value. The Company provides estimates for warehouse closing costs when it is appropriate to do so based on the applicable accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Future circumstances may result in the Companys actual future closing costs or the amount recognized upon the sale of the property to differ substantially from the original estimates. 22 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Insurance/Self Insurance Liabilities The Company uses a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms to provide for the potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property insurance, director and officers liability, vehicle liability and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by the Company are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience and outside expertise, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In March 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Boards (FASB) Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) reached a consensus on EITF Issue No. 03 1, The Meaning of Other Than Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments, (EITF 03 1). The guidance prescribes a three step model for determining whether an investment is other than temporarily impaired and requires disclosures about unrealized losses on investments. The accounting guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after June 15, 2004, while the disclosure requirements are effective for annual reporting periods ending after June 15, 2004. In September 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position EITF 03 1 1, Effective Date of Paragraphs 10 20 of EITF Issue No. 03 1 The Meaning of Other Than Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments, (FSP EITF 03 01 1). FSP EITF 03 1 1 delays the effective date for the measurement and recognition guidance contained in paragraphs 10 20 of EITF Issue 03 01. During the period of the delay, FSP EITF 03 1 1 states that companies should continue to apply relevant other than temporary guidance. The adoption of EITF 03 1, excluding paragraphs 10 20, did not impact the Companys consolidated financial statements. The Company will assess the impact of paragraphs 10 20 of EITF 03 1 once the guidance has been finalized. In December 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46 (revised December 2003), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46R), which addresses how a business enterprise should evaluate whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity through means other than voting rights and accordingly should consolidate the entity. In general, a variable interest entity is a corporation, partnership, trust, or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either does not have equity investors with voting rights or has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities. FIN 46R requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entitys activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entitys residual returns or both. FIN 46R replaces FASB Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, which was issued in January 2003 and revised the implementation date to the first fiscal period ending after March 15, 2004, with the exception of special purpose entities. The adoption of this interpretation did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. In November 2003, the EITF reached consensus on Issue No. 03 10, Application of Issue No. 02 16 by Resellers to Sales Incentives Offered to Consumers by Manufacturers, with respect to determining if consideration received by a reseller from a vendor that is reimbursed by the vendor for honoring the vendors sale incentives offered directly to consumers should be recorded as a reduction in sales. These rules apply to transactions entered into by consumers in fiscal periods beginning after November 25, 2003 and, therefore, apply to such transactions starting with the Companys fiscal third quarter of 2004, which began February 16, 2004. The adoption of EITF 03 10 did not affect the Companys consolidated gross profit or net income, but did result in a reduction of both net sales and merchandise costs by an equal amount. For fiscal 2004, net sales and merchandise costs have been reduced by $334,065. Had the Companys comparable periods in fiscal 2003 and 2002 been reported under EITF 03 10 guidance, the sales and cost of sales would have been reduced by $282,288 and $248,155, respectively. 23 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) In November 2002, the EITF reached consensus on certain issues discussed in Issue No. 02 16, Accounting by a Customer (Including a Reseller) for Certain Consideration Received from a Vendor, with respect to determining how a reseller should characterize consideration received from a vendor and when to recognize and how to measure that consideration in its income statement. Requirements for recognizing volume based rebates are effective for arrangements entered into or modified after November 21, 2002 and resellers with other supplier payments should generally apply the new rules prospectively for agreements entered into or modified after December 31, 2002. The adoption of this consensus by the Company in fiscal 2003 did not have a significant impact on the Company on an annual basis, but resulted in a change in the timing for the recognition of some vendor allowances for certain agreements entered into subsequent to December 31, 2002 and extends the recognition time frame beyond that which was in effect for similar contracts entered into prior to December 31, 2002. Net income for fiscal 2004 was negatively impacted by approximately $2,808 (after tax) due to the adoption of EITF 02 16. Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company is exposed to financial market risk resulting from changes in interest and foreign currency rates. As a policy, the Company does not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions, nor hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. The nature and amount of the Companys long and short term debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As of August 29, 2004, the Companys fixed rate long term debt includes its $851,648 principal amount at maturity Zero Coupon Subordinated Notes and additional notes and capital lease obligations totaling $130,561. The Companys debt also includes $300,000 7 1/8% Senior Notes and $300,000 5 1/2% Senior Notes. The Company has entered into fixed to floating interest rate swaps on the Senior Notes, effectively converting these fixed interest rate securities to variable rate securities. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt and may affect the interest expense related to the variable rate debt. The Company holds interest bearing instruments that are classified as cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. Short term investments generally have a maturity of three months to five years from the purchase date. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. As the majority of these instruments are of a short term nature, if interest rates were to increase or decrease immediately, there is no material risk of a valuation adjustment related to these instruments. For those instruments that are classified as available for sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in interest rates are reflected in other accumulated comprehensive income or loss. Based on the Companys cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances at August 29, 2004, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $27,000 to interest income (pre tax) on an annual basis. Most foreign currency transactions have been conducted in local currencies, limiting the Companys exposure to changes in currency rates. The Company periodically enters into short term forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates on inventory purchases. The fair value of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at August 29, 2004 was not material to the Companys results of operations or its financial position. 24 Table of Contents 
 
Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Expansion Plans Costcos primary requirement for capital is the financing of the land, building and equipment costs for new warehouses plus the costs of initial warehouse operations and working capital requirements, as well as additional capital for international expansion. While there can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized, and plans are subject to change upon further review, it is managements current intention to spend approximately $900,000 to $1,000,000 during fiscal 2005 in the United States and Canada for real estate, construction, remodeling and equipment for warehouse clubs and related operations; and approximately $100,000 to $150,000 for international expansion, including the United Kingdom, Asia, Mexico and other potential ventures. These expenditures are expected to be financed with a combination of cash provided from operations and the use of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. Expansion plans for the United States and Canada during fiscal 2005 are to open approximately 30 new warehouse clubs inclusive of seven relocations to larger and better located warehouses. The Company expects to continue its review of expansion plans in its international operations, including the United Kingdom and Asia, along with other international markets. At present, the Company is planning to open two additional warehouses in the U.K and one additional warehouse in both the Taiwan and Japan markets during fiscal 2005. Costco and its Mexico based joint venture partner, Controladora Comercial Mexicana, each own a 50% interest in Costco Mexico. Costco Mexico plans to open two to three new warehouse clubs during fiscal 2005. Additional Equity Investments in Subsidiary On October 3, 2003, the Company acquired from Carrefour Nederland B.V. its 20% equity interest in Costco Wholesale UK Limited for cash of $95,153, bringing Costcos ownership in Costco Wholesale UK Limited to 100%. Bank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs (all amounts stated in thousands of US dollars) The Company has a $500,000 commercial paper program supported by a $300,000 bank credit facility with a group of ten banks, of which $150,000 expired on November 9, 2004 and $150,000 expires on November 15, 2005. At August 29, 2004, no amounts were outstanding under the commercial paper program and no amounts were outstanding under the credit facility. The Company presently does not plan to renew the $150,000 portion of the credit facility that expired on November 9, 2004. A wholly owned Canadian subsidiary has a $152,000 commercial paper program supported by a $46,000 bank credit facility with a Canadian bank, that is guaranteed by the Company and expires in March 2005. At August 29, 2004, no amounts were outstanding under the Canadian commercial paper program or the bank credit facility. The Company has agreed to limit the combined amount outstanding under the U.S. and Canadian commercial paper programs to the combined amounts of the supporting bank credit facilities, which are $346,000 at August 29, 2004, decreased to $196,000 on November 9, 2004. The Companys wholly owned Japanese subsidiary has a short term $27,400 bank line of credit that originally expired in November 2004. Subsequent to the Companys fiscal year end, the bank line of credit was extended through February 10, 2005. At August 29, 2004, no amounts were outstanding under the line of credit. The Companys Korean subsidiary has a short term $10,400 bank line of credit, which expires in January 2005. At August 29, 2004, no amounts were outstanding under the line of credit. The Companys wholly owned UK subsidiary has a $108,000 bank revolving credit facility expiring in February 2007 and a $63,000 bank overdraft facility renewable on a yearly basis in March. At August 29, 2004, $21,595 was outstanding under the revolving credit facility with an applicable interest rate of 5.285% and no amounts were outstanding under the bank overdraft facility. 20 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Letters of Credit The Company has letter of credit facilities (for commercial and standby letters of credit), totaling approximately $338,000. The outstanding commitments under these facilities at August 29, 2004 totaled approximately $166,800, including approximately $52,900 in standby letters of credit. Financing Activities The Companys 7 1/8% Senior Notes of $304,350 at August 29, 2004 are due on June 15, 2005. The Company plans to repay the 7 1/8% Senior Notes from its cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances, which totaled $3,129,882 at August 29, 2004. In April 2003, the Companys wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.92% in the aggregate amount of approximately $36,576, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due on April 26, 2010. In November 2002, the Companys wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.88% in the aggregate amount of approximately $27,432, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due on November 7, 2009. The Company guarantees all of the promissory notes issued by its wholly owned Japanese subsidiary. In March 2002, the Company issued $300,000 of 5 1/2% Senior Notes due March 15, 2007. Interest is payable semi annually. Simultaneous with the issuance of the Senior Notes, the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements converting the interest from fixed to floating. In February 1996, the Company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a shelf registration statement for $500,000 of senior debt securities. On October 23, 2001, additional debt securities of $100,000 were registered. The $300,000 of 5 1/2% Senior Notes issued in March 2002 reduced the amount of registered securities available for future issuance to $300,000. Derivatives The Company has limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and uses them only to manage well defined interest rate and foreign exchange risks. Forward foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on inventory purchases and typically have very short terms. The aggregate amount of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at August 29, 2004 was not material. The only significant derivative instruments the Company holds are interest rate swaps, which the Company uses to manage the interest rate risk associated with its borrowings and to manage the Companys mix of fixed rate and variable rate debt. As of August 29, 2004, the Company had fixed to floating interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $600,000 and an aggregate fair value of $25,754, which is recorded in other assets on the Companys consolidated balance sheet. These swaps were entered into effective November 13, 2001, and March 25, 2002, and are designated and qualify as fair value hedges of the Companys $300,000 7 1/8% Senior Notes and the Companys $300,000 5 1/2% Senior Notes, respectively. As the terms of the swaps match those of the underlying hedged debt, the changes in the fair value of these swaps are offset by corresponding changes in the carrying amount of the hedged debt and result in no net earnings impact. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company has no off balance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on the Companys financial condition or consolidated financial statements. Stock Repurchase Program On November 30, 2001, the Companys Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program, authorizing the repurchase of up to $500,000 of Costco Common Stock through November 30, 2004. Under the program, 21 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) the Company could repurchase shares at any time in the open market or in private transactions as market conditions warrant. The repurchased shares would constitute authorized, but non issued shares and would be used for general corporate purposes, including stock option grants under stock option programs. On October 25, 2004, the Board of Directors renewed the program for another three years. To date, no shares have been repurchased under either program. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the Companys financial statements requires that management make estimates and judgments that affect the financial position and results of operations. Management continues to review its accounting policies and evaluate its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, merchandise inventory, impairment of long lived assets and warehouse closing costs and insurance/self insurance liabilities. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the present circumstances. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes sales, net of estimated returns, at the time customers take possession of merchandise or receive services. When the Company collects payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services, the amount received is recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed. The Company provides for estimated sales returns based on historical returns levels. Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market as determined primarily by the retail method of accounting and are stated using the last in, first out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail method of accounting, and are stated using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. The Company believes the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. The Company records an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the expected annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end. The Company considers in its calculation of the LIFO cost the estimated net realizable value of inventory in those inventory pools where deflation exists and records a write down of inventory where estimated net realizable value is less than LIFO inventory. The Company provides for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts on the basis of a percentage of sales. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect the trend of the actual physical inventory count results, which generally occur in the second and fourth fiscal quarters. Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as the Company progresses towards earning those rebates provided they are probable and reasonably estimable. Other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of agreement, or other systematic and rational approach. Impairment of long lived assets and warehouse closing costs The Company periodically evaluates its long lived assets for indicators of impairment. Managements judgments are based on market and operational conditions at the present time. Future events could cause management to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring an adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value. The Company provides estimates for warehouse closing costs when it is appropriate to do so based on the applicable accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Future circumstances may result in the Companys actual future closing costs or the amount recognized upon the sale of the property to differ substantially from the original estimates. 22 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Insurance/Self Insurance Liabilities The Company uses a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms to provide for the potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property insurance, director and officers liability, vehicle liability and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by the Company are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience and outside expertise, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In March 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Boards (FASB) Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) reached a consensus on EITF Issue No. 03 1, The Meaning of Other Than Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments, (EITF 03 1). The guidance prescribes a three step model for determining whether an investment is other than temporarily impaired and requires disclosures about unrealized losses on investments. The accounting guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after June 15, 2004, while the disclosure requirements are effective for annual reporting periods ending after June 15, 2004. In September 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position EITF 03 1 1, Effective Date of Paragraphs 10 20 of EITF Issue No. 03 1 The Meaning of Other Than Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments, (FSP EITF 03 01 1). FSP EITF 03 1 1 delays the effective date for the measurement and recognition guidance contained in paragraphs 10 20 of EITF Issue 03 01. During the period of the delay, FSP EITF 03 1 1 states that companies should continue to apply relevant other than temporary guidance. The adoption of EITF 03 1, excluding paragraphs 10 20, did not impact the Companys consolidated financial statements. The Company will assess the impact of paragraphs 10 20 of EITF 03 1 once the guidance has been finalized. In December 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46 (revised December 2003), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46R), which addresses how a business enterprise should evaluate whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity through means other than voting rights and accordingly should consolidate the entity. In general, a variable interest entity is a corporation, partnership, trust, or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either does not have equity investors with voting rights or has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities. FIN 46R requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entitys activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entitys residual returns or both. FIN 46R replaces FASB Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, which was issued in January 2003 and revised the implementation date to the first fiscal period ending after March 15, 2004, with the exception of special purpose entities. The adoption of this interpretation did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. In November 2003, the EITF reached consensus on Issue No. 03 10, Application of Issue No. 02 16 by Resellers to Sales Incentives Offered to Consumers by Manufacturers, with respect to determining if consideration received by a reseller from a vendor that is reimbursed by the vendor for honoring the vendors sale incentives offered directly to consumers should be recorded as a reduction in sales. These rules apply to transactions entered into by consumers in fiscal periods beginning after November 25, 2003 and, therefore, apply to such transactions starting with the Companys fiscal third quarter of 2004, which began February 16, 2004. The adoption of EITF 03 10 did not affect the Companys consolidated gross profit or net income, but did result in a reduction of both net sales and merchandise costs by an equal amount. For fiscal 2004, net sales and merchandise costs have been reduced by $334,065. Had the Companys comparable periods in fiscal 2003 and 2002 been reported under EITF 03 10 guidance, the sales and cost of sales would have been reduced by $282,288 and $248,155, respectively. 23 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) In November 2002, the EITF reached consensus on certain issues discussed in Issue No. 02 16, Accounting by a Customer (Including a Reseller) for Certain Consideration Received from a Vendor, with respect to determining how a reseller should characterize consideration received from a vendor and when to recognize and how to measure that consideration in its income statement. Requirements for recognizing volume based rebates are effective for arrangements entered into or modified after November 21, 2002 and resellers with other supplier payments should generally apply the new rules prospectively for agreements entered into or modified after December 31, 2002. The adoption of this consensus by the Company in fiscal 2003 did not have a significant impact on the Company on an annual basis, but resulted in a change in the timing for the recognition of some vendor allowances for certain agreements entered into subsequent to December 31, 2002 and extends the recognition time frame beyond that which was in effect for similar contracts entered into prior to December 31, 2002. Net income for fiscal 2004 was negatively impacted by approximately $2,808 (after tax) due to the adoption of EITF 02 16. Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company is exposed to financial market risk resulting from changes in interest and foreign currency rates. As a policy, the Company does not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions, nor hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. The nature and amount of the Companys long and short term debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As of August 29, 2004, the Companys fixed rate long term debt includes its $851,648 principal amount at maturity Zero Coupon Subordinated Notes and additional notes and capital lease obligations totaling $130,561. The Companys debt also includes $300,000 7 1/8% Senior Notes and $300,000 5 1/2% Senior Notes. The Company has entered into fixed to floating interest rate swaps on the Senior Notes, effectively converting these fixed interest rate securities to variable rate securities. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt and may affect the interest expense related to the variable rate debt. The Company holds interest bearing instruments that are classified as cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. Short term investments generally have a maturity of three months to five years from the purchase date. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. As the majority of these instruments are of a short term nature, if interest rates were to increase or decrease immediately, there is no material risk of a valuation adjustment related to these instruments. For those instruments that are classified as available for sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in interest rates are reflected in other accumulated comprehensive income or loss. Based on the Companys cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances at August 29, 2004, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $27,000 to interest income (pre tax) on an annual basis. Most foreign currency transactions have been conducted in local currencies, limiting the Companys exposure to changes in currency rates. The Company periodically enters into short term forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates on inventory purchases.

Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as the Company progresses towards earning those rebates provided they are probable and reasonably estimable. Other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of agreement, or other systematic and rational approach. Impairment of long lived assets and warehouse closing costs The Company periodically evaluates its long lived assets for indicators of impairment. Managements judgments are based on market and operational conditions at the present time. Future events could cause management to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring an adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value. The Company provides estimates for warehouse closing costs when it is appropriate to do so based on the applicable accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Future circumstances may result in the Companys actual future closing costs or the amount recognized upon the sale of the property to differ substantially from the original estimates. 22 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Insurance/Self Insurance Liabilities The Company uses a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms to provide for the potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property insurance, director and officers liability, vehicle liability and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by the Company are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience and outside expertise, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In March 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Boards (FASB) Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) reached a consensus on EITF Issue No. 03 1, The Meaning of Other Than Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments, (EITF 03 1). The guidance prescribes a three step model for determining whether an investment is other than temporarily impaired and requires disclosures about unrealized losses on investments. The accounting guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after June 15, 2004, while the disclosure requirements are effective for annual reporting periods ending after June 15, 2004. In September 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position EITF 03 1 1, Effective Date of Paragraphs 10 20 of EITF Issue No. 03 1 The Meaning of Other Than Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments, (FSP EITF 03 01 1). FSP EITF 03 1 1 delays the effective date for the measurement and recognition guidance contained in paragraphs 10 20 of EITF Issue 03 01. During the period of the delay, FSP EITF 03 1 1 states that companies should continue to apply relevant other than temporary guidance. The adoption of EITF 03 1, excluding paragraphs 10 20, did not impact the Companys consolidated financial statements. The Company will assess the impact of paragraphs 10 20 of EITF 03 1 once the guidance has been finalized. In December 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46 (revised December 2003), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46R), which addresses how a business enterprise should evaluate whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity through means other than voting rights and accordingly should consolidate the entity. In general, a variable interest entity is a corporation, partnership, trust, or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either does not have equity investors with voting rights or has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities. FIN 46R requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entitys activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entitys residual returns or both. FIN 46R replaces FASB Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, which was issued in January 2003 and revised the implementation date to the first fiscal period ending after March 15, 2004, with the exception of special purpose entities. The adoption of this interpretation did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. In November 2003, the EITF reached consensus on Issue No. 03 10, Application of Issue No. 02 16 by Resellers to Sales Incentives Offered to Consumers by Manufacturers, with respect to determining if consideration received by a reseller from a vendor that is reimbursed by the vendor for honoring the vendors sale incentives offered directly to consumers should be recorded as a reduction in sales. These rules apply to transactions entered into by consumers in fiscal periods beginning after November 25, 2003 and, therefore, apply to such transactions starting with the Companys fiscal third quarter of 2004, which began February 16, 2004. The adoption of EITF 03 10 did not affect the Companys consolidated gross profit or net income, but did result in a reduction of both net sales and merchandise costs by an equal amount. For fiscal 2004, net sales and merchandise costs have been reduced by $334,065. Had the Companys comparable periods in fiscal 2003 and 2002 been reported under EITF 03 10 guidance, the sales and cost of sales would have been reduced by $282,288 and $248,155, respectively. 23 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) In November 2002, the EITF reached consensus on certain issues discussed in Issue No. 02 16, Accounting by a Customer (Including a Reseller) for Certain Consideration Received from a Vendor, with respect to determining how a reseller should characterize consideration received from a vendor and when to recognize and how to measure that consideration in its income statement. Requirements for recognizing volume based rebates are effective for arrangements entered into or modified after November 21, 2002 and resellers with other supplier payments should generally apply the new rules prospectively for agreements entered into or modified after December 31, 2002. The adoption of this consensus by the Company in fiscal 2003 did not have a significant impact on the Company on an annual basis, but resulted in a change in the timing for the recognition of some vendor allowances for certain agreements entered into subsequent to December 31, 2002 and extends the recognition time frame beyond that which was in effect for similar contracts entered into prior to December 31, 2002. Net income for fiscal 2004 was negatively impacted by approximately $2,808 (after tax) due to the adoption of EITF 02 16. Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company is exposed to financial market risk resulting from changes in interest and foreign currency rates. As a policy, the Company does not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions, nor hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. The nature and amount of the Companys long and short term debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As of August 29, 2004, the Companys fixed rate long term debt includes its $851,648 principal amount at maturity Zero Coupon Subordinated Notes and additional notes and capital lease obligations totaling $130,561. The Companys debt also includes $300,000 7 1/8% Senior Notes and $300,000 5 1/2% Senior Notes. The Company has entered into fixed to floating interest rate swaps on the Senior Notes, effectively converting these fixed interest rate securities to variable rate securities. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt and may affect the interest expense related to the variable rate debt. The Company holds interest bearing instruments that are classified as cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. Short term investments generally have a maturity of three months to five years from the purchase date. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. As the majority of these instruments are of a short term nature, if interest rates were to increase or decrease immediately, there is no material risk of a valuation adjustment related to these instruments. For those instruments that are classified as available for sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in interest rates are reflected in other accumulated comprehensive income or loss. Based on the Companys cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances at August 29, 2004, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $27,000 to interest income (pre tax) on an annual basis. Most foreign currency transactions have been conducted in local currencies, limiting the Companys exposure to changes in currency rates. The Company periodically enters into short term forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates on inventory purchases. The fair value of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at August 29, 2004 was not material to the Companys results of operations or its financial position. 24 Table of Contents 
 
Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) the Company could repurchase shares at any time in the open market or in private transactions as market conditions warrant. The repurchased shares would constitute authorized, but non issued shares and would be used for general corporate purposes, including stock option grants under stock option programs. On October 25, 2004, the Board of Directors renewed the program for another three years. To date, no shares have been repurchased under either program. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the Companys financial statements requires that management make estimates and judgments that affect the financial position and results of operations. Management continues to review its accounting policies and evaluate its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, merchandise inventory, impairment of long lived assets and warehouse closing costs and insurance/self insurance liabilities. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the present circumstances. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes sales, net of estimated returns, at the time customers take possession of merchandise or receive services. When the Company collects payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services, the amount received is recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed. The Company provides for estimated sales returns based on historical returns levels. Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market as determined primarily by the retail method of accounting and are stated using the last in, first out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail method of accounting, and are stated using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. The Company believes the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. The Company records an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the expected annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end. The Company considers in its calculation of the LIFO cost the estimated net realizable value of inventory in those inventory pools where deflation exists and records a write down of inventory where estimated net realizable value is less than LIFO inventory. The Company provides for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts on the basis of a percentage of sales. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect the trend of the actual physical inventory count results, which generally occur in the second and fourth fiscal quarters. Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as the Company progresses towards earning those rebates provided they are probable and reasonably estimable. Other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of agreement, or other systematic and rational approach. Impairment of long lived assets and warehouse closing costs The Company periodically evaluates its long lived assets for indicators of impairment. Managements judgments are based on market and operational conditions at the present time. Future events could cause management to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring an adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value. The Company provides estimates for warehouse closing costs when it is appropriate to do so based on the applicable accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Future circumstances may result in the Companys actual future closing costs or the amount recognized upon the sale of the property to differ substantially from the original estimates. 22 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Insurance/Self Insurance Liabilities The Company uses a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms to provide for the potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property insurance, director and officers liability, vehicle liability and employee health care benefits.
