For these purposes, forward looking statements are statements that address activities, events, conditions or developments that the Company expects or anticipates may occur in the future. Such forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, domestic and international economic conditions including exchange rates, the effects of competition and regulation, consumer and small business spending patterns and debt levels, conditions affecting the acquisition, development, ownership or use of real estate, actions of vendors, rising costs associated with employees (including health care and workers compensation costs), rising costs associated with the acquisition of merchandise (including the direct and indirect effects of the rising cost of petroleum based products and fuel and energy costs), geopolitical conditions and other risks identified from time to time in the Companys public statements and reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Executive Overview and Selected Consolidated Statements of Income Data (dollars in thousands, except earnings per share) Overview Costco operates membership warehouses based on the concept that offering members very low prices on a limited selection of nationally branded and selected private label products in a wide range of merchandise categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover. This rapid inventory turnover, when combined with the operating efficiencies achieved by volume purchasing, efficient distribution and reduced handling of merchandise in no frills, self service warehouse facilities, enables Costco to operate profitably at significantly lower gross margins than traditional wholesalers, discount retailers and supermarkets. Key items for fiscal year 2005 included: Net sales increased 10% over the prior year, driven by an increase in comparable sales of 7% and the opening of 16 new warehouses; Membership fees for fiscal 2005 increased 11.6% to $1,073,156, representing new member sign ups at new warehouses opened during the fiscal year, increasing penetration of the Companys Executive Membership program, and continued strong member renewal rates; Gross margin (net sales less merchandise costs) decreased nine basis points as a percent of net sales over the prior year. Gross margins increased year over year in most of the Companys merchandise categories, but were offset by changes in the sales mix with higher penetration of lower margin departments, primarily gas. Additionally, margins were negatively impacted by ten basis points due to increased sales penetration of the Executive Membership Program and its related costs; Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales improved two basis points over the prior year, largely due to increased payroll leverage due to increased sales, a decrease in health care costs as a percent of net sales and a flattening of the rising trend in workers compensation costs, offset by higher stock option expense; Net income for fiscal 2005 increased 20.5% to $1,063,092, or $2.18 per diluted share. Net income during fiscal 2005 was impacted by several non recurring items that are discussed further in the comparison of fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 below. Exclusive of these items, net income for fiscal 2005 would have been $998,326 or $2.04 per diluted share, a 10% increase in earnings per share over the prior fiscal year. The Board of Directors approved an increase in the quarterly cash dividend from $0.10 to $0.115 per share; and During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 the Company repurchased shares of Costco common stock, expending approximately $413,252 repurchasing 9.2 million shares of stock at an average cost of $44.89 per share. 13 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) SELECTED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME DATA The table below presents selected operational data, the percentage relationship between net sales and major categories in the Consolidated Statements of Income and the percentage change in the dollar amounts of each of the items.

Comparison of Fiscal 2005 (52 weeks) and Fiscal 2004 (52 weeks): (dollars in thousands, except earnings per share) Net Income Net income for fiscal 2005 increased 20.5% to $1,063,092, or $2.18 per diluted share, from $882,393, or $1.85 per diluted share, during fiscal year 2004. Net income during fiscal 2005 was impacted by the following: a $54,155 (approximately $.11 per diluted share) income tax benefit resulting primarily from the settlement of a transfer pricing dispute between the United States and Canada (covering the years 1996 2003); a cumulative pre tax, non cash charge to preopening expenses of $15,999 (approximately $.02 per diluted share) related to a correction to the Companys method of accounting for ground leases (entered into over the past twenty years) that did not require rental payments during the period of construction; and a net tax benefit with respect to excess foreign tax credits on unremitted foreign earnings recorded in the fourth quarter of $20,592 (approximately $.04 per diluted share). Exclusive of these items, net income for fiscal 2005 would have been $998,326 or $2.04 per diluted share, a 10% increase in earnings per share over the prior fiscal year. Net Sales Net sales increased 10.0% to $51,862,072 in fiscal 2005 from $47,145,712 in fiscal 2004. Approximately 71% of the increase was due to an increase in comparable warehouse sales, that is sales in warehouses open for at least a year. The balance of the increase was due to opening 16 new warehouses during fiscal 2005 and 20 new warehouses during fiscal 2004, a portion of which is not included in comparable warehouse sales. Net sales were reduced by the implementation of Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 03 10, Application of Issue No. 02 16, Accounting by a Customer (Including a Reseller) for Certain Consideration Received from a 14 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Vendor, by Resellers to Sales Incentives Offered to Consumers by Manufacturers, which was effective at the beginning of the Companys fiscal 2004 third quarter. EITF 03 10, which primarily impacts the Companys vendor coupon programs, reduces net sales and merchandise costs by an equal amount and does not affect the Companys consolidated gross margin or net income. Had EITF 03 10 been in effect for the comparable periods in fiscal 2004, the net sales increase in fiscal 2005 would have been 10.4%. (See Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements, EITF 03 10.) For fiscal 2005, comparable sales increased 7% from fiscal 2004. Had EITF 03 10 been in effect for the comparable periods in fiscal 2004, the comparable sales increase for fiscal 2005 would have been 8%. Changes in prices of merchandise did not materially affect the sales increases, with the exception of gasoline, where price increases accounted for approximately 89 basis points of the sales increase. In addition, translation of foreign sales into U.S. dollars contributed to the increase in sales due to stronger foreign currencies, accounting for approximately 134 basis points year over year of the comparable sales increase. Membership Fees Membership fees increased 11.6% to $1,073,156, or 2.07% of net sales, in fiscal 2005 from $961,280, or 2.04% of net sales, in fiscal 2004. This increase was primarily due to additional membership sign ups at the 16 new warehouses opened in fiscal 2005, increased penetration of the Companys Executive membership and high overall member renewal rates consistent with recent years, currently 86%. Gross Margin Gross margin increased 9.1% to $5,515,111, or 10.63% of net sales, in fiscal 2005 from $5,053,696, or 10.72% of net sales, in fiscal 2004. The nine basis point decrease in gross margin as a percentage of net sales reflected a decrease of three basis points in gross margin in the Companys merchandise departments. The three basis point decrease in merchandising is largely due to changes in the sales mix, with higher penetration of lower margin departments. This effect was offset by gross margin gains in most of the Companys merchandise departments, as well as the international operations. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales was positively impacted by five basis points due to the implementation of EITF 03 10, whereby net sales and merchandise costs were reduced equally. The gross margin percentage was reduced by 10 basis points due to the increased penetration of the Executive Member program, increased spending by Executive Members and the resulting increases in the related costs. The gross margin figures reflect accounting for most U.S. merchandise inventories on the last in, first out (LIFO) method. Fiscal 2005 included a $13,410 LIFO charge (increase in merchandise costs), while fiscal 2004 included a $6,090 LIFO charge. The impact of the LIFO adjustment on a year over year basis negatively impacted gross margin, as a percentage of sales, by one additional basis point. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 9.7% to $5,044,341, or 9.73% of net sales, in fiscal 2005, from $4,597,877, or 9.75% of net sales, in fiscal 2004. Had EITF 03 10 been in effect for all of fiscal 2004, SG&A expenses as a percent to net sales would have shown additional improvement of four basis points in fiscal 2005. For fiscal 2005, warehouse and central operating costs positively impacted SG&A comparisons year over year by approximately 13 basis points, primarily due to improved payroll utilization at the warehouse level, including increased leverage from increased comparable sales and cost control measures employed in employee 15 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) benefits, primarily health care. This improvement was partially offset by the implementation of EITF 03 10, which negatively impacted SG&A as a percentage of net sales by five basis points and an increase in stock based compensation costs approximating six basis points year over year. Preopening Expenses Preopening expenses totaled $53,230, or 0.10% of net sales, during fiscal 2005 compared to $30,451, or 0.07% of net sales, during fiscal 2004. During the second quarter of fiscal 2005, in response to the Securities and Exchange Commissions February 7, 2005 letter related to leases, the Company adjusted its method of accounting for leases (entered into over the past twenty years), primarily related to ground leases at certain warehouse locations that did not require rental payments during the period of construction. As a result, the Company recorded a cumulative pre tax, non cash charge of $15,999 to preopening expense in the second quarter of fiscal 2005 to effect this accounting adjustment. Prior periods financial results have not been restated due to the immateriality of this amount to the consolidated financial statements. Twenty one warehouses (including five relocations) were opened in fiscal 2005 compared to the opening of 20 warehouses in fiscal 2004. Pre opening expenses also include costs related to remodels and expanded ancillary operations at existing warehouses. Provision for Impaired Assets and Closing Costs, net The net provision for impaired assets and closing costs was $16,393 in fiscal 2005, compared to $1,000 in fiscal 2004. The provision includes costs related to impairment of long lived assets, future lease obligations of warehouses that have been relocated to new facilities, and any losses or gains resulting from the sale of real property. The provision for fiscal 2005 included charges of $3,893 for impairment of long lived assets, $11,619 for warehouse closing expenses and $881 for net losses on the sale of real property. The provision for fiscal 2004 included charges of $16,548 for warehouse closing expenses that were offset by gains of $15,548 on the sale of real property. At August 28, 2005, the reserve for warehouse closing costs was $9,556, of which $9,118 related to future lease obligations. This compares to a reserve for warehouse closing costs of $10,367 at August 29, 2004, of which $9,184 related to future lease obligations. Interest Expense Interest expense totaled $34,437 in fiscal 2005, compared to $36,651 in fiscal 2004. Interest expense in both fiscal 2005 and 2004 includes interest on the 3 1/2% Zero Coupon Notes, 7 1/8% and 5 1/2% Senior Notes and on balances outstanding under the Companys bank credit facilities and promissory notes. The decrease was primarily a result of a decrease in interest on the Companys 3 1/2% Zero Coupon Notes as note holders converted approximately $280,811 in principle amount of the Notes into common stock during fiscal 2005. Additionally, capitalized interest increased year over year as interest rates and construction costs increased in fiscal 2005 over fiscal 2004. These decreases were partially offset by increases in interest on the Senior Notes as these fixed rate instruments were swapped into variable rate debt in November 2001 and March 2002, which was mitigated by the fact that the 7 1/8% Senior Notes matured and were repaid on June 15, 2005. Interest Income and Other Interest income and other totaled $109,096 in fiscal 2005, compared to $51,627 in fiscal 2004. The increase primarily reflects increased interest income resulting from higher cash and cash equivalents balances and short term investments on hand throughout fiscal 2005, as well as higher interest rates earned on the balances as compared to fiscal 2004. 16 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Provision for Income Taxes The effective income tax rate on earnings was 31.4% in fiscal 2005 and 37% in fiscal 2004. The decrease in the effective income tax rate is attributable to a one time $54,155 income tax benefit resulting primarily from the settlement of a transfer pricing dispute between the United States and Canada (covering the years 1996 2003) and a net tax benefit on excess foreign tax credits on unremitted foreign earnings of $20,592. Excluding these benefits the effective income tax rate on earnings in fiscal 2005 was 36.2%. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 and 2004, the effective tax rate was 28.9% and 37.0%, respectively. The decrease in the fourth quarter tax rate for fiscal 2005 is primarily attributable to the net tax benefit of $20,592, noted above, and a tax benefit of $13,895 primarily associated with lower state taxes. The state tax benefit recorded in the fourth quarter was primarily due to a reduction in the estimated effective state tax rate utilized in the first through third quarters of fiscal 2005. Excluding the benefit of these two items, the fourth quarter tax rate for fiscal 2005 would be 35.8%. Comparison of Fiscal 2004 (52 weeks) and Fiscal 2003 (52 weeks): (dollars in thousands, except earnings per share) Net Income Net income for fiscal 2004 increased 22.4% to $882,393, or $1.85 per diluted share, from $721,000, or $1.53 per diluted share during fiscal year 2003. Net Sales Net sales increased 13.1% to $47,145,712 in fiscal 2004 from $41,692,699 in fiscal 2003. Approximately 78% of the increase was due to an increase in comparable warehouse sales, that is sales in warehouses open for at least a year. The balance of the increase was due to opening 20 new warehouses during fiscal 2004 and a net of 23 new warehouses (29 opened, 6 closed) during fiscal 2003, a portion of which is not included in comparable warehouse sales. Net sales were reduced by the implementation of Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 03 10, Application of Issue No. 02 16, Accounting by a Customer (Including a Reseller) for Certain Consideration Received from a Vendor, by Resellers to Sales Incentives Offered to Consumers by Manufacturers, which was effective at the beginning of the Companys fiscal 2004 third quarter. EITF 03 10, which primarily impacts the Companys vendor coupon programs, reduces net sales and merchandise costs by an equal amount and does not affect the Companys consolidated gross margin or net income. Had EITF 03 10 been in effect for the comparable periods in fiscal 2003, the net sales increase in fiscal 2004 would have been 13.8%. (See Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements, EITF 03 10.) For fiscal 2004, comparable sales increased 10% from fiscal 2003. Had EITF 03 10 been in effect for the comparable periods in fiscal 2003, the comparable sales increase for fiscal 2004 would have been 11%. Changes in prices of merchandise did not materially affect the sales increases, with the exception of gasoline, where price increases accounted for a sales increase of approximately 70 basis points. In addition, due to the weaker U.S. dollar throughout fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003, translation of foreign sales into U.S. dollars contributed to the increase in sales, accounting for a comparable sales increase of approximately 190 basis points year over year. Sales were also positively impacted by the supermarket strikes in Southern California during the first half of the Companys 2004 fiscal year. The positive impact to sales for the entire fiscal year was estimated to be 35 to 50 basis points. 17 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Membership Fees Membership fees increased 12.7% to $961,280, or 2.04% of net sales, in fiscal 2004 from $852,853, or 2.05% of net sales, in fiscal 2003. This increase was primarily due to additional membership sign ups at the 20 new warehouses opened in fiscal 2004; increased penetration of the Companys Executive membership, including the rollout of the program into Canada, which began in the first quarter of fiscal 2004; and high overall member renewal rates consistent with recent years, currently at 86%. Gross Margin Gross margin increased 13.4% to $5,053,696, or 10.72% of net sales, in fiscal 2004 from $4,457,316, or 10.69% of net sales, in fiscal 2003. The three basis point increase, as a percent of net sales, reflected a 14 basis point increase in gross margin in the Companys merchandise departments, helped by strong year over year gross margin gains in the Companys ancillary business operations, particularly gasoline and pharmacy. Year over year gross margin, as a percentage of net sales, was also positively impacted by the implementation of EITF 03 10, whereby net sales and merchandise costs were reduced, resulting in an eight basis point increase. The year over year gross margin percentage was reduced by 12 basis points due to the increased rewards related to the Executive Membership Two Percent Reward Program, resulting from an increase in the penetration of the Executive Member program. The gross margin figures reflect accounting for most U.S. merchandise inventories on the LIFO method. Fiscal 2004 included a $6,090 LIFO charge (increase in merchandise costs), while fiscal 2003 included a $19,650 LIFO credit (reduction in merchandise costs). The impact of the LIFO adjustment on a year over year basis negatively impacted margin by an additional six basis points. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses as a percent of net sales decreased to 9.75% during fiscal 2004 from 9.83% during fiscal 2003. Had EITF 03 10 been in effect in fiscal 2003, SG&A expenses as a percent to net sales would have shown additional improvement of seven basis points in fiscal 2004. For fiscal 2004, warehouse and central operating costs positively impacted SG&A comparisons year over year by approximately 21 basis points, primarily due to increased expense leverage of warehouse payroll, benefits (primarily health care), utility and workers compensation costs. During the latter half of fiscal 2004, the Company implemented changes to its employee healthcare plans that reduced its overall healthcare costs, primarily in the fourth quarter. This improvement was partially offset by the seven basis point increase resulting from the adoption of EITF 03 10, a two basis point increase in expense related to the establishment of additional insurance liabilities resulting from financial difficulties being experienced by one of the Companys third party insurance providers, and an increase in stock based compensation costs following the Companys prospective adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, at the beginning of fiscal 2003, of four basis points. Preopening Expenses Preopening expenses totaled $30,451, or 0.07% of net sales, during fiscal 2004 compared to $36,643, or 0.09% of net sales, during fiscal 2003. This reduction was due to fewer warehouse openings. During fiscal 2004, the Company opened 20 new warehouses compared to 29 new warehouses (including 5 relocations) during fiscal 2003. Pre opening expenses also include costs related to remodels and expanded ancillary operations at existing warehouses. 18 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Provision for Impaired Assets and Closing Costs, net The net provision for impaired assets and closing costs was $1,000 in fiscal 2004, compared to $19,500 in fiscal 2003. The provision includes costs related to impairment of long lived assets, future lease obligations of warehouses that have been relocated to new facilities, and losses or gains resulting from the sale of real property. The provision for fiscal 2004 included charges of $16,548 for warehouse closing expenses that were offset by gains of $15,548 on the sale of real property. The provision for fiscal 2003 included charges of $11,836 for warehouse closing expenses, $4,697 for impairment of long lived assets and $2,967 for net losses on the sale of real property. At August 29, 2004, the reserve for warehouse closing costs was $10,367, of which $9,184 related to future lease obligations. This compares to a reserve for warehouse closing costs of $8,609 at August 31, 2003, of which $7,833 related to future lease obligations. Interest Expense Interest expense totaled $36,651 in fiscal 2004, compared to $36,920 in fiscal 2003. Interest expense in both fiscal 2004 and 2003 includes interest on the 3 1/2% Zero Coupon Notes, 7 1/8% and 5 1/2% Senior Notes and on balances outstanding under the Companys bank credit facilities and promissory notes. The decrease was primarily a result of the Companys reduction in short term borrowings, principally related to its foreign subsidiaries. This decrease was substantially offset by increases in interest rates on the Senior Notes due to interest rate swap agreements converting the interest rate from fixed to floating. Interest Income and Other Interest income and other totaled $51,627 in fiscal 2004, compared to $38,525 in fiscal 2003. The increase primarily reflects greater interest earned on higher cash and cash equivalents balances and short term investments. In addition, a reduction in the expense to record minority interest in the earnings of foreign subsidiaries was reported in fiscal 2004 as the Company increased its ownership in Costco Wholesale UK Limited to 100%. Provision for Income Taxes The effective income tax rate on earnings was 37% in fiscal 2004 and 37.75% in fiscal 2003. The decrease in the effective income tax rate is primarily attributable to lower statutory income tax rates for foreign operations and one time benefits associated with certain tax planning strategies. Liquidity and Capital Resources (dollars in thousands, except per share amounts) Cash Flows The Companys primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from warehouse operations and our existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances, which were $3,459,857 and $3,129,882 at August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, respectively. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $1,783,177 in fiscal 2005 compared to $2,098,783 in fiscal 2004, a decrease of $315,606. Higher net income and a decrease in net merchandise inventories (merchandise inventory less accounts payable) year over year increased cash flow from operating activities by $391,571. This increase was offset by decreases in cash flow from operating assets and liabilities of $706,855, primarily relating to the timing in the collection of certain receivables and in payments of income taxes in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004. A significant component of net cash used in investing activities continues to be the purchase of property and equipment related to the Companys warehouse expansion and remodel projects. Net cash used in investing activities totaled $2,058,729 in fiscal 2005 compared to $1,048,481 in fiscal 2004, an increase of $1,010,248. The increase in investing activities primarily relates to an increase in the net investment in short term investments of $768,596 and an increase in additions to property and equipment of $289,811 in fiscal 2005 over fiscal 2004. 19 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Net cash used in financing activities totaled $518,651 in fiscal 2005 compared to $209,569 provided by financing activities in fiscal 2004. The decrease of $728,220 primarily resulted from an increase in the repayment of debt of $297,275 primarily relating to the repayment of the 7 1/8% Senior Notes, which matured on June 15, 2005, and repurchases of common stock of $413,252 under the Companys $500,000 share repurchase program. Dividends Costcos Board of Directors declared four quarterly cash dividends during fiscal year 2005. The first two dividends of $0.10 per share were paid November 26, 2004 and February 25, 2005, to shareholders of record at the close of business on November 5, 2004 and February 8, 2005, respectively. The third and fourth dividends of $0.115 per share were paid May 27, 2005 and August 26, 2005 to shareholders of record at the close of business on May 6, 2005 and August 5, 2005, respectively. In fiscal 2004 the Company paid dividends of $0.10 per share in the third and fourth quarters. Contractual Obligations The Companys commitment to make future payments under contractual obligations was as follows, as of August 28, 2005. Payments Due by Period Contractual obligations  Total Less than1 year 1 to 3years 4 to 5years After5 years Long term debt(1)(2) $ 879,520 $ 18,064 $ 379,466 $ 65,437 $ 416,553 Capital lease obligations 6,591 3,225 1,305 927 1,134 Operating leases(3) 1,562,267 114,682 219,402 189,188 1,038,995 Purchase obligations (merchandise)(4) 3,049,398 3,048,785 613 Purchase obligations (building, equipment, services and other)(5) 242,361 230,086 12,275 Other(6) 8,591 1,354 1,692 1,362 4,183 Total $ 5,748,728 $ 3,416,196 $ 614,753 $ 256,914 $ 1,460,865 (1) Amounts include contractual interest payments. (2) The amount includes interest accreted to maturity for the Companys Zero Coupon 3 1/2% Convertible Subordinated Notes due August 2017, totaling $415,246. The consolidated balance sheet as of August 28, 2005 reflects a balance outstanding of $274,071. (3) Operating lease obligations have been reduced by $168,742 to reflect sub lease income. (4) Includes open merchandise purchase orders at fiscal year end. (5) The amounts exclude minor outsourced services negotiated at the individual warehouse level that are not significant and generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty. (6) Consists of asset retirement and deferred compensation obligations. Expansion Plans Costcos primary requirement for capital is the financing of the land, building and equipment costs for new warehouses plus the costs of initial warehouse operations and working capital requirements, as well as additional capital for international expansion. 20 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) While there can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized, and plans are subject to change upon further review, it is managements current intention to spend approximately $1,100,000 to $1,250,000 during fiscal 2006 in the United States and Canada for real estate, construction, remodeling and equipment for warehouse clubs and related operations; and approximately $100,000 to $150,000 for international expansion, including the United Kingdom, Asia, Mexico and other potential ventures. These expenditures are expected to be financed with a combination of cash provided from operations and the use of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. Expansion plans for the United States and Canada during fiscal 2006 are to open approximately 28 30 new warehouse clubs on a net basis, inclusive of two to three relocations to larger and better located warehouses. The Company expects to continue its review of expansion plans in its international operations, including the United Kingdom and Asia, along with other international markets. At present, the Company is planning to open three additional warehouses in the U.K during fiscal 2006. Costco Mexico plans to open two to three new warehouse clubs during fiscal 2006. Additional Equity Investments in Subsidiaries and Joint Ventures On June 30, 2005, the Company acquired the remaining 4% interest in CWC Travel Inc for $3,961, bringing Costcos ownership in this entity to 100%. In addition, during fiscal 2005 the Company contributed an additional $15,000 to its investment in Costco Mexico (a 50% owned joint venture), which did not impact its percentage ownership of this entity as the joint venture partner contributed a like amount. On October 3, 2003, the Company acquired from Carrefour Nederland B.V. its 20% equity interest in Costco Wholesale UK Limited for cash of $95,153, bringing Costcos ownership in Costco Wholesale UK Limited to 100%. Bank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs (all amounts stated in thousands of US dollars) The Company has a $500,000 commercial paper program supported by a $150,000 bank credit facility ($300,000 at August 29, 2004) with a group of nine banks, which expires on November 15, 2005, and is not expected to be renewed. At August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, no amounts were outstanding under the commercial paper program and no amounts were outstanding under the credit facility. Applicable interest rates on the credit facility at August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, were 3.92% and 1.90%, respectively. A wholly owned Canadian subsidiary has a $167,000 commercial paper program ($152,000 at August 29, 2004) supported by a $50,000 bank credit facility ($46,000 at August 29, 2004) with a Canadian bank, which is guaranteed by the Company and expires in March 2006. At August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, no amounts were outstanding under the Canadian commercial paper program or the bank credit facility. Applicable interest rates on the credit facility at August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, were 4.25% and 3.75%, respectively. At August 28, 2005, standby letters of credit totaling $23,000 issued under the bank credit facility left $27,000 available for commercial paper support. At August 29, 2004, standby letters of credit totaling $21,000 issued under the bank credit facility left $25,000 available for commercial paper support. The Company has agreed to limit the combined amount outstanding under the U.S. and Canadian commercial paper programs to the combined amounts of the supporting bank credit facilities, which are $177,000 at August 28, 2005, decreasing to $27,000 on November 15, 2005. At August 29, 2004, the combined amount of supporting bank credit facilities was $325,000. The Companys wholly owned Japanese subsidiary has a short term $13,694 bank line of credit that expires in February 2006. At August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, $5,477 and $0, respectively, were borrowed under the line of credit, and $3,652 and $2,576, respectively, were used to support standby letters of credit. A second 21 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) $13,694 bank line of credit was entered into in February 2005 that expires in February 2006. At August 28, 2005, $9,129 was borrowed under the second facility; this bank line was not in place at August 29, 2004. Applicable interest rates on the credit facilities at both August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, were .84%. The Companys Korean subsidiary has a short term $11,665 bank line of credit, which expires in January 2006. At August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, no amounts were borrowed under the line of credit and $1,668 and $0, respectively, were used to support standby letters of credit. Applicable interest rates on the credit facility at August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, were 4.51% and 4.52%, respectively. The Companys Taiwan subsidiary has a $7,439 bank revolving credit facility that expires in January 2006. At August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, no amounts were borrowed under the credit facility and $2,495 and $1,165, respectively, were used to support standby letters of credit. A second $15,499 bank revolving credit facility is in place, which expires in July 2006. At August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, no amounts were borrowed under the second credit facility and $790 and $738, respectively were used to support standby letters of credit. Applicable interest rates on the credit facilities at August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, were 3.75% and 3.50%, respectively. The Companys wholly owned United Kingdom subsidiary has a $108,408 bank revolving credit facility expiring in February 2007 and a $63,238 bank overdraft facility renewable on a yearly basis in March 2006. At August 28, 2005, $39,750 was outstanding under the revolving credit facility with an applicable interest rate of 5.30% and no amounts were outstanding under the bank overdraft facility. At August 29, 2004, $21,595 was outstanding under the revolving credit facility with an applicable interest rate of 5.285% and no amounts were outstanding under the bank overdraft facility. Letters of Credit The Company has letter of credit facilities (for commercial and standby letters of credit), totaling approximately $401,933. The outstanding commitments under these facilities at August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004 totaled approximately $131,169 and $166,800, respectively, including approximately $64,532 and $52,900, respectively, in standby letters of credit. Financing Activities The Companys 7 1/8% Senior Notes, carried at $304,350 at August 29, 2004, matured and were repaid on June 15, 2005 from its cash and cash equivalents. In April 2003, the Companys wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.92% in the aggregate amount of $36,516, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due on April 26, 2010. In March 2002, the Company issued $300,000 of 5 1/2% Senior Notes carried at $307,688 due March 15, 2007. Interest is payable semi annually. Simultaneous with the issuance of the Senior Notes, the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements converting the interest from fixed to floating. In February 1996, the Company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a shelf registration statement for $500,000 of senior debt securities. On October 23, 2001, additional debt securities of $100,000 were registered. The $300,000 of 5 1/2% Senior Notes issued in March 2002 reduced the amount of registered securities available for future issuance to $300,000. During fiscal 2005, $280,811 in principal amount of the Companys 3 1/2% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes were converted by note holders into 9,910,011 shares of common stock. 22 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Derivatives The Company has limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and uses them only to manage well defined interest rate and foreign exchange risks. Forward foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on inventory purchases and typically have very short terms. The aggregate amount of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, was $42,466 and $30,495, respectively. The majority of the forward foreign exchange contracts were entered into by the Companys wholly owned United Kingdom subsidiary, primarily to hedge U.S. dollar merchandise inventory purchases. The Company monitors its foreign currency exchange exposures to ensure the overall effectiveness of its foreign currency hedge positions. The only other derivative instruments the Company holds are interest rate swaps, which the Company uses to manage the interest rate risk associated with its borrowings and to manage the Companys mix of fixed rate and variable rate debt. As of August 28, 2005, the Company had fixed to floating interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $300,000 and an aggregate fair value of $7,688, which is recorded in other assets on the Companys consolidated balance sheet. These swaps were entered into effective March 25, 2002, and are designated and qualify as fair value hedges of the Companys $300,000 5 1/2% Senior Notes. As the terms of the swaps match those of the underlying hedged debt, the changes in the fair value of these swaps are offset by corresponding changes in the carrying amount of the hedged debt and result in no net earnings impact. As of August 29, 2004, the Company had fixed to floating interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $600,000 and an aggregate fair value of $25,754. In addition to the Companys swap on the 5 1/2% Senior Notes noted above, the Company had entered into a swap on its $300,000 7 1/8% Senior Notes effective November 13, 2001, which was designated and qualified as a fair value hedge. The $300,000 7 1/8% Senior Notes matured and were repaid on June 15, 2005. Concurrent to this transaction, the related swap agreement expired. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements With the exception of its operating leases, the Company has no off balance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on the Companys financial condition or consolidated financial statements. Stock Repurchase Program On November 30, 2001, the Companys Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program, authorizing the repurchase of up to $500,000 of Costco Common Stock through November 30, 2004. Under the program, the Company could repurchase shares at any time in the open market or in private transactions as market conditions warrant. The repurchased shares would be retired. On October 25, 2004, the Board of Directors renewed the program for another three years. On June 7, 2005 the Company began repurchasing shares on the open market. Through August 28, 2005 the Company has repurchased 9,205,100 shares of common stock at an average price of $44.89, totaling approximately $413,252, including commissions. Subsequent to the Companys fiscal 2005 year end, August 29, 2005, the Board of Directors of Costco authorized an additional stock repurchase program of up to $1,000,000 of Costco common stock. Under the program, which contains no expiration date, the Company may repurchase shares at any time in the open market or in private transactions as market conditions warrant. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the Companys financial statements requires that management make estimates and judgments that affect the financial position and results of operations. Management continues to review its accounting policies and evaluate its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, merchandise inventory, 23 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) impairment of long lived assets and warehouse closing costs and insurance/self insurance liabilities. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the present circumstances. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes sales, net of estimated returns, at the time customers take possession of merchandise or receive services. When the Company collects payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services, the amount received is recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed. The Company provides for estimated sales returns based on historical returns levels. The Company evaluates the criteria of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal Versus Net as an Agent, in determining whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, when Costco is the primary obligor, is subject to inventory risk, has latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, influence product or service specifications, or has several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded on a gross basis. If the Company is not the primary obligor and does not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above, Costco records the net amounts as commissions earned. Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market as determined primarily by the retail method of accounting and are stated using the last in, first out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail method of accounting and are stated using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. The Company believes the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. The Company records an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the expected annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end. At August 28, 2005, merchandise inventories valued at LIFO approximated FIFO after considering the lower of cost or market principle. At August 29, 2004, merchandise inventories valued using LIFO exceeded the comparable FIFO value by approximately $13,410 due to the aggregate effects of deflation. The Company provides for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts on the basis of a percentage of sales. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect the trend of the actual physical inventory count results, which generally occur in the second and fourth fiscal quarters of the Companys fiscal year. Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as the Company progresses towards earning those rebates provided they are probable and reasonably estimable. Other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of agreement, or other systematic and rational approach. Impairment of long lived assets and warehouse closing costs The Company periodically evaluates its long lived assets for indicators of impairment. Managements judgments are based on market and operational conditions at the present time. Future events could cause management to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring an adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value. 24 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) The Company provides estimates for warehouse closing costs, based on the applicable accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Future circumstances may result in the Companys actual future closing costs or the amount recognized upon the sale of the property to differ substantially from the original estimates. Insurance/Self Insurance Liabilities The Company uses a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms to provide for the potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property damage, director and officers liability, vehicle liability and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by the Company are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience and outside expertise, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In May 2005, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, a Replacement of Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 20 and FASB Statement No. 3. SFAS 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements for changes in accounting principles, unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change. SFAS 154 also requires that retrospective application of a change in accounting principle be limited to the direct effects of the change. Indirect effects of a change in accounting principle, such as a change in non discretionary profit sharing payments resulting from an accounting change, should be recognized in the period of the accounting change. SFAS 154 also requires that a change in depreciation, amortization, or depletion method for long lived, non financial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate effected by a change in accounting principle. SFAS 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. Early adoption is permitted for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after the date this Statement is issued. The Company is required to adopt the provisions of SFAS 154, as applicable, beginning in fiscal 2007. The Company does not believe the adoption of SFAS 154 will have a significant effect on its future consolidated financial statements. In March 2005, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, An Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143, which requires an entity to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation when incurred if the liabilitys fair value can be reasonably estimated. The Company adopted the provisions of FIN 47 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. The adoption of this Interpretation did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R, Share based Payments. SFAS 123R revises SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, which the Company adopted as of the beginning of its fiscal 2003, and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. SFAS 123R applies to transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services and also applies to liabilities an entity may incur for goods or services that are based on the fair value of those equity instruments. All employee stock option grants made by the Company since the beginning of fiscal 2003 have been expensed over the related option vesting period based on the fair value at the date the options are granted using the Black Scholes model. Under SFAS 123R, the Company will be required to select a valuation technique or option pricing model that meets the criteria as stated in the standard. Allowable valuation models include a binomial model and the Black Scholes model. The Company is required to adopt the provisions of SFAS 123R in the first quarter of its fiscal 2006. The Company is in the process of assessing the impact on the Companys results of operations from the adoption of SFAS 123R for its effect on prospective option grants. The adoption of SFAS 123R requires the Company to value stock options granted prior to its adoption of SFAS 123 under the fair value 25 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) method and expense these amounts in the income statement over the stock options remaining vesting period. This will result in the Company expensing $13,043 in fiscal 2006, which would previously have been presented in a proforma footnote disclosure. In addition, SFAS 123R will require the Company to reflect the tax savings resulting from tax deductions in excess of expense reflected in its financial statements as a financing cash flow, which will impact the Companys future reported cash flows from operating activities. In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, Inventory Costs An Amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin (ARB) No. 43, Chapter 4. SFAS 151 clarifies that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and spoilage should be expensed as incurred and not included in overhead. Further, SFAS 151 requires that allocation of fixed and production facilities overheads to conversion costs should be based on normal capacity of the production facilities. The provisions in this statement are effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005. The Company does not believe that the adoption of SFAS 151 will have a significant effect on its future consolidated financial statements. In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153, Exchanges of Non monetary Assets An Amendment of APB No. 29. The provisions of this statement are effective for non monetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005. This statement eliminates the exception to fair value for exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchange transactions that do not have commercial substance that is, transactions that are not expected to result in significant changes in the cash flows of the reporting entity. The Company does not believe that the adoption of SFAS 153 will have a significant effect on its future consolidated financial statements. In March 2004, the FASB EITF reached a consensus on EITF Issue No. 03 1, The Meaning of Other Than Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments, (EITF 03 1). The guidance prescribes a three step model for determining whether an investment is other than temporarily impaired and requires disclosures about unrealized losses on investments. The accounting guidance became effective for reporting periods beginning after June 15, 2004, while the disclosure requirements became effective for annual reporting periods ending after June 15, 2004. In September 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) EITF 03 1 1, Effective Date of Paragraphs 10 20 of EITF Issue No. 03 1 The Meaning of Other Than Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments, (FSP EITF 03 1 1). FSP EITF 03 1 1 delayed the effective date for the measurement and recognition guidance contained in paragraphs 10 20 of EITF Issue 03 1. In November 2005, the FASB issued FSP FAS 115 1 and FAS 124 1, The Meaning of Other Than Temporary Impairment and its Application to Certain Investments. This FSP addresses the determination as to when an investment is considered impaired, whether the impairment is other than temporary and the measurement of an impairment loss. This statement specifically nullifies the requirements of paragraph 10 18 of EITF 03 1 and references existing other than temporary impairment guidance. The guidance under this FSP is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2005 and the Company continued to apply relevant other than temporary guidance as provided for in FSP EITF 03 1 1 during fiscal 2005. The Company does not believe that the adoption of the guidance of FSP FAS 115 1 and FAS 124 1 will have a significant effect on its future consolidated financial statements. In November 2003, the EITF reached consensus on Issue No. 03 10, Application of Issue No. 02 16 by Resellers to Sales Incentives Offered to Consumers by Manufacturers, with respect to determining if consideration received by a reseller from a vendor that is reimbursed by the vendor for honoring the vendors sale incentives offered directly to consumers should be recorded as a reduction in sales. These rules apply to transactions entered into by consumers in fiscal periods beginning after November 25, 2003 and, therefore, apply to such transactions starting with the Companys fiscal third quarter of 2004, which began February 16, 2004. The adoption of EITF 03 10 did not affect the Companys consolidated gross profit or net income, but did result in a reduction of both net sales and merchandise costs by an equal amount. Had the first half of fiscal 2004 and all of fiscal 2003 been reported under EITF 03 10 guidance, the sales and cost of sales would have been reduced by approximately $186,900 and $282,300, respectively. 26 Table of Contents Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company is exposed to financial market risk resulting from changes in interest and foreign currency rates. As a policy, the Company does not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions, nor hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. The nature and amount of the Companys long and short term debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As of August 28, 2005, the Companys fixed rate long term debt includes its $415,246 principal amount at maturity Zero Coupon Subordinated Notes carried at $274,071 and additional notes and capital lease obligations totaling $132,141. The Companys debt also includes $300,000 5 1/2% Senior Notes carried at $307,688. The Company has entered into fixed to floating interest rate swaps on the Senior Notes, effectively converting these fixed interest rate securities to variable rate securities. As of August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, the Company had fixed to floating interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $300,000 and $600,000, respectively, and an aggregate fair value of $7,688 and $25,754, respectively. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt and may affect the interest expense related to the variable rate debt. The Company holds interest bearing instruments that are classified as cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. The Companys investment policy is to manage its total cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances to preserve principal and liquidity while maximizing the return on the investment portfolio through the full investment of available funds. The Company diversifies its investment portfolio by investing in multiple types of investment grade securities and through internal management and the use of third party investment managers. Short term investments generally have a maturity of three months to five years from the purchase date. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. As the majority of these instruments are of a short term nature, if interest rates were to increase or decrease immediately, there is no material risk of a valuation adjustment related to these instruments. For those instruments that are classified as available for sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in interest rates are reflected in other accumulated comprehensive income or loss. Based on the Companys cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances at August 28, 2005, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $15,000 to interest income (pre tax) on an annual basis. Most foreign currency transactions have been conducted in local currencies, limiting the Companys exposure to changes in currency rates. The Company periodically enters into short term forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates on inventory purchases. The fair value of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at August 28, 2005 was $42,901. 27 Table of Contents 
 
Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Certain statements contained in this document constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. For these purposes, forward looking statements are statements that address activities, events, conditions or developments that the Company expects or anticipates may occur in the future. Such forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, domestic and international economic conditions including exchange rates, the effects of competition and regulation, consumer and small business spending patterns and debt levels, conditions affecting the acquisition, development, ownership or use of real estate, actions of vendors, rising costs associated with employees (including health care and workers compensation costs), rising costs associated with the acquisition of merchandise (including the direct and indirect effects of the rising cost of petroleum based products and fuel and energy costs), geopolitical conditions and other risks identified from time to time in the Companys public statements and reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Executive Overview and Selected Consolidated Statements of Income Data (dollars in thousands, except earnings per share) Overview Costco operates membership warehouses based on the concept that offering members very low prices on a limited selection of nationally branded and selected private label products in a wide range of merchandise categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover. This rapid inventory turnover, when combined with the operating efficiencies achieved by volume purchasing, efficient distribution and reduced handling of merchandise in no frills, self service warehouse facilities, enables Costco to operate profitably at significantly lower gross margins than traditional wholesalers, discount retailers and supermarkets. Key items for fiscal year 2005 included: Net sales increased 10% over the prior year, driven by an increase in comparable sales of 7% and the opening of 16 new warehouses; Membership fees for fiscal 2005 increased 11.6% to $1,073,156, representing new member sign ups at new warehouses opened during the fiscal year, increasing penetration of the Companys Executive Membership program, and continued strong member renewal rates; Gross margin (net sales less merchandise costs) decreased nine basis points as a percent of net sales over the prior year. Gross margins increased year over year in most of the Companys merchandise categories, but were offset by changes in the sales mix with higher penetration of lower margin departments, primarily gas. Additionally, margins were negatively impacted by ten basis points due to increased sales penetration of the Executive Membership Program and its related costs; Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales improved two basis points over the prior year, largely due to increased payroll leverage due to increased sales, a decrease in health care costs as a percent of net sales and a flattening of the rising trend in workers compensation costs, offset by higher stock option expense; Net income for fiscal 2005 increased 20.5% to $1,063,092, or $2.18 per diluted share. Net income during fiscal 2005 was impacted by several non recurring items that are discussed further in the comparison of fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 below. Exclusive of these items, net income for fiscal 2005 would have been $998,326 or $2.04 per diluted share, a 10% increase in earnings per share over the prior fiscal year. The Board of Directors approved an increase in the quarterly cash dividend from $0.10 to $0.115 per share; and During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 the Company repurchased shares of Costco common stock, expending approximately $413,252 repurchasing 9.2 million shares of stock at an average cost of $44.89 per share. 13 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) SELECTED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME DATA The table below presents selected operational data, the percentage relationship between net sales and major categories in the Consolidated Statements of Income and the percentage change in the dollar amounts of each of the items.

Comparison of Fiscal 2005 (52 weeks) and Fiscal 2004 (52 weeks): (dollars in thousands, except earnings per share) Net Income Net income for fiscal 2005 increased 20.5% to $1,063,092, or $2.18 per diluted share, from $882,393, or $1.85 per diluted share, during fiscal year 2004. Net income during fiscal 2005 was impacted by the following: a $54,155 (approximately $.11 per diluted share) income tax benefit resulting primarily from the settlement of a transfer pricing dispute between the United States and Canada (covering the years 1996 2003); a cumulative pre tax, non cash charge to preopening expenses of $15,999 (approximately $.02 per diluted share) related to a correction to the Companys method of accounting for ground leases (entered into over the past twenty years) that did not require rental payments during the period of construction; and a net tax benefit with respect to excess foreign tax credits on unremitted foreign earnings recorded in the fourth quarter of $20,592 (approximately $.04 per diluted share). Exclusive of these items, net income for fiscal 2005 would have been $998,326 or $2.04 per diluted share, a 10% increase in earnings per share over the prior fiscal year. Net Sales Net sales increased 10.0% to $51,862,072 in fiscal 2005 from $47,145,712 in fiscal 2004. Approximately 71% of the increase was due to an increase in comparable warehouse sales, that is sales in warehouses open for at least a year. The balance of the increase was due to opening 16 new warehouses during fiscal 2005 and 20 new warehouses during fiscal 2004, a portion of which is not included in comparable warehouse sales. Net sales were reduced by the implementation of Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 03 10, Application of Issue No. 02 16, Accounting by a Customer (Including a Reseller) for Certain Consideration Received from a 14 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Vendor, by Resellers to Sales Incentives Offered to Consumers by Manufacturers, which was effective at the beginning of the Companys fiscal 2004 third quarter. EITF 03 10, which primarily impacts the Companys vendor coupon programs, reduces net sales and merchandise costs by an equal amount and does not affect the Companys consolidated gross margin or net income. Had EITF 03 10 been in effect for the comparable periods in fiscal 2004, the net sales increase in fiscal 2005 would have been 10.4%. (See Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements, EITF 03 10.) For fiscal 2005, comparable sales increased 7% from fiscal 2004. Had EITF 03 10 been in effect for the comparable periods in fiscal 2004, the comparable sales increase for fiscal 2005 would have been 8%. Changes in prices of merchandise did not materially affect the sales increases, with the exception of gasoline, where price increases accounted for approximately 89 basis points of the sales increase. In addition, translation of foreign sales into U.S. dollars contributed to the increase in sales due to stronger foreign currencies, accounting for approximately 134 basis points year over year of the comparable sales increase. Membership Fees Membership fees increased 11.6% to $1,073,156, or 2.07% of net sales, in fiscal 2005 from $961,280, or 2.04% of net sales, in fiscal 2004. This increase was primarily due to additional membership sign ups at the 16 new warehouses opened in fiscal 2005, increased penetration of the Companys Executive membership and high overall member renewal rates consistent with recent years, currently 86%. Gross Margin Gross margin increased 9.1% to $5,515,111, or 10.63% of net sales, in fiscal 2005 from $5,053,696, or 10.72% of net sales, in fiscal 2004. The nine basis point decrease in gross margin as a percentage of net sales reflected a decrease of three basis points in gross margin in the Companys merchandise departments. The three basis point decrease in merchandising is largely due to changes in the sales mix, with higher penetration of lower margin departments. This effect was offset by gross margin gains in most of the Companys merchandise departments, as well as the international operations. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales was positively impacted by five basis points due to the implementation of EITF 03 10, whereby net sales and merchandise costs were reduced equally. The gross margin percentage was reduced by 10 basis points due to the increased penetration of the Executive Member program, increased spending by Executive Members and the resulting increases in the related costs. The gross margin figures reflect accounting for most U.S. merchandise inventories on the last in, first out (LIFO) method. Fiscal 2005 included a $13,410 LIFO charge (increase in merchandise costs), while fiscal 2004 included a $6,090 LIFO charge. The impact of the LIFO adjustment on a year over year basis negatively impacted gross margin, as a percentage of sales, by one additional basis point. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 9.7% to $5,044,341, or 9.73% of net sales, in fiscal 2005, from $4,597,877, or 9.75% of net sales, in fiscal 2004. Had EITF 03 10 been in effect for all of fiscal 2004, SG&A expenses as a percent to net sales would have shown additional improvement of four basis points in fiscal 2005. For fiscal 2005, warehouse and central operating costs positively impacted SG&A comparisons year over year by approximately 13 basis points, primarily due to improved payroll utilization at the warehouse level, including increased leverage from increased comparable sales and cost control measures employed in employee 15 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) benefits, primarily health care. This improvement was partially offset by the implementation of EITF 03 10, which negatively impacted SG&A as a percentage of net sales by five basis points and an increase in stock based compensation costs approximating six basis points year over year. Preopening Expenses Preopening expenses totaled $53,230, or 0.10% of net sales, during fiscal 2005 compared to $30,451, or 0.07% of net sales, during fiscal 2004. During the second quarter of fiscal 2005, in response to the Securities and Exchange Commissions February 7, 2005 letter related to leases, the Company adjusted its method of accounting for leases (entered into over the past twenty years), primarily related to ground leases at certain warehouse locations that did not require rental payments during the period of construction. As a result, the Company recorded a cumulative pre tax, non cash charge of $15,999 to preopening expense in the second quarter of fiscal 2005 to effect this accounting adjustment. Prior periods financial results have not been restated due to the immateriality of this amount to the consolidated financial statements. Twenty one warehouses (including five relocations) were opened in fiscal 2005 compared to the opening of 20 warehouses in fiscal 2004. Pre opening expenses also include costs related to remodels and expanded ancillary operations at existing warehouses. Provision for Impaired Assets and Closing Costs, net The net provision for impaired assets and closing costs was $16,393 in fiscal 2005, compared to $1,000 in fiscal 2004. The provision includes costs related to impairment of long lived assets, future lease obligations of warehouses that have been relocated to new facilities, and any losses or gains resulting from the sale of real property. The provision for fiscal 2005 included charges of $3,893 for impairment of long lived assets, $11,619 for warehouse closing expenses and $881 for net losses on the sale of real property. The provision for fiscal 2004 included charges of $16,548 for warehouse closing expenses that were offset by gains of $15,548 on the sale of real property. At August 28, 2005, the reserve for warehouse closing costs was $9,556, of which $9,118 related to future lease obligations. This compares to a reserve for warehouse closing costs of $10,367 at August 29, 2004, of which $9,184 related to future lease obligations. Interest Expense Interest expense totaled $34,437 in fiscal 2005, compared to $36,651 in fiscal 2004. Interest expense in both fiscal 2005 and 2004 includes interest on the 3 1/2% Zero Coupon Notes, 7 1/8% and 5 1/2% Senior Notes and on balances outstanding under the Companys bank credit facilities and promissory notes. The decrease was primarily a result of a decrease in interest on the Companys 3 1/2% Zero Coupon Notes as note holders converted approximately $280,811 in principle amount of the Notes into common stock during fiscal 2005. Additionally, capitalized interest increased year over year as interest rates and construction costs increased in fiscal 2005 over fiscal 2004. These decreases were partially offset by increases in interest on the Senior Notes as these fixed rate instruments were swapped into variable rate debt in November 2001 and March 2002, which was mitigated by the fact that the 7 1/8% Senior Notes matured and were repaid on June 15, 2005. Interest Income and Other Interest income and other totaled $109,096 in fiscal 2005, compared to $51,627 in fiscal 2004. The increase primarily reflects increased interest income resulting from higher cash and cash equivalents balances and short term investments on hand throughout fiscal 2005, as well as higher interest rates earned on the balances as compared to fiscal 2004. 16 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Provision for Income Taxes The effective income tax rate on earnings was 31.4% in fiscal 2005 and 37% in fiscal 2004. The decrease in the effective income tax rate is attributable to a one time $54,155 income tax benefit resulting primarily from the settlement of a transfer pricing dispute between the United States and Canada (covering the years 1996 2003) and a net tax benefit on excess foreign tax credits on unremitted foreign earnings of $20,592. Excluding these benefits the effective income tax rate on earnings in fiscal 2005 was 36.2%. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 and 2004, the effective tax rate was 28.9% and 37.0%, respectively. The decrease in the fourth quarter tax rate for fiscal 2005 is primarily attributable to the net tax benefit of $20,592, noted above, and a tax benefit of $13,895 primarily associated with lower state taxes. The state tax benefit recorded in the fourth quarter was primarily due to a reduction in the estimated effective state tax rate utilized in the first through third quarters of fiscal 2005. Excluding the benefit of these two items, the fourth quarter tax rate for fiscal 2005 would be 35.8%. Comparison of Fiscal 2004 (52 weeks) and Fiscal 2003 (52 weeks): (dollars in thousands, except earnings per share) Net Income Net income for fiscal 2004 increased 22.4% to $882,393, or $1.85 per diluted share, from $721,000, or $1.53 per diluted share during fiscal year 2003. Net Sales Net sales increased 13.1% to $47,145,712 in fiscal 2004 from $41,692,699 in fiscal 2003. Approximately 78% of the increase was due to an increase in comparable warehouse sales, that is sales in warehouses open for at least a year. The balance of the increase was due to opening 20 new warehouses during fiscal 2004 and a net of 23 new warehouses (29 opened, 6 closed) during fiscal 2003, a portion of which is not included in comparable warehouse sales. Net sales were reduced by the implementation of Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 03 10, Application of Issue No. 02 16, Accounting by a Customer (Including a Reseller) for Certain Consideration Received from a Vendor, by Resellers to Sales Incentives Offered to Consumers by Manufacturers, which was effective at the beginning of the Companys fiscal 2004 third quarter. EITF 03 10, which primarily impacts the Companys vendor coupon programs, reduces net sales and merchandise costs by an equal amount and does not affect the Companys consolidated gross margin or net income. Had EITF 03 10 been in effect for the comparable periods in fiscal 2003, the net sales increase in fiscal 2004 would have been 13.8%. (See Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements, EITF 03 10.) For fiscal 2004, comparable sales increased 10% from fiscal 2003. Had EITF 03 10 been in effect for the comparable periods in fiscal 2003, the comparable sales increase for fiscal 2004 would have been 11%. Changes in prices of merchandise did not materially affect the sales increases, with the exception of gasoline, where price increases accounted for a sales increase of approximately 70 basis points. In addition, due to the weaker U.S. dollar throughout fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003, translation of foreign sales into U.S. dollars contributed to the increase in sales, accounting for a comparable sales increase of approximately 190 basis points year over year. Sales were also positively impacted by the supermarket strikes in Southern California during the first half of the Companys 2004 fiscal year. The positive impact to sales for the entire fiscal year was estimated to be 35 to 50 basis points. 17 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Membership Fees Membership fees increased 12.7% to $961,280, or 2.04% of net sales, in fiscal 2004 from $852,853, or 2.05% of net sales, in fiscal 2003. This increase was primarily due to additional membership sign ups at the 20 new warehouses opened in fiscal 2004; increased penetration of the Companys Executive membership, including the rollout of the program into Canada, which began in the first quarter of fiscal 2004; and high overall member renewal rates consistent with recent years, currently at 86%. Gross Margin Gross margin increased 13.4% to $5,053,696, or 10.72% of net sales, in fiscal 2004 from $4,457,316, or 10.69% of net sales, in fiscal 2003. The three basis point increase, as a percent of net sales, reflected a 14 basis point increase in gross margin in the Companys merchandise departments, helped by strong year over year gross margin gains in the Companys ancillary business operations, particularly gasoline and pharmacy. Year over year gross margin, as a percentage of net sales, was also positively impacted by the implementation of EITF 03 10, whereby net sales and merchandise costs were reduced, resulting in an eight basis point increase. The year over year gross margin percentage was reduced by 12 basis points due to the increased rewards related to the Executive Membership Two Percent Reward Program, resulting from an increase in the penetration of the Executive Member program. The gross margin figures reflect accounting for most U.S. merchandise inventories on the LIFO method. Fiscal 2004 included a $6,090 LIFO charge (increase in merchandise costs), while fiscal 2003 included a $19,650 LIFO credit (reduction in merchandise costs). The impact of the LIFO adjustment on a year over year basis negatively impacted margin by an additional six basis points. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses as a percent of net sales decreased to 9.75% during fiscal 2004 from 9.83% during fiscal 2003. Had EITF 03 10 been in effect in fiscal 2003, SG&A expenses as a percent to net sales would have shown additional improvement of seven basis points in fiscal 2004. For fiscal 2004, warehouse and central operating costs positively impacted SG&A comparisons year over year by approximately 21 basis points, primarily due to increased expense leverage of warehouse payroll, benefits (primarily health care), utility and workers compensation costs. During the latter half of fiscal 2004, the Company implemented changes to its employee healthcare plans that reduced its overall healthcare costs, primarily in the fourth quarter. This improvement was partially offset by the seven basis point increase resulting from the adoption of EITF 03 10, a two basis point increase in expense related to the establishment of additional insurance liabilities resulting from financial difficulties being experienced by one of the Companys third party insurance providers, and an increase in stock based compensation costs following the Companys prospective adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, at the beginning of fiscal 2003, of four basis points. Preopening Expenses Preopening expenses totaled $30,451, or 0.07% of net sales, during fiscal 2004 compared to $36,643, or 0.09% of net sales, during fiscal 2003. This reduction was due to fewer warehouse openings. During fiscal 2004, the Company opened 20 new warehouses compared to 29 new warehouses (including 5 relocations) during fiscal 2003. Pre opening expenses also include costs related to remodels and expanded ancillary operations at existing warehouses. 18 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Provision for Impaired Assets and Closing Costs, net The net provision for impaired assets and closing costs was $1,000 in fiscal 2004, compared to $19,500 in fiscal 2003. The provision includes costs related to impairment of long lived assets, future lease obligations of warehouses that have been relocated to new facilities, and losses or gains resulting from the sale of real property. The provision for fiscal 2004 included charges of $16,548 for warehouse closing expenses that were offset by gains of $15,548 on the sale of real property. The provision for fiscal 2003 included charges of $11,836 for warehouse closing expenses, $4,697 for impairment of long lived assets and $2,967 for net losses on the sale of real property. At August 29, 2004, the reserve for warehouse closing costs was $10,367, of which $9,184 related to future lease obligations. This compares to a reserve for warehouse closing costs of $8,609 at August 31, 2003, of which $7,833 related to future lease obligations. Interest Expense Interest expense totaled $36,651 in fiscal 2004, compared to $36,920 in fiscal 2003. Interest expense in both fiscal 2004 and 2003 includes interest on the 3 1/2% Zero Coupon Notes, 7 1/8% and 5 1/2% Senior Notes and on balances outstanding under the Companys bank credit facilities and promissory notes. The decrease was primarily a result of the Companys reduction in short term borrowings, principally related to its foreign subsidiaries. This decrease was substantially offset by increases in interest rates on the Senior Notes due to interest rate swap agreements converting the interest rate from fixed to floating. Interest Income and Other Interest income and other totaled $51,627 in fiscal 2004, compared to $38,525 in fiscal 2003. The increase primarily reflects greater interest earned on higher cash and cash equivalents balances and short term investments. In addition, a reduction in the expense to record minority interest in the earnings of foreign subsidiaries was reported in fiscal 2004 as the Company increased its ownership in Costco Wholesale UK Limited to 100%. Provision for Income Taxes The effective income tax rate on earnings was 37% in fiscal 2004 and 37.75% in fiscal 2003. The decrease in the effective income tax rate is primarily attributable to lower statutory income tax rates for foreign operations and one time benefits associated with certain tax planning strategies. Liquidity and Capital Resources (dollars in thousands, except per share amounts) Cash Flows The Companys primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from warehouse operations and our existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances, which were $3,459,857 and $3,129,882 at August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, respectively. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $1,783,177 in fiscal 2005 compared to $2,098,783 in fiscal 2004, a decrease of $315,606. Higher net income and a decrease in net merchandise inventories (merchandise inventory less accounts payable) year over year increased cash flow from operating activities by $391,571. This increase was offset by decreases in cash flow from operating assets and liabilities of $706,855, primarily relating to the timing in the collection of certain receivables and in payments of income taxes in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004. A significant component of net cash used in investing activities continues to be the purchase of property and equipment related to the Companys warehouse expansion and remodel projects. Net cash used in investing activities totaled $2,058,729 in fiscal 2005 compared to $1,048,481 in fiscal 2004, an increase of $1,010,248. The increase in investing activities primarily relates to an increase in the net investment in short term investments of $768,596 and an increase in additions to property and equipment of $289,811 in fiscal 2005 over fiscal 2004. 19 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Net cash used in financing activities totaled $518,651 in fiscal 2005 compared to $209,569 provided by financing activities in fiscal 2004. The decrease of $728,220 primarily resulted from an increase in the repayment of debt of $297,275 primarily relating to the repayment of the 7 1/8% Senior Notes, which matured on June 15, 2005, and repurchases of common stock of $413,252 under the Companys $500,000 share repurchase program. Dividends Costcos Board of Directors declared four quarterly cash dividends during fiscal year 2005. The first two dividends of $0.10 per share were paid November 26, 2004 and February 25, 2005, to shareholders of record at the close of business on November 5, 2004 and February 8, 2005, respectively. The third and fourth dividends of $0.115 per share were paid May 27, 2005 and August 26, 2005 to shareholders of record at the close of business on May 6, 2005 and August 5, 2005, respectively. In fiscal 2004 the Company paid dividends of $0.10 per share in the third and fourth quarters. Contractual Obligations The Companys commitment to make future payments under contractual obligations was as follows, as of August 28, 2005. Payments Due by Period Contractual obligations  Total Less than1 year 1 to 3years 4 to 5years After5 years Long term debt(1)(2) $ 879,520 $ 18,064 $ 379,466 $ 65,437 $ 416,553 Capital lease obligations 6,591 3,225 1,305 927 1,134 Operating leases(3) 1,562,267 114,682 219,402 189,188 1,038,995 Purchase obligations (merchandise)(4) 3,049,398 3,048,785 613 Purchase obligations (building, equipment, services and other)(5) 242,361 230,086 12,275 Other(6) 8,591 1,354 1,692 1,362 4,183 Total $ 5,748,728 $ 3,416,196 $ 614,753 $ 256,914 $ 1,460,865 (1) Amounts include contractual interest payments.

Expansion Plans Costcos primary requirement for capital is the financing of the land, building and equipment costs for new warehouses plus the costs of initial warehouse operations and working capital requirements, as well as additional capital for international expansion. 20 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) While there can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized, and plans are subject to change upon further review, it is managements current intention to spend approximately $1,100,000 to $1,250,000 during fiscal 2006 in the United States and Canada for real estate, construction, remodeling and equipment for warehouse clubs and related operations; and approximately $100,000 to $150,000 for international expansion, including the United Kingdom, Asia, Mexico and other potential ventures. These expenditures are expected to be financed with a combination of cash provided from operations and the use of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. Expansion plans for the United States and Canada during fiscal 2006 are to open approximately 28 30 new warehouse clubs on a net basis, inclusive of two to three relocations to larger and better located warehouses. The Company expects to continue its review of expansion plans in its international operations, including the United Kingdom and Asia, along with other international markets. At present, the Company is planning to open three additional warehouses in the U.K during fiscal 2006. Costco Mexico plans to open two to three new warehouse clubs during fiscal 2006. Additional Equity Investments in Subsidiaries and Joint Ventures On June 30, 2005, the Company acquired the remaining 4% interest in CWC Travel Inc for $3,961, bringing Costcos ownership in this entity to 100%. In addition, during fiscal 2005 the Company contributed an additional $15,000 to its investment in Costco Mexico (a 50% owned joint venture), which did not impact its percentage ownership of this entity as the joint venture partner contributed a like amount. On October 3, 2003, the Company acquired from Carrefour Nederland B.V. its 20% equity interest in Costco Wholesale UK Limited for cash of $95,153, bringing Costcos ownership in Costco Wholesale UK Limited to 100%. Bank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs (all amounts stated in thousands of US dollars) The Company has a $500,000 commercial paper program supported by a $150,000 bank credit facility ($300,000 at August 29, 2004) with a group of nine banks, which expires on November 15, 2005, and is not expected to be renewed. At August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, no amounts were outstanding under the commercial paper program and no amounts were outstanding under the credit facility. Applicable interest rates on the credit facility at August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, were 3.92% and 1.90%, respectively. A wholly owned Canadian subsidiary has a $167,000 commercial paper program ($152,000 at August 29, 2004) supported by a $50,000 bank credit facility ($46,000 at August 29, 2004) with a Canadian bank, which is guaranteed by the Company and expires in March 2006. At August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, no amounts were outstanding under the Canadian commercial paper program or the bank credit facility. Applicable interest rates on the credit facility at August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, were 4.25% and 3.75%, respectively. At August 28, 2005, standby letters of credit totaling $23,000 issued under the bank credit facility left $27,000 available for commercial paper support. At August 29, 2004, standby letters of credit totaling $21,000 issued under the bank credit facility left $25,000 available for commercial paper support. The Company has agreed to limit the combined amount outstanding under the U.S. and Canadian commercial paper programs to the combined amounts of the supporting bank credit facilities, which are $177,000 at August 28, 2005, decreasing to $27,000 on November 15, 2005. At August 29, 2004, the combined amount of supporting bank credit facilities was $325,000. The Companys wholly owned Japanese subsidiary has a short term $13,694 bank line of credit that expires in February 2006. At August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, $5,477 and $0, respectively, were borrowed under the line of credit, and $3,652 and $2,576, respectively, were used to support standby letters of credit. A second 21 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) $13,694 bank line of credit was entered into in February 2005 that expires in February 2006. At August 28, 2005, $9,129 was borrowed under the second facility; this bank line was not in place at August 29, 2004. Applicable interest rates on the credit facilities at both August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, were .84%. The Companys Korean subsidiary has a short term $11,665 bank line of credit, which expires in January 2006. At August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, no amounts were borrowed under the line of credit and $1,668 and $0, respectively, were used to support standby letters of credit. Applicable interest rates on the credit facility at August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, were 4.51% and 4.52%, respectively. The Companys Taiwan subsidiary has a $7,439 bank revolving credit facility that expires in January 2006. At August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, no amounts were borrowed under the credit facility and $2,495 and $1,165, respectively, were used to support standby letters of credit. A second $15,499 bank revolving credit facility is in place, which expires in July 2006. At August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, no amounts were borrowed under the second credit facility and $790 and $738, respectively were used to support standby letters of credit. Applicable interest rates on the credit facilities at August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, were 3.75% and 3.50%, respectively. The Companys wholly owned United Kingdom subsidiary has a $108,408 bank revolving credit facility expiring in February 2007 and a $63,238 bank overdraft facility renewable on a yearly basis in March 2006. At August 28, 2005, $39,750 was outstanding under the revolving credit facility with an applicable interest rate of 5.30% and no amounts were outstanding under the bank overdraft facility. At August 29, 2004, $21,595 was outstanding under the revolving credit facility with an applicable interest rate of 5.285% and no amounts were outstanding under the bank overdraft facility. Letters of Credit The Company has letter of credit facilities (for commercial and standby letters of credit), totaling approximately $401,933. The outstanding commitments under these facilities at August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004 totaled approximately $131,169 and $166,800, respectively, including approximately $64,532 and $52,900, respectively, in standby letters of credit. Financing Activities The Companys 7 1/8% Senior Notes, carried at $304,350 at August 29, 2004, matured and were repaid on June 15, 2005 from its cash and cash equivalents. In April 2003, the Companys wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.92% in the aggregate amount of $36,516, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due on April 26, 2010. In March 2002, the Company issued $300,000 of 5 1/2% Senior Notes carried at $307,688 due March 15, 2007. Interest is payable semi annually. Simultaneous with the issuance of the Senior Notes, the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements converting the interest from fixed to floating. In February 1996, the Company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a shelf registration statement for $500,000 of senior debt securities. On October 23, 2001, additional debt securities of $100,000 were registered. The $300,000 of 5 1/2% Senior Notes issued in March 2002 reduced the amount of registered securities available for future issuance to $300,000. During fiscal 2005, $280,811 in principal amount of the Companys 3 1/2% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes were converted by note holders into 9,910,011 shares of common stock. 22 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Derivatives The Company has limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and uses them only to manage well defined interest rate and foreign exchange risks. Forward foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on inventory purchases and typically have very short terms. The aggregate amount of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, was $42,466 and $30,495, respectively. The majority of the forward foreign exchange contracts were entered into by the Companys wholly owned United Kingdom subsidiary, primarily to hedge U.S. dollar merchandise inventory purchases. The Company monitors its foreign currency exchange exposures to ensure the overall effectiveness of its foreign currency hedge positions. The only other derivative instruments the Company holds are interest rate swaps, which the Company uses to manage the interest rate risk associated with its borrowings and to manage the Companys mix of fixed rate and variable rate debt. As of August 28, 2005, the Company had fixed to floating interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $300,000 and an aggregate fair value of $7,688, which is recorded in other assets on the Companys consolidated balance sheet. These swaps were entered into effective March 25, 2002, and are designated and qualify as fair value hedges of the Companys $300,000 5 1/2% Senior Notes. As the terms of the swaps match those of the underlying hedged debt, the changes in the fair value of these swaps are offset by corresponding changes in the carrying amount of the hedged debt and result in no net earnings impact. As of August 29, 2004, the Company had fixed to floating interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $600,000 and an aggregate fair value of $25,754. In addition to the Companys swap on the 5 1/2% Senior Notes noted above, the Company had entered into a swap on its $300,000 7 1/8% Senior Notes effective November 13, 2001, which was designated and qualified as a fair value hedge. The $300,000 7 1/8% Senior Notes matured and were repaid on June 15, 2005. Concurrent to this transaction, the related swap agreement expired. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements With the exception of its operating leases, the Company has no off balance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on the Companys financial condition or consolidated financial statements. Stock Repurchase Program On November 30, 2001, the Companys Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program, authorizing the repurchase of up to $500,000 of Costco Common Stock through November 30, 2004. Under the program, the Company could repurchase shares at any time in the open market or in private transactions as market conditions warrant. The repurchased shares would be retired. On October 25, 2004, the Board of Directors renewed the program for another three years. On June 7, 2005 the Company began repurchasing shares on the open market. Through August 28, 2005 the Company has repurchased 9,205,100 shares of common stock at an average price of $44.89, totaling approximately $413,252, including commissions. Subsequent to the Companys fiscal 2005 year end, August 29, 2005, the Board of Directors of Costco authorized an additional stock repurchase program of up to $1,000,000 of Costco common stock. Under the program, which contains no expiration date, the Company may repurchase shares at any time in the open market or in private transactions as market conditions warrant. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the Companys financial statements requires that management make estimates and judgments that affect the financial position and results of operations. Management continues to review its accounting policies and evaluate its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, merchandise inventory, 23 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) impairment of long lived assets and warehouse closing costs and insurance/self insurance liabilities. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the present circumstances. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes sales, net of estimated returns, at the time customers take possession of merchandise or receive services. When the Company collects payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services, the amount received is recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed. The Company provides for estimated sales returns based on historical returns levels. The Company evaluates the criteria of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal Versus Net as an Agent, in determining whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, when Costco is the primary obligor, is subject to inventory risk, has latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, influence product or service specifications, or has several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded on a gross basis. If the Company is not the primary obligor and does not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above, Costco records the net amounts as commissions earned. Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market as determined primarily by the retail method of accounting and are stated using the last in, first out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail method of accounting and are stated using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. The Company believes the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. The Company records an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the expected annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end. At August 28, 2005, merchandise inventories valued at LIFO approximated FIFO after considering the lower of cost or market principle. At August 29, 2004, merchandise inventories valued using LIFO exceeded the comparable FIFO value by approximately $13,410 due to the aggregate effects of deflation. The Company provides for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts on the basis of a percentage of sales. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect the trend of the actual physical inventory count results, which generally occur in the second and fourth fiscal quarters of the Companys fiscal year. Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as the Company progresses towards earning those rebates provided they are probable and reasonably estimable. Other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of agreement, or other systematic and rational approach. Impairment of long lived assets and warehouse closing costs The Company periodically evaluates its long lived assets for indicators of impairment. Managements judgments are based on market and operational conditions at the present time. Future events could cause management to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring an adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value. 24 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) The Company provides estimates for warehouse closing costs, based on the applicable accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Future circumstances may result in the Companys actual future closing costs or the amount recognized upon the sale of the property to differ substantially from the original estimates. Insurance/Self Insurance Liabilities The Company uses a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms to provide for the potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property damage, director and officers liability, vehicle liability and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by the Company are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience and outside expertise, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In May 2005, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, a Replacement of Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 20 and FASB Statement No. 3. SFAS 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements for changes in accounting principles, unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change. SFAS 154 also requires that retrospective application of a change in accounting principle be limited to the direct effects of the change. Indirect effects of a change in accounting principle, such as a change in non discretionary profit sharing payments resulting from an accounting change, should be recognized in the period of the accounting change. SFAS 154 also requires that a change in depreciation, amortization, or depletion method for long lived, non financial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate effected by a change in accounting principle. SFAS 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. Early adoption is permitted for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after the date this Statement is issued. The Company is required to adopt the provisions of SFAS 154, as applicable, beginning in fiscal 2007. The Company does not believe the adoption of SFAS 154 will have a significant effect on its future consolidated financial statements. In March 2005, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, An Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143, which requires an entity to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation when incurred if the liabilitys fair value can be reasonably estimated. The Company adopted the provisions of FIN 47 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. The adoption of this Interpretation did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R, Share based Payments. SFAS 123R revises SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, which the Company adopted as of the beginning of its fiscal 2003, and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. SFAS 123R applies to transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services and also applies to liabilities an entity may incur for goods or services that are based on the fair value of those equity instruments. All employee stock option grants made by the Company since the beginning of fiscal 2003 have been expensed over the related option vesting period based on the fair value at the date the options are granted using the Black Scholes model. Under SFAS 123R, the Company will be required to select a valuation technique or option pricing model that meets the criteria as stated in the standard. Allowable valuation models include a binomial model and the Black Scholes model. The Company is required to adopt the provisions of SFAS 123R in the first quarter of its fiscal 2006. The Company is in the process of assessing the impact on the Companys results of operations from the adoption of SFAS 123R for its effect on prospective option grants. The adoption of SFAS 123R requires the Company to value stock options granted prior to its adoption of SFAS 123 under the fair value 25 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) method and expense these amounts in the income statement over the stock options remaining vesting period. This will result in the Company expensing $13,043 in fiscal 2006, which would previously have been presented in a proforma footnote disclosure. In addition, SFAS 123R will require the Company to reflect the tax savings resulting from tax deductions in excess of expense reflected in its financial statements as a financing cash flow, which will impact the Companys future reported cash flows from operating activities. In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, Inventory Costs An Amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin (ARB) No. 43, Chapter 4. SFAS 151 clarifies that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and spoilage should be expensed as incurred and not included in overhead. Further, SFAS 151 requires that allocation of fixed and production facilities overheads to conversion costs should be based on normal capacity of the production facilities. The provisions in this statement are effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005. The Company does not believe that the adoption of SFAS 151 will have a significant effect on its future consolidated financial statements. In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153, Exchanges of Non monetary Assets An Amendment of APB No. 29. The provisions of this statement are effective for non monetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005. This statement eliminates the exception to fair value for exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchange transactions that do not have commercial substance that is, transactions that are not expected to result in significant changes in the cash flows of the reporting entity. The Company does not believe that the adoption of SFAS 153 will have a significant effect on its future consolidated financial statements. In March 2004, the FASB EITF reached a consensus on EITF Issue No. 03 1, The Meaning of Other Than Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments, (EITF 03 1). The guidance prescribes a three step model for determining whether an investment is other than temporarily impaired and requires disclosures about unrealized losses on investments. The accounting guidance became effective for reporting periods beginning after June 15, 2004, while the disclosure requirements became effective for annual reporting periods ending after June 15, 2004. In September 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) EITF 03 1 1, Effective Date of Paragraphs 10 20 of EITF Issue No. 03 1 The Meaning of Other Than Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments, (FSP EITF 03 1 1). FSP EITF 03 1 1 delayed the effective date for the measurement and recognition guidance contained in paragraphs 10 20 of EITF Issue 03 1. In November 2005, the FASB issued FSP FAS 115 1 and FAS 124 1, The Meaning of Other Than Temporary Impairment and its Application to Certain Investments. This FSP addresses the determination as to when an investment is considered impaired, whether the impairment is other than temporary and the measurement of an impairment loss. This statement specifically nullifies the requirements of paragraph 10 18 of EITF 03 1 and references existing other than temporary impairment guidance. The guidance under this FSP is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2005 and the Company continued to apply relevant other than temporary guidance as provided for in FSP EITF 03 1 1 during fiscal 2005. The Company does not believe that the adoption of the guidance of FSP FAS 115 1 and FAS 124 1 will have a significant effect on its future consolidated financial statements. In November 2003, the EITF reached consensus on Issue No. 03 10, Application of Issue No. 02 16 by Resellers to Sales Incentives Offered to Consumers by Manufacturers, with respect to determining if consideration received by a reseller from a vendor that is reimbursed by the vendor for honoring the vendors sale incentives offered directly to consumers should be recorded as a reduction in sales. These rules apply to transactions entered into by consumers in fiscal periods beginning after November 25, 2003 and, therefore, apply to such transactions starting with the Companys fiscal third quarter of 2004, which began February 16, 2004. The adoption of EITF 03 10 did not affect the Companys consolidated gross profit or net income, but did result in a reduction of both net sales and merchandise costs by an equal amount. Had the first half of fiscal 2004 and all of fiscal 2003 been reported under EITF 03 10 guidance, the sales and cost of sales would have been reduced by approximately $186,900 and $282,300, respectively. 26 Table of Contents Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company is exposed to financial market risk resulting from changes in interest and foreign currency rates. As a policy, the Company does not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions, nor hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. The nature and amount of the Companys long and short term debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As of August 28, 2005, the Companys fixed rate long term debt includes its $415,246 principal amount at maturity Zero Coupon Subordinated Notes carried at $274,071 and additional notes and capital lease obligations totaling $132,141. The Companys debt also includes $300,000 5 1/2% Senior Notes carried at $307,688. The Company has entered into fixed to floating interest rate swaps on the Senior Notes, effectively converting these fixed interest rate securities to variable rate securities. As of August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, the Company had fixed to floating interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $300,000 and $600,000, respectively, and an aggregate fair value of $7,688 and $25,754, respectively. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt and may affect the interest expense related to the variable rate debt. The Company holds interest bearing instruments that are classified as cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. The Companys investment policy is to manage its total cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances to preserve principal and liquidity while maximizing the return on the investment portfolio through the full investment of available funds. The Company diversifies its investment portfolio by investing in multiple types of investment grade securities and through internal management and the use of third party investment managers. Short term investments generally have a maturity of three months to five years from the purchase date. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. As the majority of these instruments are of a short term nature, if interest rates were to increase or decrease immediately, there is no material risk of a valuation adjustment related to these instruments. For those instruments that are classified as available for sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in interest rates are reflected in other accumulated comprehensive income or loss. Based on the Companys cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances at August 28, 2005, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $15,000 to interest income (pre tax) on an annual basis. Most foreign currency transactions have been conducted in local currencies, limiting the Companys exposure to changes in currency rates. The Company periodically enters into short term forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates on inventory purchases.

Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) SELECTED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME DATA The table below presents selected operational data, the percentage relationship between net sales and major categories in the Consolidated Statements of Income and the percentage change in the dollar amounts of each of the items. Percent of Net Sales Percentage Increase/(Decrease)(of dollar amounts) Fiscal 2005 Fiscal 2004 Fiscal 2003 Fiscal 2005vs. Fiscal 2004 Fiscal 2004vs. Fiscal 2003 Net sales 100.00 % 100.00 % 100.00 % 10.0 % 13.1 % Membership fees 2.07 2.04 2.05 11.6 12.7 Gross margin(a) 10.63 10.72 10.69 9.1 13.4 Selling, general and administrative expenses 9.73 9.75 9.83 9.7 12.2 Preopening expenses 0.10 0.07 0.09 74.8 (16.9 ) Provision for impaired assets and closing costs, net 0.03 0.05 1539.3 (94.9 ) Operating income 2.84 2.94 2.77 6.4 19.8 Interest expense (0.06 ) (0.08 ) (0.08 ) (6.0 ) (0.7 ) Interest income and other 0.21 0.11 0.09 111.3 34.0 Income before income taxes 2.99 2.97 2.78 10.6 20.9 Provision for income taxes 0.94 1.10 1.05 (6.2 ) 18.5 Net Income 2.05 % 1.87 % 1.73 % 20.5 % 22.4 % (a) Defined as net sales less merchandise costs. Comparison of Fiscal 2005 (52 weeks) and Fiscal 2004 (52 weeks): (dollars in thousands, except earnings per share) Net Income Net income for fiscal 2005 increased 20.5% to $1,063,092, or $2.18 per diluted share, from $882,393, or $1.85 per diluted share, during fiscal year 2004. Net income during fiscal 2005 was impacted by the following: a $54,155 (approximately $.11 per diluted share) income tax benefit resulting primarily from the settlement of a transfer pricing dispute between the United States and Canada (covering the years 1996 2003); a cumulative pre tax, non cash charge to preopening expenses of $15,999 (approximately $.02 per diluted share) related to a correction to the Companys method of accounting for ground leases (entered into over the past twenty years) that did not require rental payments during the period of construction; and a net tax benefit with respect to excess foreign tax credits on unremitted foreign earnings recorded in the fourth quarter of $20,592 (approximately $.04 per diluted share). Exclusive of these items, net income for fiscal 2005 would have been $998,326 or $2.04 per diluted share, a 10% increase in earnings per share over the prior fiscal year. Net Sales Net sales increased 10.0% to $51,862,072 in fiscal 2005 from $47,145,712 in fiscal 2004. Approximately 71% of the increase was due to an increase in comparable warehouse sales, that is sales in warehouses open for at least a year. The balance of the increase was due to opening 16 new warehouses during fiscal 2005 and 20 new warehouses during fiscal 2004, a portion of which is not included in comparable warehouse sales. Net sales were reduced by the implementation of Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 03 10, Application of Issue No. 02 16, Accounting by a Customer (Including a Reseller) for Certain Consideration Received from a 14 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Vendor, by Resellers to Sales Incentives Offered to Consumers by Manufacturers, which was effective at the beginning of the Companys fiscal 2004 third quarter. EITF 03 10, which primarily impacts the Companys vendor coupon programs, reduces net sales and merchandise costs by an equal amount and does not affect the Companys consolidated gross margin or net income. Had EITF 03 10 been in effect for the comparable periods in fiscal 2004, the net sales increase in fiscal 2005 would have been 10.4%. (See Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements, EITF 03 10.) For fiscal 2005, comparable sales increased 7% from fiscal 2004. Had EITF 03 10 been in effect for the comparable periods in fiscal 2004, the comparable sales increase for fiscal 2005 would have been 8%. Changes in prices of merchandise did not materially affect the sales increases, with the exception of gasoline, where price increases accounted for approximately 89 basis points of the sales increase. In addition, translation of foreign sales into U.S. dollars contributed to the increase in sales due to stronger foreign currencies, accounting for approximately 134 basis points year over year of the comparable sales increase. Membership Fees Membership fees increased 11.6% to $1,073,156, or 2.07% of net sales, in fiscal 2005 from $961,280, or 2.04% of net sales, in fiscal 2004. This increase was primarily due to additional membership sign ups at the 16 new warehouses opened in fiscal 2005, increased penetration of the Companys Executive membership and high overall member renewal rates consistent with recent years, currently 86%. Gross Margin Gross margin increased 9.1% to $5,515,111, or 10.63% of net sales, in fiscal 2005 from $5,053,696, or 10.72% of net sales, in fiscal 2004. The nine basis point decrease in gross margin as a percentage of net sales reflected a decrease of three basis points in gross margin in the Companys merchandise departments. The three basis point decrease in merchandising is largely due to changes in the sales mix, with higher penetration of lower margin departments. This effect was offset by gross margin gains in most of the Companys merchandise departments, as well as the international operations. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales was positively impacted by five basis points due to the implementation of EITF 03 10, whereby net sales and merchandise costs were reduced equally. The gross margin percentage was reduced by 10 basis points due to the increased penetration of the Executive Member program, increased spending by Executive Members and the resulting increases in the related costs. The gross margin figures reflect accounting for most U.S. merchandise inventories on the last in, first out (LIFO) method. Fiscal 2005 included a $13,410 LIFO charge (increase in merchandise costs), while fiscal 2004 included a $6,090 LIFO charge. The impact of the LIFO adjustment on a year over year basis negatively impacted gross margin, as a percentage of sales, by one additional basis point. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 9.7% to $5,044,341, or 9.73% of net sales, in fiscal 2005, from $4,597,877, or 9.75% of net sales, in fiscal 2004. Had EITF 03 10 been in effect for all of fiscal 2004, SG&A expenses as a percent to net sales would have shown additional improvement of four basis points in fiscal 2005. For fiscal 2005, warehouse and central operating costs positively impacted SG&A comparisons year over year by approximately 13 basis points, primarily due to improved payroll utilization at the warehouse level, including increased leverage from increased comparable sales and cost control measures employed in employee 15 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) benefits, primarily health care. This improvement was partially offset by the implementation of EITF 03 10, which negatively impacted SG&A as a percentage of net sales by five basis points and an increase in stock based compensation costs approximating six basis points year over year. Preopening Expenses Preopening expenses totaled $53,230, or 0.10% of net sales, during fiscal 2005 compared to $30,451, or 0.07% of net sales, during fiscal 2004. During the second quarter of fiscal 2005, in response to the Securities and Exchange Commissions February 7, 2005 letter related to leases, the Company adjusted its method of accounting for leases (entered into over the past twenty years), primarily related to ground leases at certain warehouse locations that did not require rental payments during the period of construction. As a result, the Company recorded a cumulative pre tax, non cash charge of $15,999 to preopening expense in the second quarter of fiscal 2005 to effect this accounting adjustment. Prior periods financial results have not been restated due to the immateriality of this amount to the consolidated financial statements. Twenty one warehouses (including five relocations) were opened in fiscal 2005 compared to the opening of 20 warehouses in fiscal 2004. Pre opening expenses also include costs related to remodels and expanded ancillary operations at existing warehouses. Provision for Impaired Assets and Closing Costs, net The net provision for impaired assets and closing costs was $16,393 in fiscal 2005, compared to $1,000 in fiscal 2004. The provision includes costs related to impairment of long lived assets, future lease obligations of warehouses that have been relocated to new facilities, and any losses or gains resulting from the sale of real property. The provision for fiscal 2005 included charges of $3,893 for impairment of long lived assets, $11,619 for warehouse closing expenses and $881 for net losses on the sale of real property. The provision for fiscal 2004 included charges of $16,548 for warehouse closing expenses that were offset by gains of $15,548 on the sale of real property. At August 28, 2005, the reserve for warehouse closing costs was $9,556, of which $9,118 related to future lease obligations. This compares to a reserve for warehouse closing costs of $10,367 at August 29, 2004, of which $9,184 related to future lease obligations. Interest Expense Interest expense totaled $34,437 in fiscal 2005, compared to $36,651 in fiscal 2004. Interest expense in both fiscal 2005 and 2004 includes interest on the 3 1/2% Zero Coupon Notes, 7 1/8% and 5 1/2% Senior Notes and on balances outstanding under the Companys bank credit facilities and promissory notes. The decrease was primarily a result of a decrease in interest on the Companys 3 1/2% Zero Coupon Notes as note holders converted approximately $280,811 in principle amount of the Notes into common stock during fiscal 2005. Additionally, capitalized interest increased year over year as interest rates and construction costs increased in fiscal 2005 over fiscal 2004. These decreases were partially offset by increases in interest on the Senior Notes as these fixed rate instruments were swapped into variable rate debt in November 2001 and March 2002, which was mitigated by the fact that the 7 1/8% Senior Notes matured and were repaid on June 15, 2005. Interest Income and Other Interest income and other totaled $109,096 in fiscal 2005, compared to $51,627 in fiscal 2004. The increase primarily reflects increased interest income resulting from higher cash and cash equivalents balances and short term investments on hand throughout fiscal 2005, as well as higher interest rates earned on the balances as compared to fiscal 2004. 16 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Provision for Income Taxes The effective income tax rate on earnings was 31.4% in fiscal 2005 and 37% in fiscal 2004. The decrease in the effective income tax rate is attributable to a one time $54,155 income tax benefit resulting primarily from the settlement of a transfer pricing dispute between the United States and Canada (covering the years 1996 2003) and a net tax benefit on excess foreign tax credits on unremitted foreign earnings of $20,592. Excluding these benefits the effective income tax rate on earnings in fiscal 2005 was 36.2%. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 and 2004, the effective tax rate was 28.9% and 37.0%, respectively. The decrease in the fourth quarter tax rate for fiscal 2005 is primarily attributable to the net tax benefit of $20,592, noted above, and a tax benefit of $13,895 primarily associated with lower state taxes. The state tax benefit recorded in the fourth quarter was primarily due to a reduction in the estimated effective state tax rate utilized in the first through third quarters of fiscal 2005. Excluding the benefit of these two items, the fourth quarter tax rate for fiscal 2005 would be 35.8%. Comparison of Fiscal 2004 (52 weeks) and Fiscal 2003 (52 weeks): (dollars in thousands, except earnings per share) Net Income Net income for fiscal 2004 increased 22.4% to $882,393, or $1.85 per diluted share, from $721,000, or $1.53 per diluted share during fiscal year 2003. Net Sales Net sales increased 13.1% to $47,145,712 in fiscal 2004 from $41,692,699 in fiscal 2003. Approximately 78% of the increase was due to an increase in comparable warehouse sales, that is sales in warehouses open for at least a year. The balance of the increase was due to opening 20 new warehouses during fiscal 2004 and a net of 23 new warehouses (29 opened, 6 closed) during fiscal 2003, a portion of which is not included in comparable warehouse sales. Net sales were reduced by the implementation of Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 03 10, Application of Issue No. 02 16, Accounting by a Customer (Including a Reseller) for Certain Consideration Received from a Vendor, by Resellers to Sales Incentives Offered to Consumers by Manufacturers, which was effective at the beginning of the Companys fiscal 2004 third quarter. EITF 03 10, which primarily impacts the Companys vendor coupon programs, reduces net sales and merchandise costs by an equal amount and does not affect the Companys consolidated gross margin or net income. Had EITF 03 10 been in effect for the comparable periods in fiscal 2003, the net sales increase in fiscal 2004 would have been 13.8%. (See Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements, EITF 03 10.) For fiscal 2004, comparable sales increased 10% from fiscal 2003. Had EITF 03 10 been in effect for the comparable periods in fiscal 2003, the comparable sales increase for fiscal 2004 would have been 11%. Changes in prices of merchandise did not materially affect the sales increases, with the exception of gasoline, where price increases accounted for a sales increase of approximately 70 basis points. In addition, due to the weaker U.S. dollar throughout fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003, translation of foreign sales into U.S. dollars contributed to the increase in sales, accounting for a comparable sales increase of approximately 190 basis points year over year. Sales were also positively impacted by the supermarket strikes in Southern California during the first half of the Companys 2004 fiscal year. The positive impact to sales for the entire fiscal year was estimated to be 35 to 50 basis points. 17 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Membership Fees Membership fees increased 12.7% to $961,280, or 2.04% of net sales, in fiscal 2004 from $852,853, or 2.05% of net sales, in fiscal 2003. This increase was primarily due to additional membership sign ups at the 20 new warehouses opened in fiscal 2004; increased penetration of the Companys Executive membership, including the rollout of the program into Canada, which began in the first quarter of fiscal 2004; and high overall member renewal rates consistent with recent years, currently at 86%. Gross Margin Gross margin increased 13.4% to $5,053,696, or 10.72% of net sales, in fiscal 2004 from $4,457,316, or 10.69% of net sales, in fiscal 2003. The three basis point increase, as a percent of net sales, reflected a 14 basis point increase in gross margin in the Companys merchandise departments, helped by strong year over year gross margin gains in the Companys ancillary business operations, particularly gasoline and pharmacy. Year over year gross margin, as a percentage of net sales, was also positively impacted by the implementation of EITF 03 10, whereby net sales and merchandise costs were reduced, resulting in an eight basis point increase. The year over year gross margin percentage was reduced by 12 basis points due to the increased rewards related to the Executive Membership Two Percent Reward Program, resulting from an increase in the penetration of the Executive Member program. The gross margin figures reflect accounting for most U.S. merchandise inventories on the LIFO method. Fiscal 2004 included a $6,090 LIFO charge (increase in merchandise costs), while fiscal 2003 included a $19,650 LIFO credit (reduction in merchandise costs). The impact of the LIFO adjustment on a year over year basis negatively impacted margin by an additional six basis points. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses as a percent of net sales decreased to 9.75% during fiscal 2004 from 9.83% during fiscal 2003. Had EITF 03 10 been in effect in fiscal 2003, SG&A expenses as a percent to net sales would have shown additional improvement of seven basis points in fiscal 2004. For fiscal 2004, warehouse and central operating costs positively impacted SG&A comparisons year over year by approximately 21 basis points, primarily due to increased expense leverage of warehouse payroll, benefits (primarily health care), utility and workers compensation costs. During the latter half of fiscal 2004, the Company implemented changes to its employee healthcare plans that reduced its overall healthcare costs, primarily in the fourth quarter. This improvement was partially offset by the seven basis point increase resulting from the adoption of EITF 03 10, a two basis point increase in expense related to the establishment of additional insurance liabilities resulting from financial difficulties being experienced by one of the Companys third party insurance providers, and an increase in stock based compensation costs following the Companys prospective adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, at the beginning of fiscal 2003, of four basis points. Preopening Expenses Preopening expenses totaled $30,451, or 0.07% of net sales, during fiscal 2004 compared to $36,643, or 0.09% of net sales, during fiscal 2003. This reduction was due to fewer warehouse openings. During fiscal 2004, the Company opened 20 new warehouses compared to 29 new warehouses (including 5 relocations) during fiscal 2003. Pre opening expenses also include costs related to remodels and expanded ancillary operations at existing warehouses. 18 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Provision for Impaired Assets and Closing Costs, net The net provision for impaired assets and closing costs was $1,000 in fiscal 2004, compared to $19,500 in fiscal 2003. The provision includes costs related to impairment of long lived assets, future lease obligations of warehouses that have been relocated to new facilities, and losses or gains resulting from the sale of real property. The provision for fiscal 2004 included charges of $16,548 for warehouse closing expenses that were offset by gains of $15,548 on the sale of real property. The provision for fiscal 2003 included charges of $11,836 for warehouse closing expenses, $4,697 for impairment of long lived assets and $2,967 for net losses on the sale of real property. At August 29, 2004, the reserve for warehouse closing costs was $10,367, of which $9,184 related to future lease obligations. This compares to a reserve for warehouse closing costs of $8,609 at August 31, 2003, of which $7,833 related to future lease obligations. Interest Expense Interest expense totaled $36,651 in fiscal 2004, compared to $36,920 in fiscal 2003. Interest expense in both fiscal 2004 and 2003 includes interest on the 3 1/2% Zero Coupon Notes, 7 1/8% and 5 1/2% Senior Notes and on balances outstanding under the Companys bank credit facilities and promissory notes. The decrease was primarily a result of the Companys reduction in short term borrowings, principally related to its foreign subsidiaries. This decrease was substantially offset by increases in interest rates on the Senior Notes due to interest rate swap agreements converting the interest rate from fixed to floating. Interest Income and Other Interest income and other totaled $51,627 in fiscal 2004, compared to $38,525 in fiscal 2003. The increase primarily reflects greater interest earned on higher cash and cash equivalents balances and short term investments. In addition, a reduction in the expense to record minority interest in the earnings of foreign subsidiaries was reported in fiscal 2004 as the Company increased its ownership in Costco Wholesale UK Limited to 100%. Provision for Income Taxes The effective income tax rate on earnings was 37% in fiscal 2004 and 37.75% in fiscal 2003. The decrease in the effective income tax rate is primarily attributable to lower statutory income tax rates for foreign operations and one time benefits associated with certain tax planning strategies. Liquidity and Capital Resources (dollars in thousands, except per share amounts) Cash Flows The Companys primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from warehouse operations and our existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances, which were $3,459,857 and $3,129,882 at August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, respectively. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $1,783,177 in fiscal 2005 compared to $2,098,783 in fiscal 2004, a decrease of $315,606. Higher net income and a decrease in net merchandise inventories (merchandise inventory less accounts payable) year over year increased cash flow from operating activities by $391,571. This increase was offset by decreases in cash flow from operating assets and liabilities of $706,855, primarily relating to the timing in the collection of certain receivables and in payments of income taxes in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004. A significant component of net cash used in investing activities continues to be the purchase of property and equipment related to the Companys warehouse expansion and remodel projects. Net cash used in investing activities totaled $2,058,729 in fiscal 2005 compared to $1,048,481 in fiscal 2004, an increase of $1,010,248. The increase in investing activities primarily relates to an increase in the net investment in short term investments of $768,596 and an increase in additions to property and equipment of $289,811 in fiscal 2005 over fiscal 2004. 19 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Net cash used in financing activities totaled $518,651 in fiscal 2005 compared to $209,569 provided by financing activities in fiscal 2004. The decrease of $728,220 primarily resulted from an increase in the repayment of debt of $297,275 primarily relating to the repayment of the 7 1/8% Senior Notes, which matured on June 15, 2005, and repurchases of common stock of $413,252 under the Companys $500,000 share repurchase program. Dividends Costcos Board of Directors declared four quarterly cash dividends during fiscal year 2005. The first two dividends of $0.10 per share were paid November 26, 2004 and February 25, 2005, to shareholders of record at the close of business on November 5, 2004 and February 8, 2005, respectively. The third and fourth dividends of $0.115 per share were paid May 27, 2005 and August 26, 2005 to shareholders of record at the close of business on May 6, 2005 and August 5, 2005, respectively. In fiscal 2004 the Company paid dividends of $0.10 per share in the third and fourth quarters. Contractual Obligations The Companys commitment to make future payments under contractual obligations was as follows, as of August 28, 2005. Payments Due by Period Contractual obligations  Total Less than1 year 1 to 3years 4 to 5years After5 years Long term debt(1)(2) $ 879,520 $ 18,064 $ 379,466 $ 65,437 $ 416,553 Capital lease obligations 6,591 3,225 1,305 927 1,134 Operating leases(3) 1,562,267 114,682 219,402 189,188 1,038,995 Purchase obligations (merchandise)(4) 3,049,398 3,048,785 613 Purchase obligations (building, equipment, services and other)(5) 242,361 230,086 12,275 Other(6) 8,591 1,354 1,692 1,362 4,183 Total $ 5,748,728 $ 3,416,196 $ 614,753 $ 256,914 $ 1,460,865 (1) Amounts include contractual interest payments.

(4) Includes open merchandise purchase orders at fiscal year end. (5) The amounts exclude minor outsourced services negotiated at the individual warehouse level that are not significant and generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty. (6) Consists of asset retirement and deferred compensation obligations. Expansion Plans Costcos primary requirement for capital is the financing of the land, building and equipment costs for new warehouses plus the costs of initial warehouse operations and working capital requirements, as well as additional capital for international expansion. 20 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) While there can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized, and plans are subject to change upon further review, it is managements current intention to spend approximately $1,100,000 to $1,250,000 during fiscal 2006 in the United States and Canada for real estate, construction, remodeling and equipment for warehouse clubs and related operations; and approximately $100,000 to $150,000 for international expansion, including the United Kingdom, Asia, Mexico and other potential ventures. These expenditures are expected to be financed with a combination of cash provided from operations and the use of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. Expansion plans for the United States and Canada during fiscal 2006 are to open approximately 28 30 new warehouse clubs on a net basis, inclusive of two to three relocations to larger and better located warehouses. The Company expects to continue its review of expansion plans in its international operations, including the United Kingdom and Asia, along with other international markets. At present, the Company is planning to open three additional warehouses in the U.K during fiscal 2006. Costco Mexico plans to open two to three new warehouse clubs during fiscal 2006. Additional Equity Investments in Subsidiaries and Joint Ventures On June 30, 2005, the Company acquired the remaining 4% interest in CWC Travel Inc for $3,961, bringing Costcos ownership in this entity to 100%. In addition, during fiscal 2005 the Company contributed an additional $15,000 to its investment in Costco Mexico (a 50% owned joint venture), which did not impact its percentage ownership of this entity as the joint venture partner contributed a like amount. On October 3, 2003, the Company acquired from Carrefour Nederland B.V. its 20% equity interest in Costco Wholesale UK Limited for cash of $95,153, bringing Costcos ownership in Costco Wholesale UK Limited to 100%. Bank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs (all amounts stated in thousands of US dollars) The Company has a $500,000 commercial paper program supported by a $150,000 bank credit facility ($300,000 at August 29, 2004) with a group of nine banks, which expires on November 15, 2005, and is not expected to be renewed. At August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, no amounts were outstanding under the commercial paper program and no amounts were outstanding under the credit facility. Applicable interest rates on the credit facility at August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, were 3.92% and 1.90%, respectively. A wholly owned Canadian subsidiary has a $167,000 commercial paper program ($152,000 at August 29, 2004) supported by a $50,000 bank credit facility ($46,000 at August 29, 2004) with a Canadian bank, which is guaranteed by the Company and expires in March 2006. At August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, no amounts were outstanding under the Canadian commercial paper program or the bank credit facility. Applicable interest rates on the credit facility at August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, were 4.25% and 3.75%, respectively. At August 28, 2005, standby letters of credit totaling $23,000 issued under the bank credit facility left $27,000 available for commercial paper support. At August 29, 2004, standby letters of credit totaling $21,000 issued under the bank credit facility left $25,000 available for commercial paper support. The Company has agreed to limit the combined amount outstanding under the U.S. and Canadian commercial paper programs to the combined amounts of the supporting bank credit facilities, which are $177,000 at August 28, 2005, decreasing to $27,000 on November 15, 2005. At August 29, 2004, the combined amount of supporting bank credit facilities was $325,000. The Companys wholly owned Japanese subsidiary has a short term $13,694 bank line of credit that expires in February 2006. At August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, $5,477 and $0, respectively, were borrowed under the line of credit, and $3,652 and $2,576, respectively, were used to support standby letters of credit. A second 21 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) $13,694 bank line of credit was entered into in February 2005 that expires in February 2006. At August 28, 2005, $9,129 was borrowed under the second facility; this bank line was not in place at August 29, 2004. Applicable interest rates on the credit facilities at both August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, were .84%. The Companys Korean subsidiary has a short term $11,665 bank line of credit, which expires in January 2006. At August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, no amounts were borrowed under the line of credit and $1,668 and $0, respectively, were used to support standby letters of credit. Applicable interest rates on the credit facility at August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, were 4.51% and 4.52%, respectively. The Companys Taiwan subsidiary has a $7,439 bank revolving credit facility that expires in January 2006. At August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, no amounts were borrowed under the credit facility and $2,495 and $1,165, respectively, were used to support standby letters of credit. A second $15,499 bank revolving credit facility is in place, which expires in July 2006. At August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, no amounts were borrowed under the second credit facility and $790 and $738, respectively were used to support standby letters of credit. Applicable interest rates on the credit facilities at August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, were 3.75% and 3.50%, respectively. The Companys wholly owned United Kingdom subsidiary has a $108,408 bank revolving credit facility expiring in February 2007 and a $63,238 bank overdraft facility renewable on a yearly basis in March 2006. At August 28, 2005, $39,750 was outstanding under the revolving credit facility with an applicable interest rate of 5.30% and no amounts were outstanding under the bank overdraft facility. At August 29, 2004, $21,595 was outstanding under the revolving credit facility with an applicable interest rate of 5.285% and no amounts were outstanding under the bank overdraft facility. Letters of Credit The Company has letter of credit facilities (for commercial and standby letters of credit), totaling approximately $401,933. The outstanding commitments under these facilities at August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004 totaled approximately $131,169 and $166,800, respectively, including approximately $64,532 and $52,900, respectively, in standby letters of credit. Financing Activities The Companys 7 1/8% Senior Notes, carried at $304,350 at August 29, 2004, matured and were repaid on June 15, 2005 from its cash and cash equivalents. In April 2003, the Companys wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.92% in the aggregate amount of $36,516, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due on April 26, 2010. In March 2002, the Company issued $300,000 of 5 1/2% Senior Notes carried at $307,688 due March 15, 2007. Interest is payable semi annually. Simultaneous with the issuance of the Senior Notes, the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements converting the interest from fixed to floating. In February 1996, the Company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a shelf registration statement for $500,000 of senior debt securities. On October 23, 2001, additional debt securities of $100,000 were registered. The $300,000 of 5 1/2% Senior Notes issued in March 2002 reduced the amount of registered securities available for future issuance to $300,000. During fiscal 2005, $280,811 in principal amount of the Companys 3 1/2% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes were converted by note holders into 9,910,011 shares of common stock. 22 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Derivatives The Company has limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and uses them only to manage well defined interest rate and foreign exchange risks. Forward foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on inventory purchases and typically have very short terms. The aggregate amount of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, was $42,466 and $30,495, respectively. The majority of the forward foreign exchange contracts were entered into by the Companys wholly owned United Kingdom subsidiary, primarily to hedge U.S. dollar merchandise inventory purchases. The Company monitors its foreign currency exchange exposures to ensure the overall effectiveness of its foreign currency hedge positions. The only other derivative instruments the Company holds are interest rate swaps, which the Company uses to manage the interest rate risk associated with its borrowings and to manage the Companys mix of fixed rate and variable rate debt. As of August 28, 2005, the Company had fixed to floating interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $300,000 and an aggregate fair value of $7,688, which is recorded in other assets on the Companys consolidated balance sheet. These swaps were entered into effective March 25, 2002, and are designated and qualify as fair value hedges of the Companys $300,000 5 1/2% Senior Notes. As the terms of the swaps match those of the underlying hedged debt, the changes in the fair value of these swaps are offset by corresponding changes in the carrying amount of the hedged debt and result in no net earnings impact. As of August 29, 2004, the Company had fixed to floating interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $600,000 and an aggregate fair value of $25,754. In addition to the Companys swap on the 5 1/2% Senior Notes noted above, the Company had entered into a swap on its $300,000 7 1/8% Senior Notes effective November 13, 2001, which was designated and qualified as a fair value hedge. The $300,000 7 1/8% Senior Notes matured and were repaid on June 15, 2005. Concurrent to this transaction, the related swap agreement expired. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements With the exception of its operating leases, the Company has no off balance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on the Companys financial condition or consolidated financial statements. Stock Repurchase Program On November 30, 2001, the Companys Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program, authorizing the repurchase of up to $500,000 of Costco Common Stock through November 30, 2004. Under the program, the Company could repurchase shares at any time in the open market or in private transactions as market conditions warrant. The repurchased shares would be retired. On October 25, 2004, the Board of Directors renewed the program for another three years. On June 7, 2005 the Company began repurchasing shares on the open market. Through August 28, 2005 the Company has repurchased 9,205,100 shares of common stock at an average price of $44.89, totaling approximately $413,252, including commissions. Subsequent to the Companys fiscal 2005 year end, August 29, 2005, the Board of Directors of Costco authorized an additional stock repurchase program of up to $1,000,000 of Costco common stock. Under the program, which contains no expiration date, the Company may repurchase shares at any time in the open market or in private transactions as market conditions warrant. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the Companys financial statements requires that management make estimates and judgments that affect the financial position and results of operations. Management continues to review its accounting policies and evaluate its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, merchandise inventory, 23 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) impairment of long lived assets and warehouse closing costs and insurance/self insurance liabilities. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the present circumstances. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes sales, net of estimated returns, at the time customers take possession of merchandise or receive services. When the Company collects payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services, the amount received is recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed. The Company provides for estimated sales returns based on historical returns levels. The Company evaluates the criteria of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal Versus Net as an Agent, in determining whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, when Costco is the primary obligor, is subject to inventory risk, has latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, influence product or service specifications, or has several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded on a gross basis. If the Company is not the primary obligor and does not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above, Costco records the net amounts as commissions earned. Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market as determined primarily by the retail method of accounting and are stated using the last in, first out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail method of accounting and are stated using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. The Company believes the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. The Company records an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the expected annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end. At August 28, 2005, merchandise inventories valued at LIFO approximated FIFO after considering the lower of cost or market principle. At August 29, 2004, merchandise inventories valued using LIFO exceeded the comparable FIFO value by approximately $13,410 due to the aggregate effects of deflation. The Company provides for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts on the basis of a percentage of sales. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect the trend of the actual physical inventory count results, which generally occur in the second and fourth fiscal quarters of the Companys fiscal year. Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as the Company progresses towards earning those rebates provided they are probable and reasonably estimable. Other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of agreement, or other systematic and rational approach. Impairment of long lived assets and warehouse closing costs The Company periodically evaluates its long lived assets for indicators of impairment. Managements judgments are based on market and operational conditions at the present time. Future events could cause management to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring an adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value. 24 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) The Company provides estimates for warehouse closing costs, based on the applicable accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Future circumstances may result in the Companys actual future closing costs or the amount recognized upon the sale of the property to differ substantially from the original estimates. Insurance/Self Insurance Liabilities The Company uses a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms to provide for the potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property damage, director and officers liability, vehicle liability and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by the Company are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience and outside expertise, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In May 2005, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, a Replacement of Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 20 and FASB Statement No. 3. SFAS 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements for changes in accounting principles, unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change. SFAS 154 also requires that retrospective application of a change in accounting principle be limited to the direct effects of the change. Indirect effects of a change in accounting principle, such as a change in non discretionary profit sharing payments resulting from an accounting change, should be recognized in the period of the accounting change. SFAS 154 also requires that a change in depreciation, amortization, or depletion method for long lived, non financial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate effected by a change in accounting principle. SFAS 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. Early adoption is permitted for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after the date this Statement is issued. The Company is required to adopt the provisions of SFAS 154, as applicable, beginning in fiscal 2007. The Company does not believe the adoption of SFAS 154 will have a significant effect on its future consolidated financial statements. In March 2005, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, An Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143, which requires an entity to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation when incurred if the liabilitys fair value can be reasonably estimated. The Company adopted the provisions of FIN 47 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. The adoption of this Interpretation did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R, Share based Payments. SFAS 123R revises SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, which the Company adopted as of the beginning of its fiscal 2003, and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. SFAS 123R applies to transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services and also applies to liabilities an entity may incur for goods or services that are based on the fair value of those equity instruments. All employee stock option grants made by the Company since the beginning of fiscal 2003 have been expensed over the related option vesting period based on the fair value at the date the options are granted using the Black Scholes model. Under SFAS 123R, the Company will be required to select a valuation technique or option pricing model that meets the criteria as stated in the standard. Allowable valuation models include a binomial model and the Black Scholes model. The Company is required to adopt the provisions of SFAS 123R in the first quarter of its fiscal 2006. The Company is in the process of assessing the impact on the Companys results of operations from the adoption of SFAS 123R for its effect on prospective option grants. The adoption of SFAS 123R requires the Company to value stock options granted prior to its adoption of SFAS 123 under the fair value 25 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) method and expense these amounts in the income statement over the stock options remaining vesting period. This will result in the Company expensing $13,043 in fiscal 2006, which would previously have been presented in a proforma footnote disclosure. In addition, SFAS 123R will require the Company to reflect the tax savings resulting from tax deductions in excess of expense reflected in its financial statements as a financing cash flow, which will impact the Companys future reported cash flows from operating activities. In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, Inventory Costs An Amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin (ARB) No. 43, Chapter 4. SFAS 151 clarifies that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and spoilage should be expensed as incurred and not included in overhead. Further, SFAS 151 requires that allocation of fixed and production facilities overheads to conversion costs should be based on normal capacity of the production facilities. The provisions in this statement are effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005. The Company does not believe that the adoption of SFAS 151 will have a significant effect on its future consolidated financial statements. In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153, Exchanges of Non monetary Assets An Amendment of APB No. 29. The provisions of this statement are effective for non monetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005. This statement eliminates the exception to fair value for exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchange transactions that do not have commercial substance that is, transactions that are not expected to result in significant changes in the cash flows of the reporting entity. The Company does not believe that the adoption of SFAS 153 will have a significant effect on its future consolidated financial statements. In March 2004, the FASB EITF reached a consensus on EITF Issue No. 03 1, The Meaning of Other Than Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments, (EITF 03 1). The guidance prescribes a three step model for determining whether an investment is other than temporarily impaired and requires disclosures about unrealized losses on investments. The accounting guidance became effective for reporting periods beginning after June 15, 2004, while the disclosure requirements became effective for annual reporting periods ending after June 15, 2004. In September 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) EITF 03 1 1, Effective Date of Paragraphs 10 20 of EITF Issue No. 03 1 The Meaning of Other Than Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments, (FSP EITF 03 1 1). FSP EITF 03 1 1 delayed the effective date for the measurement and recognition guidance contained in paragraphs 10 20 of EITF Issue 03 1. In November 2005, the FASB issued FSP FAS 115 1 and FAS 124 1, The Meaning of Other Than Temporary Impairment and its Application to Certain Investments. This FSP addresses the determination as to when an investment is considered impaired, whether the impairment is other than temporary and the measurement of an impairment loss. This statement specifically nullifies the requirements of paragraph 10 18 of EITF 03 1 and references existing other than temporary impairment guidance. The guidance under this FSP is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2005 and the Company continued to apply relevant other than temporary guidance as provided for in FSP EITF 03 1 1 during fiscal 2005. The Company does not believe that the adoption of the guidance of FSP FAS 115 1 and FAS 124 1 will have a significant effect on its future consolidated financial statements. In November 2003, the EITF reached consensus on Issue No. 03 10, Application of Issue No. 02 16 by Resellers to Sales Incentives Offered to Consumers by Manufacturers, with respect to determining if consideration received by a reseller from a vendor that is reimbursed by the vendor for honoring the vendors sale incentives offered directly to consumers should be recorded as a reduction in sales. These rules apply to transactions entered into by consumers in fiscal periods beginning after November 25, 2003 and, therefore, apply to such transactions starting with the Companys fiscal third quarter of 2004, which began February 16, 2004. The adoption of EITF 03 10 did not affect the Companys consolidated gross profit or net income, but did result in a reduction of both net sales and merchandise costs by an equal amount. Had the first half of fiscal 2004 and all of fiscal 2003 been reported under EITF 03 10 guidance, the sales and cost of sales would have been reduced by approximately $186,900 and $282,300, respectively. 26 Table of Contents Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company is exposed to financial market risk resulting from changes in interest and foreign currency rates. As a policy, the Company does not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions, nor hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. The nature and amount of the Companys long and short term debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As of August 28, 2005, the Companys fixed rate long term debt includes its $415,246 principal amount at maturity Zero Coupon Subordinated Notes carried at $274,071 and additional notes and capital lease obligations totaling $132,141. The Companys debt also includes $300,000 5 1/2% Senior Notes carried at $307,688. The Company has entered into fixed to floating interest rate swaps on the Senior Notes, effectively converting these fixed interest rate securities to variable rate securities. As of August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, the Company had fixed to floating interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $300,000 and $600,000, respectively, and an aggregate fair value of $7,688 and $25,754, respectively. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt and may affect the interest expense related to the variable rate debt. The Company holds interest bearing instruments that are classified as cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. The Companys investment policy is to manage its total cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances to preserve principal and liquidity while maximizing the return on the investment portfolio through the full investment of available funds. The Company diversifies its investment portfolio by investing in multiple types of investment grade securities and through internal management and the use of third party investment managers. Short term investments generally have a maturity of three months to five years from the purchase date. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. As the majority of these instruments are of a short term nature, if interest rates were to increase or decrease immediately, there is no material risk of a valuation adjustment related to these instruments. For those instruments that are classified as available for sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in interest rates are reflected in other accumulated comprehensive income or loss. Based on the Companys cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances at August 28, 2005, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $15,000 to interest income (pre tax) on an annual basis. Most foreign currency transactions have been conducted in local currencies, limiting the Companys exposure to changes in currency rates. The Company periodically enters into short term forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates on inventory purchases. The fair value of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at August 28, 2005 was $42,901. 27 Table of Contents 
 
Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Vendor, by Resellers to Sales Incentives Offered to Consumers by Manufacturers, which was effective at the beginning of the Companys fiscal 2004 third quarter. EITF 03 10, which primarily impacts the Companys vendor coupon programs, reduces net sales and merchandise costs by an equal amount and does not affect the Companys consolidated gross margin or net income. Had EITF 03 10 been in effect for the comparable periods in fiscal 2004, the net sales increase in fiscal 2005 would have been 10.4%. (See Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements, EITF 03 10.) For fiscal 2005, comparable sales increased 7% from fiscal 2004. Had EITF 03 10 been in effect for the comparable periods in fiscal 2004, the comparable sales increase for fiscal 2005 would have been 8%. Changes in prices of merchandise did not materially affect the sales increases, with the exception of gasoline, where price increases accounted for approximately 89 basis points of the sales increase. In addition, translation of foreign sales into U.S. dollars contributed to the increase in sales due to stronger foreign currencies, accounting for approximately 134 basis points year over year of the comparable sales increase. Membership Fees Membership fees increased 11.6% to $1,073,156, or 2.07% of net sales, in fiscal 2005 from $961,280, or 2.04% of net sales, in fiscal 2004. This increase was primarily due to additional membership sign ups at the 16 new warehouses opened in fiscal 2005, increased penetration of the Companys Executive membership and high overall member renewal rates consistent with recent years, currently 86%. Gross Margin Gross margin increased 9.1% to $5,515,111, or 10.63% of net sales, in fiscal 2005 from $5,053,696, or 10.72% of net sales, in fiscal 2004. The nine basis point decrease in gross margin as a percentage of net sales reflected a decrease of three basis points in gross margin in the Companys merchandise departments. The three basis point decrease in merchandising is largely due to changes in the sales mix, with higher penetration of lower margin departments. This effect was offset by gross margin gains in most of the Companys merchandise departments, as well as the international operations. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales was positively impacted by five basis points due to the implementation of EITF 03 10, whereby net sales and merchandise costs were reduced equally. The gross margin percentage was reduced by 10 basis points due to the increased penetration of the Executive Member program, increased spending by Executive Members and the resulting increases in the related costs. The gross margin figures reflect accounting for most U.S. merchandise inventories on the last in, first out (LIFO) method. Fiscal 2005 included a $13,410 LIFO charge (increase in merchandise costs), while fiscal 2004 included a $6,090 LIFO charge. The impact of the LIFO adjustment on a year over year basis negatively impacted gross margin, as a percentage of sales, by one additional basis point. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 9.7% to $5,044,341, or 9.73% of net sales, in fiscal 2005, from $4,597,877, or 9.75% of net sales, in fiscal 2004. Had EITF 03 10 been in effect for all of fiscal 2004, SG&A expenses as a percent to net sales would have shown additional improvement of four basis points in fiscal 2005. For fiscal 2005, warehouse and central operating costs positively impacted SG&A comparisons year over year by approximately 13 basis points, primarily due to improved payroll utilization at the warehouse level, including increased leverage from increased comparable sales and cost control measures employed in employee 15 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) benefits, primarily health care. This improvement was partially offset by the implementation of EITF 03 10, which negatively impacted SG&A as a percentage of net sales by five basis points and an increase in stock based compensation costs approximating six basis points year over year. Preopening Expenses Preopening expenses totaled $53,230, or 0.10% of net sales, during fiscal 2005 compared to $30,451, or 0.07% of net sales, during fiscal 2004. During the second quarter of fiscal 2005, in response to the Securities and Exchange Commissions February 7, 2005 letter related to leases, the Company adjusted its method of accounting for leases (entered into over the past twenty years), primarily related to ground leases at certain warehouse locations that did not require rental payments during the period of construction. As a result, the Company recorded a cumulative pre tax, non cash charge of $15,999 to preopening expense in the second quarter of fiscal 2005 to effect this accounting adjustment. Prior periods financial results have not been restated due to the immateriality of this amount to the consolidated financial statements. Twenty one warehouses (including five relocations) were opened in fiscal 2005 compared to the opening of 20 warehouses in fiscal 2004. Pre opening expenses also include costs related to remodels and expanded ancillary operations at existing warehouses. Provision for Impaired Assets and Closing Costs, net The net provision for impaired assets and closing costs was $16,393 in fiscal 2005, compared to $1,000 in fiscal 2004. The provision includes costs related to impairment of long lived assets, future lease obligations of warehouses that have been relocated to new facilities, and any losses or gains resulting from the sale of real property. The provision for fiscal 2005 included charges of $3,893 for impairment of long lived assets, $11,619 for warehouse closing expenses and $881 for net losses on the sale of real property. The provision for fiscal 2004 included charges of $16,548 for warehouse closing expenses that were offset by gains of $15,548 on the sale of real property. At August 28, 2005, the reserve for warehouse closing costs was $9,556, of which $9,118 related to future lease obligations. This compares to a reserve for warehouse closing costs of $10,367 at August 29, 2004, of which $9,184 related to future lease obligations. Interest Expense Interest expense totaled $34,437 in fiscal 2005, compared to $36,651 in fiscal 2004. Interest expense in both fiscal 2005 and 2004 includes interest on the 3 1/2% Zero Coupon Notes, 7 1/8% and 5 1/2% Senior Notes and on balances outstanding under the Companys bank credit facilities and promissory notes. The decrease was primarily a result of a decrease in interest on the Companys 3 1/2% Zero Coupon Notes as note holders converted approximately $280,811 in principle amount of the Notes into common stock during fiscal 2005. Additionally, capitalized interest increased year over year as interest rates and construction costs increased in fiscal 2005 over fiscal 2004. These decreases were partially offset by increases in interest on the Senior Notes as these fixed rate instruments were swapped into variable rate debt in November 2001 and March 2002, which was mitigated by the fact that the 7 1/8% Senior Notes matured and were repaid on June 15, 2005. Interest Income and Other Interest income and other totaled $109,096 in fiscal 2005, compared to $51,627 in fiscal 2004. The increase primarily reflects increased interest income resulting from higher cash and cash equivalents balances and short term investments on hand throughout fiscal 2005, as well as higher interest rates earned on the balances as compared to fiscal 2004. 16 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Provision for Income Taxes The effective income tax rate on earnings was 31.4% in fiscal 2005 and 37% in fiscal 2004. The decrease in the effective income tax rate is attributable to a one time $54,155 income tax benefit resulting primarily from the settlement of a transfer pricing dispute between the United States and Canada (covering the years 1996 2003) and a net tax benefit on excess foreign tax credits on unremitted foreign earnings of $20,592. Excluding these benefits the effective income tax rate on earnings in fiscal 2005 was 36.2%. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 and 2004, the effective tax rate was 28.9% and 37.0%, respectively. The decrease in the fourth quarter tax rate for fiscal 2005 is primarily attributable to the net tax benefit of $20,592, noted above, and a tax benefit of $13,895 primarily associated with lower state taxes. The state tax benefit recorded in the fourth quarter was primarily due to a reduction in the estimated effective state tax rate utilized in the first through third quarters of fiscal 2005. Excluding the benefit of these two items, the fourth quarter tax rate for fiscal 2005 would be 35.8%. Comparison of Fiscal 2004 (52 weeks) and Fiscal 2003 (52 weeks): (dollars in thousands, except earnings per share) Net Income Net income for fiscal 2004 increased 22.4% to $882,393, or $1.85 per diluted share, from $721,000, or $1.53 per diluted share during fiscal year 2003. Net Sales Net sales increased 13.1% to $47,145,712 in fiscal 2004 from $41,692,699 in fiscal 2003. Approximately 78% of the increase was due to an increase in comparable warehouse sales, that is sales in warehouses open for at least a year. The balance of the increase was due to opening 20 new warehouses during fiscal 2004 and a net of 23 new warehouses (29 opened, 6 closed) during fiscal 2003, a portion of which is not included in comparable warehouse sales. Net sales were reduced by the implementation of Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 03 10, Application of Issue No. 02 16, Accounting by a Customer (Including a Reseller) for Certain Consideration Received from a Vendor, by Resellers to Sales Incentives Offered to Consumers by Manufacturers, which was effective at the beginning of the Companys fiscal 2004 third quarter. EITF 03 10, which primarily impacts the Companys vendor coupon programs, reduces net sales and merchandise costs by an equal amount and does not affect the Companys consolidated gross margin or net income. Had EITF 03 10 been in effect for the comparable periods in fiscal 2003, the net sales increase in fiscal 2004 would have been 13.8%. (See Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements, EITF 03 10.) For fiscal 2004, comparable sales increased 10% from fiscal 2003. Had EITF 03 10 been in effect for the comparable periods in fiscal 2003, the comparable sales increase for fiscal 2004 would have been 11%. Changes in prices of merchandise did not materially affect the sales increases, with the exception of gasoline, where price increases accounted for a sales increase of approximately 70 basis points. In addition, due to the weaker U.S. dollar throughout fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003, translation of foreign sales into U.S. dollars contributed to the increase in sales, accounting for a comparable sales increase of approximately 190 basis points year over year. Sales were also positively impacted by the supermarket strikes in Southern California during the first half of the Companys 2004 fiscal year. The positive impact to sales for the entire fiscal year was estimated to be 35 to 50 basis points. 17 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Membership Fees Membership fees increased 12.7% to $961,280, or 2.04% of net sales, in fiscal 2004 from $852,853, or 2.05% of net sales, in fiscal 2003. This increase was primarily due to additional membership sign ups at the 20 new warehouses opened in fiscal 2004; increased penetration of the Companys Executive membership, including the rollout of the program into Canada, which began in the first quarter of fiscal 2004; and high overall member renewal rates consistent with recent years, currently at 86%. Gross Margin Gross margin increased 13.4% to $5,053,696, or 10.72% of net sales, in fiscal 2004 from $4,457,316, or 10.69% of net sales, in fiscal 2003. The three basis point increase, as a percent of net sales, reflected a 14 basis point increase in gross margin in the Companys merchandise departments, helped by strong year over year gross margin gains in the Companys ancillary business operations, particularly gasoline and pharmacy. Year over year gross margin, as a percentage of net sales, was also positively impacted by the implementation of EITF 03 10, whereby net sales and merchandise costs were reduced, resulting in an eight basis point increase. The year over year gross margin percentage was reduced by 12 basis points due to the increased rewards related to the Executive Membership Two Percent Reward Program, resulting from an increase in the penetration of the Executive Member program. The gross margin figures reflect accounting for most U.S. merchandise inventories on the LIFO method. Fiscal 2004 included a $6,090 LIFO charge (increase in merchandise costs), while fiscal 2003 included a $19,650 LIFO credit (reduction in merchandise costs). The impact of the LIFO adjustment on a year over year basis negatively impacted margin by an additional six basis points. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses as a percent of net sales decreased to 9.75% during fiscal 2004 from 9.83% during fiscal 2003. Had EITF 03 10 been in effect in fiscal 2003, SG&A expenses as a percent to net sales would have shown additional improvement of seven basis points in fiscal 2004. For fiscal 2004, warehouse and central operating costs positively impacted SG&A comparisons year over year by approximately 21 basis points, primarily due to increased expense leverage of warehouse payroll, benefits (primarily health care), utility and workers compensation costs. During the latter half of fiscal 2004, the Company implemented changes to its employee healthcare plans that reduced its overall healthcare costs, primarily in the fourth quarter. This improvement was partially offset by the seven basis point increase resulting from the adoption of EITF 03 10, a two basis point increase in expense related to the establishment of additional insurance liabilities resulting from financial difficulties being experienced by one of the Companys third party insurance providers, and an increase in stock based compensation costs following the Companys prospective adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, at the beginning of fiscal 2003, of four basis points. Preopening Expenses Preopening expenses totaled $30,451, or 0.07% of net sales, during fiscal 2004 compared to $36,643, or 0.09% of net sales, during fiscal 2003. This reduction was due to fewer warehouse openings. During fiscal 2004, the Company opened 20 new warehouses compared to 29 new warehouses (including 5 relocations) during fiscal 2003. Pre opening expenses also include costs related to remodels and expanded ancillary operations at existing warehouses. 18 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Provision for Impaired Assets and Closing Costs, net The net provision for impaired assets and closing costs was $1,000 in fiscal 2004, compared to $19,500 in fiscal 2003. The provision includes costs related to impairment of long lived assets, future lease obligations of warehouses that have been relocated to new facilities, and losses or gains resulting from the sale of real property. The provision for fiscal 2004 included charges of $16,548 for warehouse closing expenses that were offset by gains of $15,548 on the sale of real property. The provision for fiscal 2003 included charges of $11,836 for warehouse closing expenses, $4,697 for impairment of long lived assets and $2,967 for net losses on the sale of real property. At August 29, 2004, the reserve for warehouse closing costs was $10,367, of which $9,184 related to future lease obligations. This compares to a reserve for warehouse closing costs of $8,609 at August 31, 2003, of which $7,833 related to future lease obligations. Interest Expense Interest expense totaled $36,651 in fiscal 2004, compared to $36,920 in fiscal 2003. Interest expense in both fiscal 2004 and 2003 includes interest on the 3 1/2% Zero Coupon Notes, 7 1/8% and 5 1/2% Senior Notes and on balances outstanding under the Companys bank credit facilities and promissory notes. The decrease was primarily a result of the Companys reduction in short term borrowings, principally related to its foreign subsidiaries. This decrease was substantially offset by increases in interest rates on the Senior Notes due to interest rate swap agreements converting the interest rate from fixed to floating. Interest Income and Other Interest income and other totaled $51,627 in fiscal 2004, compared to $38,525 in fiscal 2003. The increase primarily reflects greater interest earned on higher cash and cash equivalents balances and short term investments. In addition, a reduction in the expense to record minority interest in the earnings of foreign subsidiaries was reported in fiscal 2004 as the Company increased its ownership in Costco Wholesale UK Limited to 100%. Provision for Income Taxes The effective income tax rate on earnings was 37% in fiscal 2004 and 37.75% in fiscal 2003. The decrease in the effective income tax rate is primarily attributable to lower statutory income tax rates for foreign operations and one time benefits associated with certain tax planning strategies. Liquidity and Capital Resources (dollars in thousands, except per share amounts) Cash Flows The Companys primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from warehouse operations and our existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances, which were $3,459,857 and $3,129,882 at August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, respectively. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $1,783,177 in fiscal 2005 compared to $2,098,783 in fiscal 2004, a decrease of $315,606. Higher net income and a decrease in net merchandise inventories (merchandise inventory less accounts payable) year over year increased cash flow from operating activities by $391,571. This increase was offset by decreases in cash flow from operating assets and liabilities of $706,855, primarily relating to the timing in the collection of certain receivables and in payments of income taxes in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004. A significant component of net cash used in investing activities continues to be the purchase of property and equipment related to the Companys warehouse expansion and remodel projects. Net cash used in investing activities totaled $2,058,729 in fiscal 2005 compared to $1,048,481 in fiscal 2004, an increase of $1,010,248. The increase in investing activities primarily relates to an increase in the net investment in short term investments of $768,596 and an increase in additions to property and equipment of $289,811 in fiscal 2005 over fiscal 2004. 19 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Net cash used in financing activities totaled $518,651 in fiscal 2005 compared to $209,569 provided by financing activities in fiscal 2004. The decrease of $728,220 primarily resulted from an increase in the repayment of debt of $297,275 primarily relating to the repayment of the 7 1/8% Senior Notes, which matured on June 15, 2005, and repurchases of common stock of $413,252 under the Companys $500,000 share repurchase program. Dividends Costcos Board of Directors declared four quarterly cash dividends during fiscal year 2005. The first two dividends of $0.10 per share were paid November 26, 2004 and February 25, 2005, to shareholders of record at the close of business on November 5, 2004 and February 8, 2005, respectively. The third and fourth dividends of $0.115 per share were paid May 27, 2005 and August 26, 2005 to shareholders of record at the close of business on May 6, 2005 and August 5, 2005, respectively. In fiscal 2004 the Company paid dividends of $0.10 per share in the third and fourth quarters. Contractual Obligations The Companys commitment to make future payments under contractual obligations was as follows, as of August 28, 2005. Payments Due by Period Contractual obligations  Total Less than1 year 1 to 3years 4 to 5years After5 years Long term debt(1)(2) $ 879,520 $ 18,064 $ 379,466 $ 65,437 $ 416,553 Capital lease obligations 6,591 3,225 1,305 927 1,134 Operating leases(3) 1,562,267 114,682 219,402 189,188 1,038,995 Purchase obligations (merchandise)(4) 3,049,398 3,048,785 613 Purchase obligations (building, equipment, services and other)(5) 242,361 230,086 12,275 Other(6) 8,591 1,354 1,692 1,362 4,183 Total $ 5,748,728 $ 3,416,196 $ 614,753 $ 256,914 $ 1,460,865 (1) Amounts include contractual interest payments. (2) The amount includes interest accreted to maturity for the Companys Zero Coupon 3 1/2% Convertible Subordinated Notes due August 2017, totaling $415,246. The consolidated balance sheet as of August 28, 2005 reflects a balance outstanding of $274,071. (3) Operating lease obligations have been reduced by $168,742 to reflect sub lease income. (4) Includes open merchandise purchase orders at fiscal year end. (5) The amounts exclude minor outsourced services negotiated at the individual warehouse level that are not significant and generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty. (6) Consists of asset retirement and deferred compensation obligations. Expansion Plans Costcos primary requirement for capital is the financing of the land, building and equipment costs for new warehouses plus the costs of initial warehouse operations and working capital requirements, as well as additional capital for international expansion. 20 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) While there can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized, and plans are subject to change upon further review, it is managements current intention to spend approximately $1,100,000 to $1,250,000 during fiscal 2006 in the United States and Canada for real estate, construction, remodeling and equipment for warehouse clubs and related operations; and approximately $100,000 to $150,000 for international expansion, including the United Kingdom, Asia, Mexico and other potential ventures. These expenditures are expected to be financed with a combination of cash provided from operations and the use of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. Expansion plans for the United States and Canada during fiscal 2006 are to open approximately 28 30 new warehouse clubs on a net basis, inclusive of two to three relocations to larger and better located warehouses. The Company expects to continue its review of expansion plans in its international operations, including the United Kingdom and Asia, along with other international markets. At present, the Company is planning to open three additional warehouses in the U.K during fiscal 2006. Costco Mexico plans to open two to three new warehouse clubs during fiscal 2006. Additional Equity Investments in Subsidiaries and Joint Ventures On June 30, 2005, the Company acquired the remaining 4% interest in CWC Travel Inc for $3,961, bringing Costcos ownership in this entity to 100%. In addition, during fiscal 2005 the Company contributed an additional $15,000 to its investment in Costco Mexico (a 50% owned joint venture), which did not impact its percentage ownership of this entity as the joint venture partner contributed a like amount. On October 3, 2003, the Company acquired from Carrefour Nederland B.V. its 20% equity interest in Costco Wholesale UK Limited for cash of $95,153, bringing Costcos ownership in Costco Wholesale UK Limited to 100%. Bank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs (all amounts stated in thousands of US dollars) The Company has a $500,000 commercial paper program supported by a $150,000 bank credit facility ($300,000 at August 29, 2004) with a group of nine banks, which expires on November 15, 2005, and is not expected to be renewed. At August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, no amounts were outstanding under the commercial paper program and no amounts were outstanding under the credit facility. Applicable interest rates on the credit facility at August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, were 3.92% and 1.90%, respectively. A wholly owned Canadian subsidiary has a $167,000 commercial paper program ($152,000 at August 29, 2004) supported by a $50,000 bank credit facility ($46,000 at August 29, 2004) with a Canadian bank, which is guaranteed by the Company and expires in March 2006. At August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, no amounts were outstanding under the Canadian commercial paper program or the bank credit facility. Applicable interest rates on the credit facility at August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, were 4.25% and 3.75%, respectively. At August 28, 2005, standby letters of credit totaling $23,000 issued under the bank credit facility left $27,000 available for commercial paper support. At August 29, 2004, standby letters of credit totaling $21,000 issued under the bank credit facility left $25,000 available for commercial paper support. The Company has agreed to limit the combined amount outstanding under the U.S. and Canadian commercial paper programs to the combined amounts of the supporting bank credit facilities, which are $177,000 at August 28, 2005, decreasing to $27,000 on November 15, 2005. At August 29, 2004, the combined amount of supporting bank credit facilities was $325,000. The Companys wholly owned Japanese subsidiary has a short term $13,694 bank line of credit that expires in February 2006. At August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, $5,477 and $0, respectively, were borrowed under the line of credit, and $3,652 and $2,576, respectively, were used to support standby letters of credit. A second 21 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) $13,694 bank line of credit was entered into in February 2005 that expires in February 2006. At August 28, 2005, $9,129 was borrowed under the second facility; this bank line was not in place at August 29, 2004. Applicable interest rates on the credit facilities at both August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, were .84%. The Companys Korean subsidiary has a short term $11,665 bank line of credit, which expires in January 2006. At August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, no amounts were borrowed under the line of credit and $1,668 and $0, respectively, were used to support standby letters of credit. Applicable interest rates on the credit facility at August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, were 4.51% and 4.52%, respectively. The Companys Taiwan subsidiary has a $7,439 bank revolving credit facility that expires in January 2006. At August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, no amounts were borrowed under the credit facility and $2,495 and $1,165, respectively, were used to support standby letters of credit. A second $15,499 bank revolving credit facility is in place, which expires in July 2006. At August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, no amounts were borrowed under the second credit facility and $790 and $738, respectively were used to support standby letters of credit. Applicable interest rates on the credit facilities at August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, were 3.75% and 3.50%, respectively. The Companys wholly owned United Kingdom subsidiary has a $108,408 bank revolving credit facility expiring in February 2007 and a $63,238 bank overdraft facility renewable on a yearly basis in March 2006. At August 28, 2005, $39,750 was outstanding under the revolving credit facility with an applicable interest rate of 5.30% and no amounts were outstanding under the bank overdraft facility. At August 29, 2004, $21,595 was outstanding under the revolving credit facility with an applicable interest rate of 5.285% and no amounts were outstanding under the bank overdraft facility. Letters of Credit The Company has letter of credit facilities (for commercial and standby letters of credit), totaling approximately $401,933. The outstanding commitments under these facilities at August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004 totaled approximately $131,169 and $166,800, respectively, including approximately $64,532 and $52,900, respectively, in standby letters of credit. Financing Activities The Companys 7 1/8% Senior Notes, carried at $304,350 at August 29, 2004, matured and were repaid on June 15, 2005 from its cash and cash equivalents. In April 2003, the Companys wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.92% in the aggregate amount of $36,516, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due on April 26, 2010. In March 2002, the Company issued $300,000 of 5 1/2% Senior Notes carried at $307,688 due March 15, 2007. Interest is payable semi annually. Simultaneous with the issuance of the Senior Notes, the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements converting the interest from fixed to floating. In February 1996, the Company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a shelf registration statement for $500,000 of senior debt securities. On October 23, 2001, additional debt securities of $100,000 were registered. The $300,000 of 5 1/2% Senior Notes issued in March 2002 reduced the amount of registered securities available for future issuance to $300,000. During fiscal 2005, $280,811 in principal amount of the Companys 3 1/2% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes were converted by note holders into 9,910,011 shares of common stock. 22 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Derivatives The Company has limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and uses them only to manage well defined interest rate and foreign exchange risks. Forward foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on inventory purchases and typically have very short terms. The aggregate amount of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, was $42,466 and $30,495, respectively. The majority of the forward foreign exchange contracts were entered into by the Companys wholly owned United Kingdom subsidiary, primarily to hedge U.S. dollar merchandise inventory purchases. The Company monitors its foreign currency exchange exposures to ensure the overall effectiveness of its foreign currency hedge positions. The only other derivative instruments the Company holds are interest rate swaps, which the Company uses to manage the interest rate risk associated with its borrowings and to manage the Companys mix of fixed rate and variable rate debt. As of August 28, 2005, the Company had fixed to floating interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $300,000 and an aggregate fair value of $7,688, which is recorded in other assets on the Companys consolidated balance sheet. These swaps were entered into effective March 25, 2002, and are designated and qualify as fair value hedges of the Companys $300,000 5 1/2% Senior Notes. As the terms of the swaps match those of the underlying hedged debt, the changes in the fair value of these swaps are offset by corresponding changes in the carrying amount of the hedged debt and result in no net earnings impact. As of August 29, 2004, the Company had fixed to floating interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $600,000 and an aggregate fair value of $25,754. In addition to the Companys swap on the 5 1/2% Senior Notes noted above, the Company had entered into a swap on its $300,000 7 1/8% Senior Notes effective November 13, 2001, which was designated and qualified as a fair value hedge. The $300,000 7 1/8% Senior Notes matured and were repaid on June 15, 2005. Concurrent to this transaction, the related swap agreement expired. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements With the exception of its operating leases, the Company has no off balance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on the Companys financial condition or consolidated financial statements. Stock Repurchase Program On November 30, 2001, the Companys Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program, authorizing the repurchase of up to $500,000 of Costco Common Stock through November 30, 2004. Under the program, the Company could repurchase shares at any time in the open market or in private transactions as market conditions warrant. The repurchased shares would be retired. On October 25, 2004, the Board of Directors renewed the program for another three years. On June 7, 2005 the Company began repurchasing shares on the open market. Through August 28, 2005 the Company has repurchased 9,205,100 shares of common stock at an average price of $44.89, totaling approximately $413,252, including commissions. Subsequent to the Companys fiscal 2005 year end, August 29, 2005, the Board of Directors of Costco authorized an additional stock repurchase program of up to $1,000,000 of Costco common stock. Under the program, which contains no expiration date, the Company may repurchase shares at any time in the open market or in private transactions as market conditions warrant. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the Companys financial statements requires that management make estimates and judgments that affect the financial position and results of operations. Management continues to review its accounting policies and evaluate its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, merchandise inventory, 23 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) impairment of long lived assets and warehouse closing costs and insurance/self insurance liabilities. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the present circumstances. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes sales, net of estimated returns, at the time customers take possession of merchandise or receive services. When the Company collects payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services, the amount received is recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed. The Company provides for estimated sales returns based on historical returns levels. The Company evaluates the criteria of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal Versus Net as an Agent, in determining whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, when Costco is the primary obligor, is subject to inventory risk, has latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, influence product or service specifications, or has several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded on a gross basis. If the Company is not the primary obligor and does not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above, Costco records the net amounts as commissions earned. Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market as determined primarily by the retail method of accounting and are stated using the last in, first out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail method of accounting and are stated using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. The Company believes the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. The Company records an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the expected annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end. At August 28, 2005, merchandise inventories valued at LIFO approximated FIFO after considering the lower of cost or market principle. At August 29, 2004, merchandise inventories valued using LIFO exceeded the comparable FIFO value by approximately $13,410 due to the aggregate effects of deflation. The Company provides for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts on the basis of a percentage of sales. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect the trend of the actual physical inventory count results, which generally occur in the second and fourth fiscal quarters of the Companys fiscal year. Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as the Company progresses towards earning those rebates provided they are probable and reasonably estimable. Other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of agreement, or other systematic and rational approach. Impairment of long lived assets and warehouse closing costs The Company periodically evaluates its long lived assets for indicators of impairment. Managements judgments are based on market and operational conditions at the present time. Future events could cause management to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring an adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value. 24 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) The Company provides estimates for warehouse closing costs, based on the applicable accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Future circumstances may result in the Companys actual future closing costs or the amount recognized upon the sale of the property to differ substantially from the original estimates. Insurance/Self Insurance Liabilities The Company uses a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms to provide for the potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property damage, director and officers liability, vehicle liability and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by the Company are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience and outside expertise, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In May 2005, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, a Replacement of Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 20 and FASB Statement No. 3. SFAS 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements for changes in accounting principles, unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change. SFAS 154 also requires that retrospective application of a change in accounting principle be limited to the direct effects of the change. Indirect effects of a change in accounting principle, such as a change in non discretionary profit sharing payments resulting from an accounting change, should be recognized in the period of the accounting change. SFAS 154 also requires that a change in depreciation, amortization, or depletion method for long lived, non financial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate effected by a change in accounting principle. SFAS 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. Early adoption is permitted for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after the date this Statement is issued. The Company is required to adopt the provisions of SFAS 154, as applicable, beginning in fiscal 2007. The Company does not believe the adoption of SFAS 154 will have a significant effect on its future consolidated financial statements. In March 2005, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, An Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143, which requires an entity to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation when incurred if the liabilitys fair value can be reasonably estimated. The Company adopted the provisions of FIN 47 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. The adoption of this Interpretation did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R, Share based Payments. SFAS 123R revises SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, which the Company adopted as of the beginning of its fiscal 2003, and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. SFAS 123R applies to transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services and also applies to liabilities an entity may incur for goods or services that are based on the fair value of those equity instruments. All employee stock option grants made by the Company since the beginning of fiscal 2003 have been expensed over the related option vesting period based on the fair value at the date the options are granted using the Black Scholes model. Under SFAS 123R, the Company will be required to select a valuation technique or option pricing model that meets the criteria as stated in the standard. Allowable valuation models include a binomial model and the Black Scholes model. The Company is required to adopt the provisions of SFAS 123R in the first quarter of its fiscal 2006. The Company is in the process of assessing the impact on the Companys results of operations from the adoption of SFAS 123R for its effect on prospective option grants. The adoption of SFAS 123R requires the Company to value stock options granted prior to its adoption of SFAS 123 under the fair value 25 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) method and expense these amounts in the income statement over the stock options remaining vesting period. This will result in the Company expensing $13,043 in fiscal 2006, which would previously have been presented in a proforma footnote disclosure. In addition, SFAS 123R will require the Company to reflect the tax savings resulting from tax deductions in excess of expense reflected in its financial statements as a financing cash flow, which will impact the Companys future reported cash flows from operating activities. In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, Inventory Costs An Amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin (ARB) No. 43, Chapter 4. SFAS 151 clarifies that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and spoilage should be expensed as incurred and not included in overhead. Further, SFAS 151 requires that allocation of fixed and production facilities overheads to conversion costs should be based on normal capacity of the production facilities. The provisions in this statement are effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005. The Company does not believe that the adoption of SFAS 151 will have a significant effect on its future consolidated financial statements. In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153, Exchanges of Non monetary Assets An Amendment of APB No. 29. The provisions of this statement are effective for non monetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005. This statement eliminates the exception to fair value for exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchange transactions that do not have commercial substance that is, transactions that are not expected to result in significant changes in the cash flows of the reporting entity. The Company does not believe that the adoption of SFAS 153 will have a significant effect on its future consolidated financial statements. In March 2004, the FASB EITF reached a consensus on EITF Issue No. 03 1, The Meaning of Other Than Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments, (EITF 03 1). The guidance prescribes a three step model for determining whether an investment is other than temporarily impaired and requires disclosures about unrealized losses on investments. The accounting guidance became effective for reporting periods beginning after June 15, 2004, while the disclosure requirements became effective for annual reporting periods ending after June 15, 2004. In September 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) EITF 03 1 1, Effective Date of Paragraphs 10 20 of EITF Issue No. 03 1 The Meaning of Other Than Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments, (FSP EITF 03 1 1). FSP EITF 03 1 1 delayed the effective date for the measurement and recognition guidance contained in paragraphs 10 20 of EITF Issue 03 1. In November 2005, the FASB issued FSP FAS 115 1 and FAS 124 1, The Meaning of Other Than Temporary Impairment and its Application to Certain Investments. This FSP addresses the determination as to when an investment is considered impaired, whether the impairment is other than temporary and the measurement of an impairment loss. This statement specifically nullifies the requirements of paragraph 10 18 of EITF 03 1 and references existing other than temporary impairment guidance. The guidance under this FSP is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2005 and the Company continued to apply relevant other than temporary guidance as provided for in FSP EITF 03 1 1 during fiscal 2005. The Company does not believe that the adoption of the guidance of FSP FAS 115 1 and FAS 124 1 will have a significant effect on its future consolidated financial statements. In November 2003, the EITF reached consensus on Issue No. 03 10, Application of Issue No. 02 16 by Resellers to Sales Incentives Offered to Consumers by Manufacturers, with respect to determining if consideration received by a reseller from a vendor that is reimbursed by the vendor for honoring the vendors sale incentives offered directly to consumers should be recorded as a reduction in sales. These rules apply to transactions entered into by consumers in fiscal periods beginning after November 25, 2003 and, therefore, apply to such transactions starting with the Companys fiscal third quarter of 2004, which began February 16, 2004. The adoption of EITF 03 10 did not affect the Companys consolidated gross profit or net income, but did result in a reduction of both net sales and merchandise costs by an equal amount. Had the first half of fiscal 2004 and all of fiscal 2003 been reported under EITF 03 10 guidance, the sales and cost of sales would have been reduced by approximately $186,900 and $282,300, respectively. 26 Table of Contents Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company is exposed to financial market risk resulting from changes in interest and foreign currency rates. As a policy, the Company does not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions, nor hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. The nature and amount of the Companys long and short term debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As of August 28, 2005, the Companys fixed rate long term debt includes its $415,246 principal amount at maturity Zero Coupon Subordinated Notes carried at $274,071 and additional notes and capital lease obligations totaling $132,141. The Companys debt also includes $300,000 5 1/2% Senior Notes carried at $307,688. The Company has entered into fixed to floating interest rate swaps on the Senior Notes, effectively converting these fixed interest rate securities to variable rate securities. As of August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, the Company had fixed to floating interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $300,000 and $600,000, respectively, and an aggregate fair value of $7,688 and $25,754, respectively. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt and may affect the interest expense related to the variable rate debt. The Company holds interest bearing instruments that are classified as cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. The Companys investment policy is to manage its total cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances to preserve principal and liquidity while maximizing the return on the investment portfolio through the full investment of available funds. The Company diversifies its investment portfolio by investing in multiple types of investment grade securities and through internal management and the use of third party investment managers. Short term investments generally have a maturity of three months to five years from the purchase date. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. As the majority of these instruments are of a short term nature, if interest rates were to increase or decrease immediately, there is no material risk of a valuation adjustment related to these instruments. For those instruments that are classified as available for sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in interest rates are reflected in other accumulated comprehensive income or loss. Based on the Companys cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances at August 28, 2005, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $15,000 to interest income (pre tax) on an annual basis. Most foreign currency transactions have been conducted in local currencies, limiting the Companys exposure to changes in currency rates. The Company periodically enters into short term forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates on inventory purchases. The fair value of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at August 28, 2005 was $42,901. 27 Table of Contents 
 
Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) benefits, primarily health care. This improvement was partially offset by the implementation of EITF 03 10, which negatively impacted SG&A as a percentage of net sales by five basis points and an increase in stock based compensation costs approximating six basis points year over year. Preopening Expenses Preopening expenses totaled $53,230, or 0.10% of net sales, during fiscal 2005 compared to $30,451, or 0.07% of net sales, during fiscal 2004. During the second quarter of fiscal 2005, in response to the Securities and Exchange Commissions February 7, 2005 letter related to leases, the Company adjusted its method of accounting for leases (entered into over the past twenty years), primarily related to ground leases at certain warehouse locations that did not require rental payments during the period of construction. As a result, the Company recorded a cumulative pre tax, non cash charge of $15,999 to preopening expense in the second quarter of fiscal 2005 to effect this accounting adjustment. Prior periods financial results have not been restated due to the immateriality of this amount to the consolidated financial statements. Twenty one warehouses (including five relocations) were opened in fiscal 2005 compared to the opening of 20 warehouses in fiscal 2004. Pre opening expenses also include costs related to remodels and expanded ancillary operations at existing warehouses. Provision for Impaired Assets and Closing Costs, net The net provision for impaired assets and closing costs was $16,393 in fiscal 2005, compared to $1,000 in fiscal 2004. The provision includes costs related to impairment of long lived assets, future lease obligations of warehouses that have been relocated to new facilities, and any losses or gains resulting from the sale of real property. The provision for fiscal 2005 included charges of $3,893 for impairment of long lived assets, $11,619 for warehouse closing expenses and $881 for net losses on the sale of real property. The provision for fiscal 2004 included charges of $16,548 for warehouse closing expenses that were offset by gains of $15,548 on the sale of real property. At August 28, 2005, the reserve for warehouse closing costs was $9,556, of which $9,118 related to future lease obligations. This compares to a reserve for warehouse closing costs of $10,367 at August 29, 2004, of which $9,184 related to future lease obligations. Interest Expense Interest expense totaled $34,437 in fiscal 2005, compared to $36,651 in fiscal 2004. Interest expense in both fiscal 2005 and 2004 includes interest on the 3 1/2% Zero Coupon Notes, 7 1/8% and 5 1/2% Senior Notes and on balances outstanding under the Companys bank credit facilities and promissory notes. The decrease was primarily a result of a decrease in interest on the Companys 3 1/2% Zero Coupon Notes as note holders converted approximately $280,811 in principle amount of the Notes into common stock during fiscal 2005. Additionally, capitalized interest increased year over year as interest rates and construction costs increased in fiscal 2005 over fiscal 2004. These decreases were partially offset by increases in interest on the Senior Notes as these fixed rate instruments were swapped into variable rate debt in November 2001 and March 2002, which was mitigated by the fact that the 7 1/8% Senior Notes matured and were repaid on June 15, 2005. Interest Income and Other Interest income and other totaled $109,096 in fiscal 2005, compared to $51,627 in fiscal 2004. The increase primarily reflects increased interest income resulting from higher cash and cash equivalents balances and short term investments on hand throughout fiscal 2005, as well as higher interest rates earned on the balances as compared to fiscal 2004. 16 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Provision for Income Taxes The effective income tax rate on earnings was 31.4% in fiscal 2005 and 37% in fiscal 2004. The decrease in the effective income tax rate is attributable to a one time $54,155 income tax benefit resulting primarily from the settlement of a transfer pricing dispute between the United States and Canada (covering the years 1996 2003) and a net tax benefit on excess foreign tax credits on unremitted foreign earnings of $20,592. Excluding these benefits the effective income tax rate on earnings in fiscal 2005 was 36.2%. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 and 2004, the effective tax rate was 28.9% and 37.0%, respectively. The decrease in the fourth quarter tax rate for fiscal 2005 is primarily attributable to the net tax benefit of $20,592, noted above, and a tax benefit of $13,895 primarily associated with lower state taxes. The state tax benefit recorded in the fourth quarter was primarily due to a reduction in the estimated effective state tax rate utilized in the first through third quarters of fiscal 2005. Excluding the benefit of these two items, the fourth quarter tax rate for fiscal 2005 would be 35.8%. Comparison of Fiscal 2004 (52 weeks) and Fiscal 2003 (52 weeks): (dollars in thousands, except earnings per share) Net Income Net income for fiscal 2004 increased 22.4% to $882,393, or $1.85 per diluted share, from $721,000, or $1.53 per diluted share during fiscal year 2003. Net Sales Net sales increased 13.1% to $47,145,712 in fiscal 2004 from $41,692,699 in fiscal 2003. Approximately 78% of the increase was due to an increase in comparable warehouse sales, that is sales in warehouses open for at least a year. The balance of the increase was due to opening 20 new warehouses during fiscal 2004 and a net of 23 new warehouses (29 opened, 6 closed) during fiscal 2003, a portion of which is not included in comparable warehouse sales. Net sales were reduced by the implementation of Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 03 10, Application of Issue No. 02 16, Accounting by a Customer (Including a Reseller) for Certain Consideration Received from a Vendor, by Resellers to Sales Incentives Offered to Consumers by Manufacturers, which was effective at the beginning of the Companys fiscal 2004 third quarter. EITF 03 10, which primarily impacts the Companys vendor coupon programs, reduces net sales and merchandise costs by an equal amount and does not affect the Companys consolidated gross margin or net income. Had EITF 03 10 been in effect for the comparable periods in fiscal 2003, the net sales increase in fiscal 2004 would have been 13.8%. (See Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements, EITF 03 10.) For fiscal 2004, comparable sales increased 10% from fiscal 2003. Had EITF 03 10 been in effect for the comparable periods in fiscal 2003, the comparable sales increase for fiscal 2004 would have been 11%. Changes in prices of merchandise did not materially affect the sales increases, with the exception of gasoline, where price increases accounted for a sales increase of approximately 70 basis points. In addition, due to the weaker U.S. dollar throughout fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003, translation of foreign sales into U.S. dollars contributed to the increase in sales, accounting for a comparable sales increase of approximately 190 basis points year over year. Sales were also positively impacted by the supermarket strikes in Southern California during the first half of the Companys 2004 fiscal year. The positive impact to sales for the entire fiscal year was estimated to be 35 to 50 basis points. 17 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Membership Fees Membership fees increased 12.7% to $961,280, or 2.04% of net sales, in fiscal 2004 from $852,853, or 2.05% of net sales, in fiscal 2003. This increase was primarily due to additional membership sign ups at the 20 new warehouses opened in fiscal 2004; increased penetration of the Companys Executive membership, including the rollout of the program into Canada, which began in the first quarter of fiscal 2004; and high overall member renewal rates consistent with recent years, currently at 86%. Gross Margin Gross margin increased 13.4% to $5,053,696, or 10.72% of net sales, in fiscal 2004 from $4,457,316, or 10.69% of net sales, in fiscal 2003. The three basis point increase, as a percent of net sales, reflected a 14 basis point increase in gross margin in the Companys merchandise departments, helped by strong year over year gross margin gains in the Companys ancillary business operations, particularly gasoline and pharmacy. Year over year gross margin, as a percentage of net sales, was also positively impacted by the implementation of EITF 03 10, whereby net sales and merchandise costs were reduced, resulting in an eight basis point increase. The year over year gross margin percentage was reduced by 12 basis points due to the increased rewards related to the Executive Membership Two Percent Reward Program, resulting from an increase in the penetration of the Executive Member program. The gross margin figures reflect accounting for most U.S. merchandise inventories on the LIFO method. Fiscal 2004 included a $6,090 LIFO charge (increase in merchandise costs), while fiscal 2003 included a $19,650 LIFO credit (reduction in merchandise costs). The impact of the LIFO adjustment on a year over year basis negatively impacted margin by an additional six basis points. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses as a percent of net sales decreased to 9.75% during fiscal 2004 from 9.83% during fiscal 2003. Had EITF 03 10 been in effect in fiscal 2003, SG&A expenses as a percent to net sales would have shown additional improvement of seven basis points in fiscal 2004. For fiscal 2004, warehouse and central operating costs positively impacted SG&A comparisons year over year by approximately 21 basis points, primarily due to increased expense leverage of warehouse payroll, benefits (primarily health care), utility and workers compensation costs. During the latter half of fiscal 2004, the Company implemented changes to its employee healthcare plans that reduced its overall healthcare costs, primarily in the fourth quarter. This improvement was partially offset by the seven basis point increase resulting from the adoption of EITF 03 10, a two basis point increase in expense related to the establishment of additional insurance liabilities resulting from financial difficulties being experienced by one of the Companys third party insurance providers, and an increase in stock based compensation costs following the Companys prospective adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, at the beginning of fiscal 2003, of four basis points. Preopening Expenses Preopening expenses totaled $30,451, or 0.07% of net sales, during fiscal 2004 compared to $36,643, or 0.09% of net sales, during fiscal 2003. This reduction was due to fewer warehouse openings. During fiscal 2004, the Company opened 20 new warehouses compared to 29 new warehouses (including 5 relocations) during fiscal 2003. Pre opening expenses also include costs related to remodels and expanded ancillary operations at existing warehouses. 18 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Provision for Impaired Assets and Closing Costs, net The net provision for impaired assets and closing costs was $1,000 in fiscal 2004, compared to $19,500 in fiscal 2003. The provision includes costs related to impairment of long lived assets, future lease obligations of warehouses that have been relocated to new facilities, and losses or gains resulting from the sale of real property. The provision for fiscal 2004 included charges of $16,548 for warehouse closing expenses that were offset by gains of $15,548 on the sale of real property. The provision for fiscal 2003 included charges of $11,836 for warehouse closing expenses, $4,697 for impairment of long lived assets and $2,967 for net losses on the sale of real property. At August 29, 2004, the reserve for warehouse closing costs was $10,367, of which $9,184 related to future lease obligations. This compares to a reserve for warehouse closing costs of $8,609 at August 31, 2003, of which $7,833 related to future lease obligations. Interest Expense Interest expense totaled $36,651 in fiscal 2004, compared to $36,920 in fiscal 2003. Interest expense in both fiscal 2004 and 2003 includes interest on the 3 1/2% Zero Coupon Notes, 7 1/8% and 5 1/2% Senior Notes and on balances outstanding under the Companys bank credit facilities and promissory notes. The decrease was primarily a result of the Companys reduction in short term borrowings, principally related to its foreign subsidiaries. This decrease was substantially offset by increases in interest rates on the Senior Notes due to interest rate swap agreements converting the interest rate from fixed to floating. Interest Income and Other Interest income and other totaled $51,627 in fiscal 2004, compared to $38,525 in fiscal 2003. The increase primarily reflects greater interest earned on higher cash and cash equivalents balances and short term investments. In addition, a reduction in the expense to record minority interest in the earnings of foreign subsidiaries was reported in fiscal 2004 as the Company increased its ownership in Costco Wholesale UK Limited to 100%. Provision for Income Taxes The effective income tax rate on earnings was 37% in fiscal 2004 and 37.75% in fiscal 2003. The decrease in the effective income tax rate is primarily attributable to lower statutory income tax rates for foreign operations and one time benefits associated with certain tax planning strategies. Liquidity and Capital Resources (dollars in thousands, except per share amounts) Cash Flows The Companys primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from warehouse operations and our existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances, which were $3,459,857 and $3,129,882 at August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, respectively. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $1,783,177 in fiscal 2005 compared to $2,098,783 in fiscal 2004, a decrease of $315,606. Higher net income and a decrease in net merchandise inventories (merchandise inventory less accounts payable) year over year increased cash flow from operating activities by $391,571. This increase was offset by decreases in cash flow from operating assets and liabilities of $706,855, primarily relating to the timing in the collection of certain receivables and in payments of income taxes in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004. A significant component of net cash used in investing activities continues to be the purchase of property and equipment related to the Companys warehouse expansion and remodel projects. Net cash used in investing activities totaled $2,058,729 in fiscal 2005 compared to $1,048,481 in fiscal 2004, an increase of $1,010,248. The increase in investing activities primarily relates to an increase in the net investment in short term investments of $768,596 and an increase in additions to property and equipment of $289,811 in fiscal 2005 over fiscal 2004. 19 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Net cash used in financing activities totaled $518,651 in fiscal 2005 compared to $209,569 provided by financing activities in fiscal 2004. The decrease of $728,220 primarily resulted from an increase in the repayment of debt of $297,275 primarily relating to the repayment of the 7 1/8% Senior Notes, which matured on June 15, 2005, and repurchases of common stock of $413,252 under the Companys $500,000 share repurchase program. Dividends Costcos Board of Directors declared four quarterly cash dividends during fiscal year 2005. The first two dividends of $0.10 per share were paid November 26, 2004 and February 25, 2005, to shareholders of record at the close of business on November 5, 2004 and February 8, 2005, respectively. The third and fourth dividends of $0.115 per share were paid May 27, 2005 and August 26, 2005 to shareholders of record at the close of business on May 6, 2005 and August 5, 2005, respectively. In fiscal 2004 the Company paid dividends of $0.10 per share in the third and fourth quarters. Contractual Obligations The Companys commitment to make future payments under contractual obligations was as follows, as of August 28, 2005. Payments Due by Period Contractual obligations  Total Less than1 year 1 to 3years 4 to 5years After5 years Long term debt(1)(2) $ 879,520 $ 18,064 $ 379,466 $ 65,437 $ 416,553 Capital lease obligations 6,591 3,225 1,305 927 1,134 Operating leases(3) 1,562,267 114,682 219,402 189,188 1,038,995 Purchase obligations (merchandise)(4) 3,049,398 3,048,785 613 Purchase obligations (building, equipment, services and other)(5) 242,361 230,086 12,275 Other(6) 8,591 1,354 1,692 1,362 4,183 Total $ 5,748,728 $ 3,416,196 $ 614,753 $ 256,914 $ 1,460,865 (1) Amounts include contractual interest payments. (2) The amount includes interest accreted to maturity for the Companys Zero Coupon 3 1/2% Convertible Subordinated Notes due August 2017, totaling $415,246. The consolidated balance sheet as of August 28, 2005 reflects a balance outstanding of $274,071. (3) Operating lease obligations have been reduced by $168,742 to reflect sub lease income. (4) Includes open merchandise purchase orders at fiscal year end. (5) The amounts exclude minor outsourced services negotiated at the individual warehouse level that are not significant and generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty. (6) Consists of asset retirement and deferred compensation obligations. Expansion Plans Costcos primary requirement for capital is the financing of the land, building and equipment costs for new warehouses plus the costs of initial warehouse operations and working capital requirements, as well as additional capital for international expansion. 20 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) While there can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized, and plans are subject to change upon further review, it is managements current intention to spend approximately $1,100,000 to $1,250,000 during fiscal 2006 in the United States and Canada for real estate, construction, remodeling and equipment for warehouse clubs and related operations; and approximately $100,000 to $150,000 for international expansion, including the United Kingdom, Asia, Mexico and other potential ventures. These expenditures are expected to be financed with a combination of cash provided from operations and the use of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. Expansion plans for the United States and Canada during fiscal 2006 are to open approximately 28 30 new warehouse clubs on a net basis, inclusive of two to three relocations to larger and better located warehouses. The Company expects to continue its review of expansion plans in its international operations, including the United Kingdom and Asia, along with other international markets. At present, the Company is planning to open three additional warehouses in the U.K during fiscal 2006. Costco Mexico plans to open two to three new warehouse clubs during fiscal 2006. Additional Equity Investments in Subsidiaries and Joint Ventures On June 30, 2005, the Company acquired the remaining 4% interest in CWC Travel Inc for $3,961, bringing Costcos ownership in this entity to 100%. In addition, during fiscal 2005 the Company contributed an additional $15,000 to its investment in Costco Mexico (a 50% owned joint venture), which did not impact its percentage ownership of this entity as the joint venture partner contributed a like amount. On October 3, 2003, the Company acquired from Carrefour Nederland B.V. its 20% equity interest in Costco Wholesale UK Limited for cash of $95,153, bringing Costcos ownership in Costco Wholesale UK Limited to 100%. Bank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs (all amounts stated in thousands of US dollars) The Company has a $500,000 commercial paper program supported by a $150,000 bank credit facility ($300,000 at August 29, 2004) with a group of nine banks, which expires on November 15, 2005, and is not expected to be renewed. At August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, no amounts were outstanding under the commercial paper program and no amounts were outstanding under the credit facility. Applicable interest rates on the credit facility at August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, were 3.92% and 1.90%, respectively. A wholly owned Canadian subsidiary has a $167,000 commercial paper program ($152,000 at August 29, 2004) supported by a $50,000 bank credit facility ($46,000 at August 29, 2004) with a Canadian bank, which is guaranteed by the Company and expires in March 2006. At August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, no amounts were outstanding under the Canadian commercial paper program or the bank credit facility. Applicable interest rates on the credit facility at August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, were 4.25% and 3.75%, respectively. At August 28, 2005, standby letters of credit totaling $23,000 issued under the bank credit facility left $27,000 available for commercial paper support. At August 29, 2004, standby letters of credit totaling $21,000 issued under the bank credit facility left $25,000 available for commercial paper support. The Company has agreed to limit the combined amount outstanding under the U.S. and Canadian commercial paper programs to the combined amounts of the supporting bank credit facilities, which are $177,000 at August 28, 2005, decreasing to $27,000 on November 15, 2005. At August 29, 2004, the combined amount of supporting bank credit facilities was $325,000. The Companys wholly owned Japanese subsidiary has a short term $13,694 bank line of credit that expires in February 2006. At August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, $5,477 and $0, respectively, were borrowed under the line of credit, and $3,652 and $2,576, respectively, were used to support standby letters of credit. A second 21 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) $13,694 bank line of credit was entered into in February 2005 that expires in February 2006. At August 28, 2005, $9,129 was borrowed under the second facility; this bank line was not in place at August 29, 2004. Applicable interest rates on the credit facilities at both August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, were .84%. The Companys Korean subsidiary has a short term $11,665 bank line of credit, which expires in January 2006. At August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, no amounts were borrowed under the line of credit and $1,668 and $0, respectively, were used to support standby letters of credit. Applicable interest rates on the credit facility at August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, were 4.51% and 4.52%, respectively. The Companys Taiwan subsidiary has a $7,439 bank revolving credit facility that expires in January 2006. At August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, no amounts were borrowed under the credit facility and $2,495 and $1,165, respectively, were used to support standby letters of credit. A second $15,499 bank revolving credit facility is in place, which expires in July 2006. At August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, no amounts were borrowed under the second credit facility and $790 and $738, respectively were used to support standby letters of credit. Applicable interest rates on the credit facilities at August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, were 3.75% and 3.50%, respectively. The Companys wholly owned United Kingdom subsidiary has a $108,408 bank revolving credit facility expiring in February 2007 and a $63,238 bank overdraft facility renewable on a yearly basis in March 2006. At August 28, 2005, $39,750 was outstanding under the revolving credit facility with an applicable interest rate of 5.30% and no amounts were outstanding under the bank overdraft facility. At August 29, 2004, $21,595 was outstanding under the revolving credit facility with an applicable interest rate of 5.285% and no amounts were outstanding under the bank overdraft facility. Letters of Credit The Company has letter of credit facilities (for commercial and standby letters of credit), totaling approximately $401,933. The outstanding commitments under these facilities at August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004 totaled approximately $131,169 and $166,800, respectively, including approximately $64,532 and $52,900, respectively, in standby letters of credit. Financing Activities The Companys 7 1/8% Senior Notes, carried at $304,350 at August 29, 2004, matured and were repaid on June 15, 2005 from its cash and cash equivalents. In April 2003, the Companys wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.92% in the aggregate amount of $36,516, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due on April 26, 2010. In March 2002, the Company issued $300,000 of 5 1/2% Senior Notes carried at $307,688 due March 15, 2007. Interest is payable semi annually. Simultaneous with the issuance of the Senior Notes, the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements converting the interest from fixed to floating. In February 1996, the Company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a shelf registration statement for $500,000 of senior debt securities. On October 23, 2001, additional debt securities of $100,000 were registered. The $300,000 of 5 1/2% Senior Notes issued in March 2002 reduced the amount of registered securities available for future issuance to $300,000. During fiscal 2005, $280,811 in principal amount of the Companys 3 1/2% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes were converted by note holders into 9,910,011 shares of common stock. 22 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Derivatives The Company has limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and uses them only to manage well defined interest rate and foreign exchange risks. Forward foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on inventory purchases and typically have very short terms. The aggregate amount of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, was $42,466 and $30,495, respectively. The majority of the forward foreign exchange contracts were entered into by the Companys wholly owned United Kingdom subsidiary, primarily to hedge U.S. dollar merchandise inventory purchases. The Company monitors its foreign currency exchange exposures to ensure the overall effectiveness of its foreign currency hedge positions. The only other derivative instruments the Company holds are interest rate swaps, which the Company uses to manage the interest rate risk associated with its borrowings and to manage the Companys mix of fixed rate and variable rate debt. As of August 28, 2005, the Company had fixed to floating interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $300,000 and an aggregate fair value of $7,688, which is recorded in other assets on the Companys consolidated balance sheet. These swaps were entered into effective March 25, 2002, and are designated and qualify as fair value hedges of the Companys $300,000 5 1/2% Senior Notes. As the terms of the swaps match those of the underlying hedged debt, the changes in the fair value of these swaps are offset by corresponding changes in the carrying amount of the hedged debt and result in no net earnings impact. As of August 29, 2004, the Company had fixed to floating interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $600,000 and an aggregate fair value of $25,754. In addition to the Companys swap on the 5 1/2% Senior Notes noted above, the Company had entered into a swap on its $300,000 7 1/8% Senior Notes effective November 13, 2001, which was designated and qualified as a fair value hedge. The $300,000 7 1/8% Senior Notes matured and were repaid on June 15, 2005. Concurrent to this transaction, the related swap agreement expired. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements With the exception of its operating leases, the Company has no off balance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on the Companys financial condition or consolidated financial statements. Stock Repurchase Program On November 30, 2001, the Companys Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program, authorizing the repurchase of up to $500,000 of Costco Common Stock through November 30, 2004. Under the program, the Company could repurchase shares at any time in the open market or in private transactions as market conditions warrant. The repurchased shares would be retired. On October 25, 2004, the Board of Directors renewed the program for another three years. On June 7, 2005 the Company began repurchasing shares on the open market. Through August 28, 2005 the Company has repurchased 9,205,100 shares of common stock at an average price of $44.89, totaling approximately $413,252, including commissions. Subsequent to the Companys fiscal 2005 year end, August 29, 2005, the Board of Directors of Costco authorized an additional stock repurchase program of up to $1,000,000 of Costco common stock. Under the program, which contains no expiration date, the Company may repurchase shares at any time in the open market or in private transactions as market conditions warrant. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the Companys financial statements requires that management make estimates and judgments that affect the financial position and results of operations. Management continues to review its accounting policies and evaluate its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, merchandise inventory, 23 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) impairment of long lived assets and warehouse closing costs and insurance/self insurance liabilities. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the present circumstances. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes sales, net of estimated returns, at the time customers take possession of merchandise or receive services. When the Company collects payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services, the amount received is recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed. The Company provides for estimated sales returns based on historical returns levels. The Company evaluates the criteria of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal Versus Net as an Agent, in determining whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, when Costco is the primary obligor, is subject to inventory risk, has latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, influence product or service specifications, or has several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded on a gross basis. If the Company is not the primary obligor and does not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above, Costco records the net amounts as commissions earned. Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market as determined primarily by the retail method of accounting and are stated using the last in, first out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail method of accounting and are stated using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. The Company believes the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. The Company records an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the expected annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end. At August 28, 2005, merchandise inventories valued at LIFO approximated FIFO after considering the lower of cost or market principle. At August 29, 2004, merchandise inventories valued using LIFO exceeded the comparable FIFO value by approximately $13,410 due to the aggregate effects of deflation. The Company provides for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts on the basis of a percentage of sales. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect the trend of the actual physical inventory count results, which generally occur in the second and fourth fiscal quarters of the Companys fiscal year. Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as the Company progresses towards earning those rebates provided they are probable and reasonably estimable. Other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of agreement, or other systematic and rational approach. Impairment of long lived assets and warehouse closing costs The Company periodically evaluates its long lived assets for indicators of impairment. Managements judgments are based on market and operational conditions at the present time. Future events could cause management to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring an adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value. 24 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) The Company provides estimates for warehouse closing costs, based on the applicable accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Future circumstances may result in the Companys actual future closing costs or the amount recognized upon the sale of the property to differ substantially from the original estimates. Insurance/Self Insurance Liabilities The Company uses a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms to provide for the potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property damage, director and officers liability, vehicle liability and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by the Company are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience and outside expertise, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In May 2005, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, a Replacement of Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 20 and FASB Statement No. 3. SFAS 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements for changes in accounting principles, unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change. SFAS 154 also requires that retrospective application of a change in accounting principle be limited to the direct effects of the change. Indirect effects of a change in accounting principle, such as a change in non discretionary profit sharing payments resulting from an accounting change, should be recognized in the period of the accounting change. SFAS 154 also requires that a change in depreciation, amortization, or depletion method for long lived, non financial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate effected by a change in accounting principle. SFAS 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. Early adoption is permitted for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after the date this Statement is issued. The Company is required to adopt the provisions of SFAS 154, as applicable, beginning in fiscal 2007. The Company does not believe the adoption of SFAS 154 will have a significant effect on its future consolidated financial statements. In March 2005, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, An Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143, which requires an entity to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation when incurred if the liabilitys fair value can be reasonably estimated. The Company adopted the provisions of FIN 47 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. The adoption of this Interpretation did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R, Share based Payments. SFAS 123R revises SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, which the Company adopted as of the beginning of its fiscal 2003, and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. SFAS 123R applies to transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services and also applies to liabilities an entity may incur for goods or services that are based on the fair value of those equity instruments. All employee stock option grants made by the Company since the beginning of fiscal 2003 have been expensed over the related option vesting period based on the fair value at the date the options are granted using the Black Scholes model. Under SFAS 123R, the Company will be required to select a valuation technique or option pricing model that meets the criteria as stated in the standard. Allowable valuation models include a binomial model and the Black Scholes model. The Company is required to adopt the provisions of SFAS 123R in the first quarter of its fiscal 2006. The Company is in the process of assessing the impact on the Companys results of operations from the adoption of SFAS 123R for its effect on prospective option grants. The adoption of SFAS 123R requires the Company to value stock options granted prior to its adoption of SFAS 123 under the fair value 25 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) method and expense these amounts in the income statement over the stock options remaining vesting period. This will result in the Company expensing $13,043 in fiscal 2006, which would previously have been presented in a proforma footnote disclosure. In addition, SFAS 123R will require the Company to reflect the tax savings resulting from tax deductions in excess of expense reflected in its financial statements as a financing cash flow, which will impact the Companys future reported cash flows from operating activities. In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, Inventory Costs An Amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin (ARB) No. 43, Chapter 4. SFAS 151 clarifies that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and spoilage should be expensed as incurred and not included in overhead. Further, SFAS 151 requires that allocation of fixed and production facilities overheads to conversion costs should be based on normal capacity of the production facilities. The provisions in this statement are effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005. The Company does not believe that the adoption of SFAS 151 will have a significant effect on its future consolidated financial statements. In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153, Exchanges of Non monetary Assets An Amendment of APB No. 29. The provisions of this statement are effective for non monetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005. This statement eliminates the exception to fair value for exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchange transactions that do not have commercial substance that is, transactions that are not expected to result in significant changes in the cash flows of the reporting entity. The Company does not believe that the adoption of SFAS 153 will have a significant effect on its future consolidated financial statements. In March 2004, the FASB EITF reached a consensus on EITF Issue No. 03 1, The Meaning of Other Than Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments, (EITF 03 1). The guidance prescribes a three step model for determining whether an investment is other than temporarily impaired and requires disclosures about unrealized losses on investments. The accounting guidance became effective for reporting periods beginning after June 15, 2004, while the disclosure requirements became effective for annual reporting periods ending after June 15, 2004. In September 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) EITF 03 1 1, Effective Date of Paragraphs 10 20 of EITF Issue No. 03 1 The Meaning of Other Than Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments, (FSP EITF 03 1 1). FSP EITF 03 1 1 delayed the effective date for the measurement and recognition guidance contained in paragraphs 10 20 of EITF Issue 03 1. In November 2005, the FASB issued FSP FAS 115 1 and FAS 124 1, The Meaning of Other Than Temporary Impairment and its Application to Certain Investments. This FSP addresses the determination as to when an investment is considered impaired, whether the impairment is other than temporary and the measurement of an impairment loss. This statement specifically nullifies the requirements of paragraph 10 18 of EITF 03 1 and references existing other than temporary impairment guidance. The guidance under this FSP is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2005 and the Company continued to apply relevant other than temporary guidance as provided for in FSP EITF 03 1 1 during fiscal 2005. The Company does not believe that the adoption of the guidance of FSP FAS 115 1 and FAS 124 1 will have a significant effect on its future consolidated financial statements. In November 2003, the EITF reached consensus on Issue No. 03 10, Application of Issue No. 02 16 by Resellers to Sales Incentives Offered to Consumers by Manufacturers, with respect to determining if consideration received by a reseller from a vendor that is reimbursed by the vendor for honoring the vendors sale incentives offered directly to consumers should be recorded as a reduction in sales. These rules apply to transactions entered into by consumers in fiscal periods beginning after November 25, 2003 and, therefore, apply to such transactions starting with the Companys fiscal third quarter of 2004, which began February 16, 2004. The adoption of EITF 03 10 did not affect the Companys consolidated gross profit or net income, but did result in a reduction of both net sales and merchandise costs by an equal amount. Had the first half of fiscal 2004 and all of fiscal 2003 been reported under EITF 03 10 guidance, the sales and cost of sales would have been reduced by approximately $186,900 and $282,300, respectively. 26 Table of Contents Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company is exposed to financial market risk resulting from changes in interest and foreign currency rates. As a policy, the Company does not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions, nor hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. The nature and amount of the Companys long and short term debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As of August 28, 2005, the Companys fixed rate long term debt includes its $415,246 principal amount at maturity Zero Coupon Subordinated Notes carried at $274,071 and additional notes and capital lease obligations totaling $132,141. The Companys debt also includes $300,000 5 1/2% Senior Notes carried at $307,688. The Company has entered into fixed to floating interest rate swaps on the Senior Notes, effectively converting these fixed interest rate securities to variable rate securities. As of August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, the Company had fixed to floating interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $300,000 and $600,000, respectively, and an aggregate fair value of $7,688 and $25,754, respectively. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt and may affect the interest expense related to the variable rate debt. The Company holds interest bearing instruments that are classified as cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. The Companys investment policy is to manage its total cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances to preserve principal and liquidity while maximizing the return on the investment portfolio through the full investment of available funds. The Company diversifies its investment portfolio by investing in multiple types of investment grade securities and through internal management and the use of third party investment managers. Short term investments generally have a maturity of three months to five years from the purchase date. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. As the majority of these instruments are of a short term nature, if interest rates were to increase or decrease immediately, there is no material risk of a valuation adjustment related to these instruments. For those instruments that are classified as available for sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in interest rates are reflected in other accumulated comprehensive income or loss. Based on the Companys cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances at August 28, 2005, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $15,000 to interest income (pre tax) on an annual basis. Most foreign currency transactions have been conducted in local currencies, limiting the Companys exposure to changes in currency rates. The Company periodically enters into short term forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates on inventory purchases. The fair value of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at August 28, 2005 was $42,901. 27 Table of Contents 
 
Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Provision for Income Taxes The effective income tax rate on earnings was 31.4% in fiscal 2005 and 37% in fiscal 2004. The decrease in the effective income tax rate is attributable to a one time $54,155 income tax benefit resulting primarily from the settlement of a transfer pricing dispute between the United States and Canada (covering the years 1996 2003) and a net tax benefit on excess foreign tax credits on unremitted foreign earnings of $20,592. Excluding these benefits the effective income tax rate on earnings in fiscal 2005 was 36.2%. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 and 2004, the effective tax rate was 28.9% and 37.0%, respectively. The decrease in the fourth quarter tax rate for fiscal 2005 is primarily attributable to the net tax benefit of $20,592, noted above, and a tax benefit of $13,895 primarily associated with lower state taxes. The state tax benefit recorded in the fourth quarter was primarily due to a reduction in the estimated effective state tax rate utilized in the first through third quarters of fiscal 2005. Excluding the benefit of these two items, the fourth quarter tax rate for fiscal 2005 would be 35.8%. Comparison of Fiscal 2004 (52 weeks) and Fiscal 2003 (52 weeks): (dollars in thousands, except earnings per share) Net Income Net income for fiscal 2004 increased 22.4% to $882,393, or $1.85 per diluted share, from $721,000, or $1.53 per diluted share during fiscal year 2003. Net Sales Net sales increased 13.1% to $47,145,712 in fiscal 2004 from $41,692,699 in fiscal 2003. Approximately 78% of the increase was due to an increase in comparable warehouse sales, that is sales in warehouses open for at least a year. The balance of the increase was due to opening 20 new warehouses during fiscal 2004 and a net of 23 new warehouses (29 opened, 6 closed) during fiscal 2003, a portion of which is not included in comparable warehouse sales. Net sales were reduced by the implementation of Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 03 10, Application of Issue No. 02 16, Accounting by a Customer (Including a Reseller) for Certain Consideration Received from a Vendor, by Resellers to Sales Incentives Offered to Consumers by Manufacturers, which was effective at the beginning of the Companys fiscal 2004 third quarter. EITF 03 10, which primarily impacts the Companys vendor coupon programs, reduces net sales and merchandise costs by an equal amount and does not affect the Companys consolidated gross margin or net income. Had EITF 03 10 been in effect for the comparable periods in fiscal 2003, the net sales increase in fiscal 2004 would have been 13.8%. (See Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements, EITF 03 10.) For fiscal 2004, comparable sales increased 10% from fiscal 2003. Had EITF 03 10 been in effect for the comparable periods in fiscal 2003, the comparable sales increase for fiscal 2004 would have been 11%. Changes in prices of merchandise did not materially affect the sales increases, with the exception of gasoline, where price increases accounted for a sales increase of approximately 70 basis points. In addition, due to the weaker U.S. dollar throughout fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003, translation of foreign sales into U.S. dollars contributed to the increase in sales, accounting for a comparable sales increase of approximately 190 basis points year over year. Sales were also positively impacted by the supermarket strikes in Southern California during the first half of the Companys 2004 fiscal year. The positive impact to sales for the entire fiscal year was estimated to be 35 to 50 basis points. 17 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Membership Fees Membership fees increased 12.7% to $961,280, or 2.04% of net sales, in fiscal 2004 from $852,853, or 2.05% of net sales, in fiscal 2003. This increase was primarily due to additional membership sign ups at the 20 new warehouses opened in fiscal 2004; increased penetration of the Companys Executive membership, including the rollout of the program into Canada, which began in the first quarter of fiscal 2004; and high overall member renewal rates consistent with recent years, currently at 86%. Gross Margin Gross margin increased 13.4% to $5,053,696, or 10.72% of net sales, in fiscal 2004 from $4,457,316, or 10.69% of net sales, in fiscal 2003. The three basis point increase, as a percent of net sales, reflected a 14 basis point increase in gross margin in the Companys merchandise departments, helped by strong year over year gross margin gains in the Companys ancillary business operations, particularly gasoline and pharmacy. Year over year gross margin, as a percentage of net sales, was also positively impacted by the implementation of EITF 03 10, whereby net sales and merchandise costs were reduced, resulting in an eight basis point increase. The year over year gross margin percentage was reduced by 12 basis points due to the increased rewards related to the Executive Membership Two Percent Reward Program, resulting from an increase in the penetration of the Executive Member program. The gross margin figures reflect accounting for most U.S. merchandise inventories on the LIFO method. Fiscal 2004 included a $6,090 LIFO charge (increase in merchandise costs), while fiscal 2003 included a $19,650 LIFO credit (reduction in merchandise costs). The impact of the LIFO adjustment on a year over year basis negatively impacted margin by an additional six basis points. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses as a percent of net sales decreased to 9.75% during fiscal 2004 from 9.83% during fiscal 2003. Had EITF 03 10 been in effect in fiscal 2003, SG&A expenses as a percent to net sales would have shown additional improvement of seven basis points in fiscal 2004. For fiscal 2004, warehouse and central operating costs positively impacted SG&A comparisons year over year by approximately 21 basis points, primarily due to increased expense leverage of warehouse payroll, benefits (primarily health care), utility and workers compensation costs. During the latter half of fiscal 2004, the Company implemented changes to its employee healthcare plans that reduced its overall healthcare costs, primarily in the fourth quarter. This improvement was partially offset by the seven basis point increase resulting from the adoption of EITF 03 10, a two basis point increase in expense related to the establishment of additional insurance liabilities resulting from financial difficulties being experienced by one of the Companys third party insurance providers, and an increase in stock based compensation costs following the Companys prospective adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, at the beginning of fiscal 2003, of four basis points. Preopening Expenses Preopening expenses totaled $30,451, or 0.07% of net sales, during fiscal 2004 compared to $36,643, or 0.09% of net sales, during fiscal 2003. This reduction was due to fewer warehouse openings. During fiscal 2004, the Company opened 20 new warehouses compared to 29 new warehouses (including 5 relocations) during fiscal 2003. Pre opening expenses also include costs related to remodels and expanded ancillary operations at existing warehouses. 18 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Provision for Impaired Assets and Closing Costs, net The net provision for impaired assets and closing costs was $1,000 in fiscal 2004, compared to $19,500 in fiscal 2003. The provision includes costs related to impairment of long lived assets, future lease obligations of warehouses that have been relocated to new facilities, and losses or gains resulting from the sale of real property. The provision for fiscal 2004 included charges of $16,548 for warehouse closing expenses that were offset by gains of $15,548 on the sale of real property. The provision for fiscal 2003 included charges of $11,836 for warehouse closing expenses, $4,697 for impairment of long lived assets and $2,967 for net losses on the sale of real property. At August 29, 2004, the reserve for warehouse closing costs was $10,367, of which $9,184 related to future lease obligations. This compares to a reserve for warehouse closing costs of $8,609 at August 31, 2003, of which $7,833 related to future lease obligations. Interest Expense Interest expense totaled $36,651 in fiscal 2004, compared to $36,920 in fiscal 2003. Interest expense in both fiscal 2004 and 2003 includes interest on the 3 1/2% Zero Coupon Notes, 7 1/8% and 5 1/2% Senior Notes and on balances outstanding under the Companys bank credit facilities and promissory notes. The decrease was primarily a result of the Companys reduction in short term borrowings, principally related to its foreign subsidiaries. This decrease was substantially offset by increases in interest rates on the Senior Notes due to interest rate swap agreements converting the interest rate from fixed to floating. Interest Income and Other Interest income and other totaled $51,627 in fiscal 2004, compared to $38,525 in fiscal 2003. The increase primarily reflects greater interest earned on higher cash and cash equivalents balances and short term investments. In addition, a reduction in the expense to record minority interest in the earnings of foreign subsidiaries was reported in fiscal 2004 as the Company increased its ownership in Costco Wholesale UK Limited to 100%. Provision for Income Taxes The effective income tax rate on earnings was 37% in fiscal 2004 and 37.75% in fiscal 2003. The decrease in the effective income tax rate is primarily attributable to lower statutory income tax rates for foreign operations and one time benefits associated with certain tax planning strategies. Liquidity and Capital Resources (dollars in thousands, except per share amounts) Cash Flows The Companys primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from warehouse operations and our existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances, which were $3,459,857 and $3,129,882 at August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, respectively. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $1,783,177 in fiscal 2005 compared to $2,098,783 in fiscal 2004, a decrease of $315,606. Higher net income and a decrease in net merchandise inventories (merchandise inventory less accounts payable) year over year increased cash flow from operating activities by $391,571. This increase was offset by decreases in cash flow from operating assets and liabilities of $706,855, primarily relating to the timing in the collection of certain receivables and in payments of income taxes in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004. A significant component of net cash used in investing activities continues to be the purchase of property and equipment related to the Companys warehouse expansion and remodel projects. Net cash used in investing activities totaled $2,058,729 in fiscal 2005 compared to $1,048,481 in fiscal 2004, an increase of $1,010,248. The increase in investing activities primarily relates to an increase in the net investment in short term investments of $768,596 and an increase in additions to property and equipment of $289,811 in fiscal 2005 over fiscal 2004. 19 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Net cash used in financing activities totaled $518,651 in fiscal 2005 compared to $209,569 provided by financing activities in fiscal 2004. The decrease of $728,220 primarily resulted from an increase in the repayment of debt of $297,275 primarily relating to the repayment of the 7 1/8% Senior Notes, which matured on June 15, 2005, and repurchases of common stock of $413,252 under the Companys $500,000 share repurchase program. Dividends Costcos Board of Directors declared four quarterly cash dividends during fiscal year 2005. The first two dividends of $0.10 per share were paid November 26, 2004 and February 25, 2005, to shareholders of record at the close of business on November 5, 2004 and February 8, 2005, respectively. The third and fourth dividends of $0.115 per share were paid May 27, 2005 and August 26, 2005 to shareholders of record at the close of business on May 6, 2005 and August 5, 2005, respectively. In fiscal 2004 the Company paid dividends of $0.10 per share in the third and fourth quarters. Contractual Obligations The Companys commitment to make future payments under contractual obligations was as follows, as of August 28, 2005. Payments Due by Period Contractual obligations  Total Less than1 year 1 to 3years 4 to 5years After5 years Long term debt(1)(2) $ 879,520 $ 18,064 $ 379,466 $ 65,437 $ 416,553 Capital lease obligations 6,591 3,225 1,305 927 1,134 Operating leases(3) 1,562,267 114,682 219,402 189,188 1,038,995 Purchase obligations (merchandise)(4) 3,049,398 3,048,785 613 Purchase obligations (building, equipment, services and other)(5) 242,361 230,086 12,275 Other(6) 8,591 1,354 1,692 1,362 4,183 Total $ 5,748,728 $ 3,416,196 $ 614,753 $ 256,914 $ 1,460,865 (1) Amounts include contractual interest payments. (2) The amount includes interest accreted to maturity for the Companys Zero Coupon 3 1/2% Convertible Subordinated Notes due August 2017, totaling $415,246. The consolidated balance sheet as of August 28, 2005 reflects a balance outstanding of $274,071. (3) Operating lease obligations have been reduced by $168,742 to reflect sub lease income. (4) Includes open merchandise purchase orders at fiscal year end. (5) The amounts exclude minor outsourced services negotiated at the individual warehouse level that are not significant and generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty. (6) Consists of asset retirement and deferred compensation obligations. Expansion Plans Costcos primary requirement for capital is the financing of the land, building and equipment costs for new warehouses plus the costs of initial warehouse operations and working capital requirements, as well as additional capital for international expansion. 20 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) While there can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized, and plans are subject to change upon further review, it is managements current intention to spend approximately $1,100,000 to $1,250,000 during fiscal 2006 in the United States and Canada for real estate, construction, remodeling and equipment for warehouse clubs and related operations; and approximately $100,000 to $150,000 for international expansion, including the United Kingdom, Asia, Mexico and other potential ventures. These expenditures are expected to be financed with a combination of cash provided from operations and the use of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. Expansion plans for the United States and Canada during fiscal 2006 are to open approximately 28 30 new warehouse clubs on a net basis, inclusive of two to three relocations to larger and better located warehouses. The Company expects to continue its review of expansion plans in its international operations, including the United Kingdom and Asia, along with other international markets. At present, the Company is planning to open three additional warehouses in the U.K during fiscal 2006. Costco Mexico plans to open two to three new warehouse clubs during fiscal 2006. Additional Equity Investments in Subsidiaries and Joint Ventures On June 30, 2005, the Company acquired the remaining 4% interest in CWC Travel Inc for $3,961, bringing Costcos ownership in this entity to 100%. In addition, during fiscal 2005 the Company contributed an additional $15,000 to its investment in Costco Mexico (a 50% owned joint venture), which did not impact its percentage ownership of this entity as the joint venture partner contributed a like amount. On October 3, 2003, the Company acquired from Carrefour Nederland B.V. its 20% equity interest in Costco Wholesale UK Limited for cash of $95,153, bringing Costcos ownership in Costco Wholesale UK Limited to 100%. Bank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs (all amounts stated in thousands of US dollars) The Company has a $500,000 commercial paper program supported by a $150,000 bank credit facility ($300,000 at August 29, 2004) with a group of nine banks, which expires on November 15, 2005, and is not expected to be renewed. At August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, no amounts were outstanding under the commercial paper program and no amounts were outstanding under the credit facility. Applicable interest rates on the credit facility at August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, were 3.92% and 1.90%, respectively. A wholly owned Canadian subsidiary has a $167,000 commercial paper program ($152,000 at August 29, 2004) supported by a $50,000 bank credit facility ($46,000 at August 29, 2004) with a Canadian bank, which is guaranteed by the Company and expires in March 2006. At August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, no amounts were outstanding under the Canadian commercial paper program or the bank credit facility. Applicable interest rates on the credit facility at August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, were 4.25% and 3.75%, respectively. At August 28, 2005, standby letters of credit totaling $23,000 issued under the bank credit facility left $27,000 available for commercial paper support. At August 29, 2004, standby letters of credit totaling $21,000 issued under the bank credit facility left $25,000 available for commercial paper support. The Company has agreed to limit the combined amount outstanding under the U.S. and Canadian commercial paper programs to the combined amounts of the supporting bank credit facilities, which are $177,000 at August 28, 2005, decreasing to $27,000 on November 15, 2005. At August 29, 2004, the combined amount of supporting bank credit facilities was $325,000. The Companys wholly owned Japanese subsidiary has a short term $13,694 bank line of credit that expires in February 2006. At August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, $5,477 and $0, respectively, were borrowed under the line of credit, and $3,652 and $2,576, respectively, were used to support standby letters of credit. A second 21 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) $13,694 bank line of credit was entered into in February 2005 that expires in February 2006. At August 28, 2005, $9,129 was borrowed under the second facility; this bank line was not in place at August 29, 2004. Applicable interest rates on the credit facilities at both August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, were .84%. The Companys Korean subsidiary has a short term $11,665 bank line of credit, which expires in January 2006. At August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, no amounts were borrowed under the line of credit and $1,668 and $0, respectively, were used to support standby letters of credit. Applicable interest rates on the credit facility at August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, were 4.51% and 4.52%, respectively. The Companys Taiwan subsidiary has a $7,439 bank revolving credit facility that expires in January 2006. At August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, no amounts were borrowed under the credit facility and $2,495 and $1,165, respectively, were used to support standby letters of credit. A second $15,499 bank revolving credit facility is in place, which expires in July 2006. At August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, no amounts were borrowed under the second credit facility and $790 and $738, respectively were used to support standby letters of credit. Applicable interest rates on the credit facilities at August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, were 3.75% and 3.50%, respectively. The Companys wholly owned United Kingdom subsidiary has a $108,408 bank revolving credit facility expiring in February 2007 and a $63,238 bank overdraft facility renewable on a yearly basis in March 2006. At August 28, 2005, $39,750 was outstanding under the revolving credit facility with an applicable interest rate of 5.30% and no amounts were outstanding under the bank overdraft facility. At August 29, 2004, $21,595 was outstanding under the revolving credit facility with an applicable interest rate of 5.285% and no amounts were outstanding under the bank overdraft facility. Letters of Credit The Company has letter of credit facilities (for commercial and standby letters of credit), totaling approximately $401,933. The outstanding commitments under these facilities at August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004 totaled approximately $131,169 and $166,800, respectively, including approximately $64,532 and $52,900, respectively, in standby letters of credit. Financing Activities The Companys 7 1/8% Senior Notes, carried at $304,350 at August 29, 2004, matured and were repaid on June 15, 2005 from its cash and cash equivalents. In April 2003, the Companys wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.92% in the aggregate amount of $36,516, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due on April 26, 2010. In March 2002, the Company issued $300,000 of 5 1/2% Senior Notes carried at $307,688 due March 15, 2007. Interest is payable semi annually. Simultaneous with the issuance of the Senior Notes, the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements converting the interest from fixed to floating. In February 1996, the Company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a shelf registration statement for $500,000 of senior debt securities. On October 23, 2001, additional debt securities of $100,000 were registered. The $300,000 of 5 1/2% Senior Notes issued in March 2002 reduced the amount of registered securities available for future issuance to $300,000. During fiscal 2005, $280,811 in principal amount of the Companys 3 1/2% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes were converted by note holders into 9,910,011 shares of common stock. 22 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Derivatives The Company has limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and uses them only to manage well defined interest rate and foreign exchange risks. Forward foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on inventory purchases and typically have very short terms. The aggregate amount of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, was $42,466 and $30,495, respectively. The majority of the forward foreign exchange contracts were entered into by the Companys wholly owned United Kingdom subsidiary, primarily to hedge U.S. dollar merchandise inventory purchases. The Company monitors its foreign currency exchange exposures to ensure the overall effectiveness of its foreign currency hedge positions. The only other derivative instruments the Company holds are interest rate swaps, which the Company uses to manage the interest rate risk associated with its borrowings and to manage the Companys mix of fixed rate and variable rate debt. As of August 28, 2005, the Company had fixed to floating interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $300,000 and an aggregate fair value of $7,688, which is recorded in other assets on the Companys consolidated balance sheet. These swaps were entered into effective March 25, 2002, and are designated and qualify as fair value hedges of the Companys $300,000 5 1/2% Senior Notes. As the terms of the swaps match those of the underlying hedged debt, the changes in the fair value of these swaps are offset by corresponding changes in the carrying amount of the hedged debt and result in no net earnings impact. As of August 29, 2004, the Company had fixed to floating interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $600,000 and an aggregate fair value of $25,754. In addition to the Companys swap on the 5 1/2% Senior Notes noted above, the Company had entered into a swap on its $300,000 7 1/8% Senior Notes effective November 13, 2001, which was designated and qualified as a fair value hedge. The $300,000 7 1/8% Senior Notes matured and were repaid on June 15, 2005. Concurrent to this transaction, the related swap agreement expired. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements With the exception of its operating leases, the Company has no off balance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on the Companys financial condition or consolidated financial statements. Stock Repurchase Program On November 30, 2001, the Companys Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program, authorizing the repurchase of up to $500,000 of Costco Common Stock through November 30, 2004. Under the program, the Company could repurchase shares at any time in the open market or in private transactions as market conditions warrant. The repurchased shares would be retired. On October 25, 2004, the Board of Directors renewed the program for another three years. On June 7, 2005 the Company began repurchasing shares on the open market. Through August 28, 2005 the Company has repurchased 9,205,100 shares of common stock at an average price of $44.89, totaling approximately $413,252, including commissions. Subsequent to the Companys fiscal 2005 year end, August 29, 2005, the Board of Directors of Costco authorized an additional stock repurchase program of up to $1,000,000 of Costco common stock. Under the program, which contains no expiration date, the Company may repurchase shares at any time in the open market or in private transactions as market conditions warrant. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the Companys financial statements requires that management make estimates and judgments that affect the financial position and results of operations. Management continues to review its accounting policies and evaluate its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, merchandise inventory, 23 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) impairment of long lived assets and warehouse closing costs and insurance/self insurance liabilities. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the present circumstances. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes sales, net of estimated returns, at the time customers take possession of merchandise or receive services. When the Company collects payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services, the amount received is recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed. The Company provides for estimated sales returns based on historical returns levels. The Company evaluates the criteria of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal Versus Net as an Agent, in determining whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, when Costco is the primary obligor, is subject to inventory risk, has latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, influence product or service specifications, or has several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded on a gross basis. If the Company is not the primary obligor and does not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above, Costco records the net amounts as commissions earned. Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market as determined primarily by the retail method of accounting and are stated using the last in, first out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail method of accounting and are stated using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. The Company believes the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. The Company records an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the expected annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end. At August 28, 2005, merchandise inventories valued at LIFO approximated FIFO after considering the lower of cost or market principle. At August 29, 2004, merchandise inventories valued using LIFO exceeded the comparable FIFO value by approximately $13,410 due to the aggregate effects of deflation. The Company provides for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts on the basis of a percentage of sales. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect the trend of the actual physical inventory count results, which generally occur in the second and fourth fiscal quarters of the Companys fiscal year. Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as the Company progresses towards earning those rebates provided they are probable and reasonably estimable. Other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of agreement, or other systematic and rational approach. Impairment of long lived assets and warehouse closing costs The Company periodically evaluates its long lived assets for indicators of impairment. Managements judgments are based on market and operational conditions at the present time. Future events could cause management to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring an adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value. 24 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) The Company provides estimates for warehouse closing costs, based on the applicable accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Future circumstances may result in the Companys actual future closing costs or the amount recognized upon the sale of the property to differ substantially from the original estimates. Insurance/Self Insurance Liabilities The Company uses a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms to provide for the potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property damage, director and officers liability, vehicle liability and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by the Company are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience and outside expertise, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In May 2005, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, a Replacement of Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 20 and FASB Statement No. 3. SFAS 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements for changes in accounting principles, unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change. SFAS 154 also requires that retrospective application of a change in accounting principle be limited to the direct effects of the change. Indirect effects of a change in accounting principle, such as a change in non discretionary profit sharing payments resulting from an accounting change, should be recognized in the period of the accounting change. SFAS 154 also requires that a change in depreciation, amortization, or depletion method for long lived, non financial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate effected by a change in accounting principle. SFAS 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. Early adoption is permitted for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after the date this Statement is issued. The Company is required to adopt the provisions of SFAS 154, as applicable, beginning in fiscal 2007. The Company does not believe the adoption of SFAS 154 will have a significant effect on its future consolidated financial statements. In March 2005, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, An Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143, which requires an entity to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation when incurred if the liabilitys fair value can be reasonably estimated. The Company adopted the provisions of FIN 47 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. The adoption of this Interpretation did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R, Share based Payments. SFAS 123R revises SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, which the Company adopted as of the beginning of its fiscal 2003, and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. SFAS 123R applies to transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services and also applies to liabilities an entity may incur for goods or services that are based on the fair value of those equity instruments. All employee stock option grants made by the Company since the beginning of fiscal 2003 have been expensed over the related option vesting period based on the fair value at the date the options are granted using the Black Scholes model. Under SFAS 123R, the Company will be required to select a valuation technique or option pricing model that meets the criteria as stated in the standard. Allowable valuation models include a binomial model and the Black Scholes model. The Company is required to adopt the provisions of SFAS 123R in the first quarter of its fiscal 2006. The Company is in the process of assessing the impact on the Companys results of operations from the adoption of SFAS 123R for its effect on prospective option grants. The adoption of SFAS 123R requires the Company to value stock options granted prior to its adoption of SFAS 123 under the fair value 25 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) method and expense these amounts in the income statement over the stock options remaining vesting period. This will result in the Company expensing $13,043 in fiscal 2006, which would previously have been presented in a proforma footnote disclosure. In addition, SFAS 123R will require the Company to reflect the tax savings resulting from tax deductions in excess of expense reflected in its financial statements as a financing cash flow, which will impact the Companys future reported cash flows from operating activities. In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, Inventory Costs An Amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin (ARB) No. 43, Chapter 4. SFAS 151 clarifies that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and spoilage should be expensed as incurred and not included in overhead. Further, SFAS 151 requires that allocation of fixed and production facilities overheads to conversion costs should be based on normal capacity of the production facilities. The provisions in this statement are effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005. The Company does not believe that the adoption of SFAS 151 will have a significant effect on its future consolidated financial statements. In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153, Exchanges of Non monetary Assets An Amendment of APB No. 29. The provisions of this statement are effective for non monetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005. This statement eliminates the exception to fair value for exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchange transactions that do not have commercial substance that is, transactions that are not expected to result in significant changes in the cash flows of the reporting entity. The Company does not believe that the adoption of SFAS 153 will have a significant effect on its future consolidated financial statements. In March 2004, the FASB EITF reached a consensus on EITF Issue No. 03 1, The Meaning of Other Than Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments, (EITF 03 1). The guidance prescribes a three step model for determining whether an investment is other than temporarily impaired and requires disclosures about unrealized losses on investments. The accounting guidance became effective for reporting periods beginning after June 15, 2004, while the disclosure requirements became effective for annual reporting periods ending after June 15, 2004. In September 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) EITF 03 1 1, Effective Date of Paragraphs 10 20 of EITF Issue No. 03 1 The Meaning of Other Than Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments, (FSP EITF 03 1 1). FSP EITF 03 1 1 delayed the effective date for the measurement and recognition guidance contained in paragraphs 10 20 of EITF Issue 03 1. In November 2005, the FASB issued FSP FAS 115 1 and FAS 124 1, The Meaning of Other Than Temporary Impairment and its Application to Certain Investments. This FSP addresses the determination as to when an investment is considered impaired, whether the impairment is other than temporary and the measurement of an impairment loss. This statement specifically nullifies the requirements of paragraph 10 18 of EITF 03 1 and references existing other than temporary impairment guidance. The guidance under this FSP is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2005 and the Company continued to apply relevant other than temporary guidance as provided for in FSP EITF 03 1 1 during fiscal 2005. The Company does not believe that the adoption of the guidance of FSP FAS 115 1 and FAS 124 1 will have a significant effect on its future consolidated financial statements. In November 2003, the EITF reached consensus on Issue No. 03 10, Application of Issue No. 02 16 by Resellers to Sales Incentives Offered to Consumers by Manufacturers, with respect to determining if consideration received by a reseller from a vendor that is reimbursed by the vendor for honoring the vendors sale incentives offered directly to consumers should be recorded as a reduction in sales. These rules apply to transactions entered into by consumers in fiscal periods beginning after November 25, 2003 and, therefore, apply to such transactions starting with the Companys fiscal third quarter of 2004, which began February 16, 2004. The adoption of EITF 03 10 did not affect the Companys consolidated gross profit or net income, but did result in a reduction of both net sales and merchandise costs by an equal amount. Had the first half of fiscal 2004 and all of fiscal 2003 been reported under EITF 03 10 guidance, the sales and cost of sales would have been reduced by approximately $186,900 and $282,300, respectively. 26 Table of Contents Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company is exposed to financial market risk resulting from changes in interest and foreign currency rates. As a policy, the Company does not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions, nor hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. The nature and amount of the Companys long and short term debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As of August 28, 2005, the Companys fixed rate long term debt includes its $415,246 principal amount at maturity Zero Coupon Subordinated Notes carried at $274,071 and additional notes and capital lease obligations totaling $132,141. The Companys debt also includes $300,000 5 1/2% Senior Notes carried at $307,688. The Company has entered into fixed to floating interest rate swaps on the Senior Notes, effectively converting these fixed interest rate securities to variable rate securities. As of August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, the Company had fixed to floating interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $300,000 and $600,000, respectively, and an aggregate fair value of $7,688 and $25,754, respectively. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt and may affect the interest expense related to the variable rate debt. The Company holds interest bearing instruments that are classified as cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. The Companys investment policy is to manage its total cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances to preserve principal and liquidity while maximizing the return on the investment portfolio through the full investment of available funds. The Company diversifies its investment portfolio by investing in multiple types of investment grade securities and through internal management and the use of third party investment managers. Short term investments generally have a maturity of three months to five years from the purchase date. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. As the majority of these instruments are of a short term nature, if interest rates were to increase or decrease immediately, there is no material risk of a valuation adjustment related to these instruments. For those instruments that are classified as available for sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in interest rates are reflected in other accumulated comprehensive income or loss. Based on the Companys cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances at August 28, 2005, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $15,000 to interest income (pre tax) on an annual basis. Most foreign currency transactions have been conducted in local currencies, limiting the Companys exposure to changes in currency rates. The Company periodically enters into short term forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates on inventory purchases. The fair value of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at August 28, 2005 was $42,901. 27 Table of Contents 
 
Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Membership Fees Membership fees increased 12.7% to $961,280, or 2.04% of net sales, in fiscal 2004 from $852,853, or 2.05% of net sales, in fiscal 2003. This increase was primarily due to additional membership sign ups at the 20 new warehouses opened in fiscal 2004; increased penetration of the Companys Executive membership, including the rollout of the program into Canada, which began in the first quarter of fiscal 2004; and high overall member renewal rates consistent with recent years, currently at 86%. Gross Margin Gross margin increased 13.4% to $5,053,696, or 10.72% of net sales, in fiscal 2004 from $4,457,316, or 10.69% of net sales, in fiscal 2003. The three basis point increase, as a percent of net sales, reflected a 14 basis point increase in gross margin in the Companys merchandise departments, helped by strong year over year gross margin gains in the Companys ancillary business operations, particularly gasoline and pharmacy. Year over year gross margin, as a percentage of net sales, was also positively impacted by the implementation of EITF 03 10, whereby net sales and merchandise costs were reduced, resulting in an eight basis point increase. The year over year gross margin percentage was reduced by 12 basis points due to the increased rewards related to the Executive Membership Two Percent Reward Program, resulting from an increase in the penetration of the Executive Member program. The gross margin figures reflect accounting for most U.S. merchandise inventories on the LIFO method. Fiscal 2004 included a $6,090 LIFO charge (increase in merchandise costs), while fiscal 2003 included a $19,650 LIFO credit (reduction in merchandise costs). The impact of the LIFO adjustment on a year over year basis negatively impacted margin by an additional six basis points. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses as a percent of net sales decreased to 9.75% during fiscal 2004 from 9.83% during fiscal 2003. Had EITF 03 10 been in effect in fiscal 2003, SG&A expenses as a percent to net sales would have shown additional improvement of seven basis points in fiscal 2004. For fiscal 2004, warehouse and central operating costs positively impacted SG&A comparisons year over year by approximately 21 basis points, primarily due to increased expense leverage of warehouse payroll, benefits (primarily health care), utility and workers compensation costs. During the latter half of fiscal 2004, the Company implemented changes to its employee healthcare plans that reduced its overall healthcare costs, primarily in the fourth quarter. This improvement was partially offset by the seven basis point increase resulting from the adoption of EITF 03 10, a two basis point increase in expense related to the establishment of additional insurance liabilities resulting from financial difficulties being experienced by one of the Companys third party insurance providers, and an increase in stock based compensation costs following the Companys prospective adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, at the beginning of fiscal 2003, of four basis points. Preopening Expenses Preopening expenses totaled $30,451, or 0.07% of net sales, during fiscal 2004 compared to $36,643, or 0.09% of net sales, during fiscal 2003. This reduction was due to fewer warehouse openings. During fiscal 2004, the Company opened 20 new warehouses compared to 29 new warehouses (including 5 relocations) during fiscal 2003. Pre opening expenses also include costs related to remodels and expanded ancillary operations at existing warehouses. 18 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Provision for Impaired Assets and Closing Costs, net The net provision for impaired assets and closing costs was $1,000 in fiscal 2004, compared to $19,500 in fiscal 2003. The provision includes costs related to impairment of long lived assets, future lease obligations of warehouses that have been relocated to new facilities, and losses or gains resulting from the sale of real property. The provision for fiscal 2004 included charges of $16,548 for warehouse closing expenses that were offset by gains of $15,548 on the sale of real property. The provision for fiscal 2003 included charges of $11,836 for warehouse closing expenses, $4,697 for impairment of long lived assets and $2,967 for net losses on the sale of real property. At August 29, 2004, the reserve for warehouse closing costs was $10,367, of which $9,184 related to future lease obligations. This compares to a reserve for warehouse closing costs of $8,609 at August 31, 2003, of which $7,833 related to future lease obligations. Interest Expense Interest expense totaled $36,651 in fiscal 2004, compared to $36,920 in fiscal 2003. Interest expense in both fiscal 2004 and 2003 includes interest on the 3 1/2% Zero Coupon Notes, 7 1/8% and 5 1/2% Senior Notes and on balances outstanding under the Companys bank credit facilities and promissory notes. The decrease was primarily a result of the Companys reduction in short term borrowings, principally related to its foreign subsidiaries. This decrease was substantially offset by increases in interest rates on the Senior Notes due to interest rate swap agreements converting the interest rate from fixed to floating. Interest Income and Other Interest income and other totaled $51,627 in fiscal 2004, compared to $38,525 in fiscal 2003. The increase primarily reflects greater interest earned on higher cash and cash equivalents balances and short term investments. In addition, a reduction in the expense to record minority interest in the earnings of foreign subsidiaries was reported in fiscal 2004 as the Company increased its ownership in Costco Wholesale UK Limited to 100%. Provision for Income Taxes The effective income tax rate on earnings was 37% in fiscal 2004 and 37.75% in fiscal 2003. The decrease in the effective income tax rate is primarily attributable to lower statutory income tax rates for foreign operations and one time benefits associated with certain tax planning strategies. Liquidity and Capital Resources (dollars in thousands, except per share amounts) Cash Flows The Companys primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from warehouse operations and our existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances, which were $3,459,857 and $3,129,882 at August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, respectively. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $1,783,177 in fiscal 2005 compared to $2,098,783 in fiscal 2004, a decrease of $315,606. Higher net income and a decrease in net merchandise inventories (merchandise inventory less accounts payable) year over year increased cash flow from operating activities by $391,571. This increase was offset by decreases in cash flow from operating assets and liabilities of $706,855, primarily relating to the timing in the collection of certain receivables and in payments of income taxes in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004. A significant component of net cash used in investing activities continues to be the purchase of property and equipment related to the Companys warehouse expansion and remodel projects. Net cash used in investing activities totaled $2,058,729 in fiscal 2005 compared to $1,048,481 in fiscal 2004, an increase of $1,010,248. The increase in investing activities primarily relates to an increase in the net investment in short term investments of $768,596 and an increase in additions to property and equipment of $289,811 in fiscal 2005 over fiscal 2004. 19 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Net cash used in financing activities totaled $518,651 in fiscal 2005 compared to $209,569 provided by financing activities in fiscal 2004. The decrease of $728,220 primarily resulted from an increase in the repayment of debt of $297,275 primarily relating to the repayment of the 7 1/8% Senior Notes, which matured on June 15, 2005, and repurchases of common stock of $413,252 under the Companys $500,000 share repurchase program. Dividends Costcos Board of Directors declared four quarterly cash dividends during fiscal year 2005. The first two dividends of $0.10 per share were paid November 26, 2004 and February 25, 2005, to shareholders of record at the close of business on November 5, 2004 and February 8, 2005, respectively. The third and fourth dividends of $0.115 per share were paid May 27, 2005 and August 26, 2005 to shareholders of record at the close of business on May 6, 2005 and August 5, 2005, respectively. In fiscal 2004 the Company paid dividends of $0.10 per share in the third and fourth quarters. Contractual Obligations The Companys commitment to make future payments under contractual obligations was as follows, as of August 28, 2005. Payments Due by Period Contractual obligations  Total Less than1 year 1 to 3years 4 to 5years After5 years Long term debt(1)(2) $ 879,520 $ 18,064 $ 379,466 $ 65,437 $ 416,553 Capital lease obligations 6,591 3,225 1,305 927 1,134 Operating leases(3) 1,562,267 114,682 219,402 189,188 1,038,995 Purchase obligations (merchandise)(4) 3,049,398 3,048,785 613 Purchase obligations (building, equipment, services and other)(5) 242,361 230,086 12,275 Other(6) 8,591 1,354 1,692 1,362 4,183 Total $ 5,748,728 $ 3,416,196 $ 614,753 $ 256,914 $ 1,460,865 (1) Amounts include contractual interest payments.

The consolidated balance sheet as of August 28, 2005 reflects a balance outstanding of $274,071. (3) Operating lease obligations have been reduced by $168,742 to reflect sub lease income. (4) Includes open merchandise purchase orders at fiscal year end. (5) The amounts exclude minor outsourced services negotiated at the individual warehouse level that are not significant and generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty. (6) Consists of asset retirement and deferred compensation obligations. Expansion Plans Costcos primary requirement for capital is the financing of the land, building and equipment costs for new warehouses plus the costs of initial warehouse operations and working capital requirements, as well as additional capital for international expansion. 20 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) While there can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized, and plans are subject to change upon further review, it is managements current intention to spend approximately $1,100,000 to $1,250,000 during fiscal 2006 in the United States and Canada for real estate, construction, remodeling and equipment for warehouse clubs and related operations; and approximately $100,000 to $150,000 for international expansion, including the United Kingdom, Asia, Mexico and other potential ventures. These expenditures are expected to be financed with a combination of cash provided from operations and the use of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. Expansion plans for the United States and Canada during fiscal 2006 are to open approximately 28 30 new warehouse clubs on a net basis, inclusive of two to three relocations to larger and better located warehouses. The Company expects to continue its review of expansion plans in its international operations, including the United Kingdom and Asia, along with other international markets. At present, the Company is planning to open three additional warehouses in the U.K during fiscal 2006. Costco Mexico plans to open two to three new warehouse clubs during fiscal 2006. Additional Equity Investments in Subsidiaries and Joint Ventures On June 30, 2005, the Company acquired the remaining 4% interest in CWC Travel Inc for $3,961, bringing Costcos ownership in this entity to 100%. In addition, during fiscal 2005 the Company contributed an additional $15,000 to its investment in Costco Mexico (a 50% owned joint venture), which did not impact its percentage ownership of this entity as the joint venture partner contributed a like amount. On October 3, 2003, the Company acquired from Carrefour Nederland B.V. its 20% equity interest in Costco Wholesale UK Limited for cash of $95,153, bringing Costcos ownership in Costco Wholesale UK Limited to 100%. Bank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs (all amounts stated in thousands of US dollars) The Company has a $500,000 commercial paper program supported by a $150,000 bank credit facility ($300,000 at August 29, 2004) with a group of nine banks, which expires on November 15, 2005, and is not expected to be renewed. At August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, no amounts were outstanding under the commercial paper program and no amounts were outstanding under the credit facility. Applicable interest rates on the credit facility at August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, were 3.92% and 1.90%, respectively. A wholly owned Canadian subsidiary has a $167,000 commercial paper program ($152,000 at August 29, 2004) supported by a $50,000 bank credit facility ($46,000 at August 29, 2004) with a Canadian bank, which is guaranteed by the Company and expires in March 2006. At August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, no amounts were outstanding under the Canadian commercial paper program or the bank credit facility. Applicable interest rates on the credit facility at August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, were 4.25% and 3.75%, respectively. At August 28, 2005, standby letters of credit totaling $23,000 issued under the bank credit facility left $27,000 available for commercial paper support. At August 29, 2004, standby letters of credit totaling $21,000 issued under the bank credit facility left $25,000 available for commercial paper support. The Company has agreed to limit the combined amount outstanding under the U.S. and Canadian commercial paper programs to the combined amounts of the supporting bank credit facilities, which are $177,000 at August 28, 2005, decreasing to $27,000 on November 15, 2005. At August 29, 2004, the combined amount of supporting bank credit facilities was $325,000. The Companys wholly owned Japanese subsidiary has a short term $13,694 bank line of credit that expires in February 2006. At August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, $5,477 and $0, respectively, were borrowed under the line of credit, and $3,652 and $2,576, respectively, were used to support standby letters of credit. A second 21 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) $13,694 bank line of credit was entered into in February 2005 that expires in February 2006. At August 28, 2005, $9,129 was borrowed under the second facility; this bank line was not in place at August 29, 2004. Applicable interest rates on the credit facilities at both August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, were .84%. The Companys Korean subsidiary has a short term $11,665 bank line of credit, which expires in January 2006. At August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, no amounts were borrowed under the line of credit and $1,668 and $0, respectively, were used to support standby letters of credit. Applicable interest rates on the credit facility at August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, were 4.51% and 4.52%, respectively. The Companys Taiwan subsidiary has a $7,439 bank revolving credit facility that expires in January 2006. At August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, no amounts were borrowed under the credit facility and $2,495 and $1,165, respectively, were used to support standby letters of credit. A second $15,499 bank revolving credit facility is in place, which expires in July 2006. At August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, no amounts were borrowed under the second credit facility and $790 and $738, respectively were used to support standby letters of credit. Applicable interest rates on the credit facilities at August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, were 3.75% and 3.50%, respectively. The Companys wholly owned United Kingdom subsidiary has a $108,408 bank revolving credit facility expiring in February 2007 and a $63,238 bank overdraft facility renewable on a yearly basis in March 2006. At August 28, 2005, $39,750 was outstanding under the revolving credit facility with an applicable interest rate of 5.30% and no amounts were outstanding under the bank overdraft facility. At August 29, 2004, $21,595 was outstanding under the revolving credit facility with an applicable interest rate of 5.285% and no amounts were outstanding under the bank overdraft facility. Letters of Credit The Company has letter of credit facilities (for commercial and standby letters of credit), totaling approximately $401,933. The outstanding commitments under these facilities at August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004 totaled approximately $131,169 and $166,800, respectively, including approximately $64,532 and $52,900, respectively, in standby letters of credit. Financing Activities The Companys 7 1/8% Senior Notes, carried at $304,350 at August 29, 2004, matured and were repaid on June 15, 2005 from its cash and cash equivalents. In April 2003, the Companys wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.92% in the aggregate amount of $36,516, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due on April 26, 2010. In March 2002, the Company issued $300,000 of 5 1/2% Senior Notes carried at $307,688 due March 15, 2007. Interest is payable semi annually. Simultaneous with the issuance of the Senior Notes, the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements converting the interest from fixed to floating. In February 1996, the Company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a shelf registration statement for $500,000 of senior debt securities. On October 23, 2001, additional debt securities of $100,000 were registered. The $300,000 of 5 1/2% Senior Notes issued in March 2002 reduced the amount of registered securities available for future issuance to $300,000. During fiscal 2005, $280,811 in principal amount of the Companys 3 1/2% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes were converted by note holders into 9,910,011 shares of common stock. 22 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Derivatives The Company has limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and uses them only to manage well defined interest rate and foreign exchange risks. Forward foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on inventory purchases and typically have very short terms. The aggregate amount of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, was $42,466 and $30,495, respectively. The majority of the forward foreign exchange contracts were entered into by the Companys wholly owned United Kingdom subsidiary, primarily to hedge U.S. dollar merchandise inventory purchases. The Company monitors its foreign currency exchange exposures to ensure the overall effectiveness of its foreign currency hedge positions. The only other derivative instruments the Company holds are interest rate swaps, which the Company uses to manage the interest rate risk associated with its borrowings and to manage the Companys mix of fixed rate and variable rate debt. As of August 28, 2005, the Company had fixed to floating interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $300,000 and an aggregate fair value of $7,688, which is recorded in other assets on the Companys consolidated balance sheet. These swaps were entered into effective March 25, 2002, and are designated and qualify as fair value hedges of the Companys $300,000 5 1/2% Senior Notes. As the terms of the swaps match those of the underlying hedged debt, the changes in the fair value of these swaps are offset by corresponding changes in the carrying amount of the hedged debt and result in no net earnings impact. As of August 29, 2004, the Company had fixed to floating interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $600,000 and an aggregate fair value of $25,754. In addition to the Companys swap on the 5 1/2% Senior Notes noted above, the Company had entered into a swap on its $300,000 7 1/8% Senior Notes effective November 13, 2001, which was designated and qualified as a fair value hedge. The $300,000 7 1/8% Senior Notes matured and were repaid on June 15, 2005. Concurrent to this transaction, the related swap agreement expired. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements With the exception of its operating leases, the Company has no off balance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on the Companys financial condition or consolidated financial statements. Stock Repurchase Program On November 30, 2001, the Companys Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program, authorizing the repurchase of up to $500,000 of Costco Common Stock through November 30, 2004. Under the program, the Company could repurchase shares at any time in the open market or in private transactions as market conditions warrant. The repurchased shares would be retired. On October 25, 2004, the Board of Directors renewed the program for another three years. On June 7, 2005 the Company began repurchasing shares on the open market. Through August 28, 2005 the Company has repurchased 9,205,100 shares of common stock at an average price of $44.89, totaling approximately $413,252, including commissions. Subsequent to the Companys fiscal 2005 year end, August 29, 2005, the Board of Directors of Costco authorized an additional stock repurchase program of up to $1,000,000 of Costco common stock. Under the program, which contains no expiration date, the Company may repurchase shares at any time in the open market or in private transactions as market conditions warrant. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the Companys financial statements requires that management make estimates and judgments that affect the financial position and results of operations. Management continues to review its accounting policies and evaluate its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, merchandise inventory, 23 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) impairment of long lived assets and warehouse closing costs and insurance/self insurance liabilities. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the present circumstances. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes sales, net of estimated returns, at the time customers take possession of merchandise or receive services. When the Company collects payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services, the amount received is recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed. The Company provides for estimated sales returns based on historical returns levels. The Company evaluates the criteria of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal Versus Net as an Agent, in determining whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, when Costco is the primary obligor, is subject to inventory risk, has latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, influence product or service specifications, or has several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded on a gross basis. If the Company is not the primary obligor and does not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above, Costco records the net amounts as commissions earned. Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market as determined primarily by the retail method of accounting and are stated using the last in, first out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail method of accounting and are stated using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. The Company believes the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. The Company records an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the expected annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end. At August 28, 2005, merchandise inventories valued at LIFO approximated FIFO after considering the lower of cost or market principle. At August 29, 2004, merchandise inventories valued using LIFO exceeded the comparable FIFO value by approximately $13,410 due to the aggregate effects of deflation. The Company provides for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts on the basis of a percentage of sales. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect the trend of the actual physical inventory count results, which generally occur in the second and fourth fiscal quarters of the Companys fiscal year. Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as the Company progresses towards earning those rebates provided they are probable and reasonably estimable. Other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of agreement, or other systematic and rational approach. Impairment of long lived assets and warehouse closing costs The Company periodically evaluates its long lived assets for indicators of impairment. Managements judgments are based on market and operational conditions at the present time. Future events could cause management to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring an adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value. 24 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) The Company provides estimates for warehouse closing costs, based on the applicable accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Future circumstances may result in the Companys actual future closing costs or the amount recognized upon the sale of the property to differ substantially from the original estimates. Insurance/Self Insurance Liabilities The Company uses a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms to provide for the potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property damage, director and officers liability, vehicle liability and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by the Company are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience and outside expertise, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In May 2005, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, a Replacement of Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 20 and FASB Statement No. 3. SFAS 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements for changes in accounting principles, unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change. SFAS 154 also requires that retrospective application of a change in accounting principle be limited to the direct effects of the change. Indirect effects of a change in accounting principle, such as a change in non discretionary profit sharing payments resulting from an accounting change, should be recognized in the period of the accounting change. SFAS 154 also requires that a change in depreciation, amortization, or depletion method for long lived, non financial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate effected by a change in accounting principle. SFAS 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. Early adoption is permitted for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after the date this Statement is issued. The Company is required to adopt the provisions of SFAS 154, as applicable, beginning in fiscal 2007. The Company does not believe the adoption of SFAS 154 will have a significant effect on its future consolidated financial statements. In March 2005, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, An Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143, which requires an entity to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation when incurred if the liabilitys fair value can be reasonably estimated. The Company adopted the provisions of FIN 47 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. The adoption of this Interpretation did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R, Share based Payments. SFAS 123R revises SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, which the Company adopted as of the beginning of its fiscal 2003, and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. SFAS 123R applies to transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services and also applies to liabilities an entity may incur for goods or services that are based on the fair value of those equity instruments. All employee stock option grants made by the Company since the beginning of fiscal 2003 have been expensed over the related option vesting period based on the fair value at the date the options are granted using the Black Scholes model. Under SFAS 123R, the Company will be required to select a valuation technique or option pricing model that meets the criteria as stated in the standard. Allowable valuation models include a binomial model and the Black Scholes model. The Company is required to adopt the provisions of SFAS 123R in the first quarter of its fiscal 2006. The Company is in the process of assessing the impact on the Companys results of operations from the adoption of SFAS 123R for its effect on prospective option grants. The adoption of SFAS 123R requires the Company to value stock options granted prior to its adoption of SFAS 123 under the fair value 25 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) method and expense these amounts in the income statement over the stock options remaining vesting period. This will result in the Company expensing $13,043 in fiscal 2006, which would previously have been presented in a proforma footnote disclosure. In addition, SFAS 123R will require the Company to reflect the tax savings resulting from tax deductions in excess of expense reflected in its financial statements as a financing cash flow, which will impact the Companys future reported cash flows from operating activities. In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, Inventory Costs An Amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin (ARB) No. 43, Chapter 4. SFAS 151 clarifies that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and spoilage should be expensed as incurred and not included in overhead. Further, SFAS 151 requires that allocation of fixed and production facilities overheads to conversion costs should be based on normal capacity of the production facilities. The provisions in this statement are effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005. The Company does not believe that the adoption of SFAS 151 will have a significant effect on its future consolidated financial statements. In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153, Exchanges of Non monetary Assets An Amendment of APB No. 29. The provisions of this statement are effective for non monetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005. This statement eliminates the exception to fair value for exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchange transactions that do not have commercial substance that is, transactions that are not expected to result in significant changes in the cash flows of the reporting entity. The Company does not believe that the adoption of SFAS 153 will have a significant effect on its future consolidated financial statements. In March 2004, the FASB EITF reached a consensus on EITF Issue No. 03 1, The Meaning of Other Than Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments, (EITF 03 1). The guidance prescribes a three step model for determining whether an investment is other than temporarily impaired and requires disclosures about unrealized losses on investments. The accounting guidance became effective for reporting periods beginning after June 15, 2004, while the disclosure requirements became effective for annual reporting periods ending after June 15, 2004. In September 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) EITF 03 1 1, Effective Date of Paragraphs 10 20 of EITF Issue No. 03 1 The Meaning of Other Than Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments, (FSP EITF 03 1 1). FSP EITF 03 1 1 delayed the effective date for the measurement and recognition guidance contained in paragraphs 10 20 of EITF Issue 03 1. In November 2005, the FASB issued FSP FAS 115 1 and FAS 124 1, The Meaning of Other Than Temporary Impairment and its Application to Certain Investments. This FSP addresses the determination as to when an investment is considered impaired, whether the impairment is other than temporary and the measurement of an impairment loss. This statement specifically nullifies the requirements of paragraph 10 18 of EITF 03 1 and references existing other than temporary impairment guidance. The guidance under this FSP is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2005 and the Company continued to apply relevant other than temporary guidance as provided for in FSP EITF 03 1 1 during fiscal 2005. The Company does not believe that the adoption of the guidance of FSP FAS 115 1 and FAS 124 1 will have a significant effect on its future consolidated financial statements. In November 2003, the EITF reached consensus on Issue No. 03 10, Application of Issue No. 02 16 by Resellers to Sales Incentives Offered to Consumers by Manufacturers, with respect to determining if consideration received by a reseller from a vendor that is reimbursed by the vendor for honoring the vendors sale incentives offered directly to consumers should be recorded as a reduction in sales. These rules apply to transactions entered into by consumers in fiscal periods beginning after November 25, 2003 and, therefore, apply to such transactions starting with the Companys fiscal third quarter of 2004, which began February 16, 2004. The adoption of EITF 03 10 did not affect the Companys consolidated gross profit or net income, but did result in a reduction of both net sales and merchandise costs by an equal amount. Had the first half of fiscal 2004 and all of fiscal 2003 been reported under EITF 03 10 guidance, the sales and cost of sales would have been reduced by approximately $186,900 and $282,300, respectively. 26 Table of Contents Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company is exposed to financial market risk resulting from changes in interest and foreign currency rates. As a policy, the Company does not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions, nor hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. The nature and amount of the Companys long and short term debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As of August 28, 2005, the Companys fixed rate long term debt includes its $415,246 principal amount at maturity Zero Coupon Subordinated Notes carried at $274,071 and additional notes and capital lease obligations totaling $132,141. The Companys debt also includes $300,000 5 1/2% Senior Notes carried at $307,688. The Company has entered into fixed to floating interest rate swaps on the Senior Notes, effectively converting these fixed interest rate securities to variable rate securities. As of August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, the Company had fixed to floating interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $300,000 and $600,000, respectively, and an aggregate fair value of $7,688 and $25,754, respectively. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt and may affect the interest expense related to the variable rate debt. The Company holds interest bearing instruments that are classified as cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. The Companys investment policy is to manage its total cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances to preserve principal and liquidity while maximizing the return on the investment portfolio through the full investment of available funds. The Company diversifies its investment portfolio by investing in multiple types of investment grade securities and through internal management and the use of third party investment managers. Short term investments generally have a maturity of three months to five years from the purchase date. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. As the majority of these instruments are of a short term nature, if interest rates were to increase or decrease immediately, there is no material risk of a valuation adjustment related to these instruments. For those instruments that are classified as available for sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in interest rates are reflected in other accumulated comprehensive income or loss. Based on the Companys cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances at August 28, 2005, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $15,000 to interest income (pre tax) on an annual basis. Most foreign currency transactions have been conducted in local currencies, limiting the Companys exposure to changes in currency rates. The Company periodically enters into short term forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates on inventory purchases. The fair value of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at August 28, 2005 was $42,901. 27 Table of Contents 
 
Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Provision for Impaired Assets and Closing Costs, net The net provision for impaired assets and closing costs was $1,000 in fiscal 2004, compared to $19,500 in fiscal 2003. The provision includes costs related to impairment of long lived assets, future lease obligations of warehouses that have been relocated to new facilities, and losses or gains resulting from the sale of real property. The provision for fiscal 2004 included charges of $16,548 for warehouse closing expenses that were offset by gains of $15,548 on the sale of real property. The provision for fiscal 2003 included charges of $11,836 for warehouse closing expenses, $4,697 for impairment of long lived assets and $2,967 for net losses on the sale of real property. At August 29, 2004, the reserve for warehouse closing costs was $10,367, of which $9,184 related to future lease obligations. This compares to a reserve for warehouse closing costs of $8,609 at August 31, 2003, of which $7,833 related to future lease obligations. Interest Expense Interest expense totaled $36,651 in fiscal 2004, compared to $36,920 in fiscal 2003. Interest expense in both fiscal 2004 and 2003 includes interest on the 3 1/2% Zero Coupon Notes, 7 1/8% and 5 1/2% Senior Notes and on balances outstanding under the Companys bank credit facilities and promissory notes. The decrease was primarily a result of the Companys reduction in short term borrowings, principally related to its foreign subsidiaries. This decrease was substantially offset by increases in interest rates on the Senior Notes due to interest rate swap agreements converting the interest rate from fixed to floating. Interest Income and Other Interest income and other totaled $51,627 in fiscal 2004, compared to $38,525 in fiscal 2003. The increase primarily reflects greater interest earned on higher cash and cash equivalents balances and short term investments. In addition, a reduction in the expense to record minority interest in the earnings of foreign subsidiaries was reported in fiscal 2004 as the Company increased its ownership in Costco Wholesale UK Limited to 100%. Provision for Income Taxes The effective income tax rate on earnings was 37% in fiscal 2004 and 37.75% in fiscal 2003. The decrease in the effective income tax rate is primarily attributable to lower statutory income tax rates for foreign operations and one time benefits associated with certain tax planning strategies. Liquidity and Capital Resources (dollars in thousands, except per share amounts) Cash Flows The Companys primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from warehouse operations and our existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances, which were $3,459,857 and $3,129,882 at August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, respectively. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $1,783,177 in fiscal 2005 compared to $2,098,783 in fiscal 2004, a decrease of $315,606. Higher net income and a decrease in net merchandise inventories (merchandise inventory less accounts payable) year over year increased cash flow from operating activities by $391,571. This increase was offset by decreases in cash flow from operating assets and liabilities of $706,855, primarily relating to the timing in the collection of certain receivables and in payments of income taxes in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004. A significant component of net cash used in investing activities continues to be the purchase of property and equipment related to the Companys warehouse expansion and remodel projects. Net cash used in investing activities totaled $2,058,729 in fiscal 2005 compared to $1,048,481 in fiscal 2004, an increase of $1,010,248. The increase in investing activities primarily relates to an increase in the net investment in short term investments of $768,596 and an increase in additions to property and equipment of $289,811 in fiscal 2005 over fiscal 2004. 19 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Net cash used in financing activities totaled $518,651 in fiscal 2005 compared to $209,569 provided by financing activities in fiscal 2004. The decrease of $728,220 primarily resulted from an increase in the repayment of debt of $297,275 primarily relating to the repayment of the 7 1/8% Senior Notes, which matured on June 15, 2005, and repurchases of common stock of $413,252 under the Companys $500,000 share repurchase program. Dividends Costcos Board of Directors declared four quarterly cash dividends during fiscal year 2005. The first two dividends of $0.10 per share were paid November 26, 2004 and February 25, 2005, to shareholders of record at the close of business on November 5, 2004 and February 8, 2005, respectively. The third and fourth dividends of $0.115 per share were paid May 27, 2005 and August 26, 2005 to shareholders of record at the close of business on May 6, 2005 and August 5, 2005, respectively. In fiscal 2004 the Company paid dividends of $0.10 per share in the third and fourth quarters. Contractual Obligations The Companys commitment to make future payments under contractual obligations was as follows, as of August 28, 2005. Payments Due by Period Contractual obligations  Total Less than1 year 1 to 3years 4 to 5years After5 years Long term debt(1)(2) $ 879,520 $ 18,064 $ 379,466 $ 65,437 $ 416,553 Capital lease obligations 6,591 3,225 1,305 927 1,134 Operating leases(3) 1,562,267 114,682 219,402 189,188 1,038,995 Purchase obligations (merchandise)(4) 3,049,398 3,048,785 613 Purchase obligations (building, equipment, services and other)(5) 242,361 230,086 12,275 Other(6) 8,591 1,354 1,692 1,362 4,183 Total $ 5,748,728 $ 3,416,196 $ 614,753 $ 256,914 $ 1,460,865 (1) Amounts include contractual interest payments. (2) The amount includes interest accreted to maturity for the Companys Zero Coupon 3 1/2% Convertible Subordinated Notes due August 2017, totaling $415,246. The consolidated balance sheet as of August 28, 2005 reflects a balance outstanding of $274,071. (3) Operating lease obligations have been reduced by $168,742 to reflect sub lease income. (4) Includes open merchandise purchase orders at fiscal year end. (5) The amounts exclude minor outsourced services negotiated at the individual warehouse level that are not significant and generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty. (6) Consists of asset retirement and deferred compensation obligations. Expansion Plans Costcos primary requirement for capital is the financing of the land, building and equipment costs for new warehouses plus the costs of initial warehouse operations and working capital requirements, as well as additional capital for international expansion. 20 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) While there can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized, and plans are subject to change upon further review, it is managements current intention to spend approximately $1,100,000 to $1,250,000 during fiscal 2006 in the United States and Canada for real estate, construction, remodeling and equipment for warehouse clubs and related operations; and approximately $100,000 to $150,000 for international expansion, including the United Kingdom, Asia, Mexico and other potential ventures. These expenditures are expected to be financed with a combination of cash provided from operations and the use of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. Expansion plans for the United States and Canada during fiscal 2006 are to open approximately 28 30 new warehouse clubs on a net basis, inclusive of two to three relocations to larger and better located warehouses. The Company expects to continue its review of expansion plans in its international operations, including the United Kingdom and Asia, along with other international markets. At present, the Company is planning to open three additional warehouses in the U.K during fiscal 2006. Costco Mexico plans to open two to three new warehouse clubs during fiscal 2006. Additional Equity Investments in Subsidiaries and Joint Ventures On June 30, 2005, the Company acquired the remaining 4% interest in CWC Travel Inc for $3,961, bringing Costcos ownership in this entity to 100%. In addition, during fiscal 2005 the Company contributed an additional $15,000 to its investment in Costco Mexico (a 50% owned joint venture), which did not impact its percentage ownership of this entity as the joint venture partner contributed a like amount. On October 3, 2003, the Company acquired from Carrefour Nederland B.V. its 20% equity interest in Costco Wholesale UK Limited for cash of $95,153, bringing Costcos ownership in Costco Wholesale UK Limited to 100%. Bank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs (all amounts stated in thousands of US dollars) The Company has a $500,000 commercial paper program supported by a $150,000 bank credit facility ($300,000 at August 29, 2004) with a group of nine banks, which expires on November 15, 2005, and is not expected to be renewed. At August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, no amounts were outstanding under the commercial paper program and no amounts were outstanding under the credit facility. Applicable interest rates on the credit facility at August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, were 3.92% and 1.90%, respectively. A wholly owned Canadian subsidiary has a $167,000 commercial paper program ($152,000 at August 29, 2004) supported by a $50,000 bank credit facility ($46,000 at August 29, 2004) with a Canadian bank, which is guaranteed by the Company and expires in March 2006. At August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, no amounts were outstanding under the Canadian commercial paper program or the bank credit facility. Applicable interest rates on the credit facility at August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, were 4.25% and 3.75%, respectively. At August 28, 2005, standby letters of credit totaling $23,000 issued under the bank credit facility left $27,000 available for commercial paper support. At August 29, 2004, standby letters of credit totaling $21,000 issued under the bank credit facility left $25,000 available for commercial paper support. The Company has agreed to limit the combined amount outstanding under the U.S. and Canadian commercial paper programs to the combined amounts of the supporting bank credit facilities, which are $177,000 at August 28, 2005, decreasing to $27,000 on November 15, 2005. At August 29, 2004, the combined amount of supporting bank credit facilities was $325,000. The Companys wholly owned Japanese subsidiary has a short term $13,694 bank line of credit that expires in February 2006. At August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, $5,477 and $0, respectively, were borrowed under the line of credit, and $3,652 and $2,576, respectively, were used to support standby letters of credit. A second 21 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) $13,694 bank line of credit was entered into in February 2005 that expires in February 2006. At August 28, 2005, $9,129 was borrowed under the second facility; this bank line was not in place at August 29, 2004. Applicable interest rates on the credit facilities at both August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, were .84%. The Companys Korean subsidiary has a short term $11,665 bank line of credit, which expires in January 2006. At August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, no amounts were borrowed under the line of credit and $1,668 and $0, respectively, were used to support standby letters of credit. Applicable interest rates on the credit facility at August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, were 4.51% and 4.52%, respectively. The Companys Taiwan subsidiary has a $7,439 bank revolving credit facility that expires in January 2006. At August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, no amounts were borrowed under the credit facility and $2,495 and $1,165, respectively, were used to support standby letters of credit. A second $15,499 bank revolving credit facility is in place, which expires in July 2006. At August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, no amounts were borrowed under the second credit facility and $790 and $738, respectively were used to support standby letters of credit. Applicable interest rates on the credit facilities at August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, were 3.75% and 3.50%, respectively.

At August 29, 2004, $21,595 was outstanding under the revolving credit facility with an applicable interest rate of 5.285% and no amounts were outstanding under the bank overdraft facility. Letters of Credit The Company has letter of credit facilities (for commercial and standby letters of credit), totaling approximately $401,933. The outstanding commitments under these facilities at August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004 totaled approximately $131,169 and $166,800, respectively, including approximately $64,532 and $52,900, respectively, in standby letters of credit. Financing Activities The Companys 7 1/8% Senior Notes, carried at $304,350 at August 29, 2004, matured and were repaid on June 15, 2005 from its cash and cash equivalents. In April 2003, the Companys wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.92% in the aggregate amount of $36,516, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due on April 26, 2010. In March 2002, the Company issued $300,000 of 5 1/2% Senior Notes carried at $307,688 due March 15, 2007. Interest is payable semi annually. Simultaneous with the issuance of the Senior Notes, the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements converting the interest from fixed to floating. In February 1996, the Company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a shelf registration statement for $500,000 of senior debt securities. On October 23, 2001, additional debt securities of $100,000 were registered. The $300,000 of 5 1/2% Senior Notes issued in March 2002 reduced the amount of registered securities available for future issuance to $300,000. During fiscal 2005, $280,811 in principal amount of the Companys 3 1/2% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes were converted by note holders into 9,910,011 shares of common stock. 22 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Derivatives The Company has limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and uses them only to manage well defined interest rate and foreign exchange risks. Forward foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on inventory purchases and typically have very short terms. The aggregate amount of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, was $42,466 and $30,495, respectively. The majority of the forward foreign exchange contracts were entered into by the Companys wholly owned United Kingdom subsidiary, primarily to hedge U.S. dollar merchandise inventory purchases. The Company monitors its foreign currency exchange exposures to ensure the overall effectiveness of its foreign currency hedge positions. The only other derivative instruments the Company holds are interest rate swaps, which the Company uses to manage the interest rate risk associated with its borrowings and to manage the Companys mix of fixed rate and variable rate debt. As of August 28, 2005, the Company had fixed to floating interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $300,000 and an aggregate fair value of $7,688, which is recorded in other assets on the Companys consolidated balance sheet. These swaps were entered into effective March 25, 2002, and are designated and qualify as fair value hedges of the Companys $300,000 5 1/2% Senior Notes. As the terms of the swaps match those of the underlying hedged debt, the changes in the fair value of these swaps are offset by corresponding changes in the carrying amount of the hedged debt and result in no net earnings impact. As of August 29, 2004, the Company had fixed to floating interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $600,000 and an aggregate fair value of $25,754. In addition to the Companys swap on the 5 1/2% Senior Notes noted above, the Company had entered into a swap on its $300,000 7 1/8% Senior Notes effective November 13, 2001, which was designated and qualified as a fair value hedge. The $300,000 7 1/8% Senior Notes matured and were repaid on June 15, 2005. Concurrent to this transaction, the related swap agreement expired. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements With the exception of its operating leases, the Company has no off balance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on the Companys financial condition or consolidated financial statements. Stock Repurchase Program On November 30, 2001, the Companys Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program, authorizing the repurchase of up to $500,000 of Costco Common Stock through November 30, 2004. Under the program, the Company could repurchase shares at any time in the open market or in private transactions as market conditions warrant. The repurchased shares would be retired. On October 25, 2004, the Board of Directors renewed the program for another three years. On June 7, 2005 the Company began repurchasing shares on the open market. Through August 28, 2005 the Company has repurchased 9,205,100 shares of common stock at an average price of $44.89, totaling approximately $413,252, including commissions. Subsequent to the Companys fiscal 2005 year end, August 29, 2005, the Board of Directors of Costco authorized an additional stock repurchase program of up to $1,000,000 of Costco common stock. Under the program, which contains no expiration date, the Company may repurchase shares at any time in the open market or in private transactions as market conditions warrant. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the Companys financial statements requires that management make estimates and judgments that affect the financial position and results of operations. Management continues to review its accounting policies and evaluate its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, merchandise inventory, 23 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) impairment of long lived assets and warehouse closing costs and insurance/self insurance liabilities. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the present circumstances. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes sales, net of estimated returns, at the time customers take possession of merchandise or receive services. When the Company collects payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services, the amount received is recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed. The Company provides for estimated sales returns based on historical returns levels. The Company evaluates the criteria of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal Versus Net as an Agent, in determining whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, when Costco is the primary obligor, is subject to inventory risk, has latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, influence product or service specifications, or has several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded on a gross basis. If the Company is not the primary obligor and does not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above, Costco records the net amounts as commissions earned. Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market as determined primarily by the retail method of accounting and are stated using the last in, first out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail method of accounting and are stated using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. The Company believes the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. The Company records an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the expected annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end. At August 28, 2005, merchandise inventories valued at LIFO approximated FIFO after considering the lower of cost or market principle. At August 29, 2004, merchandise inventories valued using LIFO exceeded the comparable FIFO value by approximately $13,410 due to the aggregate effects of deflation. The Company provides for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts on the basis of a percentage of sales. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect the trend of the actual physical inventory count results, which generally occur in the second and fourth fiscal quarters of the Companys fiscal year. Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as the Company progresses towards earning those rebates provided they are probable and reasonably estimable. Other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of agreement, or other systematic and rational approach. Impairment of long lived assets and warehouse closing costs The Company periodically evaluates its long lived assets for indicators of impairment. Managements judgments are based on market and operational conditions at the present time. Future events could cause management to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring an adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value. 24 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) The Company provides estimates for warehouse closing costs, based on the applicable accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Future circumstances may result in the Companys actual future closing costs or the amount recognized upon the sale of the property to differ substantially from the original estimates. Insurance/Self Insurance Liabilities The Company uses a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms to provide for the potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property damage, director and officers liability, vehicle liability and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by the Company are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience and outside expertise, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In May 2005, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, a Replacement of Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 20 and FASB Statement No. 3. SFAS 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements for changes in accounting principles, unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change. SFAS 154 also requires that retrospective application of a change in accounting principle be limited to the direct effects of the change. Indirect effects of a change in accounting principle, such as a change in non discretionary profit sharing payments resulting from an accounting change, should be recognized in the period of the accounting change. SFAS 154 also requires that a change in depreciation, amortization, or depletion method for long lived, non financial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate effected by a change in accounting principle. SFAS 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. Early adoption is permitted for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after the date this Statement is issued. The Company is required to adopt the provisions of SFAS 154, as applicable, beginning in fiscal 2007. The Company does not believe the adoption of SFAS 154 will have a significant effect on its future consolidated financial statements. In March 2005, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, An Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143, which requires an entity to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation when incurred if the liabilitys fair value can be reasonably estimated. The Company adopted the provisions of FIN 47 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. The adoption of this Interpretation did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R, Share based Payments. SFAS 123R revises SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, which the Company adopted as of the beginning of its fiscal 2003, and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. SFAS 123R applies to transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services and also applies to liabilities an entity may incur for goods or services that are based on the fair value of those equity instruments. All employee stock option grants made by the Company since the beginning of fiscal 2003 have been expensed over the related option vesting period based on the fair value at the date the options are granted using the Black Scholes model. Under SFAS 123R, the Company will be required to select a valuation technique or option pricing model that meets the criteria as stated in the standard. Allowable valuation models include a binomial model and the Black Scholes model. The Company is required to adopt the provisions of SFAS 123R in the first quarter of its fiscal 2006. The Company is in the process of assessing the impact on the Companys results of operations from the adoption of SFAS 123R for its effect on prospective option grants. The adoption of SFAS 123R requires the Company to value stock options granted prior to its adoption of SFAS 123 under the fair value 25 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) method and expense these amounts in the income statement over the stock options remaining vesting period. This will result in the Company expensing $13,043 in fiscal 2006, which would previously have been presented in a proforma footnote disclosure. In addition, SFAS 123R will require the Company to reflect the tax savings resulting from tax deductions in excess of expense reflected in its financial statements as a financing cash flow, which will impact the Companys future reported cash flows from operating activities. In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, Inventory Costs An Amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin (ARB) No. 43, Chapter 4. SFAS 151 clarifies that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and spoilage should be expensed as incurred and not included in overhead. Further, SFAS 151 requires that allocation of fixed and production facilities overheads to conversion costs should be based on normal capacity of the production facilities. The provisions in this statement are effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005. The Company does not believe that the adoption of SFAS 151 will have a significant effect on its future consolidated financial statements. In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153, Exchanges of Non monetary Assets An Amendment of APB No. 29. The provisions of this statement are effective for non monetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005. This statement eliminates the exception to fair value for exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchange transactions that do not have commercial substance that is, transactions that are not expected to result in significant changes in the cash flows of the reporting entity. The Company does not believe that the adoption of SFAS 153 will have a significant effect on its future consolidated financial statements. In March 2004, the FASB EITF reached a consensus on EITF Issue No. 03 1, The Meaning of Other Than Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments, (EITF 03 1). The guidance prescribes a three step model for determining whether an investment is other than temporarily impaired and requires disclosures about unrealized losses on investments. The accounting guidance became effective for reporting periods beginning after June 15, 2004, while the disclosure requirements became effective for annual reporting periods ending after June 15, 2004. In September 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) EITF 03 1 1, Effective Date of Paragraphs 10 20 of EITF Issue No. 03 1 The Meaning of Other Than Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments, (FSP EITF 03 1 1). FSP EITF 03 1 1 delayed the effective date for the measurement and recognition guidance contained in paragraphs 10 20 of EITF Issue 03 1. In November 2005, the FASB issued FSP FAS 115 1 and FAS 124 1, The Meaning of Other Than Temporary Impairment and its Application to Certain Investments. This FSP addresses the determination as to when an investment is considered impaired, whether the impairment is other than temporary and the measurement of an impairment loss. This statement specifically nullifies the requirements of paragraph 10 18 of EITF 03 1 and references existing other than temporary impairment guidance. The guidance under this FSP is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2005 and the Company continued to apply relevant other than temporary guidance as provided for in FSP EITF 03 1 1 during fiscal 2005. The Company does not believe that the adoption of the guidance of FSP FAS 115 1 and FAS 124 1 will have a significant effect on its future consolidated financial statements. In November 2003, the EITF reached consensus on Issue No. 03 10, Application of Issue No. 02 16 by Resellers to Sales Incentives Offered to Consumers by Manufacturers, with respect to determining if consideration received by a reseller from a vendor that is reimbursed by the vendor for honoring the vendors sale incentives offered directly to consumers should be recorded as a reduction in sales. These rules apply to transactions entered into by consumers in fiscal periods beginning after November 25, 2003 and, therefore, apply to such transactions starting with the Companys fiscal third quarter of 2004, which began February 16, 2004. The adoption of EITF 03 10 did not affect the Companys consolidated gross profit or net income, but did result in a reduction of both net sales and merchandise costs by an equal amount. Had the first half of fiscal 2004 and all of fiscal 2003 been reported under EITF 03 10 guidance, the sales and cost of sales would have been reduced by approximately $186,900 and $282,300, respectively. 26 Table of Contents Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company is exposed to financial market risk resulting from changes in interest and foreign currency rates. As a policy, the Company does not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions, nor hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. The nature and amount of the Companys long and short term debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As of August 28, 2005, the Companys fixed rate long term debt includes its $415,246 principal amount at maturity Zero Coupon Subordinated Notes carried at $274,071 and additional notes and capital lease obligations totaling $132,141. The Companys debt also includes $300,000 5 1/2% Senior Notes carried at $307,688. The Company has entered into fixed to floating interest rate swaps on the Senior Notes, effectively converting these fixed interest rate securities to variable rate securities. As of August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, the Company had fixed to floating interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $300,000 and $600,000, respectively, and an aggregate fair value of $7,688 and $25,754, respectively. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt and may affect the interest expense related to the variable rate debt. The Company holds interest bearing instruments that are classified as cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. The Companys investment policy is to manage its total cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances to preserve principal and liquidity while maximizing the return on the investment portfolio through the full investment of available funds. The Company diversifies its investment portfolio by investing in multiple types of investment grade securities and through internal management and the use of third party investment managers. Short term investments generally have a maturity of three months to five years from the purchase date. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. As the majority of these instruments are of a short term nature, if interest rates were to increase or decrease immediately, there is no material risk of a valuation adjustment related to these instruments. For those instruments that are classified as available for sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in interest rates are reflected in other accumulated comprehensive income or loss. Based on the Companys cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances at August 28, 2005, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $15,000 to interest income (pre tax) on an annual basis. Most foreign currency transactions have been conducted in local currencies, limiting the Companys exposure to changes in currency rates. The Company periodically enters into short term forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates on inventory purchases. The fair value of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at August 28, 2005 was $42,901. 27 Table of Contents 
 
Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Net cash used in financing activities totaled $518,651 in fiscal 2005 compared to $209,569 provided by financing activities in fiscal 2004. The decrease of $728,220 primarily resulted from an increase in the repayment of debt of $297,275 primarily relating to the repayment of the 7 1/8% Senior Notes, which matured on June 15, 2005, and repurchases of common stock of $413,252 under the Companys $500,000 share repurchase program. Dividends Costcos Board of Directors declared four quarterly cash dividends during fiscal year 2005. The first two dividends of $0.10 per share were paid November 26, 2004 and February 25, 2005, to shareholders of record at the close of business on November 5, 2004 and February 8, 2005, respectively. The third and fourth dividends of $0.115 per share were paid May 27, 2005 and August 26, 2005 to shareholders of record at the close of business on May 6, 2005 and August 5, 2005, respectively. In fiscal 2004 the Company paid dividends of $0.10 per share in the third and fourth quarters. Contractual Obligations The Companys commitment to make future payments under contractual obligations was as follows, as of August 28, 2005. Payments Due by Period Contractual obligations  Total Less than1 year 1 to 3years 4 to 5years After5 years Long term debt(1)(2) $ 879,520 $ 18,064 $ 379,466 $ 65,437 $ 416,553 Capital lease obligations 6,591 3,225 1,305 927 1,134 Operating leases(3) 1,562,267 114,682 219,402 189,188 1,038,995 Purchase obligations (merchandise)(4) 3,049,398 3,048,785 613 Purchase obligations (building, equipment, services and other)(5) 242,361 230,086 12,275 Other(6) 8,591 1,354 1,692 1,362 4,183 Total $ 5,748,728 $ 3,416,196 $ 614,753 $ 256,914 $ 1,460,865 (1) Amounts include contractual interest payments.

(4) Includes open merchandise purchase orders at fiscal year end. (5) The amounts exclude minor outsourced services negotiated at the individual warehouse level that are not significant and generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty. (6) Consists of asset retirement and deferred compensation obligations. Expansion Plans Costcos primary requirement for capital is the financing of the land, building and equipment costs for new warehouses plus the costs of initial warehouse operations and working capital requirements, as well as additional capital for international expansion. 20 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) While there can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized, and plans are subject to change upon further review, it is managements current intention to spend approximately $1,100,000 to $1,250,000 during fiscal 2006 in the United States and Canada for real estate, construction, remodeling and equipment for warehouse clubs and related operations; and approximately $100,000 to $150,000 for international expansion, including the United Kingdom, Asia, Mexico and other potential ventures. These expenditures are expected to be financed with a combination of cash provided from operations and the use of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. Expansion plans for the United States and Canada during fiscal 2006 are to open approximately 28 30 new warehouse clubs on a net basis, inclusive of two to three relocations to larger and better located warehouses. The Company expects to continue its review of expansion plans in its international operations, including the United Kingdom and Asia, along with other international markets. At present, the Company is planning to open three additional warehouses in the U.K during fiscal 2006. Costco Mexico plans to open two to three new warehouse clubs during fiscal 2006. Additional Equity Investments in Subsidiaries and Joint Ventures On June 30, 2005, the Company acquired the remaining 4% interest in CWC Travel Inc for $3,961, bringing Costcos ownership in this entity to 100%. In addition, during fiscal 2005 the Company contributed an additional $15,000 to its investment in Costco Mexico (a 50% owned joint venture), which did not impact its percentage ownership of this entity as the joint venture partner contributed a like amount. On October 3, 2003, the Company acquired from Carrefour Nederland B.V. its 20% equity interest in Costco Wholesale UK Limited for cash of $95,153, bringing Costcos ownership in Costco Wholesale UK Limited to 100%. Bank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs (all amounts stated in thousands of US dollars) The Company has a $500,000 commercial paper program supported by a $150,000 bank credit facility ($300,000 at August 29, 2004) with a group of nine banks, which expires on November 15, 2005, and is not expected to be renewed. At August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, no amounts were outstanding under the commercial paper program and no amounts were outstanding under the credit facility. Applicable interest rates on the credit facility at August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, were 3.92% and 1.90%, respectively. A wholly owned Canadian subsidiary has a $167,000 commercial paper program ($152,000 at August 29, 2004) supported by a $50,000 bank credit facility ($46,000 at August 29, 2004) with a Canadian bank, which is guaranteed by the Company and expires in March 2006. At August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, no amounts were outstanding under the Canadian commercial paper program or the bank credit facility. Applicable interest rates on the credit facility at August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, were 4.25% and 3.75%, respectively. At August 28, 2005, standby letters of credit totaling $23,000 issued under the bank credit facility left $27,000 available for commercial paper support. At August 29, 2004, standby letters of credit totaling $21,000 issued under the bank credit facility left $25,000 available for commercial paper support. The Company has agreed to limit the combined amount outstanding under the U.S. and Canadian commercial paper programs to the combined amounts of the supporting bank credit facilities, which are $177,000 at August 28, 2005, decreasing to $27,000 on November 15, 2005. At August 29, 2004, the combined amount of supporting bank credit facilities was $325,000. The Companys wholly owned Japanese subsidiary has a short term $13,694 bank line of credit that expires in February 2006. At August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, $5,477 and $0, respectively, were borrowed under the line of credit, and $3,652 and $2,576, respectively, were used to support standby letters of credit. A second 21 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) $13,694 bank line of credit was entered into in February 2005 that expires in February 2006. At August 28, 2005, $9,129 was borrowed under the second facility; this bank line was not in place at August 29, 2004. Applicable interest rates on the credit facilities at both August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, were .84%. The Companys Korean subsidiary has a short term $11,665 bank line of credit, which expires in January 2006. At August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, no amounts were borrowed under the line of credit and $1,668 and $0, respectively, were used to support standby letters of credit. Applicable interest rates on the credit facility at August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, were 4.51% and 4.52%, respectively. The Companys Taiwan subsidiary has a $7,439 bank revolving credit facility that expires in January 2006. At August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, no amounts were borrowed under the credit facility and $2,495 and $1,165, respectively, were used to support standby letters of credit. A second $15,499 bank revolving credit facility is in place, which expires in July 2006. At August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, no amounts were borrowed under the second credit facility and $790 and $738, respectively were used to support standby letters of credit. Applicable interest rates on the credit facilities at August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, were 3.75% and 3.50%, respectively. The Companys wholly owned United Kingdom subsidiary has a $108,408 bank revolving credit facility expiring in February 2007 and a $63,238 bank overdraft facility renewable on a yearly basis in March 2006. At August 28, 2005, $39,750 was outstanding under the revolving credit facility with an applicable interest rate of 5.30% and no amounts were outstanding under the bank overdraft facility. At August 29, 2004, $21,595 was outstanding under the revolving credit facility with an applicable interest rate of 5.285% and no amounts were outstanding under the bank overdraft facility. Letters of Credit The Company has letter of credit facilities (for commercial and standby letters of credit), totaling approximately $401,933. The outstanding commitments under these facilities at August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004 totaled approximately $131,169 and $166,800, respectively, including approximately $64,532 and $52,900, respectively, in standby letters of credit. Financing Activities The Companys 7 1/8% Senior Notes, carried at $304,350 at August 29, 2004, matured and were repaid on June 15, 2005 from its cash and cash equivalents. In April 2003, the Companys wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.92% in the aggregate amount of $36,516, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due on April 26, 2010. In March 2002, the Company issued $300,000 of 5 1/2% Senior Notes carried at $307,688 due March 15, 2007. Interest is payable semi annually. Simultaneous with the issuance of the Senior Notes, the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements converting the interest from fixed to floating. In February 1996, the Company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a shelf registration statement for $500,000 of senior debt securities. On October 23, 2001, additional debt securities of $100,000 were registered. The $300,000 of 5 1/2% Senior Notes issued in March 2002 reduced the amount of registered securities available for future issuance to $300,000. During fiscal 2005, $280,811 in principal amount of the Companys 3 1/2% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes were converted by note holders into 9,910,011 shares of common stock. 22 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Derivatives The Company has limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and uses them only to manage well defined interest rate and foreign exchange risks. Forward foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on inventory purchases and typically have very short terms. The aggregate amount of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, was $42,466 and $30,495, respectively. The majority of the forward foreign exchange contracts were entered into by the Companys wholly owned United Kingdom subsidiary, primarily to hedge U.S. dollar merchandise inventory purchases. The Company monitors its foreign currency exchange exposures to ensure the overall effectiveness of its foreign currency hedge positions. The only other derivative instruments the Company holds are interest rate swaps, which the Company uses to manage the interest rate risk associated with its borrowings and to manage the Companys mix of fixed rate and variable rate debt. As of August 28, 2005, the Company had fixed to floating interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $300,000 and an aggregate fair value of $7,688, which is recorded in other assets on the Companys consolidated balance sheet. These swaps were entered into effective March 25, 2002, and are designated and qualify as fair value hedges of the Companys $300,000 5 1/2% Senior Notes. As the terms of the swaps match those of the underlying hedged debt, the changes in the fair value of these swaps are offset by corresponding changes in the carrying amount of the hedged debt and result in no net earnings impact. As of August 29, 2004, the Company had fixed to floating interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $600,000 and an aggregate fair value of $25,754. In addition to the Companys swap on the 5 1/2% Senior Notes noted above, the Company had entered into a swap on its $300,000 7 1/8% Senior Notes effective November 13, 2001, which was designated and qualified as a fair value hedge. The $300,000 7 1/8% Senior Notes matured and were repaid on June 15, 2005. Concurrent to this transaction, the related swap agreement expired. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements With the exception of its operating leases, the Company has no off balance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on the Companys financial condition or consolidated financial statements. Stock Repurchase Program On November 30, 2001, the Companys Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program, authorizing the repurchase of up to $500,000 of Costco Common Stock through November 30, 2004. Under the program, the Company could repurchase shares at any time in the open market or in private transactions as market conditions warrant. The repurchased shares would be retired. On October 25, 2004, the Board of Directors renewed the program for another three years. On June 7, 2005 the Company began repurchasing shares on the open market. Through August 28, 2005 the Company has repurchased 9,205,100 shares of common stock at an average price of $44.89, totaling approximately $413,252, including commissions. Subsequent to the Companys fiscal 2005 year end, August 29, 2005, the Board of Directors of Costco authorized an additional stock repurchase program of up to $1,000,000 of Costco common stock. Under the program, which contains no expiration date, the Company may repurchase shares at any time in the open market or in private transactions as market conditions warrant. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the Companys financial statements requires that management make estimates and judgments that affect the financial position and results of operations. Management continues to review its accounting policies and evaluate its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, merchandise inventory, 23 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) impairment of long lived assets and warehouse closing costs and insurance/self insurance liabilities. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the present circumstances. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes sales, net of estimated returns, at the time customers take possession of merchandise or receive services. When the Company collects payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services, the amount received is recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed. The Company provides for estimated sales returns based on historical returns levels. The Company evaluates the criteria of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal Versus Net as an Agent, in determining whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, when Costco is the primary obligor, is subject to inventory risk, has latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, influence product or service specifications, or has several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded on a gross basis. If the Company is not the primary obligor and does not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above, Costco records the net amounts as commissions earned. Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market as determined primarily by the retail method of accounting and are stated using the last in, first out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail method of accounting and are stated using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. The Company believes the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. The Company records an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the expected annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end. At August 28, 2005, merchandise inventories valued at LIFO approximated FIFO after considering the lower of cost or market principle. At August 29, 2004, merchandise inventories valued using LIFO exceeded the comparable FIFO value by approximately $13,410 due to the aggregate effects of deflation. The Company provides for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts on the basis of a percentage of sales. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect the trend of the actual physical inventory count results, which generally occur in the second and fourth fiscal quarters of the Companys fiscal year. Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as the Company progresses towards earning those rebates provided they are probable and reasonably estimable. Other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of agreement, or other systematic and rational approach. Impairment of long lived assets and warehouse closing costs The Company periodically evaluates its long lived assets for indicators of impairment. Managements judgments are based on market and operational conditions at the present time. Future events could cause management to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring an adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value. 24 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) The Company provides estimates for warehouse closing costs, based on the applicable accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Future circumstances may result in the Companys actual future closing costs or the amount recognized upon the sale of the property to differ substantially from the original estimates. Insurance/Self Insurance Liabilities The Company uses a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms to provide for the potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property damage, director and officers liability, vehicle liability and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by the Company are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience and outside expertise, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In May 2005, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, a Replacement of Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 20 and FASB Statement No. 3. SFAS 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements for changes in accounting principles, unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change. SFAS 154 also requires that retrospective application of a change in accounting principle be limited to the direct effects of the change. Indirect effects of a change in accounting principle, such as a change in non discretionary profit sharing payments resulting from an accounting change, should be recognized in the period of the accounting change. SFAS 154 also requires that a change in depreciation, amortization, or depletion method for long lived, non financial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate effected by a change in accounting principle. SFAS 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. Early adoption is permitted for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after the date this Statement is issued. The Company is required to adopt the provisions of SFAS 154, as applicable, beginning in fiscal 2007. The Company does not believe the adoption of SFAS 154 will have a significant effect on its future consolidated financial statements. In March 2005, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, An Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143, which requires an entity to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation when incurred if the liabilitys fair value can be reasonably estimated. The Company adopted the provisions of FIN 47 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. The adoption of this Interpretation did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R, Share based Payments. SFAS 123R revises SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, which the Company adopted as of the beginning of its fiscal 2003, and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. SFAS 123R applies to transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services and also applies to liabilities an entity may incur for goods or services that are based on the fair value of those equity instruments. All employee stock option grants made by the Company since the beginning of fiscal 2003 have been expensed over the related option vesting period based on the fair value at the date the options are granted using the Black Scholes model. Under SFAS 123R, the Company will be required to select a valuation technique or option pricing model that meets the criteria as stated in the standard. Allowable valuation models include a binomial model and the Black Scholes model. The Company is required to adopt the provisions of SFAS 123R in the first quarter of its fiscal 2006. The Company is in the process of assessing the impact on the Companys results of operations from the adoption of SFAS 123R for its effect on prospective option grants. The adoption of SFAS 123R requires the Company to value stock options granted prior to its adoption of SFAS 123 under the fair value 25 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) method and expense these amounts in the income statement over the stock options remaining vesting period. This will result in the Company expensing $13,043 in fiscal 2006, which would previously have been presented in a proforma footnote disclosure. In addition, SFAS 123R will require the Company to reflect the tax savings resulting from tax deductions in excess of expense reflected in its financial statements as a financing cash flow, which will impact the Companys future reported cash flows from operating activities. In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, Inventory Costs An Amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin (ARB) No. 43, Chapter 4. SFAS 151 clarifies that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and spoilage should be expensed as incurred and not included in overhead. Further, SFAS 151 requires that allocation of fixed and production facilities overheads to conversion costs should be based on normal capacity of the production facilities. The provisions in this statement are effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005. The Company does not believe that the adoption of SFAS 151 will have a significant effect on its future consolidated financial statements. In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153, Exchanges of Non monetary Assets An Amendment of APB No. 29. The provisions of this statement are effective for non monetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005. This statement eliminates the exception to fair value for exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchange transactions that do not have commercial substance that is, transactions that are not expected to result in significant changes in the cash flows of the reporting entity. The Company does not believe that the adoption of SFAS 153 will have a significant effect on its future consolidated financial statements. In March 2004, the FASB EITF reached a consensus on EITF Issue No. 03 1, The Meaning of Other Than Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments, (EITF 03 1). The guidance prescribes a three step model for determining whether an investment is other than temporarily impaired and requires disclosures about unrealized losses on investments. The accounting guidance became effective for reporting periods beginning after June 15, 2004, while the disclosure requirements became effective for annual reporting periods ending after June 15, 2004. In September 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) EITF 03 1 1, Effective Date of Paragraphs 10 20 of EITF Issue No. 03 1 The Meaning of Other Than Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments, (FSP EITF 03 1 1). FSP EITF 03 1 1 delayed the effective date for the measurement and recognition guidance contained in paragraphs 10 20 of EITF Issue 03 1. In November 2005, the FASB issued FSP FAS 115 1 and FAS 124 1, The Meaning of Other Than Temporary Impairment and its Application to Certain Investments. This FSP addresses the determination as to when an investment is considered impaired, whether the impairment is other than temporary and the measurement of an impairment loss. This statement specifically nullifies the requirements of paragraph 10 18 of EITF 03 1 and references existing other than temporary impairment guidance. The guidance under this FSP is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2005 and the Company continued to apply relevant other than temporary guidance as provided for in FSP EITF 03 1 1 during fiscal 2005. The Company does not believe that the adoption of the guidance of FSP FAS 115 1 and FAS 124 1 will have a significant effect on its future consolidated financial statements. In November 2003, the EITF reached consensus on Issue No. 03 10, Application of Issue No. 02 16 by Resellers to Sales Incentives Offered to Consumers by Manufacturers, with respect to determining if consideration received by a reseller from a vendor that is reimbursed by the vendor for honoring the vendors sale incentives offered directly to consumers should be recorded as a reduction in sales. These rules apply to transactions entered into by consumers in fiscal periods beginning after November 25, 2003 and, therefore, apply to such transactions starting with the Companys fiscal third quarter of 2004, which began February 16, 2004. The adoption of EITF 03 10 did not affect the Companys consolidated gross profit or net income, but did result in a reduction of both net sales and merchandise costs by an equal amount. Had the first half of fiscal 2004 and all of fiscal 2003 been reported under EITF 03 10 guidance, the sales and cost of sales would have been reduced by approximately $186,900 and $282,300, respectively. 26 Table of Contents Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company is exposed to financial market risk resulting from changes in interest and foreign currency rates. As a policy, the Company does not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions, nor hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. The nature and amount of the Companys long and short term debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As of August 28, 2005, the Companys fixed rate long term debt includes its $415,246 principal amount at maturity Zero Coupon Subordinated Notes carried at $274,071 and additional notes and capital lease obligations totaling $132,141. The Companys debt also includes $300,000 5 1/2% Senior Notes carried at $307,688. The Company has entered into fixed to floating interest rate swaps on the Senior Notes, effectively converting these fixed interest rate securities to variable rate securities. As of August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, the Company had fixed to floating interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $300,000 and $600,000, respectively, and an aggregate fair value of $7,688 and $25,754, respectively. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt and may affect the interest expense related to the variable rate debt. The Company holds interest bearing instruments that are classified as cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. The Companys investment policy is to manage its total cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances to preserve principal and liquidity while maximizing the return on the investment portfolio through the full investment of available funds. The Company diversifies its investment portfolio by investing in multiple types of investment grade securities and through internal management and the use of third party investment managers. Short term investments generally have a maturity of three months to five years from the purchase date. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. As the majority of these instruments are of a short term nature, if interest rates were to increase or decrease immediately, there is no material risk of a valuation adjustment related to these instruments. For those instruments that are classified as available for sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in interest rates are reflected in other accumulated comprehensive income or loss. Based on the Companys cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances at August 28, 2005, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $15,000 to interest income (pre tax) on an annual basis. Most foreign currency transactions have been conducted in local currencies, limiting the Companys exposure to changes in currency rates. The Company periodically enters into short term forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates on inventory purchases. The fair value of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at August 28, 2005 was $42,901. 27 Table of Contents 
 
Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) While there can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized, and plans are subject to change upon further review, it is managements current intention to spend approximately $1,100,000 to $1,250,000 during fiscal 2006 in the United States and Canada for real estate, construction, remodeling and equipment for warehouse clubs and related operations; and approximately $100,000 to $150,000 for international expansion, including the United Kingdom, Asia, Mexico and other potential ventures. These expenditures are expected to be financed with a combination of cash provided from operations and the use of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. Expansion plans for the United States and Canada during fiscal 2006 are to open approximately 28 30 new warehouse clubs on a net basis, inclusive of two to three relocations to larger and better located warehouses. The Company expects to continue its review of expansion plans in its international operations, including the United Kingdom and Asia, along with other international markets. At present, the Company is planning to open three additional warehouses in the U.K during fiscal 2006. Costco Mexico plans to open two to three new warehouse clubs during fiscal 2006. Additional Equity Investments in Subsidiaries and Joint Ventures On June 30, 2005, the Company acquired the remaining 4% interest in CWC Travel Inc for $3,961, bringing Costcos ownership in this entity to 100%. In addition, during fiscal 2005 the Company contributed an additional $15,000 to its investment in Costco Mexico (a 50% owned joint venture), which did not impact its percentage ownership of this entity as the joint venture partner contributed a like amount. On October 3, 2003, the Company acquired from Carrefour Nederland B.V. its 20% equity interest in Costco Wholesale UK Limited for cash of $95,153, bringing Costcos ownership in Costco Wholesale UK Limited to 100%. Bank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs (all amounts stated in thousands of US dollars) The Company has a $500,000 commercial paper program supported by a $150,000 bank credit facility ($300,000 at August 29, 2004) with a group of nine banks, which expires on November 15, 2005, and is not expected to be renewed. At August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, no amounts were outstanding under the commercial paper program and no amounts were outstanding under the credit facility. Applicable interest rates on the credit facility at August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, were 3.92% and 1.90%, respectively. A wholly owned Canadian subsidiary has a $167,000 commercial paper program ($152,000 at August 29, 2004) supported by a $50,000 bank credit facility ($46,000 at August 29, 2004) with a Canadian bank, which is guaranteed by the Company and expires in March 2006. At August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, no amounts were outstanding under the Canadian commercial paper program or the bank credit facility. Applicable interest rates on the credit facility at August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, were 4.25% and 3.75%, respectively. At August 28, 2005, standby letters of credit totaling $23,000 issued under the bank credit facility left $27,000 available for commercial paper support. At August 29, 2004, standby letters of credit totaling $21,000 issued under the bank credit facility left $25,000 available for commercial paper support. The Company has agreed to limit the combined amount outstanding under the U.S. and Canadian commercial paper programs to the combined amounts of the supporting bank credit facilities, which are $177,000 at August 28, 2005, decreasing to $27,000 on November 15, 2005. At August 29, 2004, the combined amount of supporting bank credit facilities was $325,000. The Companys wholly owned Japanese subsidiary has a short term $13,694 bank line of credit that expires in February 2006. At August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, $5,477 and $0, respectively, were borrowed under the line of credit, and $3,652 and $2,576, respectively, were used to support standby letters of credit. A second 21 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) $13,694 bank line of credit was entered into in February 2005 that expires in February 2006. At August 28, 2005, $9,129 was borrowed under the second facility; this bank line was not in place at August 29, 2004. Applicable interest rates on the credit facilities at both August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, were .84%. The Companys Korean subsidiary has a short term $11,665 bank line of credit, which expires in January 2006. At August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, no amounts were borrowed under the line of credit and $1,668 and $0, respectively, were used to support standby letters of credit. Applicable interest rates on the credit facility at August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, were 4.51% and 4.52%, respectively. The Companys Taiwan subsidiary has a $7,439 bank revolving credit facility that expires in January 2006. At August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, no amounts were borrowed under the credit facility and $2,495 and $1,165, respectively, were used to support standby letters of credit. A second $15,499 bank revolving credit facility is in place, which expires in July 2006. At August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, no amounts were borrowed under the second credit facility and $790 and $738, respectively were used to support standby letters of credit. Applicable interest rates on the credit facilities at August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, were 3.75% and 3.50%, respectively. The Companys wholly owned United Kingdom subsidiary has a $108,408 bank revolving credit facility expiring in February 2007 and a $63,238 bank overdraft facility renewable on a yearly basis in March 2006. At August 28, 2005, $39,750 was outstanding under the revolving credit facility with an applicable interest rate of 5.30% and no amounts were outstanding under the bank overdraft facility. At August 29, 2004, $21,595 was outstanding under the revolving credit facility with an applicable interest rate of 5.285% and no amounts were outstanding under the bank overdraft facility. Letters of Credit The Company has letter of credit facilities (for commercial and standby letters of credit), totaling approximately $401,933. The outstanding commitments under these facilities at August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004 totaled approximately $131,169 and $166,800, respectively, including approximately $64,532 and $52,900, respectively, in standby letters of credit. Financing Activities The Companys 7 1/8% Senior Notes, carried at $304,350 at August 29, 2004, matured and were repaid on June 15, 2005 from its cash and cash equivalents. In April 2003, the Companys wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.92% in the aggregate amount of $36,516, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due on April 26, 2010. In March 2002, the Company issued $300,000 of 5 1/2% Senior Notes carried at $307,688 due March 15, 2007. Interest is payable semi annually. Simultaneous with the issuance of the Senior Notes, the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements converting the interest from fixed to floating. In February 1996, the Company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a shelf registration statement for $500,000 of senior debt securities. On October 23, 2001, additional debt securities of $100,000 were registered. The $300,000 of 5 1/2% Senior Notes issued in March 2002 reduced the amount of registered securities available for future issuance to $300,000. During fiscal 2005, $280,811 in principal amount of the Companys 3 1/2% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes were converted by note holders into 9,910,011 shares of common stock. 22 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Derivatives The Company has limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and uses them only to manage well defined interest rate and foreign exchange risks. Forward foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on inventory purchases and typically have very short terms. The aggregate amount of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, was $42,466 and $30,495, respectively. The majority of the forward foreign exchange contracts were entered into by the Companys wholly owned United Kingdom subsidiary, primarily to hedge U.S. dollar merchandise inventory purchases. The Company monitors its foreign currency exchange exposures to ensure the overall effectiveness of its foreign currency hedge positions. The only other derivative instruments the Company holds are interest rate swaps, which the Company uses to manage the interest rate risk associated with its borrowings and to manage the Companys mix of fixed rate and variable rate debt. As of August 28, 2005, the Company had fixed to floating interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $300,000 and an aggregate fair value of $7,688, which is recorded in other assets on the Companys consolidated balance sheet. These swaps were entered into effective March 25, 2002, and are designated and qualify as fair value hedges of the Companys $300,000 5 1/2% Senior Notes. As the terms of the swaps match those of the underlying hedged debt, the changes in the fair value of these swaps are offset by corresponding changes in the carrying amount of the hedged debt and result in no net earnings impact. As of August 29, 2004, the Company had fixed to floating interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $600,000 and an aggregate fair value of $25,754. In addition to the Companys swap on the 5 1/2% Senior Notes noted above, the Company had entered into a swap on its $300,000 7 1/8% Senior Notes effective November 13, 2001, which was designated and qualified as a fair value hedge. The $300,000 7 1/8% Senior Notes matured and were repaid on June 15, 2005. Concurrent to this transaction, the related swap agreement expired. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements With the exception of its operating leases, the Company has no off balance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on the Companys financial condition or consolidated financial statements. Stock Repurchase Program On November 30, 2001, the Companys Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program, authorizing the repurchase of up to $500,000 of Costco Common Stock through November 30, 2004. Under the program, the Company could repurchase shares at any time in the open market or in private transactions as market conditions warrant. The repurchased shares would be retired. On October 25, 2004, the Board of Directors renewed the program for another three years. On June 7, 2005 the Company began repurchasing shares on the open market. Through August 28, 2005 the Company has repurchased 9,205,100 shares of common stock at an average price of $44.89, totaling approximately $413,252, including commissions. Subsequent to the Companys fiscal 2005 year end, August 29, 2005, the Board of Directors of Costco authorized an additional stock repurchase program of up to $1,000,000 of Costco common stock. Under the program, which contains no expiration date, the Company may repurchase shares at any time in the open market or in private transactions as market conditions warrant. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the Companys financial statements requires that management make estimates and judgments that affect the financial position and results of operations. Management continues to review its accounting policies and evaluate its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, merchandise inventory, 23 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) impairment of long lived assets and warehouse closing costs and insurance/self insurance liabilities. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the present circumstances. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes sales, net of estimated returns, at the time customers take possession of merchandise or receive services. When the Company collects payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services, the amount received is recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed. The Company provides for estimated sales returns based on historical returns levels. The Company evaluates the criteria of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal Versus Net as an Agent, in determining whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, when Costco is the primary obligor, is subject to inventory risk, has latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, influence product or service specifications, or has several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded on a gross basis. If the Company is not the primary obligor and does not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above, Costco records the net amounts as commissions earned. Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market as determined primarily by the retail method of accounting and are stated using the last in, first out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail method of accounting and are stated using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. The Company believes the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. The Company records an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the expected annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end. At August 28, 2005, merchandise inventories valued at LIFO approximated FIFO after considering the lower of cost or market principle. At August 29, 2004, merchandise inventories valued using LIFO exceeded the comparable FIFO value by approximately $13,410 due to the aggregate effects of deflation. The Company provides for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts on the basis of a percentage of sales. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect the trend of the actual physical inventory count results, which generally occur in the second and fourth fiscal quarters of the Companys fiscal year. Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as the Company progresses towards earning those rebates provided they are probable and reasonably estimable. Other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of agreement, or other systematic and rational approach. Impairment of long lived assets and warehouse closing costs The Company periodically evaluates its long lived assets for indicators of impairment. Managements judgments are based on market and operational conditions at the present time. Future events could cause management to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring an adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value. 24 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) The Company provides estimates for warehouse closing costs, based on the applicable accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Future circumstances may result in the Companys actual future closing costs or the amount recognized upon the sale of the property to differ substantially from the original estimates. Insurance/Self Insurance Liabilities The Company uses a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms to provide for the potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property damage, director and officers liability, vehicle liability and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by the Company are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience and outside expertise, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In May 2005, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, a Replacement of Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 20 and FASB Statement No. 3. SFAS 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements for changes in accounting principles, unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change. SFAS 154 also requires that retrospective application of a change in accounting principle be limited to the direct effects of the change. Indirect effects of a change in accounting principle, such as a change in non discretionary profit sharing payments resulting from an accounting change, should be recognized in the period of the accounting change. SFAS 154 also requires that a change in depreciation, amortization, or depletion method for long lived, non financial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate effected by a change in accounting principle. SFAS 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. Early adoption is permitted for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after the date this Statement is issued. The Company is required to adopt the provisions of SFAS 154, as applicable, beginning in fiscal 2007. The Company does not believe the adoption of SFAS 154 will have a significant effect on its future consolidated financial statements. In March 2005, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, An Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143, which requires an entity to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation when incurred if the liabilitys fair value can be reasonably estimated. The Company adopted the provisions of FIN 47 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. The adoption of this Interpretation did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R, Share based Payments. SFAS 123R revises SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, which the Company adopted as of the beginning of its fiscal 2003, and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. SFAS 123R applies to transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services and also applies to liabilities an entity may incur for goods or services that are based on the fair value of those equity instruments. All employee stock option grants made by the Company since the beginning of fiscal 2003 have been expensed over the related option vesting period based on the fair value at the date the options are granted using the Black Scholes model. Under SFAS 123R, the Company will be required to select a valuation technique or option pricing model that meets the criteria as stated in the standard. Allowable valuation models include a binomial model and the Black Scholes model. The Company is required to adopt the provisions of SFAS 123R in the first quarter of its fiscal 2006. The Company is in the process of assessing the impact on the Companys results of operations from the adoption of SFAS 123R for its effect on prospective option grants. The adoption of SFAS 123R requires the Company to value stock options granted prior to its adoption of SFAS 123 under the fair value 25 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) method and expense these amounts in the income statement over the stock options remaining vesting period. This will result in the Company expensing $13,043 in fiscal 2006, which would previously have been presented in a proforma footnote disclosure. In addition, SFAS 123R will require the Company to reflect the tax savings resulting from tax deductions in excess of expense reflected in its financial statements as a financing cash flow, which will impact the Companys future reported cash flows from operating activities. In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, Inventory Costs An Amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin (ARB) No. 43, Chapter 4. SFAS 151 clarifies that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and spoilage should be expensed as incurred and not included in overhead. Further, SFAS 151 requires that allocation of fixed and production facilities overheads to conversion costs should be based on normal capacity of the production facilities. The provisions in this statement are effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005. The Company does not believe that the adoption of SFAS 151 will have a significant effect on its future consolidated financial statements. In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153, Exchanges of Non monetary Assets An Amendment of APB No. 29. The provisions of this statement are effective for non monetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005. This statement eliminates the exception to fair value for exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchange transactions that do not have commercial substance that is, transactions that are not expected to result in significant changes in the cash flows of the reporting entity. The Company does not believe that the adoption of SFAS 153 will have a significant effect on its future consolidated financial statements. In March 2004, the FASB EITF reached a consensus on EITF Issue No. 03 1, The Meaning of Other Than Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments, (EITF 03 1). The guidance prescribes a three step model for determining whether an investment is other than temporarily impaired and requires disclosures about unrealized losses on investments. The accounting guidance became effective for reporting periods beginning after June 15, 2004, while the disclosure requirements became effective for annual reporting periods ending after June 15, 2004. In September 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) EITF 03 1 1, Effective Date of Paragraphs 10 20 of EITF Issue No. 03 1 The Meaning of Other Than Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments, (FSP EITF 03 1 1). FSP EITF 03 1 1 delayed the effective date for the measurement and recognition guidance contained in paragraphs 10 20 of EITF Issue 03 1. In November 2005, the FASB issued FSP FAS 115 1 and FAS 124 1, The Meaning of Other Than Temporary Impairment and its Application to Certain Investments. This FSP addresses the determination as to when an investment is considered impaired, whether the impairment is other than temporary and the measurement of an impairment loss. This statement specifically nullifies the requirements of paragraph 10 18 of EITF 03 1 and references existing other than temporary impairment guidance. The guidance under this FSP is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2005 and the Company continued to apply relevant other than temporary guidance as provided for in FSP EITF 03 1 1 during fiscal 2005. The Company does not believe that the adoption of the guidance of FSP FAS 115 1 and FAS 124 1 will have a significant effect on its future consolidated financial statements. In November 2003, the EITF reached consensus on Issue No. 03 10, Application of Issue No. 02 16 by Resellers to Sales Incentives Offered to Consumers by Manufacturers, with respect to determining if consideration received by a reseller from a vendor that is reimbursed by the vendor for honoring the vendors sale incentives offered directly to consumers should be recorded as a reduction in sales. These rules apply to transactions entered into by consumers in fiscal periods beginning after November 25, 2003 and, therefore, apply to such transactions starting with the Companys fiscal third quarter of 2004, which began February 16, 2004. The adoption of EITF 03 10 did not affect the Companys consolidated gross profit or net income, but did result in a reduction of both net sales and merchandise costs by an equal amount. Had the first half of fiscal 2004 and all of fiscal 2003 been reported under EITF 03 10 guidance, the sales and cost of sales would have been reduced by approximately $186,900 and $282,300, respectively. 26 Table of Contents Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company is exposed to financial market risk resulting from changes in interest and foreign currency rates. As a policy, the Company does not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions, nor hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. The nature and amount of the Companys long and short term debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As of August 28, 2005, the Companys fixed rate long term debt includes its $415,246 principal amount at maturity Zero Coupon Subordinated Notes carried at $274,071 and additional notes and capital lease obligations totaling $132,141. The Companys debt also includes $300,000 5 1/2% Senior Notes carried at $307,688. The Company has entered into fixed to floating interest rate swaps on the Senior Notes, effectively converting these fixed interest rate securities to variable rate securities. As of August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, the Company had fixed to floating interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $300,000 and $600,000, respectively, and an aggregate fair value of $7,688 and $25,754, respectively. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt and may affect the interest expense related to the variable rate debt. The Company holds interest bearing instruments that are classified as cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. The Companys investment policy is to manage its total cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances to preserve principal and liquidity while maximizing the return on the investment portfolio through the full investment of available funds. The Company diversifies its investment portfolio by investing in multiple types of investment grade securities and through internal management and the use of third party investment managers. Short term investments generally have a maturity of three months to five years from the purchase date. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. As the majority of these instruments are of a short term nature, if interest rates were to increase or decrease immediately, there is no material risk of a valuation adjustment related to these instruments. For those instruments that are classified as available for sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in interest rates are reflected in other accumulated comprehensive income or loss. Based on the Companys cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances at August 28, 2005, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $15,000 to interest income (pre tax) on an annual basis. Most foreign currency transactions have been conducted in local currencies, limiting the Companys exposure to changes in currency rates. The Company periodically enters into short term forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates on inventory purchases. The fair value of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at August 28, 2005 was $42,901. 27 Table of Contents 
 
Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) $13,694 bank line of credit was entered into in February 2005 that expires in February 2006. At August 28, 2005, $9,129 was borrowed under the second facility; this bank line was not in place at August 29, 2004. Applicable interest rates on the credit facilities at both August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, were .84%. The Companys Korean subsidiary has a short term $11,665 bank line of credit, which expires in January 2006. At August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, no amounts were borrowed under the line of credit and $1,668 and $0, respectively, were used to support standby letters of credit. Applicable interest rates on the credit facility at August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, were 4.51% and 4.52%, respectively. The Companys Taiwan subsidiary has a $7,439 bank revolving credit facility that expires in January 2006. At August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, no amounts were borrowed under the credit facility and $2,495 and $1,165, respectively, were used to support standby letters of credit. A second $15,499 bank revolving credit facility is in place, which expires in July 2006. At August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, no amounts were borrowed under the second credit facility and $790 and $738, respectively were used to support standby letters of credit. Applicable interest rates on the credit facilities at August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, were 3.75% and 3.50%, respectively. The Companys wholly owned United Kingdom subsidiary has a $108,408 bank revolving credit facility expiring in February 2007 and a $63,238 bank overdraft facility renewable on a yearly basis in March 2006. At August 28, 2005, $39,750 was outstanding under the revolving credit facility with an applicable interest rate of 5.30% and no amounts were outstanding under the bank overdraft facility. At August 29, 2004, $21,595 was outstanding under the revolving credit facility with an applicable interest rate of 5.285% and no amounts were outstanding under the bank overdraft facility. Letters of Credit The Company has letter of credit facilities (for commercial and standby letters of credit), totaling approximately $401,933. The outstanding commitments under these facilities at August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004 totaled approximately $131,169 and $166,800, respectively, including approximately $64,532 and $52,900, respectively, in standby letters of credit. Financing Activities The Companys 7 1/8% Senior Notes, carried at $304,350 at August 29, 2004, matured and were repaid on June 15, 2005 from its cash and cash equivalents. In April 2003, the Companys wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.92% in the aggregate amount of $36,516, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due on April 26, 2010. In March 2002, the Company issued $300,000 of 5 1/2% Senior Notes carried at $307,688 due March 15, 2007. Interest is payable semi annually. Simultaneous with the issuance of the Senior Notes, the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements converting the interest from fixed to floating. In February 1996, the Company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a shelf registration statement for $500,000 of senior debt securities. On October 23, 2001, additional debt securities of $100,000 were registered. The $300,000 of 5 1/2% Senior Notes issued in March 2002 reduced the amount of registered securities available for future issuance to $300,000. During fiscal 2005, $280,811 in principal amount of the Companys 3 1/2% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes were converted by note holders into 9,910,011 shares of common stock. 22 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Derivatives The Company has limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and uses them only to manage well defined interest rate and foreign exchange risks. Forward foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on inventory purchases and typically have very short terms. The aggregate amount of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, was $42,466 and $30,495, respectively. The majority of the forward foreign exchange contracts were entered into by the Companys wholly owned United Kingdom subsidiary, primarily to hedge U.S. dollar merchandise inventory purchases. The Company monitors its foreign currency exchange exposures to ensure the overall effectiveness of its foreign currency hedge positions. The only other derivative instruments the Company holds are interest rate swaps, which the Company uses to manage the interest rate risk associated with its borrowings and to manage the Companys mix of fixed rate and variable rate debt. As of August 28, 2005, the Company had fixed to floating interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $300,000 and an aggregate fair value of $7,688, which is recorded in other assets on the Companys consolidated balance sheet. These swaps were entered into effective March 25, 2002, and are designated and qualify as fair value hedges of the Companys $300,000 5 1/2% Senior Notes. As the terms of the swaps match those of the underlying hedged debt, the changes in the fair value of these swaps are offset by corresponding changes in the carrying amount of the hedged debt and result in no net earnings impact. As of August 29, 2004, the Company had fixed to floating interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $600,000 and an aggregate fair value of $25,754. In addition to the Companys swap on the 5 1/2% Senior Notes noted above, the Company had entered into a swap on its $300,000 7 1/8% Senior Notes effective November 13, 2001, which was designated and qualified as a fair value hedge. The $300,000 7 1/8% Senior Notes matured and were repaid on June 15, 2005. Concurrent to this transaction, the related swap agreement expired. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements With the exception of its operating leases, the Company has no off balance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on the Companys financial condition or consolidated financial statements. Stock Repurchase Program On November 30, 2001, the Companys Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program, authorizing the repurchase of up to $500,000 of Costco Common Stock through November 30, 2004. Under the program, the Company could repurchase shares at any time in the open market or in private transactions as market conditions warrant. The repurchased shares would be retired. On October 25, 2004, the Board of Directors renewed the program for another three years. On June 7, 2005 the Company began repurchasing shares on the open market. Through August 28, 2005 the Company has repurchased 9,205,100 shares of common stock at an average price of $44.89, totaling approximately $413,252, including commissions. Subsequent to the Companys fiscal 2005 year end, August 29, 2005, the Board of Directors of Costco authorized an additional stock repurchase program of up to $1,000,000 of Costco common stock. Under the program, which contains no expiration date, the Company may repurchase shares at any time in the open market or in private transactions as market conditions warrant. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the Companys financial statements requires that management make estimates and judgments that affect the financial position and results of operations. Management continues to review its accounting policies and evaluate its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, merchandise inventory, 23 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) impairment of long lived assets and warehouse closing costs and insurance/self insurance liabilities. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the present circumstances. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes sales, net of estimated returns, at the time customers take possession of merchandise or receive services. When the Company collects payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services, the amount received is recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed. The Company provides for estimated sales returns based on historical returns levels. The Company evaluates the criteria of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal Versus Net as an Agent, in determining whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, when Costco is the primary obligor, is subject to inventory risk, has latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, influence product or service specifications, or has several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded on a gross basis. If the Company is not the primary obligor and does not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above, Costco records the net amounts as commissions earned. Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market as determined primarily by the retail method of accounting and are stated using the last in, first out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail method of accounting and are stated using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. The Company believes the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. The Company records an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the expected annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end. At August 28, 2005, merchandise inventories valued at LIFO approximated FIFO after considering the lower of cost or market principle. At August 29, 2004, merchandise inventories valued using LIFO exceeded the comparable FIFO value by approximately $13,410 due to the aggregate effects of deflation. The Company provides for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts on the basis of a percentage of sales. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect the trend of the actual physical inventory count results, which generally occur in the second and fourth fiscal quarters of the Companys fiscal year. Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as the Company progresses towards earning those rebates provided they are probable and reasonably estimable. Other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of agreement, or other systematic and rational approach. Impairment of long lived assets and warehouse closing costs The Company periodically evaluates its long lived assets for indicators of impairment. Managements judgments are based on market and operational conditions at the present time. Future events could cause management to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring an adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value. 24 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) The Company provides estimates for warehouse closing costs, based on the applicable accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Future circumstances may result in the Companys actual future closing costs or the amount recognized upon the sale of the property to differ substantially from the original estimates. Insurance/Self Insurance Liabilities The Company uses a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms to provide for the potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property damage, director and officers liability, vehicle liability and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by the Company are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience and outside expertise, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In May 2005, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, a Replacement of Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 20 and FASB Statement No. 3. SFAS 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements for changes in accounting principles, unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change. SFAS 154 also requires that retrospective application of a change in accounting principle be limited to the direct effects of the change. Indirect effects of a change in accounting principle, such as a change in non discretionary profit sharing payments resulting from an accounting change, should be recognized in the period of the accounting change. SFAS 154 also requires that a change in depreciation, amortization, or depletion method for long lived, non financial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate effected by a change in accounting principle. SFAS 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. Early adoption is permitted for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after the date this Statement is issued. The Company is required to adopt the provisions of SFAS 154, as applicable, beginning in fiscal 2007. The Company does not believe the adoption of SFAS 154 will have a significant effect on its future consolidated financial statements. In March 2005, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, An Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143, which requires an entity to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation when incurred if the liabilitys fair value can be reasonably estimated. The Company adopted the provisions of FIN 47 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. The adoption of this Interpretation did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R, Share based Payments. SFAS 123R revises SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, which the Company adopted as of the beginning of its fiscal 2003, and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. SFAS 123R applies to transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services and also applies to liabilities an entity may incur for goods or services that are based on the fair value of those equity instruments. All employee stock option grants made by the Company since the beginning of fiscal 2003 have been expensed over the related option vesting period based on the fair value at the date the options are granted using the Black Scholes model. Under SFAS 123R, the Company will be required to select a valuation technique or option pricing model that meets the criteria as stated in the standard. Allowable valuation models include a binomial model and the Black Scholes model. The Company is required to adopt the provisions of SFAS 123R in the first quarter of its fiscal 2006. The Company is in the process of assessing the impact on the Companys results of operations from the adoption of SFAS 123R for its effect on prospective option grants. The adoption of SFAS 123R requires the Company to value stock options granted prior to its adoption of SFAS 123 under the fair value 25 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) method and expense these amounts in the income statement over the stock options remaining vesting period. This will result in the Company expensing $13,043 in fiscal 2006, which would previously have been presented in a proforma footnote disclosure. In addition, SFAS 123R will require the Company to reflect the tax savings resulting from tax deductions in excess of expense reflected in its financial statements as a financing cash flow, which will impact the Companys future reported cash flows from operating activities. In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, Inventory Costs An Amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin (ARB) No. 43, Chapter 4. SFAS 151 clarifies that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and spoilage should be expensed as incurred and not included in overhead. Further, SFAS 151 requires that allocation of fixed and production facilities overheads to conversion costs should be based on normal capacity of the production facilities. The provisions in this statement are effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005. The Company does not believe that the adoption of SFAS 151 will have a significant effect on its future consolidated financial statements. In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153, Exchanges of Non monetary Assets An Amendment of APB No. 29. The provisions of this statement are effective for non monetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005. This statement eliminates the exception to fair value for exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchange transactions that do not have commercial substance that is, transactions that are not expected to result in significant changes in the cash flows of the reporting entity. The Company does not believe that the adoption of SFAS 153 will have a significant effect on its future consolidated financial statements. In March 2004, the FASB EITF reached a consensus on EITF Issue No. 03 1, The Meaning of Other Than Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments, (EITF 03 1). The guidance prescribes a three step model for determining whether an investment is other than temporarily impaired and requires disclosures about unrealized losses on investments. The accounting guidance became effective for reporting periods beginning after June 15, 2004, while the disclosure requirements became effective for annual reporting periods ending after June 15, 2004.

FSP EITF 03 1 1 delayed the effective date for the measurement and recognition guidance contained in paragraphs 10 20 of EITF Issue 03 1. In November 2005, the FASB issued FSP FAS 115 1 and FAS 124 1, The Meaning of Other Than Temporary Impairment and its Application to Certain Investments. This FSP addresses the determination as to when an investment is considered impaired, whether the impairment is other than temporary and the measurement of an impairment loss. This statement specifically nullifies the requirements of paragraph 10 18 of EITF 03 1 and references existing other than temporary impairment guidance. The guidance under this FSP is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2005 and the Company continued to apply relevant other than temporary guidance as provided for in FSP EITF 03 1 1 during fiscal 2005. The Company does not believe that the adoption of the guidance of FSP FAS 115 1 and FAS 124 1 will have a significant effect on its future consolidated financial statements. In November 2003, the EITF reached consensus on Issue No. 03 10, Application of Issue No. 02 16 by Resellers to Sales Incentives Offered to Consumers by Manufacturers, with respect to determining if consideration received by a reseller from a vendor that is reimbursed by the vendor for honoring the vendors sale incentives offered directly to consumers should be recorded as a reduction in sales. These rules apply to transactions entered into by consumers in fiscal periods beginning after November 25, 2003 and, therefore, apply to such transactions starting with the Companys fiscal third quarter of 2004, which began February 16, 2004.

As of August 28, 2005, the Company had fixed to floating interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $300,000 and an aggregate fair value of $7,688, which is recorded in other assets on the Companys consolidated balance sheet. These swaps were entered into effective March 25, 2002, and are designated and qualify as fair value hedges of the Companys $300,000 5 1/2% Senior Notes. As the terms of the swaps match those of the underlying hedged debt, the changes in the fair value of these swaps are offset by corresponding changes in the carrying amount of the hedged debt and result in no net earnings impact. As of August 29, 2004, the Company had fixed to floating interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $600,000 and an aggregate fair value of $25,754. In addition to the Companys swap on the 5 1/2% Senior Notes noted above, the Company had entered into a swap on its $300,000 7 1/8% Senior Notes effective November 13, 2001, which was designated and qualified as a fair value hedge. The $300,000 7 1/8% Senior Notes matured and were repaid on June 15, 2005. Concurrent to this transaction, the related swap agreement expired. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements With the exception of its operating leases, the Company has no off balance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on the Companys financial condition or consolidated financial statements. Stock Repurchase Program On November 30, 2001, the Companys Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program, authorizing the repurchase of up to $500,000 of Costco Common Stock through November 30, 2004. Under the program, the Company could repurchase shares at any time in the open market or in private transactions as market conditions warrant. The repurchased shares would be retired. On October 25, 2004, the Board of Directors renewed the program for another three years. On June 7, 2005 the Company began repurchasing shares on the open market. Through August 28, 2005 the Company has repurchased 9,205,100 shares of common stock at an average price of $44.89, totaling approximately $413,252, including commissions. Subsequent to the Companys fiscal 2005 year end, August 29, 2005, the Board of Directors of Costco authorized an additional stock repurchase program of up to $1,000,000 of Costco common stock. Under the program, which contains no expiration date, the Company may repurchase shares at any time in the open market or in private transactions as market conditions warrant. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the Companys financial statements requires that management make estimates and judgments that affect the financial position and results of operations. Management continues to review its accounting policies and evaluate its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, merchandise inventory, 23 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) impairment of long lived assets and warehouse closing costs and insurance/self insurance liabilities. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the present circumstances. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes sales, net of estimated returns, at the time customers take possession of merchandise or receive services. When the Company collects payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services, the amount received is recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed. The Company provides for estimated sales returns based on historical returns levels. The Company evaluates the criteria of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal Versus Net as an Agent, in determining whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, when Costco is the primary obligor, is subject to inventory risk, has latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, influence product or service specifications, or has several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded on a gross basis. If the Company is not the primary obligor and does not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above, Costco records the net amounts as commissions earned. Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market as determined primarily by the retail method of accounting and are stated using the last in, first out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail method of accounting and are stated using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. The Company believes the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. The Company records an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the expected annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end. At August 28, 2005, merchandise inventories valued at LIFO approximated FIFO after considering the lower of cost or market principle. At August 29, 2004, merchandise inventories valued using LIFO exceeded the comparable FIFO value by approximately $13,410 due to the aggregate effects of deflation. The Company provides for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts on the basis of a percentage of sales. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect the trend of the actual physical inventory count results, which generally occur in the second and fourth fiscal quarters of the Companys fiscal year. Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as the Company progresses towards earning those rebates provided they are probable and reasonably estimable. Other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of agreement, or other systematic and rational approach. Impairment of long lived assets and warehouse closing costs The Company periodically evaluates its long lived assets for indicators of impairment. Managements judgments are based on market and operational conditions at the present time. Future events could cause management to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring an adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value. 24 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) The Company provides estimates for warehouse closing costs, based on the applicable accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Future circumstances may result in the Companys actual future closing costs or the amount recognized upon the sale of the property to differ substantially from the original estimates. Insurance/Self Insurance Liabilities The Company uses a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms to provide for the potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property damage, director and officers liability, vehicle liability and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by the Company are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience and outside expertise, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In May 2005, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, a Replacement of Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 20 and FASB Statement No. 3. SFAS 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements for changes in accounting principles, unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change. SFAS 154 also requires that retrospective application of a change in accounting principle be limited to the direct effects of the change. Indirect effects of a change in accounting principle, such as a change in non discretionary profit sharing payments resulting from an accounting change, should be recognized in the period of the accounting change. SFAS 154 also requires that a change in depreciation, amortization, or depletion method for long lived, non financial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate effected by a change in accounting principle. SFAS 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. Early adoption is permitted for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after the date this Statement is issued. The Company is required to adopt the provisions of SFAS 154, as applicable, beginning in fiscal 2007. The Company does not believe the adoption of SFAS 154 will have a significant effect on its future consolidated financial statements. In March 2005, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, An Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143, which requires an entity to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation when incurred if the liabilitys fair value can be reasonably estimated. The Company adopted the provisions of FIN 47 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. The adoption of this Interpretation did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R, Share based Payments. SFAS 123R revises SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, which the Company adopted as of the beginning of its fiscal 2003, and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. SFAS 123R applies to transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services and also applies to liabilities an entity may incur for goods or services that are based on the fair value of those equity instruments. All employee stock option grants made by the Company since the beginning of fiscal 2003 have been expensed over the related option vesting period based on the fair value at the date the options are granted using the Black Scholes model. Under SFAS 123R, the Company will be required to select a valuation technique or option pricing model that meets the criteria as stated in the standard. Allowable valuation models include a binomial model and the Black Scholes model. The Company is required to adopt the provisions of SFAS 123R in the first quarter of its fiscal 2006. The Company is in the process of assessing the impact on the Companys results of operations from the adoption of SFAS 123R for its effect on prospective option grants. The adoption of SFAS 123R requires the Company to value stock options granted prior to its adoption of SFAS 123 under the fair value 25 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) method and expense these amounts in the income statement over the stock options remaining vesting period. This will result in the Company expensing $13,043 in fiscal 2006, which would previously have been presented in a proforma footnote disclosure. In addition, SFAS 123R will require the Company to reflect the tax savings resulting from tax deductions in excess of expense reflected in its financial statements as a financing cash flow, which will impact the Companys future reported cash flows from operating activities. In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, Inventory Costs An Amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin (ARB) No. 43, Chapter 4. SFAS 151 clarifies that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and spoilage should be expensed as incurred and not included in overhead. Further, SFAS 151 requires that allocation of fixed and production facilities overheads to conversion costs should be based on normal capacity of the production facilities. The provisions in this statement are effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005. The Company does not believe that the adoption of SFAS 151 will have a significant effect on its future consolidated financial statements. In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153, Exchanges of Non monetary Assets An Amendment of APB No. 29. The provisions of this statement are effective for non monetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005. This statement eliminates the exception to fair value for exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchange transactions that do not have commercial substance that is, transactions that are not expected to result in significant changes in the cash flows of the reporting entity. The Company does not believe that the adoption of SFAS 153 will have a significant effect on its future consolidated financial statements. In March 2004, the FASB EITF reached a consensus on EITF Issue No. 03 1, The Meaning of Other Than Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments, (EITF 03 1). The guidance prescribes a three step model for determining whether an investment is other than temporarily impaired and requires disclosures about unrealized losses on investments. The accounting guidance became effective for reporting periods beginning after June 15, 2004, while the disclosure requirements became effective for annual reporting periods ending after June 15, 2004. In September 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) EITF 03 1 1, Effective Date of Paragraphs 10 20 of EITF Issue No. 03 1 The Meaning of Other Than Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments, (FSP EITF 03 1 1). FSP EITF 03 1 1 delayed the effective date for the measurement and recognition guidance contained in paragraphs 10 20 of EITF Issue 03 1. In November 2005, the FASB issued FSP FAS 115 1 and FAS 124 1, The Meaning of Other Than Temporary Impairment and its Application to Certain Investments. This FSP addresses the determination as to when an investment is considered impaired, whether the impairment is other than temporary and the measurement of an impairment loss. This statement specifically nullifies the requirements of paragraph 10 18 of EITF 03 1 and references existing other than temporary impairment guidance. The guidance under this FSP is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2005 and the Company continued to apply relevant other than temporary guidance as provided for in FSP EITF 03 1 1 during fiscal 2005. The Company does not believe that the adoption of the guidance of FSP FAS 115 1 and FAS 124 1 will have a significant effect on its future consolidated financial statements. In November 2003, the EITF reached consensus on Issue No. 03 10, Application of Issue No. 02 16 by Resellers to Sales Incentives Offered to Consumers by Manufacturers, with respect to determining if consideration received by a reseller from a vendor that is reimbursed by the vendor for honoring the vendors sale incentives offered directly to consumers should be recorded as a reduction in sales. These rules apply to transactions entered into by consumers in fiscal periods beginning after November 25, 2003 and, therefore, apply to such transactions starting with the Companys fiscal third quarter of 2004, which began February 16, 2004. The adoption of EITF 03 10 did not affect the Companys consolidated gross profit or net income, but did result in a reduction of both net sales and merchandise costs by an equal amount. Had the first half of fiscal 2004 and all of fiscal 2003 been reported under EITF 03 10 guidance, the sales and cost of sales would have been reduced by approximately $186,900 and $282,300, respectively. 26 Table of Contents Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company is exposed to financial market risk resulting from changes in interest and foreign currency rates. As a policy, the Company does not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions, nor hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. The nature and amount of the Companys long and short term debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As of August 28, 2005, the Companys fixed rate long term debt includes its $415,246 principal amount at maturity Zero Coupon Subordinated Notes carried at $274,071 and additional notes and capital lease obligations totaling $132,141. The Companys debt also includes $300,000 5 1/2% Senior Notes carried at $307,688. The Company has entered into fixed to floating interest rate swaps on the Senior Notes, effectively converting these fixed interest rate securities to variable rate securities. As of August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, the Company had fixed to floating interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $300,000 and $600,000, respectively, and an aggregate fair value of $7,688 and $25,754, respectively. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt and may affect the interest expense related to the variable rate debt. The Company holds interest bearing instruments that are classified as cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. The Companys investment policy is to manage its total cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances to preserve principal and liquidity while maximizing the return on the investment portfolio through the full investment of available funds. The Company diversifies its investment portfolio by investing in multiple types of investment grade securities and through internal management and the use of third party investment managers. Short term investments generally have a maturity of three months to five years from the purchase date. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. As the majority of these instruments are of a short term nature, if interest rates were to increase or decrease immediately, there is no material risk of a valuation adjustment related to these instruments. For those instruments that are classified as available for sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in interest rates are reflected in other accumulated comprehensive income or loss. Based on the Companys cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances at August 28, 2005, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $15,000 to interest income (pre tax) on an annual basis. Most foreign currency transactions have been conducted in local currencies, limiting the Companys exposure to changes in currency rates. The Company periodically enters into short term forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates on inventory purchases. The fair value of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at August 28, 2005 was $42,901. 27 Table of Contents

Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) The Company provides estimates for warehouse closing costs, based on the applicable accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Future circumstances may result in the Companys actual future closing costs or the amount recognized upon the sale of the property to differ substantially from the original estimates. Insurance/Self Insurance Liabilities The Company uses a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms to provide for the potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property damage, director and officers liability, vehicle liability and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by the Company are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience and outside expertise, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In May 2005, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, a Replacement of Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 20 and FASB Statement No. 3. SFAS 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements for changes in accounting principles, unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change. SFAS 154 also requires that retrospective application of a change in accounting principle be limited to the direct effects of the change. Indirect effects of a change in accounting principle, such as a change in non discretionary profit sharing payments resulting from an accounting change, should be recognized in the period of the accounting change. SFAS 154 also requires that a change in depreciation, amortization, or depletion method for long lived, non financial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate effected by a change in accounting principle. SFAS 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. Early adoption is permitted for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after the date this Statement is issued. The Company is required to adopt the provisions of SFAS 154, as applicable, beginning in fiscal 2007. The Company does not believe the adoption of SFAS 154 will have a significant effect on its future consolidated financial statements. In March 2005, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, An Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143, which requires an entity to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation when incurred if the liabilitys fair value can be reasonably estimated. The Company adopted the provisions of FIN 47 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. The adoption of this Interpretation did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R, Share based Payments. SFAS 123R revises SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, which the Company adopted as of the beginning of its fiscal 2003, and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. SFAS 123R applies to transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services and also applies to liabilities an entity may incur for goods or services that are based on the fair value of those equity instruments. All employee stock option grants made by the Company since the beginning of fiscal 2003 have been expensed over the related option vesting period based on the fair value at the date the options are granted using the Black Scholes model. Under SFAS 123R, the Company will be required to select a valuation technique or option pricing model that meets the criteria as stated in the standard. Allowable valuation models include a binomial model and the Black Scholes model. The Company is required to adopt the provisions of SFAS 123R in the first quarter of its fiscal 2006. The Company is in the process of assessing the impact on the Companys results of operations from the adoption of SFAS 123R for its effect on prospective option grants. The adoption of SFAS 123R requires the Company to value stock options granted prior to its adoption of SFAS 123 under the fair value 25 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) method and expense these amounts in the income statement over the stock options remaining vesting period. This will result in the Company expensing $13,043 in fiscal 2006, which would previously have been presented in a proforma footnote disclosure. In addition, SFAS 123R will require the Company to reflect the tax savings resulting from tax deductions in excess of expense reflected in its financial statements as a financing cash flow, which will impact the Companys future reported cash flows from operating activities. In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, Inventory Costs An Amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin (ARB) No. 43, Chapter 4. SFAS 151 clarifies that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and spoilage should be expensed as incurred and not included in overhead. Further, SFAS 151 requires that allocation of fixed and production facilities overheads to conversion costs should be based on normal capacity of the production facilities. The provisions in this statement are effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005. The Company does not believe that the adoption of SFAS 151 will have a significant effect on its future consolidated financial statements. In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153, Exchanges of Non monetary Assets An Amendment of APB No. 29. The provisions of this statement are effective for non monetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005. This statement eliminates the exception to fair value for exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchange transactions that do not have commercial substance that is, transactions that are not expected to result in significant changes in the cash flows of the reporting entity. The Company does not believe that the adoption of SFAS 153 will have a significant effect on its future consolidated financial statements. In March 2004, the FASB EITF reached a consensus on EITF Issue No. 03 1, The Meaning of Other Than Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments, (EITF 03 1). The guidance prescribes a three step model for determining whether an investment is other than temporarily impaired and requires disclosures about unrealized losses on investments. The accounting guidance became effective for reporting periods beginning after June 15, 2004, while the disclosure requirements became effective for annual reporting periods ending after June 15, 2004. In September 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) EITF 03 1 1, Effective Date of Paragraphs 10 20 of EITF Issue No. 03 1 The Meaning of Other Than Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments, (FSP EITF 03 1 1). FSP EITF 03 1 1 delayed the effective date for the measurement and recognition guidance contained in paragraphs 10 20 of EITF Issue 03 1. In November 2005, the FASB issued FSP FAS 115 1 and FAS 124 1, The Meaning of Other Than Temporary Impairment and its Application to Certain Investments. This FSP addresses the determination as to when an investment is considered impaired, whether the impairment is other than temporary and the measurement of an impairment loss. This statement specifically nullifies the requirements of paragraph 10 18 of EITF 03 1 and references existing other than temporary impairment guidance. The guidance under this FSP is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2005 and the Company continued to apply relevant other than temporary guidance as provided for in FSP EITF 03 1 1 during fiscal 2005. The Company does not believe that the adoption of the guidance of FSP FAS 115 1 and FAS 124 1 will have a significant effect on its future consolidated financial statements. In November 2003, the EITF reached consensus on Issue No. 03 10, Application of Issue No. 02 16 by Resellers to Sales Incentives Offered to Consumers by Manufacturers, with respect to determining if consideration received by a reseller from a vendor that is reimbursed by the vendor for honoring the vendors sale incentives offered directly to consumers should be recorded as a reduction in sales. These rules apply to transactions entered into by consumers in fiscal periods beginning after November 25, 2003 and, therefore, apply to such transactions starting with the Companys fiscal third quarter of 2004, which began February 16, 2004. The adoption of EITF 03 10 did not affect the Companys consolidated gross profit or net income, but did result in a reduction of both net sales and merchandise costs by an equal amount. Had the first half of fiscal 2004 and all of fiscal 2003 been reported under EITF 03 10 guidance, the sales and cost of sales would have been reduced by approximately $186,900 and $282,300, respectively. 26 Table of Contents Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company is exposed to financial market risk resulting from changes in interest and foreign currency rates. As a policy, the Company does not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions, nor hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. The nature and amount of the Companys long and short term debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As of August 28, 2005, the Companys fixed rate long term debt includes its $415,246 principal amount at maturity Zero Coupon Subordinated Notes carried at $274,071 and additional notes and capital lease obligations totaling $132,141. The Companys debt also includes $300,000 5 1/2% Senior Notes carried at $307,688. The Company has entered into fixed to floating interest rate swaps on the Senior Notes, effectively converting these fixed interest rate securities to variable rate securities. As of August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, the Company had fixed to floating interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $300,000 and $600,000, respectively, and an aggregate fair value of $7,688 and $25,754, respectively. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt and may affect the interest expense related to the variable rate debt. The Company holds interest bearing instruments that are classified as cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. The Companys investment policy is to manage its total cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances to preserve principal and liquidity while maximizing the return on the investment portfolio through the full investment of available funds. The Company diversifies its investment portfolio by investing in multiple types of investment grade securities and through internal management and the use of third party investment managers. Short term investments generally have a maturity of three months to five years from the purchase date. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. As the majority of these instruments are of a short term nature, if interest rates were to increase or decrease immediately, there is no material risk of a valuation adjustment related to these instruments. For those instruments that are classified as available for sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in interest rates are reflected in other accumulated comprehensive income or loss. Based on the Companys cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances at August 28, 2005, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $15,000 to interest income (pre tax) on an annual basis. Most foreign currency transactions have been conducted in local currencies, limiting the Companys exposure to changes in currency rates. The Company periodically enters into short term forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates on inventory purchases. The fair value of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at August 28, 2005 was $42,901. 27 Table of Contents
