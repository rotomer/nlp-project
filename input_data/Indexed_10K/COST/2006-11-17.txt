Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview Our fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to the end of August. Fiscal year 2006, ended September 3, 2006, included 53 weeks, with the 53rd week falling in the fiscal fourth quarter. The fiscal years ended August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2004, each included 52 weeks. Key items for fiscal year 2006 included: Net sales in fiscal 2006 (53 weeks) increased 13.7% over fiscal 2005 (52 weeks), driven by an increase in comparable sales (sales in warehouses open for at least one year) of 8% and the opening of 25 (net of relocations) new warehouses; Membership fees for fiscal 2006 increased 10.7% to $1.2 billion, representing new member sign ups at new warehouses opened during the fiscal year, increased penetration of the Executive Membership program, and continued strong member renewal rates; We increased annual membership fees by $5 for our U.S. and Canada Gold Star (individual), Business, and Business Add on Members, effective May 1, 2006, for new members and July 1, 2006, for existing members; Gross margin (net sales less merchandise costs) as a percentage of net sales declined eleven basis points over the prior year, primarily due to increased penetration of the Executive Membership two percent reward program; Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales improved four basis points over the prior year, largely due to increased expense leverage of warehouse payroll and a lower rate of increase in workers compensation costs, somewhat offset by higher stock based compensation expense; Net income for fiscal 2006 was $1.1 billion, or $2.30 per diluted share, compared to $1.06 billion, or $2.18 per diluted share, in fiscal 2005. The fiscal 2005 results included several non recurring items that in the aggregate positively impacted that years reported earnings by approximately $0.14 per diluted share; The Board of Directors approved an increase in the quarterly cash dividend from $0.115 to $0.13 per share in April 2006; and We repurchased 28.4 million shares of our common stock, expending approximately $1.5 billion at an average cost of $51.44 per share. Results of Operations (dollars in thousands, except per share data) Net Sales Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 Fiscal 2004 Net sales $ 58,963,180 $ 51,879,070 $ 47,148,627 Net sales increase 13.7 % 10.0 % 13.1 % Increase in comparable warehouse sales 8 % 7 % 10 % Warehouse openings (net of relocations) 25 16 20 2006 vs. 2005 Net sales increased 13.7% to $58.96 billion in fiscal 2006, from $51.88 billion in fiscal 2005. The increase was due to comparable warehouse sales growth of 8%, the opening of 25 new warehouses (28 opened, 3 closed due to relocations) during fiscal 2006 and one additional week of sales in fiscal 2006. 16 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Changes in prices of merchandise, with the exception of gasoline, did not materially affect the sales increase. Gasoline sales contributed to the 13.7% increase in net sales by approximately 235 basis points for fiscal 2006, with approximately 70% of this increase related to the change in price. In addition, translation of foreign sales into U.S. dollars contributed to the increase in sales due to stronger foreign currencies, accounting for approximately 87 basis points of the comparable year over year sales increase. 2005 vs. 2004 Net sales increased 10.0% to $51.88 billion in fiscal 2005 from $47.15 billion in fiscal 2004. The increase was due to comparable warehouse sales growth of 7% and to the opening of 16 new warehouses (21 opened, 5 closed due to relocations) during fiscal 2005. Net sales were reduced by the implementation of Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 03 10, Application of Issue No. 02 16, Accounting by a Customer (Including a Reseller) for Certain Consideration Received from a Vendor, by Resellers to Sales Incentives Offered to Consumers by Manufacturers, (EITF 03 10) which was effective at the beginning of our fiscal 2004 third quarter. EITF 03 10, which primarily impacts our vendor coupon programs, reduces net sales and merchandise costs by an equal amount and does not affect our consolidated gross margin or net income. Had EITF 03 10 been in effect for the comparable periods in fiscal 2004, the net sales increase in fiscal 2005 would have been 10.5% and the comparable sales increase for fiscal 2005 would have been 8%. Changes in prices of merchandise, with the exception of gasoline, did not materially affect the sales increase. Gasoline sales contributed to the 10.0% increase in net sales by approximately 155 basis points for fiscal 2005, with approximately 62% of this increase related to the change in price. In addition, translation of foreign sales into U.S. dollars contributed to the increase in sales due to stronger foreign currencies, accounting for approximately 134 basis points of the comparable year over year sales increase. Membership Fees Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 Fiscal 2004 Membership fees $ 1,188,047 $ 1,073,156 $ 961,280 Membership fees increase 10.7 % 11.6 % 12.7 % Membership fees as a percent of net sales 2.02 % 2.07 % 2.04 % Total cardholders 47,679 45,258 42,416 2006 vs. 2005 Membership fees increased 10.7% to $1.19 billion, or 2.02% of net sales, in fiscal 2006 from $1.07 billion, or 2.07% of net sales, in fiscal 2005. This increase was primarily due to additional membership sign ups at the 25 new warehouses opened in fiscal 2006, increased penetration of the Executive Membership program, and high overall member renewal rates consistent with recent years, currently 86.5%. In April 2006, we announced plans to increase annual membership fees by $5 for our U.S. and Canada Gold Star (individual), Business, and Business Add on Members, effective May 1, 2006 for new members and July 1, 2006 for renewals. Approximately 15 million members will be affected by this increase. Membership fees are accounted for on a deferred basis, whereby membership fee revenue is recognized ratably over the one year term of the membership, which will have the effect of spreading the full realization of the increase over the next two fiscal years. 17 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) 2005 vs. 2004 Membership fees increased 11.6% to $1.07 billion, or 2.07% of net sales, in fiscal 2005 from $961 million, or 2.04% of net sales, in fiscal 2004. This increase was primarily due to additional membership sign ups at the 16 new warehouses opened in fiscal 2005, increased penetration of our Executive Membership program and a high overall member renewal rate of 86%. Gross Margin Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 Fiscal 2004 Gross margin $ 6,217,683 $ 5,532,109 $ 5,056,611 Gross margin increase 12.4 % 9.4 % 13.4 % Gross margin as a percent of net sales 10.55 % 10.66 % 10.73 % 2006 vs. 2005 Gross margin was $6.22 billion in fiscal 2006 or 10.55% of net sales, compared to $5.53 billion or 10.66% of net sales in fiscal 2006. This eleven basis point decrease reflected increased penetration of the Executive Membership two percent reward program and increased spending by executive members, which decreased gross margin by ten basis points. Additionally, a decrease of four basis points in gross margin in our merchandise departments and warehouse ancillary businesses was primarily due to changes in the sales mix, with higher sales penetration of lower margin departments and slightly lower overall gross margins in our hardlines and softlines categories. These decreases were partially offset by a three basis point improvement due to the absence of a charge to inventories following the last in, first out (LIFO) method. 2005 vs. 2004 Gross margin increased 9.4% to $5.53 billion, or 10.66% of net sales, in fiscal 2005 from $5.06 billion, or 10.73% of net sales in fiscal 2004. This seven basis point decrease in gross margin as a percentage of net sales reflected a decrease of three basis points in gross margin in our merchandise departments. The three basis point decrease in merchandising is largely due to changes in the sales mix, with higher penetration of lower margin departments. This effect was offset by gross margin gains in most of our merchandise departments, as well as our international operations. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales was positively impacted by five basis points due to the implementation of EITF 03 10, whereby net sales and merchandise costs were reduced equally. The gross margin percentage was reduced by ten basis points due to the increased penetration of the Executive Member two percent reward program, increased spending by Executive members and the resulting increases in the related costs. The gross margin figures reflect accounting for most U.S. merchandise inventories on the LIFO method. Fiscal 2005 included a $13.0 million LIFO charge (increase in merchandise costs), while fiscal 2004 included a $6.0 million LIFO charge. The impact of the LIFO adjustment on a year over year basis negatively impacted gross margin, as a percentage of sales, by one additional basis point. 18 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 Fiscal 2004 Selling, general and administrative expense $ 5,732,141 $ 5,061,339 $ 4,600,792 Selling, general and administrative expense as a percent of net sales 9.72 % 9.76 % 9.76 % 2006 vs. 2005 Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were $5.73 billion, or 9.72% of net sales in fiscal 2006, compared to $5.06 billion, or 9.76% of net sales in fiscal 2005. Improved warehouse and central operating costs positively impacted SG&A by approximately nine basis points, primarily due to increased expense leverage of warehouse payroll, which was positively impacted by strong comparable warehouse sales and a lower rate of increase in workers compensation costs. This improvement was partially offset by an increase in stock based compensation cost of approximately five basis points in fiscal 2006. 2005 vs. 2004 SG&A expenses were $5.06 billion, or 9.76% of net sales, in fiscal 2005 compared to $4.60 billion, or 9.76% of net sales, in fiscal 2004. Had EITF 03 10 been in effect for all of fiscal 2004, SG&A expenses as a percent of net sales would have shown improvement of four basis points as a percent of net sales in fiscal 2005. For fiscal 2005, warehouse and central operating costs positively impacted SG&A comparisons year over year by approximately ten basis points, primarily due to improved payroll utilization at the warehouse level, including increased leverage from increased comparable sales and cost control measures employed in employee benefits, primarily health care. This improvement was offset by the implementation of EITF 03 10, which negatively impacted SG&A as a percentage of net sales by five basis points, and an increase in stock based compensation costs approximating six basis points year over year. Preopening Expenses Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 Fiscal 2004 Preopening expenses $ 42,504 $ 53,230 $ 30,451 Preopening expenses as a percent of net sales 0.07 % 0.10 % 0.07 % Warehouse openings 28 21 20 Relocations (3 ) (5 ) Warehouse openings, net of relocations 25 16 20 2006 vs. 2005 Preopening expenses totaled $42.5 million, or 0.07% of net sales, during fiscal 2006 compared to $53.2 million, or 0.10% of net sales, during fiscal 2005. During fiscal 2005, in response to the February 7, 2005 letter of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) concerning accounting standards related to leases, we adjusted our method of accounting for leases (entered into over the previous twenty years), primarily related to ground leases at certain owned warehouse locations that did not require rental payments during the period of construction. We recorded a cumulative pre tax, non cash charge of $16.0 million to preopening expense in the second quarter of fiscal 2005. Twenty eight warehouses (including three relocations) were opened in fiscal 2006 compared to the opening of 19 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) twenty one warehouses (including five relocations) in fiscal 2005. Preopening expenses also include costs related to remodels and expanded ancillary operations at existing warehouses. 2005 vs. 2004 Preopening expenses totaled $53.2 million, or 0.10% of net sales, during fiscal 2005 compared to $30.5 million, or 0.07% of net sales, during fiscal 2004. As discussed above, fiscal 2005 included a cumulative pre tax, non cash charge of $16.0 million to preopening expense related to an adjustment to the method of accounting for leases. Twenty one warehouses (including five relocations) were opened in fiscal 2005 compared to the opening of 20 warehouses in fiscal 2004. Preopening expenses also include costs related to remodels and expanded ancillary operations at existing warehouses. Provision for Impaired Assets and Closing Costs, net Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 Fiscal 2004 Provision for Impaired Assets and Closing Costs, net: Warehouse closing expenses $ 3,762 $ 11,619 $ 16,548 Impairment of long lived assets 3,893 Net losses (gains) on the sale of real property 1,691 881 (15,548 ) Total $ 5,453 $ 16,393 $ 1,000 Provision for Impaired Assets and Closing Costs, net as a percent of net sales 0.01 % 0.03 % 0.00 % 2006 vs. 2005 The net provision for impaired assets and closing costs was $5.5 million in fiscal 2006, compared to $16.4 million in fiscal 2005. The provision includes costs related to impairment of long lived assets, future lease obligations of warehouses that have been relocated to new facilities, and losses or gains resulting from the sale of real property. The provision for fiscal 2006 included charges of $3.8 million for warehouse closing expenses and $1.7 million for net losses on the sale of real property. The provision for fiscal 2005 included charges of $3.9 million for impairment of long lived assets, $11.6 million for warehouse closing expenses and $0.9 million for net losses on the sale of real property. 2005 vs. 2004 The net provision for impaired assets and closing costs was $16.4 million in fiscal 2005, compared to $1.0 million in fiscal 2004. The provision for fiscal 2005 included charges of $3.9 million for impairment of long lived assets, $11.6 million for warehouse closing expenses and $0.9 million for net losses on the sale of real property. The provision for fiscal 2004 included charges of $16.5 million for warehouse closing expenses that were offset by gains of $15.5 million on the sale of real property. The reserve for warehouse closing costs at the end of fiscal 2006 and 2005 included: September 3,2006 August 28,2005 Reserve for warehouse closing costs: Future lease obligations $ 5,950 $ 9,118 Other 1,091 438 Total $ 7,041 $ 9,556 20 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Interest Expense Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 Fiscal 2004 Interest expense $ 12,570 $ 34,437 $ 36,651 2006 vs. 2005 Interest expense totaled $12.6 million in fiscal 2006, compared to $34.4 million in fiscal 2005. Interest expense in fiscal 2006 primarily included interest on the 5 1/2% Senior Notes, the 3 1/2% Zero Coupon Notes, and balances outstanding under our bank credit facilities and promissory notes. In fiscal 2005, interest expense also included interest on the 7 1/8% Senior Notes. The decrease in interest expense in fiscal 2006 resulted primarily from the repayment of the 7 1/8% Senior Notes in June 2005. In addition, interest expense decreased on the 3 1/2% Zero Coupon Notes as note holders converted approximately $190.9 million in principal amount of the Notes into common stock. The amount of interest capitalized increased in fiscal 2006, contributing to the decrease in interest expense, as both interest rates and the dollar amount of projects under construction increased. The overall decrease in interest expense in fiscal 2006 was partially offset by the increase in interest rates on the 5 1/2% Senior Notes, which were swapped into variable rate debt in March 2002. 2005 vs. 2004 Interest expense totaled $34.4 million in fiscal 2005, compared to $36.7 million in fiscal 2004. Interest expense in both fiscal 2005 and 2004 included interest on the 3 1/2% Zero Coupon Notes, the 7 1/8% and 5 1/2% Senior Notes, and on balances outstanding under our bank credit facilities and promissory notes. The decrease was primarily a result of a decrease in interest on our 3 1/2% Zero Coupon Notes as note holders converted approximately $280.8 million in principle amount of the Notes into common stock during fiscal 2005. Additionally, capitalized interest increased year over year as interest rates and construction costs increased in fiscal 2005 over fiscal 2004. These decreases were partially offset by increases in interest on the Senior Notes as these fixed rate instruments were swapped into variable rate debt in November 2001 and March 2002, which was mitigated by the fact that the 7 1/8% Senior Notes matured and were repaid on June 15, 2005. Interest Income and Other Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 Fiscal 2004 Interest income and other $ 138,355 $ 109,096 $ 51,627 2006 vs. 2005 Interest income and other totaled $138.4 million in fiscal 2006, compared to $109.1 million in fiscal 2005. This increase primarily reflects increased interest income resulting from higher interest rates earned, as well as an extra week in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005. 2005 vs. 2004 Interest income and other totaled $109.1 million in fiscal 2005, compared to $51.6 million in fiscal 2004. The increase primarily reflects increased interest income resulting from higher cash and cash equivalents balances and short term investments on hand throughout fiscal 2005, as well as higher interest rates earned on the balances as compared to fiscal 2004. 21 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Provision for Income Taxes Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 Fiscal 2004 Income tax expense $ 648,202 $ 485,870 $ 518,231 Effective tax rate 37.01 % 31.37 % 37.00 % The effective income tax rate on earnings in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004 was 37.01%, 31.37% and 37.00%, respectively. The low rate in fiscal 2005 was primarily attributable to a non recurring $54.2 million income tax benefit resulting primarily from the settlement of a transfer pricing dispute between the United States and Canada (covering the years 1996 2003) and a net tax benefit on excess foreign tax credits on unremitted foreign earnings of $20.6 million. Excluding these benefits the effective income tax rate on earnings in fiscal 2005 would have been 36.2%. Net Income Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 Fiscal 2004 Net income $ 1,103,215 $ 1,063,092 $ 882,393 Net income increase 3.8 % 20.5 % 22.4 % Net income as a percentage of net sales 1.87 % 2.05 % 1.87 % Diluted earnings per share $ 2.30 $ 2.18 $ 1.85 Shares used to calculate diluted earnings per share 480,341 492,035 482,459 Diluted earnings per share increase 6 % 18 % 21 % 2006 vs. 2005 Net income for fiscal 2006 increased 3.8%, to $1.10 billion or $2.30 per diluted share, from $1.06 billion or $2.18 per diluted share, during fiscal 2005. The fiscal 2005 results included several non recurring items that in the aggregate positively impacted reported earnings for all of fiscal 2005 by approximately $0.14 per share: a $54.2 million (approximately $0.11 per diluted share) income tax benefit resulting primarily from the settlement of a transfer pricing dispute between the United States and Canada; a cumulative pre tax, non cash charge to preopening expenses of $16.0 million (approximately $0.02 per diluted share) related to a correction to our method of accounting for ground leases; and a net tax benefit with respect to excess foreign tax credits on unremitted foreign earnings recorded in the fourth quarter of $20.6 million (approximately $0.04 per diluted share). Exclusive of these items, fiscal 2005 earnings were $2.04 per diluted share. Fiscal 2006s earnings per diluted share represents an increase of 13% over that figure. 2005 vs. 2004 Net Income Net income for fiscal 2005 increased 20.5% to $1.06 billion, or $2.18 per diluted share, from $882.4 million, or $1.85 per diluted share, during fiscal year 2004. As discussed above, the fiscal 2005 results included several non recurring items that in the aggregate positively impacted reported earnings for all of fiscal 2005 by approximately $0.14 per share. Exclusive of these items, fiscal 2005 earnings were $2.04 per diluted share, which represents an increase of 10% over fiscal 2004 earnings per diluted share. 22 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (dollars in thousands, except per share amounts) The following table itemizes components of our most liquid assets: September 3,2006 August 28,2005 Cash and cash equivalents $ 1,510,939 $ 2,062,585 Short term investments 1,322,181 1,397,272 Total $ 2,833,120 $ 3,459,857 Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from warehouse operations and our existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances, which were $2.83 billion and $3.46 billion at September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, respectively. Of these balances, approximately $594 million and $522 million at September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, respectively, represented debit and credit card receivables, primarily related to weekend sales immediately prior to the year end close. The decrease in our most liquid assets of $627 million to $2.83 billion at September 3, 2006 was due primarily to the repurchase of our common stock, the acquisition of property and equipment related to warehouse expansion and the payment of cash dividends. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $1.83 billion in fiscal 2006 compared to $1.78 billion in fiscal 2005, an increase of $51 million. This increase is attributable to higher net income and an increase in cash flow from operating assets and liabilities of $338 million, offset by an increase in net merchandise inventories (merchandise inventory less accounts payable) of $388 million. Net cash used in investing activities totaled $1.15 billion in fiscal 2006 compared to $2.05 billion in fiscal 2005. The decrease relates primarily to a decrease in the net investment in short term investments of $1.16 billion, offset by an increase of $217 million in additions to property and equipment related to warehouse expansion and remodel projects. The decrease in the net investment in short term investments was due primarily to our stock repurchase activity. Net cash used in financing activities totaled $1.23 billion in fiscal 2006 compared to $519 million in fiscal 2005. The increase of $715 million primarily resulted from the repurchase of common stock in fiscal 2006, which used $1.44 billion of cash, compared to $413 million in fiscal 2005. In addition, $304 million was used in fiscal 2005 for the repayment of the 7 1/8% Senior Notes. Dividends In April 2006, our quarterly cash dividend was increased from $0.115 to $0.13 per share. Our cash dividends paid in fiscal 2006 totaled $0.49 per share. In fiscal 2005, we paid quarterly cash dividends totaling $0.43 per share. Our current quarterly dividend rate is $0.13 per share or $0.52 per share on an annualized basis. 23 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Contractual Obligations Our commitments at year end to make future payments under contractual obligations were as follows, as of September 3, 2006: Payments Due by Period Contractual obligations Total Less than 1 year 1 to 3 years 4 to 5 years After 5 years Long term debt(1) $ 523,391 $ 317,959 $ 57,358 $ 60,046 $ 88,028 Capital lease obligations and other(1) 20,928 8,152 4,666 2,034 6,076 Operating leases(2) 1,647,683 130,259 237,373 200,052 1,079,999 Purchase obligations (merchandise)(3) 3,538,948 3,538,096 852 Purchase obligations (building, equipment, services and other)(4) 385,650 350,721 29,563 5,366 Other(5) 11,809 1,703 2,852 2,692 4,562 Total $ 6,128,409 $ 4,346,890 $ 332,664 $ 270,190 $ 1,178,665 (1) Amounts include contractual interest payments. (2) Operating lease obligations have been reduced by $162,120 to reflect sub lease income. (3) Includes open merchandise purchase orders. (4) The amounts exclude minor outsourced services negotiated at the individual warehouse level that are not significant and generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty. (5) Consists of asset retirement and deferred compensation obligations. Expansion Plans Our primary requirement for capital is the domestic and international financing of the land, building and equipment costs for new and remodeled warehouses plus the costs of initial warehouse operations and working capital requirements. While there can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized, and plans are subject to change upon further review, it is managements current intention to spend approximately $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion during fiscal 2007 for real estate, construction, remodeling and equipment for warehouse clubs and related operations. These expenditures are expected to be financed with a combination of cash provided from operations and the use of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. Plans for the United States and Canada during fiscal 2007 are to open approximately 33 to 35 new warehouses on a net basis, inclusive of one to two relocations. We expect to continue our review of expansion plans in our international operations, including the United Kingdom and Asia, along with other international markets. At present, we are planning to open one additional warehouse in the United Kingdom during fiscal 2007. Costco Mexico plans to open one to two new warehouses during fiscal 2007. 24 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Additional Equity Investments in Subsidiaries and Joint Ventures During fiscal 2006 and 2005, we contributed an additional $15 million each year to our investment in Costco Mexico (a 50% owned joint venture), which did not impact our percentage ownership of this entity, as our joint venture partner contributed a like amount. In addition, in fiscal 2005, we acquired the remaining 4% interest in CWC Travel Inc. for $4 million, bringing our ownership in this entity to 100%. Bank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs (all amounts stated in U.S. dollars) A wholly owned Canadian subsidiary has a $181 million commercial paper program ($167 million at August 28, 2005) supported by a $54 million bank credit facility ($50 million at August 28, 2005) with a Canadian bank, which we guarantee and which expires in March 2007. We intend to renew the bank credit facility. At both September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, there were no amounts outstanding under the Canadian commercial paper program or the bank credit facility. Applicable interest rates on the credit facility at September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, were 4.65% and 4.25%, respectively. At September 3, 2006, standby letters of credit totaling $21 million issued under the bank credit facility left $33 million available for commercial paper support. At August 28, 2005, standby letters of credit totaling $23 million issued under the bank credit facility left $27 million available for commercial paper support. Our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary has a short term $13 million bank line of credit ($14 million at August 28, 2005) that expires in February 2007, which we intend to renew. At September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, $2.5 million and $6 million, respectively, were borrowed under the line of credit, and $4 million in both years was used to support standby letters of credit. A second $13 million bank line of credit also expires in February 2007, which we intend to renew. At September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, $0.9 million and $9 million, respectively, were borrowed under the second facility. Applicable interest rates on the credit facilities at September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, were 0.95% and 0.84%, respectively. Our Korean subsidiary has a short term $13 million bank line of credit, which expires in February 2007, and which we intend to renew. At September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, no amounts were borrowed under the line of credit and $2 million in both years was used to support standby letters of credit. Applicable interest rates on the credit facility at September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005 were 5.48% and 4.51%, respectively. Our Taiwan subsidiary has a $5 million bank revolving credit facility that expires in January 2007, which we intend to renew. At September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, no amounts were borrowed under the credit facility and $2 million and $3 million, respectively, were used to support standby letters of credit. A second $15 million bank revolving credit facility is in place, which expires in August 2007. At September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, no amounts were borrowed under the second credit facility and $2 million and $1 million, respectively, were used to support standby letters of credit. Applicable interest rates on the credit facility at September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, were 4.00% and 3.75%, respectively. Our wholly owned United Kingdom subsidiary has a $114 million bank revolving credit facility expiring in February 2007, and a $67 million bank overdraft facility renewable on a yearly basis in March 2007. We intend to renew both facilities. At September 3, 2006, $38 million was outstanding under the revolving credit facility with an applicable interest rate of 5.32% and no amounts were outstanding under the bank overdraft facility. At August 28, 2005, $40 million was outstanding under the revolving credit facility, with an applicable interest rate of 5.30%, and no amounts were outstanding under the bank overdraft facility. 25 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) On November 15, 2005, upon the expiration of our $150 million bank credit facility in the U.S. with a group of nine banks, we terminated our $500 million commercial paper program. At August 28, 2005, no amounts were outstanding under the commercial paper program and no amounts were outstanding under the credit facility. The applicable interest rate on the credit facility at August 28, 2005, was 3.92%. Letters of Credit We have letter of credit facilities (for commercial and standby letters of credit) totaling $400 million. The outstanding commitments under these facilities at September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005 totaled $85 million and $131 million, respectively, including $55 million and $65 million, respectively, in standby letters of credit. Financing Activities In April 2003, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.92% in the aggregate amount of $34 million, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due in April 2010. In March 2002, we issued $300 million of 5 1/2% Senior Notes, carried at $301 million, due in March 2007. Interest is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15. Simultaneous with the issuance of the 5 1/2% Senior Notes, we entered into interest rate swap agreements converting the interest to a floating rate indexed to LIBOR. We plan to repay the 5 1/2% Senior Notes at maturity from our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances. In February 1996, we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a shelf registration statement for $500 million of senior debt securities. In October 2001, additional debt securities of $100 million were registered. The $300 million of 5 1/2% Senior Notes issued in March 2002 reduced the amount of registered securities available for future issuance to $300 million. In April 2006, we cancelled the shelf registration. During fiscal 2006, $191 million in principal amount of our 3 1/2% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes were converted by note holders into 6.5 million shares of common stock. The current Notes outstanding are convertible into a maximum of 2,925,057 shares of Costco common stock at an initial conversion price of $22.71. Derivatives We have limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and use them only to manage well defined interest rate and foreign exchange risks. Forward foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on inventory purchases and typically have very short terms. The aggregate notional amount, which approximates the fair value of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, was $63 million and $42 million, respectively. The majority of the forward foreign exchange contracts were entered into by our wholly owned United Kingdom subsidiary, primarily to hedge U.S. dollar merchandise inventory purchases. We also hold interest rate swaps to manage the interest rate risk associated with our borrowings and the mix of fixed rate and variable rate debt. As of September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, we had fixed to floating interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $300 million and an aggregate fair value of $1 million and $8 million, respectively. These amounts were recorded in deferred income taxes and other current assets as of September 3, 2006 and in other assets as of 26 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) August 28, 2005, in our consolidated balance sheets. These swaps were entered into effective March 25, 2002, and are designated and qualify as fair value hedges of our $300 million 5 1/2% Senior Notes. As the terms of the swaps match those of the underlying hedged debt, the changes in the fair value of these swaps are offset by corresponding changes in the carrying amount of the hedged debt and result in no net earnings impact. We are exposed to market risk for changes in utility commodity pricing, which we partially mitigate through the use of firm price contracts with counterparties for approximately 19% of our locations in the U.S. and Canada. The effects of these arrangements are not significant for any period presented. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements With the exception of our operating leases, we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition or consolidated financial statements. Stock Repurchase Programs Our Board of Directors has approved the following stock repurchase programs (000s): AmountApproved AmountRemaining August 2005 $ 1,000,000 $ 0 January 2006(1) 1,000,000 625,534 July 2006(2) 2,000,000 2,000,000 Total $ 4,000,000 $ 2,625,534 (1) Expires in January 2009. (2) Expires in July 2009. During fiscal 2005, we repurchased 9.2 million shares of common stock, at an average price of $44.89, totaling approximately $413 million. During fiscal 2006, we repurchased 28.4 million shares at an average price of $51.44, totaling approximately $1.46 billion. The amount available to be purchased under the approved plans was approximately $2.63 billion at September 3, 2006. Purchases are made from time to time as conditions warrant in the open market or in block purchases, or pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5 1. Repurchased shares are retired. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our financial statements requires that management make estimates and judgments that affect the financial position and results of operations. Management continues to review its accounting policies and evaluate its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, merchandise inventory valuation, impairment of long lived assets, warehouse closing costs, insurance/self insurance liabilities, stock based compensation and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Revenue Recognition We recognize sales, net of estimated returns, at the time customers take possession of merchandise or receive services. When we collect payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of 27 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) merchandise or the performance of services, the amount received is recorded as deferred revenue on the balance sheet until the sale or service is completed. We provide for estimated sales returns based on historical returns levels. We evaluate the criteria of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal Versus Net as an Agent, in determining whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, when we are the primary obligor, subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, influence product or service specifications, or have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded on a gross basis. If we are not the primary obligor and do not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above, we record the net amounts as commissions earned, which is reflected in net sales. Membership fee revenue represents annual membership fees paid by substantially all of our members. We account for membership fee revenue on a deferred basis, whereby membership fee revenue is recognized ratably over one year. Our Executive members qualify for a 2% reward (which can be redeemed only at Costco warehouses), up to a maximum of $500 per year, on all qualified purchases made at Costco. We account for this 2% reward as a reduction in sales, with the related liability being classified within other current liabilities. Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, as determined primarily by the retail method of accounting, and are stated using the last in, first out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail method of accounting and are stated using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. We believe the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. We record an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the expected annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end. At both September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005 merchandise inventories valued at LIFO approximated FIFO after considering the lower of cost or market principle. We provide for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts as a percentage of net sales. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect the actual physical inventory count results, which generally occur in the second and fourth fiscal quarters of the fiscal year. Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as we progress toward earning those rebates, provided they are probable and reasonably estimable. Other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of agreement, or other systematic and rational approach. Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Warehouse Closing costs We periodically evaluate our long lived assets for indicators of impairment. Our judgments are based on existing market and operational conditions. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring an adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value. We provide estimates for warehouse closing costs based on applicable U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Future circumstances may result in actual closing costs or the amount recognized upon the sale of the property to differ substantially from the original estimates. 28 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Insurance/Self Insurance Liabilities We use a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance pool, to provide for potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property damage, director and officers liability, vehicle liability and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience and evaluations of outside expertise, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. StockBased Compensation We account for stockbased compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123R. We use the BlackScholes optionpricing model, which requires the input of subjective assumptions. These assumptions include: estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them (expected term); the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term (volatility), and the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements (forfeitures). Changes in these assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stockbased compensation. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, we ceased the granting of stock options in favor of restricted stock units. Income Taxes The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Significant judgment is required in assessing, among other things, the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items. We establish reserves when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable, we believe that certain positions may be successfully challenged. When facts and circumstances change, we adjust these reserves through our provision for income taxes. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in the Current Year Financial Statements (SAB 108). SAB 108 addresses how the effects of prior year uncorrected misstatements should be considered when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements. SAB 108 requires an entity to quantify misstatements using a balance sheet and income statement approach and to evaluate whether either approach results in quantifying an error that is material in light of relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. We early adopted SAB 108 as of August 29, 2005, the beginning of our fiscal year. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report for further discussion. In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157). SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements required under other accounting pronouncements but does not change existing guidance as to whether or not an instrument is carried at fair value. SFAS 157 is effective for our fiscal year 2008. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting SFAS 157. 29 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. FIN 48 is effective beginning in fiscal 2008. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting FIN 48. In June 2006, the FASB ratified the consensus reached on Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 06 03, How Sales Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities Should Be Presented in the Income Statement (that is, Gross Versus Net Presentation). The EITF reached a consensus that the presentation of taxes on either a gross or net basis is an accounting policy decision that requires disclosure. EITF 06 03 is effective for the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after December 15, 2006. Amounts collected from our members, which under common trade practices are referred to as sales taxes, are and have been recorded on a net basis. We have no intention of modifying this accounting policy. Therefore, the adoption of EITF 06 03 will not have any effect on our financial position or results of operations. In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, a Replacement of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 20, and FASB Statement No. 3. SFAS 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements for changes in accounting principles, unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change. SFAS 154 also requires that retrospective application of a change in accounting principle be limited to the direct effects of the change. Indirect effects of a change in accounting principle, such as a change in non discretionary profit sharing payments resulting from an accounting change, should be recognized in the period of the accounting change. SFAS 154 also requires that a change in depreciation, amortization, or depletion method for long lived, non financial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate effected by a change in accounting principle. SFAS 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. We will adopt the provisions of SFAS 154 beginning in fiscal 2007. We do not believe the adoption will have a significant effect on our future consolidated financial statements. 30 Table of Contents Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to financial market risk resulting from changes in interest and foreign currency rates. As a policy, we do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions, nor hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. The nature and amount of our long and short term debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As of September 3, 2006, our fixed rate long term debt included $129 million principal amount at maturity Zero Coupon Subordinated Notes carried at $88 million and additional notes and capital lease obligations totaling $135 million. Our debt also includes $300 million 51/2% Senior Notes carried at $301 million. We entered into fixed to floating interest rate swaps on the Senior Notes, effectively converting these fixed interest rate securities to variable rate securities. As of September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, we had fixed to floating interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $300 million and an aggregate fair value of $1 million and $8 million, respectively. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt and may affect the interest expense related to the variable rate debt. We hold interest bearing instruments that are classified as cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. Our investment policy is to manage our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances to preserve principal and liquidity, while seeking to maximize the return on our investment portfolio through the full investment of available funds. We diversify our investment portfolio by investing in multiple types of investment grade securities and through a combination of internal and third party investment management. Short term investments generally have a maturity of three months to five years from the purchase date. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. As the majority of these instruments are of a short term nature, if interest rates were to increase or decrease, there is no material risk of a valuation adjustment related to these instruments. For those instruments that are classified as available for sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in interest rates are reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss. Based on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances at September 3, 2006, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $9 million to interest income (pre tax) on an annual basis. Most transactions of our foreign subsidiaries are conducted in local currencies, limiting our exposure to changes in currency rates. We periodically enter into short term forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates on inventory purchases. The notional value of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at September 3, 2006 was $62 million. 31 Table of Contents 
 
Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Changes in prices of merchandise, with the exception of gasoline, did not materially affect the sales increase. Gasoline sales contributed to the 13.7% increase in net sales by approximately 235 basis points for fiscal 2006, with approximately 70% of this increase related to the change in price. In addition, translation of foreign sales into U.S. dollars contributed to the increase in sales due to stronger foreign currencies, accounting for approximately 87 basis points of the comparable year over year sales increase. 2005 vs. 2004 Net sales increased 10.0% to $51.88 billion in fiscal 2005 from $47.15 billion in fiscal 2004. The increase was due to comparable warehouse sales growth of 7% and to the opening of 16 new warehouses (21 opened, 5 closed due to relocations) during fiscal 2005. Net sales were reduced by the implementation of Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 03 10, Application of Issue No. 02 16, Accounting by a Customer (Including a Reseller) for Certain Consideration Received from a Vendor, by Resellers to Sales Incentives Offered to Consumers by Manufacturers, (EITF 03 10) which was effective at the beginning of our fiscal 2004 third quarter. EITF 03 10, which primarily impacts our vendor coupon programs, reduces net sales and merchandise costs by an equal amount and does not affect our consolidated gross margin or net income. Had EITF 03 10 been in effect for the comparable periods in fiscal 2004, the net sales increase in fiscal 2005 would have been 10.5% and the comparable sales increase for fiscal 2005 would have been 8%. Changes in prices of merchandise, with the exception of gasoline, did not materially affect the sales increase. Gasoline sales contributed to the 10.0% increase in net sales by approximately 155 basis points for fiscal 2005, with approximately 62% of this increase related to the change in price. In addition, translation of foreign sales into U.S. dollars contributed to the increase in sales due to stronger foreign currencies, accounting for approximately 134 basis points of the comparable year over year sales increase. Membership Fees Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 Fiscal 2004 Membership fees $ 1,188,047 $ 1,073,156 $ 961,280 Membership fees increase 10.7 % 11.6 % 12.7 % Membership fees as a percent of net sales 2.02 % 2.07 % 2.04 % Total cardholders 47,679 45,258 42,416 2006 vs. 2005 Membership fees increased 10.7% to $1.19 billion, or 2.02% of net sales, in fiscal 2006 from $1.07 billion, or 2.07% of net sales, in fiscal 2005. This increase was primarily due to additional membership sign ups at the 25 new warehouses opened in fiscal 2006, increased penetration of the Executive Membership program, and high overall member renewal rates consistent with recent years, currently 86.5%. In April 2006, we announced plans to increase annual membership fees by $5 for our U.S. and Canada Gold Star (individual), Business, and Business Add on Members, effective May 1, 2006 for new members and July 1, 2006 for renewals. Approximately 15 million members will be affected by this increase. Membership fees are accounted for on a deferred basis, whereby membership fee revenue is recognized ratably over the one year term of the membership, which will have the effect of spreading the full realization of the increase over the next two fiscal years. 17 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) 2005 vs. 2004 Membership fees increased 11.6% to $1.07 billion, or 2.07% of net sales, in fiscal 2005 from $961 million, or 2.04% of net sales, in fiscal 2004. This increase was primarily due to additional membership sign ups at the 16 new warehouses opened in fiscal 2005, increased penetration of our Executive Membership program and a high overall member renewal rate of 86%. Gross Margin Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 Fiscal 2004 Gross margin $ 6,217,683 $ 5,532,109 $ 5,056,611 Gross margin increase 12.4 % 9.4 % 13.4 % Gross margin as a percent of net sales 10.55 % 10.66 % 10.73 % 2006 vs. 2005 Gross margin was $6.22 billion in fiscal 2006 or 10.55% of net sales, compared to $5.53 billion or 10.66% of net sales in fiscal 2006. This eleven basis point decrease reflected increased penetration of the Executive Membership two percent reward program and increased spending by executive members, which decreased gross margin by ten basis points. Additionally, a decrease of four basis points in gross margin in our merchandise departments and warehouse ancillary businesses was primarily due to changes in the sales mix, with higher sales penetration of lower margin departments and slightly lower overall gross margins in our hardlines and softlines categories. These decreases were partially offset by a three basis point improvement due to the absence of a charge to inventories following the last in, first out (LIFO) method. 2005 vs. 2004 Gross margin increased 9.4% to $5.53 billion, or 10.66% of net sales, in fiscal 2005 from $5.06 billion, or 10.73% of net sales in fiscal 2004. This seven basis point decrease in gross margin as a percentage of net sales reflected a decrease of three basis points in gross margin in our merchandise departments. The three basis point decrease in merchandising is largely due to changes in the sales mix, with higher penetration of lower margin departments. This effect was offset by gross margin gains in most of our merchandise departments, as well as our international operations. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales was positively impacted by five basis points due to the implementation of EITF 03 10, whereby net sales and merchandise costs were reduced equally. The gross margin percentage was reduced by ten basis points due to the increased penetration of the Executive Member two percent reward program, increased spending by Executive members and the resulting increases in the related costs. The gross margin figures reflect accounting for most U.S. merchandise inventories on the LIFO method. Fiscal 2005 included a $13.0 million LIFO charge (increase in merchandise costs), while fiscal 2004 included a $6.0 million LIFO charge. The impact of the LIFO adjustment on a year over year basis negatively impacted gross margin, as a percentage of sales, by one additional basis point. 18 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 Fiscal 2004 Selling, general and administrative expense $ 5,732,141 $ 5,061,339 $ 4,600,792 Selling, general and administrative expense as a percent of net sales 9.72 % 9.76 % 9.76 % 2006 vs. 2005 Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were $5.73 billion, or 9.72% of net sales in fiscal 2006, compared to $5.06 billion, or 9.76% of net sales in fiscal 2005. Improved warehouse and central operating costs positively impacted SG&A by approximately nine basis points, primarily due to increased expense leverage of warehouse payroll, which was positively impacted by strong comparable warehouse sales and a lower rate of increase in workers compensation costs. This improvement was partially offset by an increase in stock based compensation cost of approximately five basis points in fiscal 2006. 2005 vs. 2004 SG&A expenses were $5.06 billion, or 9.76% of net sales, in fiscal 2005 compared to $4.60 billion, or 9.76% of net sales, in fiscal 2004. Had EITF 03 10 been in effect for all of fiscal 2004, SG&A expenses as a percent of net sales would have shown improvement of four basis points as a percent of net sales in fiscal 2005. For fiscal 2005, warehouse and central operating costs positively impacted SG&A comparisons year over year by approximately ten basis points, primarily due to improved payroll utilization at the warehouse level, including increased leverage from increased comparable sales and cost control measures employed in employee benefits, primarily health care. This improvement was offset by the implementation of EITF 03 10, which negatively impacted SG&A as a percentage of net sales by five basis points, and an increase in stock based compensation costs approximating six basis points year over year. Preopening Expenses Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 Fiscal 2004 Preopening expenses $ 42,504 $ 53,230 $ 30,451 Preopening expenses as a percent of net sales 0.07 % 0.10 % 0.07 % Warehouse openings 28 21 20 Relocations (3 ) (5 ) Warehouse openings, net of relocations 25 16 20 2006 vs. 2005 Preopening expenses totaled $42.5 million, or 0.07% of net sales, during fiscal 2006 compared to $53.2 million, or 0.10% of net sales, during fiscal 2005. During fiscal 2005, in response to the February 7, 2005 letter of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) concerning accounting standards related to leases, we adjusted our method of accounting for leases (entered into over the previous twenty years), primarily related to ground leases at certain owned warehouse locations that did not require rental payments during the period of construction. We recorded a cumulative pre tax, non cash charge of $16.0 million to preopening expense in the second quarter of fiscal 2005. Twenty eight warehouses (including three relocations) were opened in fiscal 2006 compared to the opening of 19 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) twenty one warehouses (including five relocations) in fiscal 2005. Preopening expenses also include costs related to remodels and expanded ancillary operations at existing warehouses. 2005 vs. 2004 Preopening expenses totaled $53.2 million, or 0.10% of net sales, during fiscal 2005 compared to $30.5 million, or 0.07% of net sales, during fiscal 2004. As discussed above, fiscal 2005 included a cumulative pre tax, non cash charge of $16.0 million to preopening expense related to an adjustment to the method of accounting for leases. Twenty one warehouses (including five relocations) were opened in fiscal 2005 compared to the opening of 20 warehouses in fiscal 2004. Preopening expenses also include costs related to remodels and expanded ancillary operations at existing warehouses.

The provision includes costs related to impairment of long lived assets, future lease obligations of warehouses that have been relocated to new facilities, and losses or gains resulting from the sale of real property. The provision for fiscal 2006 included charges of $3.8 million for warehouse closing expenses and $1.7 million for net losses on the sale of real property. The provision for fiscal 2005 included charges of $3.9 million for impairment of long lived assets, $11.6 million for warehouse closing expenses and $0.9 million for net losses on the sale of real property. 2005 vs. 2004 The net provision for impaired assets and closing costs was $16.4 million in fiscal 2005, compared to $1.0 million in fiscal 2004. The provision for fiscal 2005 included charges of $3.9 million for impairment of long lived assets, $11.6 million for warehouse closing expenses and $0.9 million for net losses on the sale of real property. The provision for fiscal 2004 included charges of $16.5 million for warehouse closing expenses that were offset by gains of $15.5 million on the sale of real property. The reserve for warehouse closing costs at the end of fiscal 2006 and 2005 included: September 3,2006 August 28,2005 Reserve for warehouse closing costs: Future lease obligations $ 5,950 $ 9,118 Other 1,091 438 Total $ 7,041 $ 9,556 20 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Interest Expense Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 Fiscal 2004 Interest expense $ 12,570 $ 34,437 $ 36,651 2006 vs. 2005 Interest expense totaled $12.6 million in fiscal 2006, compared to $34.4 million in fiscal 2005. Interest expense in fiscal 2006 primarily included interest on the 5 1/2% Senior Notes, the 3 1/2% Zero Coupon Notes, and balances outstanding under our bank credit facilities and promissory notes. In fiscal 2005, interest expense also included interest on the 7 1/8% Senior Notes. The decrease in interest expense in fiscal 2006 resulted primarily from the repayment of the 7 1/8% Senior Notes in June 2005. In addition, interest expense decreased on the 3 1/2% Zero Coupon Notes as note holders converted approximately $190.9 million in principal amount of the Notes into common stock. The amount of interest capitalized increased in fiscal 2006, contributing to the decrease in interest expense, as both interest rates and the dollar amount of projects under construction increased. The overall decrease in interest expense in fiscal 2006 was partially offset by the increase in interest rates on the 5 1/2% Senior Notes, which were swapped into variable rate debt in March 2002. 2005 vs. 2004 Interest expense totaled $34.4 million in fiscal 2005, compared to $36.7 million in fiscal 2004. Interest expense in both fiscal 2005 and 2004 included interest on the 3 1/2% Zero Coupon Notes, the 7 1/8% and 5 1/2% Senior Notes, and on balances outstanding under our bank credit facilities and promissory notes. The decrease was primarily a result of a decrease in interest on our 3 1/2% Zero Coupon Notes as note holders converted approximately $280.8 million in principle amount of the Notes into common stock during fiscal 2005. Additionally, capitalized interest increased year over year as interest rates and construction costs increased in fiscal 2005 over fiscal 2004. These decreases were partially offset by increases in interest on the Senior Notes as these fixed rate instruments were swapped into variable rate debt in November 2001 and March 2002, which was mitigated by the fact that the 7 1/8% Senior Notes matured and were repaid on June 15, 2005. Interest Income and Other Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 Fiscal 2004 Interest income and other $ 138,355 $ 109,096 $ 51,627 2006 vs. 2005 Interest income and other totaled $138.4 million in fiscal 2006, compared to $109.1 million in fiscal 2005. This increase primarily reflects increased interest income resulting from higher interest rates earned, as well as an extra week in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005. 2005 vs. 2004 Interest income and other totaled $109.1 million in fiscal 2005, compared to $51.6 million in fiscal 2004. The increase primarily reflects increased interest income resulting from higher cash and cash equivalents balances and short term investments on hand throughout fiscal 2005, as well as higher interest rates earned on the balances as compared to fiscal 2004. 21 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Provision for Income Taxes Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 Fiscal 2004 Income tax expense $ 648,202 $ 485,870 $ 518,231 Effective tax rate 37.01 % 31.37 % 37.00 % The effective income tax rate on earnings in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004 was 37.01%, 31.37% and 37.00%, respectively. The low rate in fiscal 2005 was primarily attributable to a non recurring $54.2 million income tax benefit resulting primarily from the settlement of a transfer pricing dispute between the United States and Canada (covering the years 1996 2003) and a net tax benefit on excess foreign tax credits on unremitted foreign earnings of $20.6 million. Excluding these benefits the effective income tax rate on earnings in fiscal 2005 would have been 36.2%. Net Income Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 Fiscal 2004 Net income $ 1,103,215 $ 1,063,092 $ 882,393 Net income increase 3.8 % 20.5 % 22.4 % Net income as a percentage of net sales 1.87 % 2.05 % 1.87 % Diluted earnings per share $ 2.30 $ 2.18 $ 1.85 Shares used to calculate diluted earnings per share 480,341 492,035 482,459 Diluted earnings per share increase 6 % 18 % 21 % 2006 vs. 2005 Net income for fiscal 2006 increased 3.8%, to $1.10 billion or $2.30 per diluted share, from $1.06 billion or $2.18 per diluted share, during fiscal 2005. The fiscal 2005 results included several non recurring items that in the aggregate positively impacted reported earnings for all of fiscal 2005 by approximately $0.14 per share: a $54.2 million (approximately $0.11 per diluted share) income tax benefit resulting primarily from the settlement of a transfer pricing dispute between the United States and Canada; a cumulative pre tax, non cash charge to preopening expenses of $16.0 million (approximately $0.02 per diluted share) related to a correction to our method of accounting for ground leases; and a net tax benefit with respect to excess foreign tax credits on unremitted foreign earnings recorded in the fourth quarter of $20.6 million (approximately $0.04 per diluted share). Exclusive of these items, fiscal 2005 earnings were $2.04 per diluted share. Fiscal 2006s earnings per diluted share represents an increase of 13% over that figure. 2005 vs. 2004 Net Income Net income for fiscal 2005 increased 20.5% to $1.06 billion, or $2.18 per diluted share, from $882.4 million, or $1.85 per diluted share, during fiscal year 2004. As discussed above, the fiscal 2005 results included several non recurring items that in the aggregate positively impacted reported earnings for all of fiscal 2005 by approximately $0.14 per share. Exclusive of these items, fiscal 2005 earnings were $2.04 per diluted share, which represents an increase of 10% over fiscal 2004 earnings per diluted share. 22 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (dollars in thousands, except per share amounts) The following table itemizes components of our most liquid assets: September 3,2006 August 28,2005 Cash and cash equivalents $ 1,510,939 $ 2,062,585 Short term investments 1,322,181 1,397,272 Total $ 2,833,120 $ 3,459,857 Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from warehouse operations and our existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances, which were $2.83 billion and $3.46 billion at September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, respectively. Of these balances, approximately $594 million and $522 million at September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, respectively, represented debit and credit card receivables, primarily related to weekend sales immediately prior to the year end close. The decrease in our most liquid assets of $627 million to $2.83 billion at September 3, 2006 was due primarily to the repurchase of our common stock, the acquisition of property and equipment related to warehouse expansion and the payment of cash dividends. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $1.83 billion in fiscal 2006 compared to $1.78 billion in fiscal 2005, an increase of $51 million. This increase is attributable to higher net income and an increase in cash flow from operating assets and liabilities of $338 million, offset by an increase in net merchandise inventories (merchandise inventory less accounts payable) of $388 million. Net cash used in investing activities totaled $1.15 billion in fiscal 2006 compared to $2.05 billion in fiscal 2005. The decrease relates primarily to a decrease in the net investment in short term investments of $1.16 billion, offset by an increase of $217 million in additions to property and equipment related to warehouse expansion and remodel projects. The decrease in the net investment in short term investments was due primarily to our stock repurchase activity. Net cash used in financing activities totaled $1.23 billion in fiscal 2006 compared to $519 million in fiscal 2005. The increase of $715 million primarily resulted from the repurchase of common stock in fiscal 2006, which used $1.44 billion of cash, compared to $413 million in fiscal 2005. In addition, $304 million was used in fiscal 2005 for the repayment of the 7 1/8% Senior Notes. Dividends In April 2006, our quarterly cash dividend was increased from $0.115 to $0.13 per share. Our cash dividends paid in fiscal 2006 totaled $0.49 per share. In fiscal 2005, we paid quarterly cash dividends totaling $0.43 per share. Our current quarterly dividend rate is $0.13 per share or $0.52 per share on an annualized basis. 23 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Contractual Obligations Our commitments at year end to make future payments under contractual obligations were as follows, as of September 3, 2006: Payments Due by Period Contractual obligations Total Less than 1 year 1 to 3 years 4 to 5 years After 5 years Long term debt(1) $ 523,391 $ 317,959 $ 57,358 $ 60,046 $ 88,028 Capital lease obligations and other(1) 20,928 8,152 4,666 2,034 6,076 Operating leases(2) 1,647,683 130,259 237,373 200,052 1,079,999 Purchase obligations (merchandise)(3) 3,538,948 3,538,096 852 Purchase obligations (building, equipment, services and other)(4) 385,650 350,721 29,563 5,366 Other(5) 11,809 1,703 2,852 2,692 4,562 Total $ 6,128,409 $ 4,346,890 $ 332,664 $ 270,190 $ 1,178,665 (1) Amounts include contractual interest payments. (2) Operating lease obligations have been reduced by $162,120 to reflect sub lease income. (3) Includes open merchandise purchase orders. (4) The amounts exclude minor outsourced services negotiated at the individual warehouse level that are not significant and generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty. (5) Consists of asset retirement and deferred compensation obligations. Expansion Plans Our primary requirement for capital is the domestic and international financing of the land, building and equipment costs for new and remodeled warehouses plus the costs of initial warehouse operations and working capital requirements. While there can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized, and plans are subject to change upon further review, it is managements current intention to spend approximately $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion during fiscal 2007 for real estate, construction, remodeling and equipment for warehouse clubs and related operations. These expenditures are expected to be financed with a combination of cash provided from operations and the use of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. Plans for the United States and Canada during fiscal 2007 are to open approximately 33 to 35 new warehouses on a net basis, inclusive of one to two relocations. We expect to continue our review of expansion plans in our international operations, including the United Kingdom and Asia, along with other international markets. At present, we are planning to open one additional warehouse in the United Kingdom during fiscal 2007. Costco Mexico plans to open one to two new warehouses during fiscal 2007. 24 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Additional Equity Investments in Subsidiaries and Joint Ventures During fiscal 2006 and 2005, we contributed an additional $15 million each year to our investment in Costco Mexico (a 50% owned joint venture), which did not impact our percentage ownership of this entity, as our joint venture partner contributed a like amount. In addition, in fiscal 2005, we acquired the remaining 4% interest in CWC Travel Inc. for $4 million, bringing our ownership in this entity to 100%. Bank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs (all amounts stated in U.S. dollars) A wholly owned Canadian subsidiary has a $181 million commercial paper program ($167 million at August 28, 2005) supported by a $54 million bank credit facility ($50 million at August 28, 2005) with a Canadian bank, which we guarantee and which expires in March 2007. We intend to renew the bank credit facility. At both September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, there were no amounts outstanding under the Canadian commercial paper program or the bank credit facility. Applicable interest rates on the credit facility at September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, were 4.65% and 4.25%, respectively. At September 3, 2006, standby letters of credit totaling $21 million issued under the bank credit facility left $33 million available for commercial paper support. At August 28, 2005, standby letters of credit totaling $23 million issued under the bank credit facility left $27 million available for commercial paper support. Our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary has a short term $13 million bank line of credit ($14 million at August 28, 2005) that expires in February 2007, which we intend to renew. At September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, $2.5 million and $6 million, respectively, were borrowed under the line of credit, and $4 million in both years was used to support standby letters of credit. A second $13 million bank line of credit also expires in February 2007, which we intend to renew. At September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, $0.9 million and $9 million, respectively, were borrowed under the second facility. Applicable interest rates on the credit facilities at September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, were 0.95% and 0.84%, respectively. Our Korean subsidiary has a short term $13 million bank line of credit, which expires in February 2007, and which we intend to renew. At September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, no amounts were borrowed under the line of credit and $2 million in both years was used to support standby letters of credit. Applicable interest rates on the credit facility at September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005 were 5.48% and 4.51%, respectively. Our Taiwan subsidiary has a $5 million bank revolving credit facility that expires in January 2007, which we intend to renew. At September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, no amounts were borrowed under the credit facility and $2 million and $3 million, respectively, were used to support standby letters of credit. A second $15 million bank revolving credit facility is in place, which expires in August 2007. At September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, no amounts were borrowed under the second credit facility and $2 million and $1 million, respectively, were used to support standby letters of credit. Applicable interest rates on the credit facility at September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, were 4.00% and 3.75%, respectively. Our wholly owned United Kingdom subsidiary has a $114 million bank revolving credit facility expiring in February 2007, and a $67 million bank overdraft facility renewable on a yearly basis in March 2007. We intend to renew both facilities. At September 3, 2006, $38 million was outstanding under the revolving credit facility with an applicable interest rate of 5.32% and no amounts were outstanding under the bank overdraft facility. At August 28, 2005, $40 million was outstanding under the revolving credit facility, with an applicable interest rate of 5.30%, and no amounts were outstanding under the bank overdraft facility. 25 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) On November 15, 2005, upon the expiration of our $150 million bank credit facility in the U.S. with a group of nine banks, we terminated our $500 million commercial paper program. At August 28, 2005, no amounts were outstanding under the commercial paper program and no amounts were outstanding under the credit facility. The applicable interest rate on the credit facility at August 28, 2005, was 3.92%. Letters of Credit We have letter of credit facilities (for commercial and standby letters of credit) totaling $400 million. The outstanding commitments under these facilities at September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005 totaled $85 million and $131 million, respectively, including $55 million and $65 million, respectively, in standby letters of credit. Financing Activities In April 2003, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.92% in the aggregate amount of $34 million, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due in April 2010. In March 2002, we issued $300 million of 5 1/2% Senior Notes, carried at $301 million, due in March 2007. Interest is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15. Simultaneous with the issuance of the 5 1/2% Senior Notes, we entered into interest rate swap agreements converting the interest to a floating rate indexed to LIBOR. We plan to repay the 5 1/2% Senior Notes at maturity from our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances. In February 1996, we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a shelf registration statement for $500 million of senior debt securities. In October 2001, additional debt securities of $100 million were registered. The $300 million of 5 1/2% Senior Notes issued in March 2002 reduced the amount of registered securities available for future issuance to $300 million. In April 2006, we cancelled the shelf registration. During fiscal 2006, $191 million in principal amount of our 3 1/2% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes were converted by note holders into 6.5 million shares of common stock. The current Notes outstanding are convertible into a maximum of 2,925,057 shares of Costco common stock at an initial conversion price of $22.71. Derivatives We have limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and use them only to manage well defined interest rate and foreign exchange risks. Forward foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on inventory purchases and typically have very short terms. The aggregate notional amount, which approximates the fair value of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, was $63 million and $42 million, respectively. The majority of the forward foreign exchange contracts were entered into by our wholly owned United Kingdom subsidiary, primarily to hedge U.S. dollar merchandise inventory purchases. We also hold interest rate swaps to manage the interest rate risk associated with our borrowings and the mix of fixed rate and variable rate debt. As of September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, we had fixed to floating interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $300 million and an aggregate fair value of $1 million and $8 million, respectively. These amounts were recorded in deferred income taxes and other current assets as of September 3, 2006 and in other assets as of 26 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) August 28, 2005, in our consolidated balance sheets. These swaps were entered into effective March 25, 2002, and are designated and qualify as fair value hedges of our $300 million 5 1/2% Senior Notes. As the terms of the swaps match those of the underlying hedged debt, the changes in the fair value of these swaps are offset by corresponding changes in the carrying amount of the hedged debt and result in no net earnings impact. We are exposed to market risk for changes in utility commodity pricing, which we partially mitigate through the use of firm price contracts with counterparties for approximately 19% of our locations in the U.S. and Canada. The effects of these arrangements are not significant for any period presented. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements With the exception of our operating leases, we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition or consolidated financial statements. Stock Repurchase Programs Our Board of Directors has approved the following stock repurchase programs (000s): AmountApproved AmountRemaining August 2005 $ 1,000,000 $ 0 January 2006(1) 1,000,000 625,534 July 2006(2) 2,000,000 2,000,000 Total $ 4,000,000 $ 2,625,534 (1) Expires in January 2009. (2) Expires in July 2009. During fiscal 2005, we repurchased 9.2 million shares of common stock, at an average price of $44.89, totaling approximately $413 million. During fiscal 2006, we repurchased 28.4 million shares at an average price of $51.44, totaling approximately $1.46 billion. The amount available to be purchased under the approved plans was approximately $2.63 billion at September 3, 2006. Purchases are made from time to time as conditions warrant in the open market or in block purchases, or pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5 1. Repurchased shares are retired. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our financial statements requires that management make estimates and judgments that affect the financial position and results of operations. Management continues to review its accounting policies and evaluate its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, merchandise inventory valuation, impairment of long lived assets, warehouse closing costs, insurance/self insurance liabilities, stock based compensation and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Revenue Recognition We recognize sales, net of estimated returns, at the time customers take possession of merchandise or receive services. When we collect payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of 27 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) merchandise or the performance of services, the amount received is recorded as deferred revenue on the balance sheet until the sale or service is completed. We provide for estimated sales returns based on historical returns levels. We evaluate the criteria of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal Versus Net as an Agent, in determining whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, when we are the primary obligor, subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, influence product or service specifications, or have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded on a gross basis. If we are not the primary obligor and do not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above, we record the net amounts as commissions earned, which is reflected in net sales. Membership fee revenue represents annual membership fees paid by substantially all of our members. We account for membership fee revenue on a deferred basis, whereby membership fee revenue is recognized ratably over one year. Our Executive members qualify for a 2% reward (which can be redeemed only at Costco warehouses), up to a maximum of $500 per year, on all qualified purchases made at Costco. We account for this 2% reward as a reduction in sales, with the related liability being classified within other current liabilities. Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, as determined primarily by the retail method of accounting, and are stated using the last in, first out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail method of accounting and are stated using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. We believe the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. We record an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the expected annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end. At both September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005 merchandise inventories valued at LIFO approximated FIFO after considering the lower of cost or market principle. We provide for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts as a percentage of net sales. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect the actual physical inventory count results, which generally occur in the second and fourth fiscal quarters of the fiscal year. Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as we progress toward earning those rebates, provided they are probable and reasonably estimable. Other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of agreement, or other systematic and rational approach. Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Warehouse Closing costs We periodically evaluate our long lived assets for indicators of impairment. Our judgments are based on existing market and operational conditions. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring an adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value. We provide estimates for warehouse closing costs based on applicable U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Future circumstances may result in actual closing costs or the amount recognized upon the sale of the property to differ substantially from the original estimates. 28 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Insurance/Self Insurance Liabilities We use a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance pool, to provide for potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property damage, director and officers liability, vehicle liability and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience and evaluations of outside expertise, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. StockBased Compensation We account for stockbased compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123R. We use the BlackScholes optionpricing model, which requires the input of subjective assumptions. These assumptions include: estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them (expected term); the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term (volatility), and the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements (forfeitures). Changes in these assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stockbased compensation. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, we ceased the granting of stock options in favor of restricted stock units. Income Taxes The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Significant judgment is required in assessing, among other things, the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items. We establish reserves when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable, we believe that certain positions may be successfully challenged. When facts and circumstances change, we adjust these reserves through our provision for income taxes. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in the Current Year Financial Statements (SAB 108). SAB 108 addresses how the effects of prior year uncorrected misstatements should be considered when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements. SAB 108 requires an entity to quantify misstatements using a balance sheet and income statement approach and to evaluate whether either approach results in quantifying an error that is material in light of relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. We early adopted SAB 108 as of August 29, 2005, the beginning of our fiscal year. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report for further discussion. In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157). SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements required under other accounting pronouncements but does not change existing guidance as to whether or not an instrument is carried at fair value. SFAS 157 is effective for our fiscal year 2008. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting SFAS 157. 29 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. FIN 48 is effective beginning in fiscal 2008. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting FIN 48. In June 2006, the FASB ratified the consensus reached on Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 06 03, How Sales Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities Should Be Presented in the Income Statement (that is, Gross Versus Net Presentation). The EITF reached a consensus that the presentation of taxes on either a gross or net basis is an accounting policy decision that requires disclosure. EITF 06 03 is effective for the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after December 15, 2006. Amounts collected from our members, which under common trade practices are referred to as sales taxes, are and have been recorded on a net basis. We have no intention of modifying this accounting policy. Therefore, the adoption of EITF 06 03 will not have any effect on our financial position or results of operations. In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, a Replacement of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 20, and FASB Statement No. 3. SFAS 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements for changes in accounting principles, unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change. SFAS 154 also requires that retrospective application of a change in accounting principle be limited to the direct effects of the change. Indirect effects of a change in accounting principle, such as a change in non discretionary profit sharing payments resulting from an accounting change, should be recognized in the period of the accounting change. SFAS 154 also requires that a change in depreciation, amortization, or depletion method for long lived, non financial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate effected by a change in accounting principle. SFAS 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. We will adopt the provisions of SFAS 154 beginning in fiscal 2007. We do not believe the adoption will have a significant effect on our future consolidated financial statements. 30 Table of Contents Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to financial market risk resulting from changes in interest and foreign currency rates. As a policy, we do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions, nor hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. The nature and amount of our long and short term debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As of September 3, 2006, our fixed rate long term debt included $129 million principal amount at maturity Zero Coupon Subordinated Notes carried at $88 million and additional notes and capital lease obligations totaling $135 million. Our debt also includes $300 million 51/2% Senior Notes carried at $301 million. We entered into fixed to floating interest rate swaps on the Senior Notes, effectively converting these fixed interest rate securities to variable rate securities. As of September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, we had fixed to floating interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $300 million and an aggregate fair value of $1 million and $8 million, respectively. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt and may affect the interest expense related to the variable rate debt. We hold interest bearing instruments that are classified as cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. Our investment policy is to manage our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances to preserve principal and liquidity, while seeking to maximize the return on our investment portfolio through the full investment of available funds. We diversify our investment portfolio by investing in multiple types of investment grade securities and through a combination of internal and third party investment management. Short term investments generally have a maturity of three months to five years from the purchase date. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. As the majority of these instruments are of a short term nature, if interest rates were to increase or decrease, there is no material risk of a valuation adjustment related to these instruments. For those instruments that are classified as available for sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in interest rates are reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss. Based on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances at September 3, 2006, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $9 million to interest income (pre tax) on an annual basis. Most transactions of our foreign subsidiaries are conducted in local currencies, limiting our exposure to changes in currency rates. We periodically enter into short term forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates on inventory purchases. The notional value of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at September 3, 2006 was $62 million. 31 Table of Contents 
 
Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) 2005 vs. 2004 Membership fees increased 11.6% to $1.07 billion, or 2.07% of net sales, in fiscal 2005 from $961 million, or 2.04% of net sales, in fiscal 2004. This increase was primarily due to additional membership sign ups at the 16 new warehouses opened in fiscal 2005, increased penetration of our Executive Membership program and a high overall member renewal rate of 86%. Gross Margin Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 Fiscal 2004 Gross margin $ 6,217,683 $ 5,532,109 $ 5,056,611 Gross margin increase 12.4 % 9.4 % 13.4 % Gross margin as a percent of net sales 10.55 % 10.66 % 10.73 % 2006 vs. 2005 Gross margin was $6.22 billion in fiscal 2006 or 10.55% of net sales, compared to $5.53 billion or 10.66% of net sales in fiscal 2006. This eleven basis point decrease reflected increased penetration of the Executive Membership two percent reward program and increased spending by executive members, which decreased gross margin by ten basis points. Additionally, a decrease of four basis points in gross margin in our merchandise departments and warehouse ancillary businesses was primarily due to changes in the sales mix, with higher sales penetration of lower margin departments and slightly lower overall gross margins in our hardlines and softlines categories. These decreases were partially offset by a three basis point improvement due to the absence of a charge to inventories following the last in, first out (LIFO) method. 2005 vs. 2004 Gross margin increased 9.4% to $5.53 billion, or 10.66% of net sales, in fiscal 2005 from $5.06 billion, or 10.73% of net sales in fiscal 2004. This seven basis point decrease in gross margin as a percentage of net sales reflected a decrease of three basis points in gross margin in our merchandise departments. The three basis point decrease in merchandising is largely due to changes in the sales mix, with higher penetration of lower margin departments. This effect was offset by gross margin gains in most of our merchandise departments, as well as our international operations. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales was positively impacted by five basis points due to the implementation of EITF 03 10, whereby net sales and merchandise costs were reduced equally. The gross margin percentage was reduced by ten basis points due to the increased penetration of the Executive Member two percent reward program, increased spending by Executive members and the resulting increases in the related costs. The gross margin figures reflect accounting for most U.S. merchandise inventories on the LIFO method. Fiscal 2005 included a $13.0 million LIFO charge (increase in merchandise costs), while fiscal 2004 included a $6.0 million LIFO charge. The impact of the LIFO adjustment on a year over year basis negatively impacted gross margin, as a percentage of sales, by one additional basis point. 18 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 Fiscal 2004 Selling, general and administrative expense $ 5,732,141 $ 5,061,339 $ 4,600,792 Selling, general and administrative expense as a percent of net sales 9.72 % 9.76 % 9.76 % 2006 vs. 2005 Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were $5.73 billion, or 9.72% of net sales in fiscal 2006, compared to $5.06 billion, or 9.76% of net sales in fiscal 2005. Improved warehouse and central operating costs positively impacted SG&A by approximately nine basis points, primarily due to increased expense leverage of warehouse payroll, which was positively impacted by strong comparable warehouse sales and a lower rate of increase in workers compensation costs. This improvement was partially offset by an increase in stock based compensation cost of approximately five basis points in fiscal 2006. 2005 vs. 2004 SG&A expenses were $5.06 billion, or 9.76% of net sales, in fiscal 2005 compared to $4.60 billion, or 9.76% of net sales, in fiscal 2004. Had EITF 03 10 been in effect for all of fiscal 2004, SG&A expenses as a percent of net sales would have shown improvement of four basis points as a percent of net sales in fiscal 2005. For fiscal 2005, warehouse and central operating costs positively impacted SG&A comparisons year over year by approximately ten basis points, primarily due to improved payroll utilization at the warehouse level, including increased leverage from increased comparable sales and cost control measures employed in employee benefits, primarily health care. This improvement was offset by the implementation of EITF 03 10, which negatively impacted SG&A as a percentage of net sales by five basis points, and an increase in stock based compensation costs approximating six basis points year over year. Preopening Expenses Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 Fiscal 2004 Preopening expenses $ 42,504 $ 53,230 $ 30,451 Preopening expenses as a percent of net sales 0.07 % 0.10 % 0.07 % Warehouse openings 28 21 20 Relocations (3 ) (5 ) Warehouse openings, net of relocations 25 16 20 2006 vs. 2005 Preopening expenses totaled $42.5 million, or 0.07% of net sales, during fiscal 2006 compared to $53.2 million, or 0.10% of net sales, during fiscal 2005. During fiscal 2005, in response to the February 7, 2005 letter of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) concerning accounting standards related to leases, we adjusted our method of accounting for leases (entered into over the previous twenty years), primarily related to ground leases at certain owned warehouse locations that did not require rental payments during the period of construction. We recorded a cumulative pre tax, non cash charge of $16.0 million to preopening expense in the second quarter of fiscal 2005. Twenty eight warehouses (including three relocations) were opened in fiscal 2006 compared to the opening of 19 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) twenty one warehouses (including five relocations) in fiscal 2005. Preopening expenses also include costs related to remodels and expanded ancillary operations at existing warehouses. 2005 vs. 2004 Preopening expenses totaled $53.2 million, or 0.10% of net sales, during fiscal 2005 compared to $30.5 million, or 0.07% of net sales, during fiscal 2004. As discussed above, fiscal 2005 included a cumulative pre tax, non cash charge of $16.0 million to preopening expense related to an adjustment to the method of accounting for leases. Twenty one warehouses (including five relocations) were opened in fiscal 2005 compared to the opening of 20 warehouses in fiscal 2004. Preopening expenses also include costs related to remodels and expanded ancillary operations at existing warehouses. Provision for Impaired Assets and Closing Costs, net Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 Fiscal 2004 Provision for Impaired Assets and Closing Costs, net: Warehouse closing expenses $ 3,762 $ 11,619 $ 16,548 Impairment of long lived assets 3,893 Net losses (gains) on the sale of real property 1,691 881 (15,548 ) Total $ 5,453 $ 16,393 $ 1,000 Provision for Impaired Assets and Closing Costs, net as a percent of net sales 0.01 % 0.03 % 0.00 % 2006 vs. 2005 The net provision for impaired assets and closing costs was $5.5 million in fiscal 2006, compared to $16.4 million in fiscal 2005. The provision includes costs related to impairment of long lived assets, future lease obligations of warehouses that have been relocated to new facilities, and losses or gains resulting from the sale of real property. The provision for fiscal 2006 included charges of $3.8 million for warehouse closing expenses and $1.7 million for net losses on the sale of real property. The provision for fiscal 2005 included charges of $3.9 million for impairment of long lived assets, $11.6 million for warehouse closing expenses and $0.9 million for net losses on the sale of real property. 2005 vs. 2004 The net provision for impaired assets and closing costs was $16.4 million in fiscal 2005, compared to $1.0 million in fiscal 2004. The provision for fiscal 2005 included charges of $3.9 million for impairment of long lived assets, $11.6 million for warehouse closing expenses and $0.9 million for net losses on the sale of real property. The provision for fiscal 2004 included charges of $16.5 million for warehouse closing expenses that were offset by gains of $15.5 million on the sale of real property. The reserve for warehouse closing costs at the end of fiscal 2006 and 2005 included: September 3,2006 August 28,2005 Reserve for warehouse closing costs: Future lease obligations $ 5,950 $ 9,118 Other 1,091 438 Total $ 7,041 $ 9,556 20 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Interest Expense Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 Fiscal 2004 Interest expense $ 12,570 $ 34,437 $ 36,651 2006 vs. 2005 Interest expense totaled $12.6 million in fiscal 2006, compared to $34.4 million in fiscal 2005. Interest expense in fiscal 2006 primarily included interest on the 5 1/2% Senior Notes, the 3 1/2% Zero Coupon Notes, and balances outstanding under our bank credit facilities and promissory notes. In fiscal 2005, interest expense also included interest on the 7 1/8% Senior Notes. The decrease in interest expense in fiscal 2006 resulted primarily from the repayment of the 7 1/8% Senior Notes in June 2005. In addition, interest expense decreased on the 3 1/2% Zero Coupon Notes as note holders converted approximately $190.9 million in principal amount of the Notes into common stock. The amount of interest capitalized increased in fiscal 2006, contributing to the decrease in interest expense, as both interest rates and the dollar amount of projects under construction increased. The overall decrease in interest expense in fiscal 2006 was partially offset by the increase in interest rates on the 5 1/2% Senior Notes, which were swapped into variable rate debt in March 2002. 2005 vs. 2004 Interest expense totaled $34.4 million in fiscal 2005, compared to $36.7 million in fiscal 2004. Interest expense in both fiscal 2005 and 2004 included interest on the 3 1/2% Zero Coupon Notes, the 7 1/8% and 5 1/2% Senior Notes, and on balances outstanding under our bank credit facilities and promissory notes. The decrease was primarily a result of a decrease in interest on our 3 1/2% Zero Coupon Notes as note holders converted approximately $280.8 million in principle amount of the Notes into common stock during fiscal 2005. Additionally, capitalized interest increased year over year as interest rates and construction costs increased in fiscal 2005 over fiscal 2004. These decreases were partially offset by increases in interest on the Senior Notes as these fixed rate instruments were swapped into variable rate debt in November 2001 and March 2002, which was mitigated by the fact that the 7 1/8% Senior Notes matured and were repaid on June 15, 2005. Interest Income and Other Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 Fiscal 2004 Interest income and other $ 138,355 $ 109,096 $ 51,627 2006 vs. 2005 Interest income and other totaled $138.4 million in fiscal 2006, compared to $109.1 million in fiscal 2005. This increase primarily reflects increased interest income resulting from higher interest rates earned, as well as an extra week in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005. 2005 vs. 2004 Interest income and other totaled $109.1 million in fiscal 2005, compared to $51.6 million in fiscal 2004. The increase primarily reflects increased interest income resulting from higher cash and cash equivalents balances and short term investments on hand throughout fiscal 2005, as well as higher interest rates earned on the balances as compared to fiscal 2004. 21 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Provision for Income Taxes Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 Fiscal 2004 Income tax expense $ 648,202 $ 485,870 $ 518,231 Effective tax rate 37.01 % 31.37 % 37.00 % The effective income tax rate on earnings in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004 was 37.01%, 31.37% and 37.00%, respectively. The low rate in fiscal 2005 was primarily attributable to a non recurring $54.2 million income tax benefit resulting primarily from the settlement of a transfer pricing dispute between the United States and Canada (covering the years 1996 2003) and a net tax benefit on excess foreign tax credits on unremitted foreign earnings of $20.6 million. Excluding these benefits the effective income tax rate on earnings in fiscal 2005 would have been 36.2%. Net Income Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 Fiscal 2004 Net income $ 1,103,215 $ 1,063,092 $ 882,393 Net income increase 3.8 % 20.5 % 22.4 % Net income as a percentage of net sales 1.87 % 2.05 % 1.87 % Diluted earnings per share $ 2.30 $ 2.18 $ 1.85 Shares used to calculate diluted earnings per share 480,341 492,035 482,459 Diluted earnings per share increase 6 % 18 % 21 % 2006 vs. 2005 Net income for fiscal 2006 increased 3.8%, to $1.10 billion or $2.30 per diluted share, from $1.06 billion or $2.18 per diluted share, during fiscal 2005. The fiscal 2005 results included several non recurring items that in the aggregate positively impacted reported earnings for all of fiscal 2005 by approximately $0.14 per share: a $54.2 million (approximately $0.11 per diluted share) income tax benefit resulting primarily from the settlement of a transfer pricing dispute between the United States and Canada; a cumulative pre tax, non cash charge to preopening expenses of $16.0 million (approximately $0.02 per diluted share) related to a correction to our method of accounting for ground leases; and a net tax benefit with respect to excess foreign tax credits on unremitted foreign earnings recorded in the fourth quarter of $20.6 million (approximately $0.04 per diluted share). Exclusive of these items, fiscal 2005 earnings were $2.04 per diluted share. Fiscal 2006s earnings per diluted share represents an increase of 13% over that figure. 2005 vs. 2004 Net Income Net income for fiscal 2005 increased 20.5% to $1.06 billion, or $2.18 per diluted share, from $882.4 million, or $1.85 per diluted share, during fiscal year 2004. As discussed above, the fiscal 2005 results included several non recurring items that in the aggregate positively impacted reported earnings for all of fiscal 2005 by approximately $0.14 per share. Exclusive of these items, fiscal 2005 earnings were $2.04 per diluted share, which represents an increase of 10% over fiscal 2004 earnings per diluted share. 22 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (dollars in thousands, except per share amounts) The following table itemizes components of our most liquid assets: September 3,2006 August 28,2005 Cash and cash equivalents $ 1,510,939 $ 2,062,585 Short term investments 1,322,181 1,397,272 Total $ 2,833,120 $ 3,459,857 Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from warehouse operations and our existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances, which were $2.83 billion and $3.46 billion at September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, respectively. Of these balances, approximately $594 million and $522 million at September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, respectively, represented debit and credit card receivables, primarily related to weekend sales immediately prior to the year end close. The decrease in our most liquid assets of $627 million to $2.83 billion at September 3, 2006 was due primarily to the repurchase of our common stock, the acquisition of property and equipment related to warehouse expansion and the payment of cash dividends. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $1.83 billion in fiscal 2006 compared to $1.78 billion in fiscal 2005, an increase of $51 million. This increase is attributable to higher net income and an increase in cash flow from operating assets and liabilities of $338 million, offset by an increase in net merchandise inventories (merchandise inventory less accounts payable) of $388 million. Net cash used in investing activities totaled $1.15 billion in fiscal 2006 compared to $2.05 billion in fiscal 2005. The decrease relates primarily to a decrease in the net investment in short term investments of $1.16 billion, offset by an increase of $217 million in additions to property and equipment related to warehouse expansion and remodel projects. The decrease in the net investment in short term investments was due primarily to our stock repurchase activity. Net cash used in financing activities totaled $1.23 billion in fiscal 2006 compared to $519 million in fiscal 2005. The increase of $715 million primarily resulted from the repurchase of common stock in fiscal 2006, which used $1.44 billion of cash, compared to $413 million in fiscal 2005. In addition, $304 million was used in fiscal 2005 for the repayment of the 7 1/8% Senior Notes. Dividends In April 2006, our quarterly cash dividend was increased from $0.115 to $0.13 per share. Our cash dividends paid in fiscal 2006 totaled $0.49 per share. In fiscal 2005, we paid quarterly cash dividends totaling $0.43 per share. Our current quarterly dividend rate is $0.13 per share or $0.52 per share on an annualized basis. 23 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Contractual Obligations Our commitments at year end to make future payments under contractual obligations were as follows, as of September 3, 2006: Payments Due by Period Contractual obligations Total Less than 1 year 1 to 3 years 4 to 5 years After 5 years Long term debt(1) $ 523,391 $ 317,959 $ 57,358 $ 60,046 $ 88,028 Capital lease obligations and other(1) 20,928 8,152 4,666 2,034 6,076 Operating leases(2) 1,647,683 130,259 237,373 200,052 1,079,999 Purchase obligations (merchandise)(3) 3,538,948 3,538,096 852 Purchase obligations (building, equipment, services and other)(4) 385,650 350,721 29,563 5,366 Other(5) 11,809 1,703 2,852 2,692 4,562 Total $ 6,128,409 $ 4,346,890 $ 332,664 $ 270,190 $ 1,178,665 (1) Amounts include contractual interest payments. (2) Operating lease obligations have been reduced by $162,120 to reflect sub lease income. (3) Includes open merchandise purchase orders. (4) The amounts exclude minor outsourced services negotiated at the individual warehouse level that are not significant and generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty. (5) Consists of asset retirement and deferred compensation obligations. Expansion Plans Our primary requirement for capital is the domestic and international financing of the land, building and equipment costs for new and remodeled warehouses plus the costs of initial warehouse operations and working capital requirements. While there can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized, and plans are subject to change upon further review, it is managements current intention to spend approximately $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion during fiscal 2007 for real estate, construction, remodeling and equipment for warehouse clubs and related operations. These expenditures are expected to be financed with a combination of cash provided from operations and the use of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. Plans for the United States and Canada during fiscal 2007 are to open approximately 33 to 35 new warehouses on a net basis, inclusive of one to two relocations. We expect to continue our review of expansion plans in our international operations, including the United Kingdom and Asia, along with other international markets. At present, we are planning to open one additional warehouse in the United Kingdom during fiscal 2007. Costco Mexico plans to open one to two new warehouses during fiscal 2007. 24 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Additional Equity Investments in Subsidiaries and Joint Ventures During fiscal 2006 and 2005, we contributed an additional $15 million each year to our investment in Costco Mexico (a 50% owned joint venture), which did not impact our percentage ownership of this entity, as our joint venture partner contributed a like amount. In addition, in fiscal 2005, we acquired the remaining 4% interest in CWC Travel Inc. for $4 million, bringing our ownership in this entity to 100%. Bank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs (all amounts stated in U.S. dollars) A wholly owned Canadian subsidiary has a $181 million commercial paper program ($167 million at August 28, 2005) supported by a $54 million bank credit facility ($50 million at August 28, 2005) with a Canadian bank, which we guarantee and which expires in March 2007. We intend to renew the bank credit facility. At both September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, there were no amounts outstanding under the Canadian commercial paper program or the bank credit facility. Applicable interest rates on the credit facility at September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, were 4.65% and 4.25%, respectively. At September 3, 2006, standby letters of credit totaling $21 million issued under the bank credit facility left $33 million available for commercial paper support. At August 28, 2005, standby letters of credit totaling $23 million issued under the bank credit facility left $27 million available for commercial paper support. Our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary has a short term $13 million bank line of credit ($14 million at August 28, 2005) that expires in February 2007, which we intend to renew. At September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, $2.5 million and $6 million, respectively, were borrowed under the line of credit, and $4 million in both years was used to support standby letters of credit. A second $13 million bank line of credit also expires in February 2007, which we intend to renew. At September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, $0.9 million and $9 million, respectively, were borrowed under the second facility. Applicable interest rates on the credit facilities at September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, were 0.95% and 0.84%, respectively. Our Korean subsidiary has a short term $13 million bank line of credit, which expires in February 2007, and which we intend to renew. At September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, no amounts were borrowed under the line of credit and $2 million in both years was used to support standby letters of credit. Applicable interest rates on the credit facility at September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005 were 5.48% and 4.51%, respectively. Our Taiwan subsidiary has a $5 million bank revolving credit facility that expires in January 2007, which we intend to renew. At September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, no amounts were borrowed under the credit facility and $2 million and $3 million, respectively, were used to support standby letters of credit. A second $15 million bank revolving credit facility is in place, which expires in August 2007. At September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, no amounts were borrowed under the second credit facility and $2 million and $1 million, respectively, were used to support standby letters of credit. Applicable interest rates on the credit facility at September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, were 4.00% and 3.75%, respectively. Our wholly owned United Kingdom subsidiary has a $114 million bank revolving credit facility expiring in February 2007, and a $67 million bank overdraft facility renewable on a yearly basis in March 2007. We intend to renew both facilities. At September 3, 2006, $38 million was outstanding under the revolving credit facility with an applicable interest rate of 5.32% and no amounts were outstanding under the bank overdraft facility. At August 28, 2005, $40 million was outstanding under the revolving credit facility, with an applicable interest rate of 5.30%, and no amounts were outstanding under the bank overdraft facility. 25 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) On November 15, 2005, upon the expiration of our $150 million bank credit facility in the U.S. with a group of nine banks, we terminated our $500 million commercial paper program. At August 28, 2005, no amounts were outstanding under the commercial paper program and no amounts were outstanding under the credit facility. The applicable interest rate on the credit facility at August 28, 2005, was 3.92%. Letters of Credit We have letter of credit facilities (for commercial and standby letters of credit) totaling $400 million. The outstanding commitments under these facilities at September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005 totaled $85 million and $131 million, respectively, including $55 million and $65 million, respectively, in standby letters of credit. Financing Activities In April 2003, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.92% in the aggregate amount of $34 million, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due in April 2010. In March 2002, we issued $300 million of 5 1/2% Senior Notes, carried at $301 million, due in March 2007. Interest is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15. Simultaneous with the issuance of the 5 1/2% Senior Notes, we entered into interest rate swap agreements converting the interest to a floating rate indexed to LIBOR. We plan to repay the 5 1/2% Senior Notes at maturity from our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances. In February 1996, we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a shelf registration statement for $500 million of senior debt securities. In October 2001, additional debt securities of $100 million were registered. The $300 million of 5 1/2% Senior Notes issued in March 2002 reduced the amount of registered securities available for future issuance to $300 million. In April 2006, we cancelled the shelf registration. During fiscal 2006, $191 million in principal amount of our 3 1/2% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes were converted by note holders into 6.5 million shares of common stock. The current Notes outstanding are convertible into a maximum of 2,925,057 shares of Costco common stock at an initial conversion price of $22.71. Derivatives We have limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and use them only to manage well defined interest rate and foreign exchange risks. Forward foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on inventory purchases and typically have very short terms. The aggregate notional amount, which approximates the fair value of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, was $63 million and $42 million, respectively. The majority of the forward foreign exchange contracts were entered into by our wholly owned United Kingdom subsidiary, primarily to hedge U.S. dollar merchandise inventory purchases. We also hold interest rate swaps to manage the interest rate risk associated with our borrowings and the mix of fixed rate and variable rate debt. As of September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, we had fixed to floating interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $300 million and an aggregate fair value of $1 million and $8 million, respectively. These amounts were recorded in deferred income taxes and other current assets as of September 3, 2006 and in other assets as of 26 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) August 28, 2005, in our consolidated balance sheets. These swaps were entered into effective March 25, 2002, and are designated and qualify as fair value hedges of our $300 million 5 1/2% Senior Notes. As the terms of the swaps match those of the underlying hedged debt, the changes in the fair value of these swaps are offset by corresponding changes in the carrying amount of the hedged debt and result in no net earnings impact. We are exposed to market risk for changes in utility commodity pricing, which we partially mitigate through the use of firm price contracts with counterparties for approximately 19% of our locations in the U.S. and Canada. The effects of these arrangements are not significant for any period presented. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements With the exception of our operating leases, we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition or consolidated financial statements. Stock Repurchase Programs Our Board of Directors has approved the following stock repurchase programs (000s): AmountApproved AmountRemaining August 2005 $ 1,000,000 $ 0 January 2006(1) 1,000,000 625,534 July 2006(2) 2,000,000 2,000,000 Total $ 4,000,000 $ 2,625,534 (1) Expires in January 2009. (2) Expires in July 2009. During fiscal 2005, we repurchased 9.2 million shares of common stock, at an average price of $44.89, totaling approximately $413 million. During fiscal 2006, we repurchased 28.4 million shares at an average price of $51.44, totaling approximately $1.46 billion. The amount available to be purchased under the approved plans was approximately $2.63 billion at September 3, 2006. Purchases are made from time to time as conditions warrant in the open market or in block purchases, or pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5 1. Repurchased shares are retired. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our financial statements requires that management make estimates and judgments that affect the financial position and results of operations. Management continues to review its accounting policies and evaluate its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, merchandise inventory valuation, impairment of long lived assets, warehouse closing costs, insurance/self insurance liabilities, stock based compensation and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Revenue Recognition We recognize sales, net of estimated returns, at the time customers take possession of merchandise or receive services. When we collect payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of 27 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) merchandise or the performance of services, the amount received is recorded as deferred revenue on the balance sheet until the sale or service is completed. We provide for estimated sales returns based on historical returns levels. We evaluate the criteria of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal Versus Net as an Agent, in determining whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, when we are the primary obligor, subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, influence product or service specifications, or have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded on a gross basis. If we are not the primary obligor and do not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above, we record the net amounts as commissions earned, which is reflected in net sales. Membership fee revenue represents annual membership fees paid by substantially all of our members. We account for membership fee revenue on a deferred basis, whereby membership fee revenue is recognized ratably over one year. Our Executive members qualify for a 2% reward (which can be redeemed only at Costco warehouses), up to a maximum of $500 per year, on all qualified purchases made at Costco. We account for this 2% reward as a reduction in sales, with the related liability being classified within other current liabilities. Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, as determined primarily by the retail method of accounting, and are stated using the last in, first out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail method of accounting and are stated using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. We believe the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. We record an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the expected annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end. At both September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005 merchandise inventories valued at LIFO approximated FIFO after considering the lower of cost or market principle. We provide for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts as a percentage of net sales. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect the actual physical inventory count results, which generally occur in the second and fourth fiscal quarters of the fiscal year. Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as we progress toward earning those rebates, provided they are probable and reasonably estimable. Other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of agreement, or other systematic and rational approach. Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Warehouse Closing costs We periodically evaluate our long lived assets for indicators of impairment. Our judgments are based on existing market and operational conditions. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring an adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value. We provide estimates for warehouse closing costs based on applicable U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Future circumstances may result in actual closing costs or the amount recognized upon the sale of the property to differ substantially from the original estimates. 28 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Insurance/Self Insurance Liabilities We use a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance pool, to provide for potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property damage, director and officers liability, vehicle liability and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience and evaluations of outside expertise, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. StockBased Compensation We account for stockbased compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123R. We use the BlackScholes optionpricing model, which requires the input of subjective assumptions. These assumptions include: estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them (expected term); the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term (volatility), and the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements (forfeitures). Changes in these assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stockbased compensation. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, we ceased the granting of stock options in favor of restricted stock units. Income Taxes The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Significant judgment is required in assessing, among other things, the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items. We establish reserves when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable, we believe that certain positions may be successfully challenged. When facts and circumstances change, we adjust these reserves through our provision for income taxes. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in the Current Year Financial Statements (SAB 108). SAB 108 addresses how the effects of prior year uncorrected misstatements should be considered when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements. SAB 108 requires an entity to quantify misstatements using a balance sheet and income statement approach and to evaluate whether either approach results in quantifying an error that is material in light of relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. We early adopted SAB 108 as of August 29, 2005, the beginning of our fiscal year. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report for further discussion. In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157). SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements required under other accounting pronouncements but does not change existing guidance as to whether or not an instrument is carried at fair value. SFAS 157 is effective for our fiscal year 2008. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting SFAS 157. 29 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. FIN 48 is effective beginning in fiscal 2008. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting FIN 48. In June 2006, the FASB ratified the consensus reached on Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 06 03, How Sales Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities Should Be Presented in the Income Statement (that is, Gross Versus Net Presentation). The EITF reached a consensus that the presentation of taxes on either a gross or net basis is an accounting policy decision that requires disclosure. EITF 06 03 is effective for the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after December 15, 2006. Amounts collected from our members, which under common trade practices are referred to as sales taxes, are and have been recorded on a net basis. We have no intention of modifying this accounting policy. Therefore, the adoption of EITF 06 03 will not have any effect on our financial position or results of operations. In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, a Replacement of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 20, and FASB Statement No. 3. SFAS 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements for changes in accounting principles, unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change. SFAS 154 also requires that retrospective application of a change in accounting principle be limited to the direct effects of the change. Indirect effects of a change in accounting principle, such as a change in non discretionary profit sharing payments resulting from an accounting change, should be recognized in the period of the accounting change. SFAS 154 also requires that a change in depreciation, amortization, or depletion method for long lived, non financial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate effected by a change in accounting principle. SFAS 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. We will adopt the provisions of SFAS 154 beginning in fiscal 2007. We do not believe the adoption will have a significant effect on our future consolidated financial statements. 30 Table of Contents Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to financial market risk resulting from changes in interest and foreign currency rates. As a policy, we do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions, nor hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. The nature and amount of our long and short term debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As of September 3, 2006, our fixed rate long term debt included $129 million principal amount at maturity Zero Coupon Subordinated Notes carried at $88 million and additional notes and capital lease obligations totaling $135 million. Our debt also includes $300 million 51/2% Senior Notes carried at $301 million. We entered into fixed to floating interest rate swaps on the Senior Notes, effectively converting these fixed interest rate securities to variable rate securities. As of September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, we had fixed to floating interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $300 million and an aggregate fair value of $1 million and $8 million, respectively. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt and may affect the interest expense related to the variable rate debt. We hold interest bearing instruments that are classified as cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. Our investment policy is to manage our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances to preserve principal and liquidity, while seeking to maximize the return on our investment portfolio through the full investment of available funds. We diversify our investment portfolio by investing in multiple types of investment grade securities and through a combination of internal and third party investment management. Short term investments generally have a maturity of three months to five years from the purchase date. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. As the majority of these instruments are of a short term nature, if interest rates were to increase or decrease, there is no material risk of a valuation adjustment related to these instruments. For those instruments that are classified as available for sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in interest rates are reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss. Based on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances at September 3, 2006, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $9 million to interest income (pre tax) on an annual basis. Most transactions of our foreign subsidiaries are conducted in local currencies, limiting our exposure to changes in currency rates. We periodically enter into short term forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates on inventory purchases. The notional value of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at September 3, 2006 was $62 million. 31 Table of Contents 
 
Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 Fiscal 2004 Selling, general and administrative expense $ 5,732,141 $ 5,061,339 $ 4,600,792 Selling, general and administrative expense as a percent of net sales 9.72 % 9.76 % 9.76 % 2006 vs. 2005 Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were $5.73 billion, or 9.72% of net sales in fiscal 2006, compared to $5.06 billion, or 9.76% of net sales in fiscal 2005. Improved warehouse and central operating costs positively impacted SG&A by approximately nine basis points, primarily due to increased expense leverage of warehouse payroll, which was positively impacted by strong comparable warehouse sales and a lower rate of increase in workers compensation costs. This improvement was partially offset by an increase in stock based compensation cost of approximately five basis points in fiscal 2006. 2005 vs. 2004 SG&A expenses were $5.06 billion, or 9.76% of net sales, in fiscal 2005 compared to $4.60 billion, or 9.76% of net sales, in fiscal 2004. Had EITF 03 10 been in effect for all of fiscal 2004, SG&A expenses as a percent of net sales would have shown improvement of four basis points as a percent of net sales in fiscal 2005. For fiscal 2005, warehouse and central operating costs positively impacted SG&A comparisons year over year by approximately ten basis points, primarily due to improved payroll utilization at the warehouse level, including increased leverage from increased comparable sales and cost control measures employed in employee benefits, primarily health care. This improvement was offset by the implementation of EITF 03 10, which negatively impacted SG&A as a percentage of net sales by five basis points, and an increase in stock based compensation costs approximating six basis points year over year. Preopening Expenses Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 Fiscal 2004 Preopening expenses $ 42,504 $ 53,230 $ 30,451 Preopening expenses as a percent of net sales 0.07 % 0.10 % 0.07 % Warehouse openings 28 21 20 Relocations (3 ) (5 ) Warehouse openings, net of relocations 25 16 20 2006 vs. 2005 Preopening expenses totaled $42.5 million, or 0.07% of net sales, during fiscal 2006 compared to $53.2 million, or 0.10% of net sales, during fiscal 2005. During fiscal 2005, in response to the February 7, 2005 letter of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) concerning accounting standards related to leases, we adjusted our method of accounting for leases (entered into over the previous twenty years), primarily related to ground leases at certain owned warehouse locations that did not require rental payments during the period of construction. We recorded a cumulative pre tax, non cash charge of $16.0 million to preopening expense in the second quarter of fiscal 2005. Twenty eight warehouses (including three relocations) were opened in fiscal 2006 compared to the opening of 19 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) twenty one warehouses (including five relocations) in fiscal 2005. Preopening expenses also include costs related to remodels and expanded ancillary operations at existing warehouses. 2005 vs. 2004 Preopening expenses totaled $53.2 million, or 0.10% of net sales, during fiscal 2005 compared to $30.5 million, or 0.07% of net sales, during fiscal 2004. As discussed above, fiscal 2005 included a cumulative pre tax, non cash charge of $16.0 million to preopening expense related to an adjustment to the method of accounting for leases. Twenty one warehouses (including five relocations) were opened in fiscal 2005 compared to the opening of 20 warehouses in fiscal 2004. Preopening expenses also include costs related to remodels and expanded ancillary operations at existing warehouses.

The provision includes costs related to impairment of long lived assets, future lease obligations of warehouses that have been relocated to new facilities, and losses or gains resulting from the sale of real property. The provision for fiscal 2006 included charges of $3.8 million for warehouse closing expenses and $1.7 million for net losses on the sale of real property. The provision for fiscal 2005 included charges of $3.9 million for impairment of long lived assets, $11.6 million for warehouse closing expenses and $0.9 million for net losses on the sale of real property. 2005 vs. 2004 The net provision for impaired assets and closing costs was $16.4 million in fiscal 2005, compared to $1.0 million in fiscal 2004. The provision for fiscal 2005 included charges of $3.9 million for impairment of long lived assets, $11.6 million for warehouse closing expenses and $0.9 million for net losses on the sale of real property. The provision for fiscal 2004 included charges of $16.5 million for warehouse closing expenses that were offset by gains of $15.5 million on the sale of real property. The reserve for warehouse closing costs at the end of fiscal 2006 and 2005 included: September 3,2006 August 28,2005 Reserve for warehouse closing costs: Future lease obligations $ 5,950 $ 9,118 Other 1,091 438 Total $ 7,041 $ 9,556 20 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Interest Expense Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 Fiscal 2004 Interest expense $ 12,570 $ 34,437 $ 36,651 2006 vs. 2005 Interest expense totaled $12.6 million in fiscal 2006, compared to $34.4 million in fiscal 2005. Interest expense in fiscal 2006 primarily included interest on the 5 1/2% Senior Notes, the 3 1/2% Zero Coupon Notes, and balances outstanding under our bank credit facilities and promissory notes. In fiscal 2005, interest expense also included interest on the 7 1/8% Senior Notes. The decrease in interest expense in fiscal 2006 resulted primarily from the repayment of the 7 1/8% Senior Notes in June 2005. In addition, interest expense decreased on the 3 1/2% Zero Coupon Notes as note holders converted approximately $190.9 million in principal amount of the Notes into common stock. The amount of interest capitalized increased in fiscal 2006, contributing to the decrease in interest expense, as both interest rates and the dollar amount of projects under construction increased. The overall decrease in interest expense in fiscal 2006 was partially offset by the increase in interest rates on the 5 1/2% Senior Notes, which were swapped into variable rate debt in March 2002. 2005 vs. 2004 Interest expense totaled $34.4 million in fiscal 2005, compared to $36.7 million in fiscal 2004. Interest expense in both fiscal 2005 and 2004 included interest on the 3 1/2% Zero Coupon Notes, the 7 1/8% and 5 1/2% Senior Notes, and on balances outstanding under our bank credit facilities and promissory notes. The decrease was primarily a result of a decrease in interest on our 3 1/2% Zero Coupon Notes as note holders converted approximately $280.8 million in principle amount of the Notes into common stock during fiscal 2005. Additionally, capitalized interest increased year over year as interest rates and construction costs increased in fiscal 2005 over fiscal 2004. These decreases were partially offset by increases in interest on the Senior Notes as these fixed rate instruments were swapped into variable rate debt in November 2001 and March 2002, which was mitigated by the fact that the 7 1/8% Senior Notes matured and were repaid on June 15, 2005. Interest Income and Other Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 Fiscal 2004 Interest income and other $ 138,355 $ 109,096 $ 51,627 2006 vs. 2005 Interest income and other totaled $138.4 million in fiscal 2006, compared to $109.1 million in fiscal 2005. This increase primarily reflects increased interest income resulting from higher interest rates earned, as well as an extra week in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005. 2005 vs. 2004 Interest income and other totaled $109.1 million in fiscal 2005, compared to $51.6 million in fiscal 2004. The increase primarily reflects increased interest income resulting from higher cash and cash equivalents balances and short term investments on hand throughout fiscal 2005, as well as higher interest rates earned on the balances as compared to fiscal 2004. 21 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Provision for Income Taxes Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 Fiscal 2004 Income tax expense $ 648,202 $ 485,870 $ 518,231 Effective tax rate 37.01 % 31.37 % 37.00 % The effective income tax rate on earnings in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004 was 37.01%, 31.37% and 37.00%, respectively. The low rate in fiscal 2005 was primarily attributable to a non recurring $54.2 million income tax benefit resulting primarily from the settlement of a transfer pricing dispute between the United States and Canada (covering the years 1996 2003) and a net tax benefit on excess foreign tax credits on unremitted foreign earnings of $20.6 million. Excluding these benefits the effective income tax rate on earnings in fiscal 2005 would have been 36.2%. Net Income Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 Fiscal 2004 Net income $ 1,103,215 $ 1,063,092 $ 882,393 Net income increase 3.8 % 20.5 % 22.4 % Net income as a percentage of net sales 1.87 % 2.05 % 1.87 % Diluted earnings per share $ 2.30 $ 2.18 $ 1.85 Shares used to calculate diluted earnings per share 480,341 492,035 482,459 Diluted earnings per share increase 6 % 18 % 21 % 2006 vs. 2005 Net income for fiscal 2006 increased 3.8%, to $1.10 billion or $2.30 per diluted share, from $1.06 billion or $2.18 per diluted share, during fiscal 2005. The fiscal 2005 results included several non recurring items that in the aggregate positively impacted reported earnings for all of fiscal 2005 by approximately $0.14 per share: a $54.2 million (approximately $0.11 per diluted share) income tax benefit resulting primarily from the settlement of a transfer pricing dispute between the United States and Canada; a cumulative pre tax, non cash charge to preopening expenses of $16.0 million (approximately $0.02 per diluted share) related to a correction to our method of accounting for ground leases; and a net tax benefit with respect to excess foreign tax credits on unremitted foreign earnings recorded in the fourth quarter of $20.6 million (approximately $0.04 per diluted share). Exclusive of these items, fiscal 2005 earnings were $2.04 per diluted share. Fiscal 2006s earnings per diluted share represents an increase of 13% over that figure. 2005 vs. 2004 Net Income Net income for fiscal 2005 increased 20.5% to $1.06 billion, or $2.18 per diluted share, from $882.4 million, or $1.85 per diluted share, during fiscal year 2004. As discussed above, the fiscal 2005 results included several non recurring items that in the aggregate positively impacted reported earnings for all of fiscal 2005 by approximately $0.14 per share. Exclusive of these items, fiscal 2005 earnings were $2.04 per diluted share, which represents an increase of 10% over fiscal 2004 earnings per diluted share. 22 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (dollars in thousands, except per share amounts) The following table itemizes components of our most liquid assets: September 3,2006 August 28,2005 Cash and cash equivalents $ 1,510,939 $ 2,062,585 Short term investments 1,322,181 1,397,272 Total $ 2,833,120 $ 3,459,857 Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from warehouse operations and our existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances, which were $2.83 billion and $3.46 billion at September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, respectively. Of these balances, approximately $594 million and $522 million at September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, respectively, represented debit and credit card receivables, primarily related to weekend sales immediately prior to the year end close. The decrease in our most liquid assets of $627 million to $2.83 billion at September 3, 2006 was due primarily to the repurchase of our common stock, the acquisition of property and equipment related to warehouse expansion and the payment of cash dividends. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $1.83 billion in fiscal 2006 compared to $1.78 billion in fiscal 2005, an increase of $51 million. This increase is attributable to higher net income and an increase in cash flow from operating assets and liabilities of $338 million, offset by an increase in net merchandise inventories (merchandise inventory less accounts payable) of $388 million. Net cash used in investing activities totaled $1.15 billion in fiscal 2006 compared to $2.05 billion in fiscal 2005. The decrease relates primarily to a decrease in the net investment in short term investments of $1.16 billion, offset by an increase of $217 million in additions to property and equipment related to warehouse expansion and remodel projects. The decrease in the net investment in short term investments was due primarily to our stock repurchase activity. Net cash used in financing activities totaled $1.23 billion in fiscal 2006 compared to $519 million in fiscal 2005. The increase of $715 million primarily resulted from the repurchase of common stock in fiscal 2006, which used $1.44 billion of cash, compared to $413 million in fiscal 2005. In addition, $304 million was used in fiscal 2005 for the repayment of the 7 1/8% Senior Notes. Dividends In April 2006, our quarterly cash dividend was increased from $0.115 to $0.13 per share. Our cash dividends paid in fiscal 2006 totaled $0.49 per share. In fiscal 2005, we paid quarterly cash dividends totaling $0.43 per share. Our current quarterly dividend rate is $0.13 per share or $0.52 per share on an annualized basis. 23 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Contractual Obligations Our commitments at year end to make future payments under contractual obligations were as follows, as of September 3, 2006: Payments Due by Period Contractual obligations Total Less than 1 year 1 to 3 years 4 to 5 years After 5 years Long term debt(1) $ 523,391 $ 317,959 $ 57,358 $ 60,046 $ 88,028 Capital lease obligations and other(1) 20,928 8,152 4,666 2,034 6,076 Operating leases(2) 1,647,683 130,259 237,373 200,052 1,079,999 Purchase obligations (merchandise)(3) 3,538,948 3,538,096 852 Purchase obligations (building, equipment, services and other)(4) 385,650 350,721 29,563 5,366 Other(5) 11,809 1,703 2,852 2,692 4,562 Total $ 6,128,409 $ 4,346,890 $ 332,664 $ 270,190 $ 1,178,665 (1) Amounts include contractual interest payments.

(4) The amounts exclude minor outsourced services negotiated at the individual warehouse level that are not significant and generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty. (5) Consists of asset retirement and deferred compensation obligations. Expansion Plans Our primary requirement for capital is the domestic and international financing of the land, building and equipment costs for new and remodeled warehouses plus the costs of initial warehouse operations and working capital requirements. While there can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized, and plans are subject to change upon further review, it is managements current intention to spend approximately $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion during fiscal 2007 for real estate, construction, remodeling and equipment for warehouse clubs and related operations. These expenditures are expected to be financed with a combination of cash provided from operations and the use of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. Plans for the United States and Canada during fiscal 2007 are to open approximately 33 to 35 new warehouses on a net basis, inclusive of one to two relocations. We expect to continue our review of expansion plans in our international operations, including the United Kingdom and Asia, along with other international markets. At present, we are planning to open one additional warehouse in the United Kingdom during fiscal 2007. Costco Mexico plans to open one to two new warehouses during fiscal 2007. 24 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Additional Equity Investments in Subsidiaries and Joint Ventures During fiscal 2006 and 2005, we contributed an additional $15 million each year to our investment in Costco Mexico (a 50% owned joint venture), which did not impact our percentage ownership of this entity, as our joint venture partner contributed a like amount. In addition, in fiscal 2005, we acquired the remaining 4% interest in CWC Travel Inc. for $4 million, bringing our ownership in this entity to 100%. Bank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs (all amounts stated in U.S. dollars) A wholly owned Canadian subsidiary has a $181 million commercial paper program ($167 million at August 28, 2005) supported by a $54 million bank credit facility ($50 million at August 28, 2005) with a Canadian bank, which we guarantee and which expires in March 2007. We intend to renew the bank credit facility. At both September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, there were no amounts outstanding under the Canadian commercial paper program or the bank credit facility. Applicable interest rates on the credit facility at September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, were 4.65% and 4.25%, respectively. At September 3, 2006, standby letters of credit totaling $21 million issued under the bank credit facility left $33 million available for commercial paper support. At August 28, 2005, standby letters of credit totaling $23 million issued under the bank credit facility left $27 million available for commercial paper support. Our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary has a short term $13 million bank line of credit ($14 million at August 28, 2005) that expires in February 2007, which we intend to renew. At September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, $2.5 million and $6 million, respectively, were borrowed under the line of credit, and $4 million in both years was used to support standby letters of credit. A second $13 million bank line of credit also expires in February 2007, which we intend to renew. At September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, $0.9 million and $9 million, respectively, were borrowed under the second facility. Applicable interest rates on the credit facilities at September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, were 0.95% and 0.84%, respectively. Our Korean subsidiary has a short term $13 million bank line of credit, which expires in February 2007, and which we intend to renew. At September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, no amounts were borrowed under the line of credit and $2 million in both years was used to support standby letters of credit. Applicable interest rates on the credit facility at September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005 were 5.48% and 4.51%, respectively. Our Taiwan subsidiary has a $5 million bank revolving credit facility that expires in January 2007, which we intend to renew. At September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, no amounts were borrowed under the credit facility and $2 million and $3 million, respectively, were used to support standby letters of credit. A second $15 million bank revolving credit facility is in place, which expires in August 2007. At September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, no amounts were borrowed under the second credit facility and $2 million and $1 million, respectively, were used to support standby letters of credit. Applicable interest rates on the credit facility at September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, were 4.00% and 3.75%, respectively. Our wholly owned United Kingdom subsidiary has a $114 million bank revolving credit facility expiring in February 2007, and a $67 million bank overdraft facility renewable on a yearly basis in March 2007. We intend to renew both facilities. At September 3, 2006, $38 million was outstanding under the revolving credit facility with an applicable interest rate of 5.32% and no amounts were outstanding under the bank overdraft facility. At August 28, 2005, $40 million was outstanding under the revolving credit facility, with an applicable interest rate of 5.30%, and no amounts were outstanding under the bank overdraft facility. 25 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) On November 15, 2005, upon the expiration of our $150 million bank credit facility in the U.S. with a group of nine banks, we terminated our $500 million commercial paper program. At August 28, 2005, no amounts were outstanding under the commercial paper program and no amounts were outstanding under the credit facility. The applicable interest rate on the credit facility at August 28, 2005, was 3.92%. Letters of Credit We have letter of credit facilities (for commercial and standby letters of credit) totaling $400 million. The outstanding commitments under these facilities at September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005 totaled $85 million and $131 million, respectively, including $55 million and $65 million, respectively, in standby letters of credit. Financing Activities In April 2003, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.92% in the aggregate amount of $34 million, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due in April 2010. In March 2002, we issued $300 million of 5 1/2% Senior Notes, carried at $301 million, due in March 2007. Interest is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15. Simultaneous with the issuance of the 5 1/2% Senior Notes, we entered into interest rate swap agreements converting the interest to a floating rate indexed to LIBOR. We plan to repay the 5 1/2% Senior Notes at maturity from our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances. In February 1996, we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a shelf registration statement for $500 million of senior debt securities. In October 2001, additional debt securities of $100 million were registered. The $300 million of 5 1/2% Senior Notes issued in March 2002 reduced the amount of registered securities available for future issuance to $300 million. In April 2006, we cancelled the shelf registration. During fiscal 2006, $191 million in principal amount of our 3 1/2% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes were converted by note holders into 6.5 million shares of common stock. The current Notes outstanding are convertible into a maximum of 2,925,057 shares of Costco common stock at an initial conversion price of $22.71. Derivatives We have limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and use them only to manage well defined interest rate and foreign exchange risks. Forward foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on inventory purchases and typically have very short terms. The aggregate notional amount, which approximates the fair value of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, was $63 million and $42 million, respectively. The majority of the forward foreign exchange contracts were entered into by our wholly owned United Kingdom subsidiary, primarily to hedge U.S. dollar merchandise inventory purchases. We also hold interest rate swaps to manage the interest rate risk associated with our borrowings and the mix of fixed rate and variable rate debt. As of September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, we had fixed to floating interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $300 million and an aggregate fair value of $1 million and $8 million, respectively. These amounts were recorded in deferred income taxes and other current assets as of September 3, 2006 and in other assets as of 26 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) August 28, 2005, in our consolidated balance sheets. These swaps were entered into effective March 25, 2002, and are designated and qualify as fair value hedges of our $300 million 5 1/2% Senior Notes. As the terms of the swaps match those of the underlying hedged debt, the changes in the fair value of these swaps are offset by corresponding changes in the carrying amount of the hedged debt and result in no net earnings impact. We are exposed to market risk for changes in utility commodity pricing, which we partially mitigate through the use of firm price contracts with counterparties for approximately 19% of our locations in the U.S. and Canada. The effects of these arrangements are not significant for any period presented. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements With the exception of our operating leases, we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition or consolidated financial statements. Stock Repurchase Programs Our Board of Directors has approved the following stock repurchase programs (000s): AmountApproved AmountRemaining August 2005 $ 1,000,000 $ 0 January 2006(1) 1,000,000 625,534 July 2006(2) 2,000,000 2,000,000 Total $ 4,000,000 $ 2,625,534 (1) Expires in January 2009. (2) Expires in July 2009. During fiscal 2005, we repurchased 9.2 million shares of common stock, at an average price of $44.89, totaling approximately $413 million. During fiscal 2006, we repurchased 28.4 million shares at an average price of $51.44, totaling approximately $1.46 billion. The amount available to be purchased under the approved plans was approximately $2.63 billion at September 3, 2006. Purchases are made from time to time as conditions warrant in the open market or in block purchases, or pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5 1. Repurchased shares are retired. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our financial statements requires that management make estimates and judgments that affect the financial position and results of operations. Management continues to review its accounting policies and evaluate its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, merchandise inventory valuation, impairment of long lived assets, warehouse closing costs, insurance/self insurance liabilities, stock based compensation and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Revenue Recognition We recognize sales, net of estimated returns, at the time customers take possession of merchandise or receive services. When we collect payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of 27 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) merchandise or the performance of services, the amount received is recorded as deferred revenue on the balance sheet until the sale or service is completed. We provide for estimated sales returns based on historical returns levels. We evaluate the criteria of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal Versus Net as an Agent, in determining whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, when we are the primary obligor, subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, influence product or service specifications, or have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded on a gross basis. If we are not the primary obligor and do not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above, we record the net amounts as commissions earned, which is reflected in net sales. Membership fee revenue represents annual membership fees paid by substantially all of our members. We account for membership fee revenue on a deferred basis, whereby membership fee revenue is recognized ratably over one year. Our Executive members qualify for a 2% reward (which can be redeemed only at Costco warehouses), up to a maximum of $500 per year, on all qualified purchases made at Costco. We account for this 2% reward as a reduction in sales, with the related liability being classified within other current liabilities. Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, as determined primarily by the retail method of accounting, and are stated using the last in, first out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail method of accounting and are stated using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. We believe the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. We record an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the expected annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end. At both September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005 merchandise inventories valued at LIFO approximated FIFO after considering the lower of cost or market principle. We provide for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts as a percentage of net sales. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect the actual physical inventory count results, which generally occur in the second and fourth fiscal quarters of the fiscal year. Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as we progress toward earning those rebates, provided they are probable and reasonably estimable. Other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of agreement, or other systematic and rational approach. Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Warehouse Closing costs We periodically evaluate our long lived assets for indicators of impairment. Our judgments are based on existing market and operational conditions. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring an adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value. We provide estimates for warehouse closing costs based on applicable U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Future circumstances may result in actual closing costs or the amount recognized upon the sale of the property to differ substantially from the original estimates. 28 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Insurance/Self Insurance Liabilities We use a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance pool, to provide for potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property damage, director and officers liability, vehicle liability and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience and evaluations of outside expertise, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. StockBased Compensation We account for stockbased compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123R. We use the BlackScholes optionpricing model, which requires the input of subjective assumptions. These assumptions include: estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them (expected term); the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term (volatility), and the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements (forfeitures). Changes in these assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stockbased compensation. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, we ceased the granting of stock options in favor of restricted stock units. Income Taxes The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Significant judgment is required in assessing, among other things, the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items. We establish reserves when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable, we believe that certain positions may be successfully challenged. When facts and circumstances change, we adjust these reserves through our provision for income taxes. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in the Current Year Financial Statements (SAB 108). SAB 108 addresses how the effects of prior year uncorrected misstatements should be considered when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements. SAB 108 requires an entity to quantify misstatements using a balance sheet and income statement approach and to evaluate whether either approach results in quantifying an error that is material in light of relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. We early adopted SAB 108 as of August 29, 2005, the beginning of our fiscal year. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report for further discussion. In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157). SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements required under other accounting pronouncements but does not change existing guidance as to whether or not an instrument is carried at fair value. SFAS 157 is effective for our fiscal year 2008. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting SFAS 157. 29 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. FIN 48 is effective beginning in fiscal 2008. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting FIN 48. In June 2006, the FASB ratified the consensus reached on Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 06 03, How Sales Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities Should Be Presented in the Income Statement (that is, Gross Versus Net Presentation). The EITF reached a consensus that the presentation of taxes on either a gross or net basis is an accounting policy decision that requires disclosure. EITF 06 03 is effective for the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after December 15, 2006. Amounts collected from our members, which under common trade practices are referred to as sales taxes, are and have been recorded on a net basis. We have no intention of modifying this accounting policy. Therefore, the adoption of EITF 06 03 will not have any effect on our financial position or results of operations. In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, a Replacement of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 20, and FASB Statement No. 3. SFAS 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements for changes in accounting principles, unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change. SFAS 154 also requires that retrospective application of a change in accounting principle be limited to the direct effects of the change. Indirect effects of a change in accounting principle, such as a change in non discretionary profit sharing payments resulting from an accounting change, should be recognized in the period of the accounting change. SFAS 154 also requires that a change in depreciation, amortization, or depletion method for long lived, non financial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate effected by a change in accounting principle. SFAS 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. We will adopt the provisions of SFAS 154 beginning in fiscal 2007. We do not believe the adoption will have a significant effect on our future consolidated financial statements. 30 Table of Contents Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to financial market risk resulting from changes in interest and foreign currency rates. As a policy, we do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions, nor hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. The nature and amount of our long and short term debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As of September 3, 2006, our fixed rate long term debt included $129 million principal amount at maturity Zero Coupon Subordinated Notes carried at $88 million and additional notes and capital lease obligations totaling $135 million. Our debt also includes $300 million 51/2% Senior Notes carried at $301 million. We entered into fixed to floating interest rate swaps on the Senior Notes, effectively converting these fixed interest rate securities to variable rate securities. As of September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, we had fixed to floating interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $300 million and an aggregate fair value of $1 million and $8 million, respectively. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt and may affect the interest expense related to the variable rate debt. We hold interest bearing instruments that are classified as cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. Our investment policy is to manage our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances to preserve principal and liquidity, while seeking to maximize the return on our investment portfolio through the full investment of available funds. We diversify our investment portfolio by investing in multiple types of investment grade securities and through a combination of internal and third party investment management. Short term investments generally have a maturity of three months to five years from the purchase date. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. As the majority of these instruments are of a short term nature, if interest rates were to increase or decrease, there is no material risk of a valuation adjustment related to these instruments. For those instruments that are classified as available for sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in interest rates are reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss. Based on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances at September 3, 2006, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $9 million to interest income (pre tax) on an annual basis. Most transactions of our foreign subsidiaries are conducted in local currencies, limiting our exposure to changes in currency rates. We periodically enter into short term forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates on inventory purchases. The notional value of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at September 3, 2006 was $62 million. 31 Table of Contents 
 
Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) twenty one warehouses (including five relocations) in fiscal 2005. Preopening expenses also include costs related to remodels and expanded ancillary operations at existing warehouses. 2005 vs. 2004 Preopening expenses totaled $53.2 million, or 0.10% of net sales, during fiscal 2005 compared to $30.5 million, or 0.07% of net sales, during fiscal 2004. As discussed above, fiscal 2005 included a cumulative pre tax, non cash charge of $16.0 million to preopening expense related to an adjustment to the method of accounting for leases. Twenty one warehouses (including five relocations) were opened in fiscal 2005 compared to the opening of 20 warehouses in fiscal 2004. Preopening expenses also include costs related to remodels and expanded ancillary operations at existing warehouses.

The provision includes costs related to impairment of long lived assets, future lease obligations of warehouses that have been relocated to new facilities, and losses or gains resulting from the sale of real property. The provision for fiscal 2006 included charges of $3.8 million for warehouse closing expenses and $1.7 million for net losses on the sale of real property. The provision for fiscal 2005 included charges of $3.9 million for impairment of long lived assets, $11.6 million for warehouse closing expenses and $0.9 million for net losses on the sale of real property. 2005 vs. 2004 The net provision for impaired assets and closing costs was $16.4 million in fiscal 2005, compared to $1.0 million in fiscal 2004. The provision for fiscal 2005 included charges of $3.9 million for impairment of long lived assets, $11.6 million for warehouse closing expenses and $0.9 million for net losses on the sale of real property. The provision for fiscal 2004 included charges of $16.5 million for warehouse closing expenses that were offset by gains of $15.5 million on the sale of real property. The reserve for warehouse closing costs at the end of fiscal 2006 and 2005 included: September 3,2006 August 28,2005 Reserve for warehouse closing costs: Future lease obligations $ 5,950 $ 9,118 Other 1,091 438 Total $ 7,041 $ 9,556 20 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Interest Expense Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 Fiscal 2004 Interest expense $ 12,570 $ 34,437 $ 36,651 2006 vs. 2005 Interest expense totaled $12.6 million in fiscal 2006, compared to $34.4 million in fiscal 2005. Interest expense in fiscal 2006 primarily included interest on the 5 1/2% Senior Notes, the 3 1/2% Zero Coupon Notes, and balances outstanding under our bank credit facilities and promissory notes. In fiscal 2005, interest expense also included interest on the 7 1/8% Senior Notes. The decrease in interest expense in fiscal 2006 resulted primarily from the repayment of the 7 1/8% Senior Notes in June 2005. In addition, interest expense decreased on the 3 1/2% Zero Coupon Notes as note holders converted approximately $190.9 million in principal amount of the Notes into common stock. The amount of interest capitalized increased in fiscal 2006, contributing to the decrease in interest expense, as both interest rates and the dollar amount of projects under construction increased. The overall decrease in interest expense in fiscal 2006 was partially offset by the increase in interest rates on the 5 1/2% Senior Notes, which were swapped into variable rate debt in March 2002. 2005 vs. 2004 Interest expense totaled $34.4 million in fiscal 2005, compared to $36.7 million in fiscal 2004. Interest expense in both fiscal 2005 and 2004 included interest on the 3 1/2% Zero Coupon Notes, the 7 1/8% and 5 1/2% Senior Notes, and on balances outstanding under our bank credit facilities and promissory notes. The decrease was primarily a result of a decrease in interest on our 3 1/2% Zero Coupon Notes as note holders converted approximately $280.8 million in principle amount of the Notes into common stock during fiscal 2005. Additionally, capitalized interest increased year over year as interest rates and construction costs increased in fiscal 2005 over fiscal 2004. These decreases were partially offset by increases in interest on the Senior Notes as these fixed rate instruments were swapped into variable rate debt in November 2001 and March 2002, which was mitigated by the fact that the 7 1/8% Senior Notes matured and were repaid on June 15, 2005. Interest Income and Other Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 Fiscal 2004 Interest income and other $ 138,355 $ 109,096 $ 51,627 2006 vs. 2005 Interest income and other totaled $138.4 million in fiscal 2006, compared to $109.1 million in fiscal 2005. This increase primarily reflects increased interest income resulting from higher interest rates earned, as well as an extra week in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005. 2005 vs. 2004 Interest income and other totaled $109.1 million in fiscal 2005, compared to $51.6 million in fiscal 2004. The increase primarily reflects increased interest income resulting from higher cash and cash equivalents balances and short term investments on hand throughout fiscal 2005, as well as higher interest rates earned on the balances as compared to fiscal 2004. 21 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Provision for Income Taxes Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 Fiscal 2004 Income tax expense $ 648,202 $ 485,870 $ 518,231 Effective tax rate 37.01 % 31.37 % 37.00 % The effective income tax rate on earnings in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004 was 37.01%, 31.37% and 37.00%, respectively. The low rate in fiscal 2005 was primarily attributable to a non recurring $54.2 million income tax benefit resulting primarily from the settlement of a transfer pricing dispute between the United States and Canada (covering the years 1996 2003) and a net tax benefit on excess foreign tax credits on unremitted foreign earnings of $20.6 million. Excluding these benefits the effective income tax rate on earnings in fiscal 2005 would have been 36.2%. Net Income Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 Fiscal 2004 Net income $ 1,103,215 $ 1,063,092 $ 882,393 Net income increase 3.8 % 20.5 % 22.4 % Net income as a percentage of net sales 1.87 % 2.05 % 1.87 % Diluted earnings per share $ 2.30 $ 2.18 $ 1.85 Shares used to calculate diluted earnings per share 480,341 492,035 482,459 Diluted earnings per share increase 6 % 18 % 21 % 2006 vs. 2005 Net income for fiscal 2006 increased 3.8%, to $1.10 billion or $2.30 per diluted share, from $1.06 billion or $2.18 per diluted share, during fiscal 2005. The fiscal 2005 results included several non recurring items that in the aggregate positively impacted reported earnings for all of fiscal 2005 by approximately $0.14 per share: a $54.2 million (approximately $0.11 per diluted share) income tax benefit resulting primarily from the settlement of a transfer pricing dispute between the United States and Canada; a cumulative pre tax, non cash charge to preopening expenses of $16.0 million (approximately $0.02 per diluted share) related to a correction to our method of accounting for ground leases; and a net tax benefit with respect to excess foreign tax credits on unremitted foreign earnings recorded in the fourth quarter of $20.6 million (approximately $0.04 per diluted share). Exclusive of these items, fiscal 2005 earnings were $2.04 per diluted share. Fiscal 2006s earnings per diluted share represents an increase of 13% over that figure. 2005 vs. 2004 Net Income Net income for fiscal 2005 increased 20.5% to $1.06 billion, or $2.18 per diluted share, from $882.4 million, or $1.85 per diluted share, during fiscal year 2004. As discussed above, the fiscal 2005 results included several non recurring items that in the aggregate positively impacted reported earnings for all of fiscal 2005 by approximately $0.14 per share. Exclusive of these items, fiscal 2005 earnings were $2.04 per diluted share, which represents an increase of 10% over fiscal 2004 earnings per diluted share. 22 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (dollars in thousands, except per share amounts) The following table itemizes components of our most liquid assets: September 3,2006 August 28,2005 Cash and cash equivalents $ 1,510,939 $ 2,062,585 Short term investments 1,322,181 1,397,272 Total $ 2,833,120 $ 3,459,857 Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from warehouse operations and our existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances, which were $2.83 billion and $3.46 billion at September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, respectively. Of these balances, approximately $594 million and $522 million at September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, respectively, represented debit and credit card receivables, primarily related to weekend sales immediately prior to the year end close. The decrease in our most liquid assets of $627 million to $2.83 billion at September 3, 2006 was due primarily to the repurchase of our common stock, the acquisition of property and equipment related to warehouse expansion and the payment of cash dividends. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $1.83 billion in fiscal 2006 compared to $1.78 billion in fiscal 2005, an increase of $51 million. This increase is attributable to higher net income and an increase in cash flow from operating assets and liabilities of $338 million, offset by an increase in net merchandise inventories (merchandise inventory less accounts payable) of $388 million. Net cash used in investing activities totaled $1.15 billion in fiscal 2006 compared to $2.05 billion in fiscal 2005. The decrease relates primarily to a decrease in the net investment in short term investments of $1.16 billion, offset by an increase of $217 million in additions to property and equipment related to warehouse expansion and remodel projects. The decrease in the net investment in short term investments was due primarily to our stock repurchase activity. Net cash used in financing activities totaled $1.23 billion in fiscal 2006 compared to $519 million in fiscal 2005. The increase of $715 million primarily resulted from the repurchase of common stock in fiscal 2006, which used $1.44 billion of cash, compared to $413 million in fiscal 2005. In addition, $304 million was used in fiscal 2005 for the repayment of the 7 1/8% Senior Notes. Dividends In April 2006, our quarterly cash dividend was increased from $0.115 to $0.13 per share. Our cash dividends paid in fiscal 2006 totaled $0.49 per share. In fiscal 2005, we paid quarterly cash dividends totaling $0.43 per share. Our current quarterly dividend rate is $0.13 per share or $0.52 per share on an annualized basis. 23 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Contractual Obligations Our commitments at year end to make future payments under contractual obligations were as follows, as of September 3, 2006: Payments Due by Period Contractual obligations Total Less than 1 year 1 to 3 years 4 to 5 years After 5 years Long term debt(1) $ 523,391 $ 317,959 $ 57,358 $ 60,046 $ 88,028 Capital lease obligations and other(1) 20,928 8,152 4,666 2,034 6,076 Operating leases(2) 1,647,683 130,259 237,373 200,052 1,079,999 Purchase obligations (merchandise)(3) 3,538,948 3,538,096 852 Purchase obligations (building, equipment, services and other)(4) 385,650 350,721 29,563 5,366 Other(5) 11,809 1,703 2,852 2,692 4,562 Total $ 6,128,409 $ 4,346,890 $ 332,664 $ 270,190 $ 1,178,665 (1) Amounts include contractual interest payments. (2) Operating lease obligations have been reduced by $162,120 to reflect sub lease income. (3) Includes open merchandise purchase orders. (4) The amounts exclude minor outsourced services negotiated at the individual warehouse level that are not significant and generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty. (5) Consists of asset retirement and deferred compensation obligations. Expansion Plans Our primary requirement for capital is the domestic and international financing of the land, building and equipment costs for new and remodeled warehouses plus the costs of initial warehouse operations and working capital requirements. While there can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized, and plans are subject to change upon further review, it is managements current intention to spend approximately $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion during fiscal 2007 for real estate, construction, remodeling and equipment for warehouse clubs and related operations. These expenditures are expected to be financed with a combination of cash provided from operations and the use of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. Plans for the United States and Canada during fiscal 2007 are to open approximately 33 to 35 new warehouses on a net basis, inclusive of one to two relocations. We expect to continue our review of expansion plans in our international operations, including the United Kingdom and Asia, along with other international markets. At present, we are planning to open one additional warehouse in the United Kingdom during fiscal 2007. Costco Mexico plans to open one to two new warehouses during fiscal 2007. 24 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Additional Equity Investments in Subsidiaries and Joint Ventures During fiscal 2006 and 2005, we contributed an additional $15 million each year to our investment in Costco Mexico (a 50% owned joint venture), which did not impact our percentage ownership of this entity, as our joint venture partner contributed a like amount. In addition, in fiscal 2005, we acquired the remaining 4% interest in CWC Travel Inc. for $4 million, bringing our ownership in this entity to 100%. Bank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs (all amounts stated in U.S. dollars) A wholly owned Canadian subsidiary has a $181 million commercial paper program ($167 million at August 28, 2005) supported by a $54 million bank credit facility ($50 million at August 28, 2005) with a Canadian bank, which we guarantee and which expires in March 2007. We intend to renew the bank credit facility. At both September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, there were no amounts outstanding under the Canadian commercial paper program or the bank credit facility. Applicable interest rates on the credit facility at September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, were 4.65% and 4.25%, respectively. At September 3, 2006, standby letters of credit totaling $21 million issued under the bank credit facility left $33 million available for commercial paper support. At August 28, 2005, standby letters of credit totaling $23 million issued under the bank credit facility left $27 million available for commercial paper support. Our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary has a short term $13 million bank line of credit ($14 million at August 28, 2005) that expires in February 2007, which we intend to renew. At September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, $2.5 million and $6 million, respectively, were borrowed under the line of credit, and $4 million in both years was used to support standby letters of credit. A second $13 million bank line of credit also expires in February 2007, which we intend to renew. At September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, $0.9 million and $9 million, respectively, were borrowed under the second facility. Applicable interest rates on the credit facilities at September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, were 0.95% and 0.84%, respectively. Our Korean subsidiary has a short term $13 million bank line of credit, which expires in February 2007, and which we intend to renew. At September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, no amounts were borrowed under the line of credit and $2 million in both years was used to support standby letters of credit. Applicable interest rates on the credit facility at September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005 were 5.48% and 4.51%, respectively. Our Taiwan subsidiary has a $5 million bank revolving credit facility that expires in January 2007, which we intend to renew. At September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, no amounts were borrowed under the credit facility and $2 million and $3 million, respectively, were used to support standby letters of credit. A second $15 million bank revolving credit facility is in place, which expires in August 2007. At September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, no amounts were borrowed under the second credit facility and $2 million and $1 million, respectively, were used to support standby letters of credit. Applicable interest rates on the credit facility at September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, were 4.00% and 3.75%, respectively. Our wholly owned United Kingdom subsidiary has a $114 million bank revolving credit facility expiring in February 2007, and a $67 million bank overdraft facility renewable on a yearly basis in March 2007. We intend to renew both facilities. At September 3, 2006, $38 million was outstanding under the revolving credit facility with an applicable interest rate of 5.32% and no amounts were outstanding under the bank overdraft facility. At August 28, 2005, $40 million was outstanding under the revolving credit facility, with an applicable interest rate of 5.30%, and no amounts were outstanding under the bank overdraft facility. 25 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) On November 15, 2005, upon the expiration of our $150 million bank credit facility in the U.S. with a group of nine banks, we terminated our $500 million commercial paper program. At August 28, 2005, no amounts were outstanding under the commercial paper program and no amounts were outstanding under the credit facility. The applicable interest rate on the credit facility at August 28, 2005, was 3.92%. Letters of Credit We have letter of credit facilities (for commercial and standby letters of credit) totaling $400 million. The outstanding commitments under these facilities at September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005 totaled $85 million and $131 million, respectively, including $55 million and $65 million, respectively, in standby letters of credit. Financing Activities In April 2003, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.92% in the aggregate amount of $34 million, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due in April 2010. In March 2002, we issued $300 million of 5 1/2% Senior Notes, carried at $301 million, due in March 2007. Interest is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15. Simultaneous with the issuance of the 5 1/2% Senior Notes, we entered into interest rate swap agreements converting the interest to a floating rate indexed to LIBOR. We plan to repay the 5 1/2% Senior Notes at maturity from our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances. In February 1996, we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a shelf registration statement for $500 million of senior debt securities. In October 2001, additional debt securities of $100 million were registered. The $300 million of 5 1/2% Senior Notes issued in March 2002 reduced the amount of registered securities available for future issuance to $300 million. In April 2006, we cancelled the shelf registration. During fiscal 2006, $191 million in principal amount of our 3 1/2% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes were converted by note holders into 6.5 million shares of common stock. The current Notes outstanding are convertible into a maximum of 2,925,057 shares of Costco common stock at an initial conversion price of $22.71. Derivatives We have limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and use them only to manage well defined interest rate and foreign exchange risks. Forward foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on inventory purchases and typically have very short terms. The aggregate notional amount, which approximates the fair value of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, was $63 million and $42 million, respectively. The majority of the forward foreign exchange contracts were entered into by our wholly owned United Kingdom subsidiary, primarily to hedge U.S. dollar merchandise inventory purchases. We also hold interest rate swaps to manage the interest rate risk associated with our borrowings and the mix of fixed rate and variable rate debt. As of September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, we had fixed to floating interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $300 million and an aggregate fair value of $1 million and $8 million, respectively. These amounts were recorded in deferred income taxes and other current assets as of September 3, 2006 and in other assets as of 26 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) August 28, 2005, in our consolidated balance sheets. These swaps were entered into effective March 25, 2002, and are designated and qualify as fair value hedges of our $300 million 5 1/2% Senior Notes. As the terms of the swaps match those of the underlying hedged debt, the changes in the fair value of these swaps are offset by corresponding changes in the carrying amount of the hedged debt and result in no net earnings impact. We are exposed to market risk for changes in utility commodity pricing, which we partially mitigate through the use of firm price contracts with counterparties for approximately 19% of our locations in the U.S. and Canada. The effects of these arrangements are not significant for any period presented. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements With the exception of our operating leases, we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition or consolidated financial statements. Stock Repurchase Programs Our Board of Directors has approved the following stock repurchase programs (000s): AmountApproved AmountRemaining August 2005 $ 1,000,000 $ 0 January 2006(1) 1,000,000 625,534 July 2006(2) 2,000,000 2,000,000 Total $ 4,000,000 $ 2,625,534 (1) Expires in January 2009. (2) Expires in July 2009. During fiscal 2005, we repurchased 9.2 million shares of common stock, at an average price of $44.89, totaling approximately $413 million. During fiscal 2006, we repurchased 28.4 million shares at an average price of $51.44, totaling approximately $1.46 billion. The amount available to be purchased under the approved plans was approximately $2.63 billion at September 3, 2006. Purchases are made from time to time as conditions warrant in the open market or in block purchases, or pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5 1. Repurchased shares are retired. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our financial statements requires that management make estimates and judgments that affect the financial position and results of operations. Management continues to review its accounting policies and evaluate its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, merchandise inventory valuation, impairment of long lived assets, warehouse closing costs, insurance/self insurance liabilities, stock based compensation and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Revenue Recognition We recognize sales, net of estimated returns, at the time customers take possession of merchandise or receive services. When we collect payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of 27 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) merchandise or the performance of services, the amount received is recorded as deferred revenue on the balance sheet until the sale or service is completed. We provide for estimated sales returns based on historical returns levels. We evaluate the criteria of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal Versus Net as an Agent, in determining whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, when we are the primary obligor, subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, influence product or service specifications, or have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded on a gross basis. If we are not the primary obligor and do not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above, we record the net amounts as commissions earned, which is reflected in net sales. Membership fee revenue represents annual membership fees paid by substantially all of our members. We account for membership fee revenue on a deferred basis, whereby membership fee revenue is recognized ratably over one year. Our Executive members qualify for a 2% reward (which can be redeemed only at Costco warehouses), up to a maximum of $500 per year, on all qualified purchases made at Costco. We account for this 2% reward as a reduction in sales, with the related liability being classified within other current liabilities. Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, as determined primarily by the retail method of accounting, and are stated using the last in, first out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail method of accounting and are stated using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. We believe the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. We record an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the expected annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end. At both September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005 merchandise inventories valued at LIFO approximated FIFO after considering the lower of cost or market principle. We provide for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts as a percentage of net sales. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect the actual physical inventory count results, which generally occur in the second and fourth fiscal quarters of the fiscal year. Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as we progress toward earning those rebates, provided they are probable and reasonably estimable. Other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of agreement, or other systematic and rational approach. Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Warehouse Closing costs We periodically evaluate our long lived assets for indicators of impairment. Our judgments are based on existing market and operational conditions. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring an adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value. We provide estimates for warehouse closing costs based on applicable U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Future circumstances may result in actual closing costs or the amount recognized upon the sale of the property to differ substantially from the original estimates. 28 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Insurance/Self Insurance Liabilities We use a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance pool, to provide for potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property damage, director and officers liability, vehicle liability and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience and evaluations of outside expertise, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. StockBased Compensation We account for stockbased compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123R. We use the BlackScholes optionpricing model, which requires the input of subjective assumptions. These assumptions include: estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them (expected term); the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term (volatility), and the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements (forfeitures). Changes in these assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stockbased compensation. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, we ceased the granting of stock options in favor of restricted stock units. Income Taxes The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Significant judgment is required in assessing, among other things, the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items. We establish reserves when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable, we believe that certain positions may be successfully challenged. When facts and circumstances change, we adjust these reserves through our provision for income taxes. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in the Current Year Financial Statements (SAB 108). SAB 108 addresses how the effects of prior year uncorrected misstatements should be considered when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements. SAB 108 requires an entity to quantify misstatements using a balance sheet and income statement approach and to evaluate whether either approach results in quantifying an error that is material in light of relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. We early adopted SAB 108 as of August 29, 2005, the beginning of our fiscal year. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report for further discussion. In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157). SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements required under other accounting pronouncements but does not change existing guidance as to whether or not an instrument is carried at fair value. SFAS 157 is effective for our fiscal year 2008. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting SFAS 157. 29 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. FIN 48 is effective beginning in fiscal 2008. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting FIN 48. In June 2006, the FASB ratified the consensus reached on Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 06 03, How Sales Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities Should Be Presented in the Income Statement (that is, Gross Versus Net Presentation). The EITF reached a consensus that the presentation of taxes on either a gross or net basis is an accounting policy decision that requires disclosure. EITF 06 03 is effective for the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after December 15, 2006. Amounts collected from our members, which under common trade practices are referred to as sales taxes, are and have been recorded on a net basis. We have no intention of modifying this accounting policy. Therefore, the adoption of EITF 06 03 will not have any effect on our financial position or results of operations. In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, a Replacement of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 20, and FASB Statement No. 3. SFAS 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements for changes in accounting principles, unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change. SFAS 154 also requires that retrospective application of a change in accounting principle be limited to the direct effects of the change. Indirect effects of a change in accounting principle, such as a change in non discretionary profit sharing payments resulting from an accounting change, should be recognized in the period of the accounting change. SFAS 154 also requires that a change in depreciation, amortization, or depletion method for long lived, non financial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate effected by a change in accounting principle. SFAS 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. We will adopt the provisions of SFAS 154 beginning in fiscal 2007. We do not believe the adoption will have a significant effect on our future consolidated financial statements. 30 Table of Contents Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to financial market risk resulting from changes in interest and foreign currency rates. As a policy, we do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions, nor hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. The nature and amount of our long and short term debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As of September 3, 2006, our fixed rate long term debt included $129 million principal amount at maturity Zero Coupon Subordinated Notes carried at $88 million and additional notes and capital lease obligations totaling $135 million. Our debt also includes $300 million 51/2% Senior Notes carried at $301 million. We entered into fixed to floating interest rate swaps on the Senior Notes, effectively converting these fixed interest rate securities to variable rate securities. As of September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, we had fixed to floating interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $300 million and an aggregate fair value of $1 million and $8 million, respectively. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt and may affect the interest expense related to the variable rate debt. We hold interest bearing instruments that are classified as cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. Our investment policy is to manage our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances to preserve principal and liquidity, while seeking to maximize the return on our investment portfolio through the full investment of available funds. We diversify our investment portfolio by investing in multiple types of investment grade securities and through a combination of internal and third party investment management. Short term investments generally have a maturity of three months to five years from the purchase date. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. As the majority of these instruments are of a short term nature, if interest rates were to increase or decrease, there is no material risk of a valuation adjustment related to these instruments. For those instruments that are classified as available for sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in interest rates are reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss. Based on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances at September 3, 2006, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $9 million to interest income (pre tax) on an annual basis. Most transactions of our foreign subsidiaries are conducted in local currencies, limiting our exposure to changes in currency rates. We periodically enter into short term forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates on inventory purchases. The notional value of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at September 3, 2006 was $62 million. 31 Table of Contents 
 
Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Interest Expense Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 Fiscal 2004 Interest expense $ 12,570 $ 34,437 $ 36,651 2006 vs. 2005 Interest expense totaled $12.6 million in fiscal 2006, compared to $34.4 million in fiscal 2005. Interest expense in fiscal 2006 primarily included interest on the 5 1/2% Senior Notes, the 3 1/2% Zero Coupon Notes, and balances outstanding under our bank credit facilities and promissory notes. In fiscal 2005, interest expense also included interest on the 7 1/8% Senior Notes. The decrease in interest expense in fiscal 2006 resulted primarily from the repayment of the 7 1/8% Senior Notes in June 2005. In addition, interest expense decreased on the 3 1/2% Zero Coupon Notes as note holders converted approximately $190.9 million in principal amount of the Notes into common stock. The amount of interest capitalized increased in fiscal 2006, contributing to the decrease in interest expense, as both interest rates and the dollar amount of projects under construction increased. The overall decrease in interest expense in fiscal 2006 was partially offset by the increase in interest rates on the 5 1/2% Senior Notes, which were swapped into variable rate debt in March 2002. 2005 vs. 2004 Interest expense totaled $34.4 million in fiscal 2005, compared to $36.7 million in fiscal 2004. Interest expense in both fiscal 2005 and 2004 included interest on the 3 1/2% Zero Coupon Notes, the 7 1/8% and 5 1/2% Senior Notes, and on balances outstanding under our bank credit facilities and promissory notes. The decrease was primarily a result of a decrease in interest on our 3 1/2% Zero Coupon Notes as note holders converted approximately $280.8 million in principle amount of the Notes into common stock during fiscal 2005. Additionally, capitalized interest increased year over year as interest rates and construction costs increased in fiscal 2005 over fiscal 2004. These decreases were partially offset by increases in interest on the Senior Notes as these fixed rate instruments were swapped into variable rate debt in November 2001 and March 2002, which was mitigated by the fact that the 7 1/8% Senior Notes matured and were repaid on June 15, 2005. Interest Income and Other Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 Fiscal 2004 Interest income and other $ 138,355 $ 109,096 $ 51,627 2006 vs. 2005 Interest income and other totaled $138.4 million in fiscal 2006, compared to $109.1 million in fiscal 2005. This increase primarily reflects increased interest income resulting from higher interest rates earned, as well as an extra week in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005. 2005 vs. 2004 Interest income and other totaled $109.1 million in fiscal 2005, compared to $51.6 million in fiscal 2004. The increase primarily reflects increased interest income resulting from higher cash and cash equivalents balances and short term investments on hand throughout fiscal 2005, as well as higher interest rates earned on the balances as compared to fiscal 2004. 21 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Provision for Income Taxes Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 Fiscal 2004 Income tax expense $ 648,202 $ 485,870 $ 518,231 Effective tax rate 37.01 % 31.37 % 37.00 % The effective income tax rate on earnings in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004 was 37.01%, 31.37% and 37.00%, respectively. The low rate in fiscal 2005 was primarily attributable to a non recurring $54.2 million income tax benefit resulting primarily from the settlement of a transfer pricing dispute between the United States and Canada (covering the years 1996 2003) and a net tax benefit on excess foreign tax credits on unremitted foreign earnings of $20.6 million. Excluding these benefits the effective income tax rate on earnings in fiscal 2005 would have been 36.2%. Net Income Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 Fiscal 2004 Net income $ 1,103,215 $ 1,063,092 $ 882,393 Net income increase 3.8 % 20.5 % 22.4 % Net income as a percentage of net sales 1.87 % 2.05 % 1.87 % Diluted earnings per share $ 2.30 $ 2.18 $ 1.85 Shares used to calculate diluted earnings per share 480,341 492,035 482,459 Diluted earnings per share increase 6 % 18 % 21 % 2006 vs. 2005 Net income for fiscal 2006 increased 3.8%, to $1.10 billion or $2.30 per diluted share, from $1.06 billion or $2.18 per diluted share, during fiscal 2005. The fiscal 2005 results included several non recurring items that in the aggregate positively impacted reported earnings for all of fiscal 2005 by approximately $0.14 per share: a $54.2 million (approximately $0.11 per diluted share) income tax benefit resulting primarily from the settlement of a transfer pricing dispute between the United States and Canada; a cumulative pre tax, non cash charge to preopening expenses of $16.0 million (approximately $0.02 per diluted share) related to a correction to our method of accounting for ground leases; and a net tax benefit with respect to excess foreign tax credits on unremitted foreign earnings recorded in the fourth quarter of $20.6 million (approximately $0.04 per diluted share). Exclusive of these items, fiscal 2005 earnings were $2.04 per diluted share. Fiscal 2006s earnings per diluted share represents an increase of 13% over that figure. 2005 vs. 2004 Net Income Net income for fiscal 2005 increased 20.5% to $1.06 billion, or $2.18 per diluted share, from $882.4 million, or $1.85 per diluted share, during fiscal year 2004. As discussed above, the fiscal 2005 results included several non recurring items that in the aggregate positively impacted reported earnings for all of fiscal 2005 by approximately $0.14 per share. Exclusive of these items, fiscal 2005 earnings were $2.04 per diluted share, which represents an increase of 10% over fiscal 2004 earnings per diluted share. 22 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (dollars in thousands, except per share amounts) The following table itemizes components of our most liquid assets: September 3,2006 August 28,2005 Cash and cash equivalents $ 1,510,939 $ 2,062,585 Short term investments 1,322,181 1,397,272 Total $ 2,833,120 $ 3,459,857 Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from warehouse operations and our existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances, which were $2.83 billion and $3.46 billion at September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, respectively. Of these balances, approximately $594 million and $522 million at September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, respectively, represented debit and credit card receivables, primarily related to weekend sales immediately prior to the year end close. The decrease in our most liquid assets of $627 million to $2.83 billion at September 3, 2006 was due primarily to the repurchase of our common stock, the acquisition of property and equipment related to warehouse expansion and the payment of cash dividends. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $1.83 billion in fiscal 2006 compared to $1.78 billion in fiscal 2005, an increase of $51 million. This increase is attributable to higher net income and an increase in cash flow from operating assets and liabilities of $338 million, offset by an increase in net merchandise inventories (merchandise inventory less accounts payable) of $388 million. Net cash used in investing activities totaled $1.15 billion in fiscal 2006 compared to $2.05 billion in fiscal 2005. The decrease relates primarily to a decrease in the net investment in short term investments of $1.16 billion, offset by an increase of $217 million in additions to property and equipment related to warehouse expansion and remodel projects. The decrease in the net investment in short term investments was due primarily to our stock repurchase activity. Net cash used in financing activities totaled $1.23 billion in fiscal 2006 compared to $519 million in fiscal 2005. The increase of $715 million primarily resulted from the repurchase of common stock in fiscal 2006, which used $1.44 billion of cash, compared to $413 million in fiscal 2005. In addition, $304 million was used in fiscal 2005 for the repayment of the 7 1/8% Senior Notes. Dividends In April 2006, our quarterly cash dividend was increased from $0.115 to $0.13 per share. Our cash dividends paid in fiscal 2006 totaled $0.49 per share. In fiscal 2005, we paid quarterly cash dividends totaling $0.43 per share. Our current quarterly dividend rate is $0.13 per share or $0.52 per share on an annualized basis. 23 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Contractual Obligations Our commitments at year end to make future payments under contractual obligations were as follows, as of September 3, 2006: Payments Due by Period Contractual obligations Total Less than 1 year 1 to 3 years 4 to 5 years After 5 years Long term debt(1) $ 523,391 $ 317,959 $ 57,358 $ 60,046 $ 88,028 Capital lease obligations and other(1) 20,928 8,152 4,666 2,034 6,076 Operating leases(2) 1,647,683 130,259 237,373 200,052 1,079,999 Purchase obligations (merchandise)(3) 3,538,948 3,538,096 852 Purchase obligations (building, equipment, services and other)(4) 385,650 350,721 29,563 5,366 Other(5) 11,809 1,703 2,852 2,692 4,562 Total $ 6,128,409 $ 4,346,890 $ 332,664 $ 270,190 $ 1,178,665 (1) Amounts include contractual interest payments. (2) Operating lease obligations have been reduced by $162,120 to reflect sub lease income. (3) Includes open merchandise purchase orders. (4) The amounts exclude minor outsourced services negotiated at the individual warehouse level that are not significant and generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty. (5) Consists of asset retirement and deferred compensation obligations. Expansion Plans Our primary requirement for capital is the domestic and international financing of the land, building and equipment costs for new and remodeled warehouses plus the costs of initial warehouse operations and working capital requirements. While there can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized, and plans are subject to change upon further review, it is managements current intention to spend approximately $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion during fiscal 2007 for real estate, construction, remodeling and equipment for warehouse clubs and related operations. These expenditures are expected to be financed with a combination of cash provided from operations and the use of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. Plans for the United States and Canada during fiscal 2007 are to open approximately 33 to 35 new warehouses on a net basis, inclusive of one to two relocations. We expect to continue our review of expansion plans in our international operations, including the United Kingdom and Asia, along with other international markets. At present, we are planning to open one additional warehouse in the United Kingdom during fiscal 2007. Costco Mexico plans to open one to two new warehouses during fiscal 2007. 24 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Additional Equity Investments in Subsidiaries and Joint Ventures During fiscal 2006 and 2005, we contributed an additional $15 million each year to our investment in Costco Mexico (a 50% owned joint venture), which did not impact our percentage ownership of this entity, as our joint venture partner contributed a like amount. In addition, in fiscal 2005, we acquired the remaining 4% interest in CWC Travel Inc. for $4 million, bringing our ownership in this entity to 100%. Bank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs (all amounts stated in U.S. dollars) A wholly owned Canadian subsidiary has a $181 million commercial paper program ($167 million at August 28, 2005) supported by a $54 million bank credit facility ($50 million at August 28, 2005) with a Canadian bank, which we guarantee and which expires in March 2007. We intend to renew the bank credit facility. At both September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, there were no amounts outstanding under the Canadian commercial paper program or the bank credit facility. Applicable interest rates on the credit facility at September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, were 4.65% and 4.25%, respectively. At September 3, 2006, standby letters of credit totaling $21 million issued under the bank credit facility left $33 million available for commercial paper support. At August 28, 2005, standby letters of credit totaling $23 million issued under the bank credit facility left $27 million available for commercial paper support. Our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary has a short term $13 million bank line of credit ($14 million at August 28, 2005) that expires in February 2007, which we intend to renew. At September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, $2.5 million and $6 million, respectively, were borrowed under the line of credit, and $4 million in both years was used to support standby letters of credit. A second $13 million bank line of credit also expires in February 2007, which we intend to renew. At September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, $0.9 million and $9 million, respectively, were borrowed under the second facility. Applicable interest rates on the credit facilities at September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, were 0.95% and 0.84%, respectively. Our Korean subsidiary has a short term $13 million bank line of credit, which expires in February 2007, and which we intend to renew. At September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, no amounts were borrowed under the line of credit and $2 million in both years was used to support standby letters of credit. Applicable interest rates on the credit facility at September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005 were 5.48% and 4.51%, respectively. Our Taiwan subsidiary has a $5 million bank revolving credit facility that expires in January 2007, which we intend to renew. At September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, no amounts were borrowed under the credit facility and $2 million and $3 million, respectively, were used to support standby letters of credit. A second $15 million bank revolving credit facility is in place, which expires in August 2007. At September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, no amounts were borrowed under the second credit facility and $2 million and $1 million, respectively, were used to support standby letters of credit. Applicable interest rates on the credit facility at September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, were 4.00% and 3.75%, respectively. Our wholly owned United Kingdom subsidiary has a $114 million bank revolving credit facility expiring in February 2007, and a $67 million bank overdraft facility renewable on a yearly basis in March 2007. We intend to renew both facilities. At September 3, 2006, $38 million was outstanding under the revolving credit facility with an applicable interest rate of 5.32% and no amounts were outstanding under the bank overdraft facility. At August 28, 2005, $40 million was outstanding under the revolving credit facility, with an applicable interest rate of 5.30%, and no amounts were outstanding under the bank overdraft facility. 25 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) On November 15, 2005, upon the expiration of our $150 million bank credit facility in the U.S. with a group of nine banks, we terminated our $500 million commercial paper program. At August 28, 2005, no amounts were outstanding under the commercial paper program and no amounts were outstanding under the credit facility. The applicable interest rate on the credit facility at August 28, 2005, was 3.92%. Letters of Credit We have letter of credit facilities (for commercial and standby letters of credit) totaling $400 million. The outstanding commitments under these facilities at September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005 totaled $85 million and $131 million, respectively, including $55 million and $65 million, respectively, in standby letters of credit. Financing Activities In April 2003, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.92% in the aggregate amount of $34 million, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due in April 2010. In March 2002, we issued $300 million of 5 1/2% Senior Notes, carried at $301 million, due in March 2007. Interest is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15. Simultaneous with the issuance of the 5 1/2% Senior Notes, we entered into interest rate swap agreements converting the interest to a floating rate indexed to LIBOR. We plan to repay the 5 1/2% Senior Notes at maturity from our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances. In February 1996, we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a shelf registration statement for $500 million of senior debt securities. In October 2001, additional debt securities of $100 million were registered. The $300 million of 5 1/2% Senior Notes issued in March 2002 reduced the amount of registered securities available for future issuance to $300 million. In April 2006, we cancelled the shelf registration. During fiscal 2006, $191 million in principal amount of our 3 1/2% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes were converted by note holders into 6.5 million shares of common stock. The current Notes outstanding are convertible into a maximum of 2,925,057 shares of Costco common stock at an initial conversion price of $22.71. Derivatives We have limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and use them only to manage well defined interest rate and foreign exchange risks. Forward foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on inventory purchases and typically have very short terms. The aggregate notional amount, which approximates the fair value of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, was $63 million and $42 million, respectively. The majority of the forward foreign exchange contracts were entered into by our wholly owned United Kingdom subsidiary, primarily to hedge U.S. dollar merchandise inventory purchases. We also hold interest rate swaps to manage the interest rate risk associated with our borrowings and the mix of fixed rate and variable rate debt. As of September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, we had fixed to floating interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $300 million and an aggregate fair value of $1 million and $8 million, respectively. These amounts were recorded in deferred income taxes and other current assets as of September 3, 2006 and in other assets as of 26 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) August 28, 2005, in our consolidated balance sheets. These swaps were entered into effective March 25, 2002, and are designated and qualify as fair value hedges of our $300 million 5 1/2% Senior Notes. As the terms of the swaps match those of the underlying hedged debt, the changes in the fair value of these swaps are offset by corresponding changes in the carrying amount of the hedged debt and result in no net earnings impact. We are exposed to market risk for changes in utility commodity pricing, which we partially mitigate through the use of firm price contracts with counterparties for approximately 19% of our locations in the U.S. and Canada. The effects of these arrangements are not significant for any period presented. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements With the exception of our operating leases, we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition or consolidated financial statements. Stock Repurchase Programs Our Board of Directors has approved the following stock repurchase programs (000s): AmountApproved AmountRemaining August 2005 $ 1,000,000 $ 0 January 2006(1) 1,000,000 625,534 July 2006(2) 2,000,000 2,000,000 Total $ 4,000,000 $ 2,625,534 (1) Expires in January 2009. (2) Expires in July 2009. During fiscal 2005, we repurchased 9.2 million shares of common stock, at an average price of $44.89, totaling approximately $413 million. During fiscal 2006, we repurchased 28.4 million shares at an average price of $51.44, totaling approximately $1.46 billion. The amount available to be purchased under the approved plans was approximately $2.63 billion at September 3, 2006. Purchases are made from time to time as conditions warrant in the open market or in block purchases, or pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5 1. Repurchased shares are retired. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our financial statements requires that management make estimates and judgments that affect the financial position and results of operations. Management continues to review its accounting policies and evaluate its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, merchandise inventory valuation, impairment of long lived assets, warehouse closing costs, insurance/self insurance liabilities, stock based compensation and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Revenue Recognition We recognize sales, net of estimated returns, at the time customers take possession of merchandise or receive services. When we collect payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of 27 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) merchandise or the performance of services, the amount received is recorded as deferred revenue on the balance sheet until the sale or service is completed. We provide for estimated sales returns based on historical returns levels. We evaluate the criteria of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal Versus Net as an Agent, in determining whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, when we are the primary obligor, subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, influence product or service specifications, or have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded on a gross basis. If we are not the primary obligor and do not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above, we record the net amounts as commissions earned, which is reflected in net sales. Membership fee revenue represents annual membership fees paid by substantially all of our members. We account for membership fee revenue on a deferred basis, whereby membership fee revenue is recognized ratably over one year. Our Executive members qualify for a 2% reward (which can be redeemed only at Costco warehouses), up to a maximum of $500 per year, on all qualified purchases made at Costco. We account for this 2% reward as a reduction in sales, with the related liability being classified within other current liabilities. Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, as determined primarily by the retail method of accounting, and are stated using the last in, first out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail method of accounting and are stated using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. We believe the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. We record an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the expected annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end. At both September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005 merchandise inventories valued at LIFO approximated FIFO after considering the lower of cost or market principle. We provide for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts as a percentage of net sales. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect the actual physical inventory count results, which generally occur in the second and fourth fiscal quarters of the fiscal year. Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as we progress toward earning those rebates, provided they are probable and reasonably estimable. Other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of agreement, or other systematic and rational approach. Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Warehouse Closing costs We periodically evaluate our long lived assets for indicators of impairment. Our judgments are based on existing market and operational conditions. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring an adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value. We provide estimates for warehouse closing costs based on applicable U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Future circumstances may result in actual closing costs or the amount recognized upon the sale of the property to differ substantially from the original estimates. 28 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Insurance/Self Insurance Liabilities We use a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance pool, to provide for potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property damage, director and officers liability, vehicle liability and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience and evaluations of outside expertise, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. StockBased Compensation We account for stockbased compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123R. We use the BlackScholes optionpricing model, which requires the input of subjective assumptions. These assumptions include: estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them (expected term); the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term (volatility), and the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements (forfeitures). Changes in these assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stockbased compensation. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, we ceased the granting of stock options in favor of restricted stock units. Income Taxes The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Significant judgment is required in assessing, among other things, the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items. We establish reserves when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable, we believe that certain positions may be successfully challenged. When facts and circumstances change, we adjust these reserves through our provision for income taxes. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in the Current Year Financial Statements (SAB 108). SAB 108 addresses how the effects of prior year uncorrected misstatements should be considered when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements. SAB 108 requires an entity to quantify misstatements using a balance sheet and income statement approach and to evaluate whether either approach results in quantifying an error that is material in light of relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. We early adopted SAB 108 as of August 29, 2005, the beginning of our fiscal year. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report for further discussion. In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157). SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements required under other accounting pronouncements but does not change existing guidance as to whether or not an instrument is carried at fair value. SFAS 157 is effective for our fiscal year 2008. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting SFAS 157. 29 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. FIN 48 is effective beginning in fiscal 2008. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting FIN 48. In June 2006, the FASB ratified the consensus reached on Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 06 03, How Sales Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities Should Be Presented in the Income Statement (that is, Gross Versus Net Presentation). The EITF reached a consensus that the presentation of taxes on either a gross or net basis is an accounting policy decision that requires disclosure. EITF 06 03 is effective for the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after December 15, 2006. Amounts collected from our members, which under common trade practices are referred to as sales taxes, are and have been recorded on a net basis. We have no intention of modifying this accounting policy. Therefore, the adoption of EITF 06 03 will not have any effect on our financial position or results of operations. In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, a Replacement of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 20, and FASB Statement No. 3. SFAS 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements for changes in accounting principles, unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change. SFAS 154 also requires that retrospective application of a change in accounting principle be limited to the direct effects of the change. Indirect effects of a change in accounting principle, such as a change in non discretionary profit sharing payments resulting from an accounting change, should be recognized in the period of the accounting change. SFAS 154 also requires that a change in depreciation, amortization, or depletion method for long lived, non financial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate effected by a change in accounting principle. SFAS 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. We will adopt the provisions of SFAS 154 beginning in fiscal 2007. We do not believe the adoption will have a significant effect on our future consolidated financial statements. 30 Table of Contents Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to financial market risk resulting from changes in interest and foreign currency rates. As a policy, we do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions, nor hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. The nature and amount of our long and short term debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As of September 3, 2006, our fixed rate long term debt included $129 million principal amount at maturity Zero Coupon Subordinated Notes carried at $88 million and additional notes and capital lease obligations totaling $135 million. Our debt also includes $300 million 51/2% Senior Notes carried at $301 million. We entered into fixed to floating interest rate swaps on the Senior Notes, effectively converting these fixed interest rate securities to variable rate securities. As of September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, we had fixed to floating interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $300 million and an aggregate fair value of $1 million and $8 million, respectively. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt and may affect the interest expense related to the variable rate debt. We hold interest bearing instruments that are classified as cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. Our investment policy is to manage our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances to preserve principal and liquidity, while seeking to maximize the return on our investment portfolio through the full investment of available funds. We diversify our investment portfolio by investing in multiple types of investment grade securities and through a combination of internal and third party investment management. Short term investments generally have a maturity of three months to five years from the purchase date. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. As the majority of these instruments are of a short term nature, if interest rates were to increase or decrease, there is no material risk of a valuation adjustment related to these instruments. For those instruments that are classified as available for sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in interest rates are reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss. Based on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances at September 3, 2006, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $9 million to interest income (pre tax) on an annual basis. Most transactions of our foreign subsidiaries are conducted in local currencies, limiting our exposure to changes in currency rates. We periodically enter into short term forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates on inventory purchases. The notional value of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at September 3, 2006 was $62 million. 31 Table of Contents 
 
Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Provision for Income Taxes Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 Fiscal 2004 Income tax expense $ 648,202 $ 485,870 $ 518,231 Effective tax rate 37.01 % 31.37 % 37.00 % The effective income tax rate on earnings in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004 was 37.01%, 31.37% and 37.00%, respectively. The low rate in fiscal 2005 was primarily attributable to a non recurring $54.2 million income tax benefit resulting primarily from the settlement of a transfer pricing dispute between the United States and Canada (covering the years 1996 2003) and a net tax benefit on excess foreign tax credits on unremitted foreign earnings of $20.6 million. Excluding these benefits the effective income tax rate on earnings in fiscal 2005 would have been 36.2%. Net Income Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 Fiscal 2004 Net income $ 1,103,215 $ 1,063,092 $ 882,393 Net income increase 3.8 % 20.5 % 22.4 % Net income as a percentage of net sales 1.87 % 2.05 % 1.87 % Diluted earnings per share $ 2.30 $ 2.18 $ 1.85 Shares used to calculate diluted earnings per share 480,341 492,035 482,459 Diluted earnings per share increase 6 % 18 % 21 % 2006 vs. 2005 Net income for fiscal 2006 increased 3.8%, to $1.10 billion or $2.30 per diluted share, from $1.06 billion or $2.18 per diluted share, during fiscal 2005. The fiscal 2005 results included several non recurring items that in the aggregate positively impacted reported earnings for all of fiscal 2005 by approximately $0.14 per share: a $54.2 million (approximately $0.11 per diluted share) income tax benefit resulting primarily from the settlement of a transfer pricing dispute between the United States and Canada; a cumulative pre tax, non cash charge to preopening expenses of $16.0 million (approximately $0.02 per diluted share) related to a correction to our method of accounting for ground leases; and a net tax benefit with respect to excess foreign tax credits on unremitted foreign earnings recorded in the fourth quarter of $20.6 million (approximately $0.04 per diluted share). Exclusive of these items, fiscal 2005 earnings were $2.04 per diluted share. Fiscal 2006s earnings per diluted share represents an increase of 13% over that figure. 2005 vs. 2004 Net Income Net income for fiscal 2005 increased 20.5% to $1.06 billion, or $2.18 per diluted share, from $882.4 million, or $1.85 per diluted share, during fiscal year 2004. As discussed above, the fiscal 2005 results included several non recurring items that in the aggregate positively impacted reported earnings for all of fiscal 2005 by approximately $0.14 per share. Exclusive of these items, fiscal 2005 earnings were $2.04 per diluted share, which represents an increase of 10% over fiscal 2004 earnings per diluted share. 22 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (dollars in thousands, except per share amounts) The following table itemizes components of our most liquid assets: September 3,2006 August 28,2005 Cash and cash equivalents $ 1,510,939 $ 2,062,585 Short term investments 1,322,181 1,397,272 Total $ 2,833,120 $ 3,459,857 Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from warehouse operations and our existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances, which were $2.83 billion and $3.46 billion at September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, respectively. Of these balances, approximately $594 million and $522 million at September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, respectively, represented debit and credit card receivables, primarily related to weekend sales immediately prior to the year end close. The decrease in our most liquid assets of $627 million to $2.83 billion at September 3, 2006 was due primarily to the repurchase of our common stock, the acquisition of property and equipment related to warehouse expansion and the payment of cash dividends. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $1.83 billion in fiscal 2006 compared to $1.78 billion in fiscal 2005, an increase of $51 million. This increase is attributable to higher net income and an increase in cash flow from operating assets and liabilities of $338 million, offset by an increase in net merchandise inventories (merchandise inventory less accounts payable) of $388 million. Net cash used in investing activities totaled $1.15 billion in fiscal 2006 compared to $2.05 billion in fiscal 2005. The decrease relates primarily to a decrease in the net investment in short term investments of $1.16 billion, offset by an increase of $217 million in additions to property and equipment related to warehouse expansion and remodel projects. The decrease in the net investment in short term investments was due primarily to our stock repurchase activity. Net cash used in financing activities totaled $1.23 billion in fiscal 2006 compared to $519 million in fiscal 2005. The increase of $715 million primarily resulted from the repurchase of common stock in fiscal 2006, which used $1.44 billion of cash, compared to $413 million in fiscal 2005. In addition, $304 million was used in fiscal 2005 for the repayment of the 7 1/8% Senior Notes. Dividends In April 2006, our quarterly cash dividend was increased from $0.115 to $0.13 per share. Our cash dividends paid in fiscal 2006 totaled $0.49 per share. In fiscal 2005, we paid quarterly cash dividends totaling $0.43 per share. Our current quarterly dividend rate is $0.13 per share or $0.52 per share on an annualized basis. 23 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Contractual Obligations Our commitments at year end to make future payments under contractual obligations were as follows, as of September 3, 2006: Payments Due by Period Contractual obligations Total Less than 1 year 1 to 3 years 4 to 5 years After 5 years Long term debt(1) $ 523,391 $ 317,959 $ 57,358 $ 60,046 $ 88,028 Capital lease obligations and other(1) 20,928 8,152 4,666 2,034 6,076 Operating leases(2) 1,647,683 130,259 237,373 200,052 1,079,999 Purchase obligations (merchandise)(3) 3,538,948 3,538,096 852 Purchase obligations (building, equipment, services and other)(4) 385,650 350,721 29,563 5,366 Other(5) 11,809 1,703 2,852 2,692 4,562 Total $ 6,128,409 $ 4,346,890 $ 332,664 $ 270,190 $ 1,178,665 (1) Amounts include contractual interest payments. (2) Operating lease obligations have been reduced by $162,120 to reflect sub lease income. (3) Includes open merchandise purchase orders. (4) The amounts exclude minor outsourced services negotiated at the individual warehouse level that are not significant and generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty. (5) Consists of asset retirement and deferred compensation obligations. Expansion Plans Our primary requirement for capital is the domestic and international financing of the land, building and equipment costs for new and remodeled warehouses plus the costs of initial warehouse operations and working capital requirements. While there can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized, and plans are subject to change upon further review, it is managements current intention to spend approximately $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion during fiscal 2007 for real estate, construction, remodeling and equipment for warehouse clubs and related operations. These expenditures are expected to be financed with a combination of cash provided from operations and the use of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. Plans for the United States and Canada during fiscal 2007 are to open approximately 33 to 35 new warehouses on a net basis, inclusive of one to two relocations. We expect to continue our review of expansion plans in our international operations, including the United Kingdom and Asia, along with other international markets. At present, we are planning to open one additional warehouse in the United Kingdom during fiscal 2007. Costco Mexico plans to open one to two new warehouses during fiscal 2007. 24 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Additional Equity Investments in Subsidiaries and Joint Ventures During fiscal 2006 and 2005, we contributed an additional $15 million each year to our investment in Costco Mexico (a 50% owned joint venture), which did not impact our percentage ownership of this entity, as our joint venture partner contributed a like amount. In addition, in fiscal 2005, we acquired the remaining 4% interest in CWC Travel Inc. for $4 million, bringing our ownership in this entity to 100%. Bank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs (all amounts stated in U.S. dollars) A wholly owned Canadian subsidiary has a $181 million commercial paper program ($167 million at August 28, 2005) supported by a $54 million bank credit facility ($50 million at August 28, 2005) with a Canadian bank, which we guarantee and which expires in March 2007. We intend to renew the bank credit facility. At both September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, there were no amounts outstanding under the Canadian commercial paper program or the bank credit facility. Applicable interest rates on the credit facility at September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, were 4.65% and 4.25%, respectively. At September 3, 2006, standby letters of credit totaling $21 million issued under the bank credit facility left $33 million available for commercial paper support. At August 28, 2005, standby letters of credit totaling $23 million issued under the bank credit facility left $27 million available for commercial paper support. Our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary has a short term $13 million bank line of credit ($14 million at August 28, 2005) that expires in February 2007, which we intend to renew. At September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, $2.5 million and $6 million, respectively, were borrowed under the line of credit, and $4 million in both years was used to support standby letters of credit. A second $13 million bank line of credit also expires in February 2007, which we intend to renew. At September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, $0.9 million and $9 million, respectively, were borrowed under the second facility. Applicable interest rates on the credit facilities at September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, were 0.95% and 0.84%, respectively. Our Korean subsidiary has a short term $13 million bank line of credit, which expires in February 2007, and which we intend to renew. At September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, no amounts were borrowed under the line of credit and $2 million in both years was used to support standby letters of credit. Applicable interest rates on the credit facility at September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005 were 5.48% and 4.51%, respectively. Our Taiwan subsidiary has a $5 million bank revolving credit facility that expires in January 2007, which we intend to renew. At September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, no amounts were borrowed under the credit facility and $2 million and $3 million, respectively, were used to support standby letters of credit. A second $15 million bank revolving credit facility is in place, which expires in August 2007. At September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, no amounts were borrowed under the second credit facility and $2 million and $1 million, respectively, were used to support standby letters of credit. Applicable interest rates on the credit facility at September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, were 4.00% and 3.75%, respectively. Our wholly owned United Kingdom subsidiary has a $114 million bank revolving credit facility expiring in February 2007, and a $67 million bank overdraft facility renewable on a yearly basis in March 2007. We intend to renew both facilities. At September 3, 2006, $38 million was outstanding under the revolving credit facility with an applicable interest rate of 5.32% and no amounts were outstanding under the bank overdraft facility. At August 28, 2005, $40 million was outstanding under the revolving credit facility, with an applicable interest rate of 5.30%, and no amounts were outstanding under the bank overdraft facility. 25 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) On November 15, 2005, upon the expiration of our $150 million bank credit facility in the U.S. with a group of nine banks, we terminated our $500 million commercial paper program. At August 28, 2005, no amounts were outstanding under the commercial paper program and no amounts were outstanding under the credit facility. The applicable interest rate on the credit facility at August 28, 2005, was 3.92%. Letters of Credit We have letter of credit facilities (for commercial and standby letters of credit) totaling $400 million. The outstanding commitments under these facilities at September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005 totaled $85 million and $131 million, respectively, including $55 million and $65 million, respectively, in standby letters of credit. Financing Activities In April 2003, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.92% in the aggregate amount of $34 million, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due in April 2010. In March 2002, we issued $300 million of 5 1/2% Senior Notes, carried at $301 million, due in March 2007. Interest is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15. Simultaneous with the issuance of the 5 1/2% Senior Notes, we entered into interest rate swap agreements converting the interest to a floating rate indexed to LIBOR. We plan to repay the 5 1/2% Senior Notes at maturity from our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances. In February 1996, we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a shelf registration statement for $500 million of senior debt securities. In October 2001, additional debt securities of $100 million were registered. The $300 million of 5 1/2% Senior Notes issued in March 2002 reduced the amount of registered securities available for future issuance to $300 million. In April 2006, we cancelled the shelf registration. During fiscal 2006, $191 million in principal amount of our 3 1/2% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes were converted by note holders into 6.5 million shares of common stock. The current Notes outstanding are convertible into a maximum of 2,925,057 shares of Costco common stock at an initial conversion price of $22.71. Derivatives We have limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and use them only to manage well defined interest rate and foreign exchange risks. Forward foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on inventory purchases and typically have very short terms. The aggregate notional amount, which approximates the fair value of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, was $63 million and $42 million, respectively. The majority of the forward foreign exchange contracts were entered into by our wholly owned United Kingdom subsidiary, primarily to hedge U.S. dollar merchandise inventory purchases. We also hold interest rate swaps to manage the interest rate risk associated with our borrowings and the mix of fixed rate and variable rate debt. As of September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, we had fixed to floating interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $300 million and an aggregate fair value of $1 million and $8 million, respectively. These amounts were recorded in deferred income taxes and other current assets as of September 3, 2006 and in other assets as of 26 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) August 28, 2005, in our consolidated balance sheets. These swaps were entered into effective March 25, 2002, and are designated and qualify as fair value hedges of our $300 million 5 1/2% Senior Notes. As the terms of the swaps match those of the underlying hedged debt, the changes in the fair value of these swaps are offset by corresponding changes in the carrying amount of the hedged debt and result in no net earnings impact. We are exposed to market risk for changes in utility commodity pricing, which we partially mitigate through the use of firm price contracts with counterparties for approximately 19% of our locations in the U.S. and Canada. The effects of these arrangements are not significant for any period presented. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements With the exception of our operating leases, we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition or consolidated financial statements. Stock Repurchase Programs Our Board of Directors has approved the following stock repurchase programs (000s): AmountApproved AmountRemaining August 2005 $ 1,000,000 $ 0 January 2006(1) 1,000,000 625,534 July 2006(2) 2,000,000 2,000,000 Total $ 4,000,000 $ 2,625,534 (1) Expires in January 2009. (2) Expires in July 2009. During fiscal 2005, we repurchased 9.2 million shares of common stock, at an average price of $44.89, totaling approximately $413 million. During fiscal 2006, we repurchased 28.4 million shares at an average price of $51.44, totaling approximately $1.46 billion. The amount available to be purchased under the approved plans was approximately $2.63 billion at September 3, 2006. Purchases are made from time to time as conditions warrant in the open market or in block purchases, or pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5 1. Repurchased shares are retired. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our financial statements requires that management make estimates and judgments that affect the financial position and results of operations. Management continues to review its accounting policies and evaluate its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, merchandise inventory valuation, impairment of long lived assets, warehouse closing costs, insurance/self insurance liabilities, stock based compensation and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Revenue Recognition We recognize sales, net of estimated returns, at the time customers take possession of merchandise or receive services. When we collect payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of 27 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) merchandise or the performance of services, the amount received is recorded as deferred revenue on the balance sheet until the sale or service is completed. We provide for estimated sales returns based on historical returns levels. We evaluate the criteria of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal Versus Net as an Agent, in determining whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, when we are the primary obligor, subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, influence product or service specifications, or have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded on a gross basis. If we are not the primary obligor and do not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above, we record the net amounts as commissions earned, which is reflected in net sales. Membership fee revenue represents annual membership fees paid by substantially all of our members. We account for membership fee revenue on a deferred basis, whereby membership fee revenue is recognized ratably over one year. Our Executive members qualify for a 2% reward (which can be redeemed only at Costco warehouses), up to a maximum of $500 per year, on all qualified purchases made at Costco. We account for this 2% reward as a reduction in sales, with the related liability being classified within other current liabilities. Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, as determined primarily by the retail method of accounting, and are stated using the last in, first out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail method of accounting and are stated using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. We believe the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. We record an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the expected annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end. At both September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005 merchandise inventories valued at LIFO approximated FIFO after considering the lower of cost or market principle. We provide for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts as a percentage of net sales. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect the actual physical inventory count results, which generally occur in the second and fourth fiscal quarters of the fiscal year. Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as we progress toward earning those rebates, provided they are probable and reasonably estimable. Other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of agreement, or other systematic and rational approach. Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Warehouse Closing costs We periodically evaluate our long lived assets for indicators of impairment. Our judgments are based on existing market and operational conditions. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring an adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value. We provide estimates for warehouse closing costs based on applicable U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Future circumstances may result in actual closing costs or the amount recognized upon the sale of the property to differ substantially from the original estimates. 28 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Insurance/Self Insurance Liabilities We use a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance pool, to provide for potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property damage, director and officers liability, vehicle liability and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience and evaluations of outside expertise, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. StockBased Compensation We account for stockbased compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123R. We use the BlackScholes optionpricing model, which requires the input of subjective assumptions. These assumptions include: estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them (expected term); the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term (volatility), and the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements (forfeitures). Changes in these assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stockbased compensation. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, we ceased the granting of stock options in favor of restricted stock units. Income Taxes The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Significant judgment is required in assessing, among other things, the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items. We establish reserves when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable, we believe that certain positions may be successfully challenged. When facts and circumstances change, we adjust these reserves through our provision for income taxes. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in the Current Year Financial Statements (SAB 108). SAB 108 addresses how the effects of prior year uncorrected misstatements should be considered when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements. SAB 108 requires an entity to quantify misstatements using a balance sheet and income statement approach and to evaluate whether either approach results in quantifying an error that is material in light of relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. We early adopted SAB 108 as of August 29, 2005, the beginning of our fiscal year. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report for further discussion. In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157). SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements required under other accounting pronouncements but does not change existing guidance as to whether or not an instrument is carried at fair value. SFAS 157 is effective for our fiscal year 2008. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting SFAS 157. 29 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. FIN 48 is effective beginning in fiscal 2008. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting FIN 48. In June 2006, the FASB ratified the consensus reached on Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 06 03, How Sales Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities Should Be Presented in the Income Statement (that is, Gross Versus Net Presentation). The EITF reached a consensus that the presentation of taxes on either a gross or net basis is an accounting policy decision that requires disclosure. EITF 06 03 is effective for the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after December 15, 2006. Amounts collected from our members, which under common trade practices are referred to as sales taxes, are and have been recorded on a net basis. We have no intention of modifying this accounting policy. Therefore, the adoption of EITF 06 03 will not have any effect on our financial position or results of operations. In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, a Replacement of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 20, and FASB Statement No. 3. SFAS 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements for changes in accounting principles, unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change. SFAS 154 also requires that retrospective application of a change in accounting principle be limited to the direct effects of the change. Indirect effects of a change in accounting principle, such as a change in non discretionary profit sharing payments resulting from an accounting change, should be recognized in the period of the accounting change. SFAS 154 also requires that a change in depreciation, amortization, or depletion method for long lived, non financial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate effected by a change in accounting principle. SFAS 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. We will adopt the provisions of SFAS 154 beginning in fiscal 2007. We do not believe the adoption will have a significant effect on our future consolidated financial statements. 30 Table of Contents Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to financial market risk resulting from changes in interest and foreign currency rates. As a policy, we do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions, nor hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. The nature and amount of our long and short term debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As of September 3, 2006, our fixed rate long term debt included $129 million principal amount at maturity Zero Coupon Subordinated Notes carried at $88 million and additional notes and capital lease obligations totaling $135 million. Our debt also includes $300 million 51/2% Senior Notes carried at $301 million. We entered into fixed to floating interest rate swaps on the Senior Notes, effectively converting these fixed interest rate securities to variable rate securities. As of September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, we had fixed to floating interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $300 million and an aggregate fair value of $1 million and $8 million, respectively. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt and may affect the interest expense related to the variable rate debt. We hold interest bearing instruments that are classified as cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. Our investment policy is to manage our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances to preserve principal and liquidity, while seeking to maximize the return on our investment portfolio through the full investment of available funds. We diversify our investment portfolio by investing in multiple types of investment grade securities and through a combination of internal and third party investment management. Short term investments generally have a maturity of three months to five years from the purchase date. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. As the majority of these instruments are of a short term nature, if interest rates were to increase or decrease, there is no material risk of a valuation adjustment related to these instruments. For those instruments that are classified as available for sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in interest rates are reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss. Based on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances at September 3, 2006, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $9 million to interest income (pre tax) on an annual basis. Most transactions of our foreign subsidiaries are conducted in local currencies, limiting our exposure to changes in currency rates. We periodically enter into short term forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates on inventory purchases. The notional value of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at September 3, 2006 was $62 million. 31 Table of Contents 
 
Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (dollars in thousands, except per share amounts) The following table itemizes components of our most liquid assets: September 3,2006 August 28,2005 Cash and cash equivalents $ 1,510,939 $ 2,062,585 Short term investments 1,322,181 1,397,272 Total $ 2,833,120 $ 3,459,857 Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from warehouse operations and our existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances, which were $2.83 billion and $3.46 billion at September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, respectively. Of these balances, approximately $594 million and $522 million at September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, respectively, represented debit and credit card receivables, primarily related to weekend sales immediately prior to the year end close. The decrease in our most liquid assets of $627 million to $2.83 billion at September 3, 2006 was due primarily to the repurchase of our common stock, the acquisition of property and equipment related to warehouse expansion and the payment of cash dividends. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $1.83 billion in fiscal 2006 compared to $1.78 billion in fiscal 2005, an increase of $51 million. This increase is attributable to higher net income and an increase in cash flow from operating assets and liabilities of $338 million, offset by an increase in net merchandise inventories (merchandise inventory less accounts payable) of $388 million. Net cash used in investing activities totaled $1.15 billion in fiscal 2006 compared to $2.05 billion in fiscal 2005. The decrease relates primarily to a decrease in the net investment in short term investments of $1.16 billion, offset by an increase of $217 million in additions to property and equipment related to warehouse expansion and remodel projects. The decrease in the net investment in short term investments was due primarily to our stock repurchase activity. Net cash used in financing activities totaled $1.23 billion in fiscal 2006 compared to $519 million in fiscal 2005. The increase of $715 million primarily resulted from the repurchase of common stock in fiscal 2006, which used $1.44 billion of cash, compared to $413 million in fiscal 2005. In addition, $304 million was used in fiscal 2005 for the repayment of the 7 1/8% Senior Notes. Dividends In April 2006, our quarterly cash dividend was increased from $0.115 to $0.13 per share. Our cash dividends paid in fiscal 2006 totaled $0.49 per share. In fiscal 2005, we paid quarterly cash dividends totaling $0.43 per share. Our current quarterly dividend rate is $0.13 per share or $0.52 per share on an annualized basis. 23 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Contractual Obligations Our commitments at year end to make future payments under contractual obligations were as follows, as of September 3, 2006: Payments Due by Period Contractual obligations Total Less than 1 year 1 to 3 years 4 to 5 years After 5 years Long term debt(1) $ 523,391 $ 317,959 $ 57,358 $ 60,046 $ 88,028 Capital lease obligations and other(1) 20,928 8,152 4,666 2,034 6,076 Operating leases(2) 1,647,683 130,259 237,373 200,052 1,079,999 Purchase obligations (merchandise)(3) 3,538,948 3,538,096 852 Purchase obligations (building, equipment, services and other)(4) 385,650 350,721 29,563 5,366 Other(5) 11,809 1,703 2,852 2,692 4,562 Total $ 6,128,409 $ 4,346,890 $ 332,664 $ 270,190 $ 1,178,665 (1) Amounts include contractual interest payments. (2) Operating lease obligations have been reduced by $162,120 to reflect sub lease income. (3) Includes open merchandise purchase orders. (4) The amounts exclude minor outsourced services negotiated at the individual warehouse level that are not significant and generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty. (5) Consists of asset retirement and deferred compensation obligations. Expansion Plans Our primary requirement for capital is the domestic and international financing of the land, building and equipment costs for new and remodeled warehouses plus the costs of initial warehouse operations and working capital requirements. While there can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized, and plans are subject to change upon further review, it is managements current intention to spend approximately $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion during fiscal 2007 for real estate, construction, remodeling and equipment for warehouse clubs and related operations. These expenditures are expected to be financed with a combination of cash provided from operations and the use of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. Plans for the United States and Canada during fiscal 2007 are to open approximately 33 to 35 new warehouses on a net basis, inclusive of one to two relocations. We expect to continue our review of expansion plans in our international operations, including the United Kingdom and Asia, along with other international markets. At present, we are planning to open one additional warehouse in the United Kingdom during fiscal 2007. Costco Mexico plans to open one to two new warehouses during fiscal 2007. 24 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Additional Equity Investments in Subsidiaries and Joint Ventures During fiscal 2006 and 2005, we contributed an additional $15 million each year to our investment in Costco Mexico (a 50% owned joint venture), which did not impact our percentage ownership of this entity, as our joint venture partner contributed a like amount. In addition, in fiscal 2005, we acquired the remaining 4% interest in CWC Travel Inc. for $4 million, bringing our ownership in this entity to 100%. Bank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs (all amounts stated in U.S. dollars) A wholly owned Canadian subsidiary has a $181 million commercial paper program ($167 million at August 28, 2005) supported by a $54 million bank credit facility ($50 million at August 28, 2005) with a Canadian bank, which we guarantee and which expires in March 2007. We intend to renew the bank credit facility. At both September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, there were no amounts outstanding under the Canadian commercial paper program or the bank credit facility. Applicable interest rates on the credit facility at September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, were 4.65% and 4.25%, respectively. At September 3, 2006, standby letters of credit totaling $21 million issued under the bank credit facility left $33 million available for commercial paper support. At August 28, 2005, standby letters of credit totaling $23 million issued under the bank credit facility left $27 million available for commercial paper support. Our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary has a short term $13 million bank line of credit ($14 million at August 28, 2005) that expires in February 2007, which we intend to renew. At September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, $2.5 million and $6 million, respectively, were borrowed under the line of credit, and $4 million in both years was used to support standby letters of credit. A second $13 million bank line of credit also expires in February 2007, which we intend to renew. At September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, $0.9 million and $9 million, respectively, were borrowed under the second facility. Applicable interest rates on the credit facilities at September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, were 0.95% and 0.84%, respectively. Our Korean subsidiary has a short term $13 million bank line of credit, which expires in February 2007, and which we intend to renew. At September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, no amounts were borrowed under the line of credit and $2 million in both years was used to support standby letters of credit. Applicable interest rates on the credit facility at September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005 were 5.48% and 4.51%, respectively. Our Taiwan subsidiary has a $5 million bank revolving credit facility that expires in January 2007, which we intend to renew. At September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, no amounts were borrowed under the credit facility and $2 million and $3 million, respectively, were used to support standby letters of credit. A second $15 million bank revolving credit facility is in place, which expires in August 2007. At September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, no amounts were borrowed under the second credit facility and $2 million and $1 million, respectively, were used to support standby letters of credit. Applicable interest rates on the credit facility at September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, were 4.00% and 3.75%, respectively. Our wholly owned United Kingdom subsidiary has a $114 million bank revolving credit facility expiring in February 2007, and a $67 million bank overdraft facility renewable on a yearly basis in March 2007. We intend to renew both facilities. At September 3, 2006, $38 million was outstanding under the revolving credit facility with an applicable interest rate of 5.32% and no amounts were outstanding under the bank overdraft facility. At August 28, 2005, $40 million was outstanding under the revolving credit facility, with an applicable interest rate of 5.30%, and no amounts were outstanding under the bank overdraft facility. 25 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) On November 15, 2005, upon the expiration of our $150 million bank credit facility in the U.S. with a group of nine banks, we terminated our $500 million commercial paper program. At August 28, 2005, no amounts were outstanding under the commercial paper program and no amounts were outstanding under the credit facility. The applicable interest rate on the credit facility at August 28, 2005, was 3.92%. Letters of Credit We have letter of credit facilities (for commercial and standby letters of credit) totaling $400 million. The outstanding commitments under these facilities at September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005 totaled $85 million and $131 million, respectively, including $55 million and $65 million, respectively, in standby letters of credit. Financing Activities In April 2003, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.92% in the aggregate amount of $34 million, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due in April 2010. In March 2002, we issued $300 million of 5 1/2% Senior Notes, carried at $301 million, due in March 2007. Interest is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15. Simultaneous with the issuance of the 5 1/2% Senior Notes, we entered into interest rate swap agreements converting the interest to a floating rate indexed to LIBOR. We plan to repay the 5 1/2% Senior Notes at maturity from our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances. In February 1996, we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a shelf registration statement for $500 million of senior debt securities. In October 2001, additional debt securities of $100 million were registered. The $300 million of 5 1/2% Senior Notes issued in March 2002 reduced the amount of registered securities available for future issuance to $300 million. In April 2006, we cancelled the shelf registration. During fiscal 2006, $191 million in principal amount of our 3 1/2% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes were converted by note holders into 6.5 million shares of common stock. The current Notes outstanding are convertible into a maximum of 2,925,057 shares of Costco common stock at an initial conversion price of $22.71. Derivatives We have limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and use them only to manage well defined interest rate and foreign exchange risks. Forward foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on inventory purchases and typically have very short terms. The aggregate notional amount, which approximates the fair value of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, was $63 million and $42 million, respectively. The majority of the forward foreign exchange contracts were entered into by our wholly owned United Kingdom subsidiary, primarily to hedge U.S. dollar merchandise inventory purchases. We also hold interest rate swaps to manage the interest rate risk associated with our borrowings and the mix of fixed rate and variable rate debt. As of September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, we had fixed to floating interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $300 million and an aggregate fair value of $1 million and $8 million, respectively. These amounts were recorded in deferred income taxes and other current assets as of September 3, 2006 and in other assets as of 26 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) August 28, 2005, in our consolidated balance sheets. These swaps were entered into effective March 25, 2002, and are designated and qualify as fair value hedges of our $300 million 5 1/2% Senior Notes. As the terms of the swaps match those of the underlying hedged debt, the changes in the fair value of these swaps are offset by corresponding changes in the carrying amount of the hedged debt and result in no net earnings impact. We are exposed to market risk for changes in utility commodity pricing, which we partially mitigate through the use of firm price contracts with counterparties for approximately 19% of our locations in the U.S. and Canada. The effects of these arrangements are not significant for any period presented. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements With the exception of our operating leases, we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition or consolidated financial statements. Stock Repurchase Programs Our Board of Directors has approved the following stock repurchase programs (000s): AmountApproved AmountRemaining August 2005 $ 1,000,000 $ 0 January 2006(1) 1,000,000 625,534 July 2006(2) 2,000,000 2,000,000 Total $ 4,000,000 $ 2,625,534 (1) Expires in January 2009. (2) Expires in July 2009. During fiscal 2005, we repurchased 9.2 million shares of common stock, at an average price of $44.89, totaling approximately $413 million. During fiscal 2006, we repurchased 28.4 million shares at an average price of $51.44, totaling approximately $1.46 billion. The amount available to be purchased under the approved plans was approximately $2.63 billion at September 3, 2006. Purchases are made from time to time as conditions warrant in the open market or in block purchases, or pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5 1. Repurchased shares are retired. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our financial statements requires that management make estimates and judgments that affect the financial position and results of operations. Management continues to review its accounting policies and evaluate its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, merchandise inventory valuation, impairment of long lived assets, warehouse closing costs, insurance/self insurance liabilities, stock based compensation and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Revenue Recognition We recognize sales, net of estimated returns, at the time customers take possession of merchandise or receive services. When we collect payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of 27 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) merchandise or the performance of services, the amount received is recorded as deferred revenue on the balance sheet until the sale or service is completed. We provide for estimated sales returns based on historical returns levels. We evaluate the criteria of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal Versus Net as an Agent, in determining whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, when we are the primary obligor, subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, influence product or service specifications, or have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded on a gross basis. If we are not the primary obligor and do not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above, we record the net amounts as commissions earned, which is reflected in net sales. Membership fee revenue represents annual membership fees paid by substantially all of our members. We account for membership fee revenue on a deferred basis, whereby membership fee revenue is recognized ratably over one year. Our Executive members qualify for a 2% reward (which can be redeemed only at Costco warehouses), up to a maximum of $500 per year, on all qualified purchases made at Costco. We account for this 2% reward as a reduction in sales, with the related liability being classified within other current liabilities. Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, as determined primarily by the retail method of accounting, and are stated using the last in, first out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail method of accounting and are stated using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. We believe the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. We record an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the expected annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end. At both September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005 merchandise inventories valued at LIFO approximated FIFO after considering the lower of cost or market principle. We provide for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts as a percentage of net sales. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect the actual physical inventory count results, which generally occur in the second and fourth fiscal quarters of the fiscal year. Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as we progress toward earning those rebates, provided they are probable and reasonably estimable. Other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of agreement, or other systematic and rational approach. Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Warehouse Closing costs We periodically evaluate our long lived assets for indicators of impairment. Our judgments are based on existing market and operational conditions. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring an adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value. We provide estimates for warehouse closing costs based on applicable U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Future circumstances may result in actual closing costs or the amount recognized upon the sale of the property to differ substantially from the original estimates. 28 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Insurance/Self Insurance Liabilities We use a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance pool, to provide for potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property damage, director and officers liability, vehicle liability and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience and evaluations of outside expertise, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. StockBased Compensation We account for stockbased compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123R. We use the BlackScholes optionpricing model, which requires the input of subjective assumptions. These assumptions include: estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them (expected term); the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term (volatility), and the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements (forfeitures). Changes in these assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stockbased compensation. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, we ceased the granting of stock options in favor of restricted stock units. Income Taxes The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Significant judgment is required in assessing, among other things, the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items. We establish reserves when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable, we believe that certain positions may be successfully challenged. When facts and circumstances change, we adjust these reserves through our provision for income taxes. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in the Current Year Financial Statements (SAB 108). SAB 108 addresses how the effects of prior year uncorrected misstatements should be considered when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements. SAB 108 requires an entity to quantify misstatements using a balance sheet and income statement approach and to evaluate whether either approach results in quantifying an error that is material in light of relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. We early adopted SAB 108 as of August 29, 2005, the beginning of our fiscal year. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report for further discussion. In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157). SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements required under other accounting pronouncements but does not change existing guidance as to whether or not an instrument is carried at fair value. SFAS 157 is effective for our fiscal year 2008. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting SFAS 157. 29 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. FIN 48 is effective beginning in fiscal 2008. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting FIN 48. In June 2006, the FASB ratified the consensus reached on Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 06 03, How Sales Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities Should Be Presented in the Income Statement (that is, Gross Versus Net Presentation). The EITF reached a consensus that the presentation of taxes on either a gross or net basis is an accounting policy decision that requires disclosure. EITF 06 03 is effective for the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after December 15, 2006. Amounts collected from our members, which under common trade practices are referred to as sales taxes, are and have been recorded on a net basis. We have no intention of modifying this accounting policy. Therefore, the adoption of EITF 06 03 will not have any effect on our financial position or results of operations. In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, a Replacement of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 20, and FASB Statement No. 3. SFAS 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements for changes in accounting principles, unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change. SFAS 154 also requires that retrospective application of a change in accounting principle be limited to the direct effects of the change. Indirect effects of a change in accounting principle, such as a change in non discretionary profit sharing payments resulting from an accounting change, should be recognized in the period of the accounting change. SFAS 154 also requires that a change in depreciation, amortization, or depletion method for long lived, non financial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate effected by a change in accounting principle. SFAS 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. We will adopt the provisions of SFAS 154 beginning in fiscal 2007. We do not believe the adoption will have a significant effect on our future consolidated financial statements. 30 Table of Contents Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to financial market risk resulting from changes in interest and foreign currency rates. As a policy, we do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions, nor hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. The nature and amount of our long and short term debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As of September 3, 2006, our fixed rate long term debt included $129 million principal amount at maturity Zero Coupon Subordinated Notes carried at $88 million and additional notes and capital lease obligations totaling $135 million. Our debt also includes $300 million 51/2% Senior Notes carried at $301 million. We entered into fixed to floating interest rate swaps on the Senior Notes, effectively converting these fixed interest rate securities to variable rate securities. As of September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, we had fixed to floating interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $300 million and an aggregate fair value of $1 million and $8 million, respectively. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt and may affect the interest expense related to the variable rate debt. We hold interest bearing instruments that are classified as cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. Our investment policy is to manage our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances to preserve principal and liquidity, while seeking to maximize the return on our investment portfolio through the full investment of available funds. We diversify our investment portfolio by investing in multiple types of investment grade securities and through a combination of internal and third party investment management. Short term investments generally have a maturity of three months to five years from the purchase date. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. As the majority of these instruments are of a short term nature, if interest rates were to increase or decrease, there is no material risk of a valuation adjustment related to these instruments. For those instruments that are classified as available for sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in interest rates are reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss. Based on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances at September 3, 2006, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $9 million to interest income (pre tax) on an annual basis. Most transactions of our foreign subsidiaries are conducted in local currencies, limiting our exposure to changes in currency rates. We periodically enter into short term forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates on inventory purchases. The notional value of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at September 3, 2006 was $62 million. 31 Table of Contents

Expansion Plans Our primary requirement for capital is the domestic and international financing of the land, building and equipment costs for new and remodeled warehouses plus the costs of initial warehouse operations and working capital requirements. While there can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized, and plans are subject to change upon further review, it is managements current intention to spend approximately $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion during fiscal 2007 for real estate, construction, remodeling and equipment for warehouse clubs and related operations. These expenditures are expected to be financed with a combination of cash provided from operations and the use of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. Plans for the United States and Canada during fiscal 2007 are to open approximately 33 to 35 new warehouses on a net basis, inclusive of one to two relocations. We expect to continue our review of expansion plans in our international operations, including the United Kingdom and Asia, along with other international markets. At present, we are planning to open one additional warehouse in the United Kingdom during fiscal 2007. Costco Mexico plans to open one to two new warehouses during fiscal 2007. 24 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Additional Equity Investments in Subsidiaries and Joint Ventures During fiscal 2006 and 2005, we contributed an additional $15 million each year to our investment in Costco Mexico (a 50% owned joint venture), which did not impact our percentage ownership of this entity, as our joint venture partner contributed a like amount. In addition, in fiscal 2005, we acquired the remaining 4% interest in CWC Travel Inc. for $4 million, bringing our ownership in this entity to 100%. Bank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs (all amounts stated in U.S. dollars) A wholly owned Canadian subsidiary has a $181 million commercial paper program ($167 million at August 28, 2005) supported by a $54 million bank credit facility ($50 million at August 28, 2005) with a Canadian bank, which we guarantee and which expires in March 2007. We intend to renew the bank credit facility. At both September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, there were no amounts outstanding under the Canadian commercial paper program or the bank credit facility. Applicable interest rates on the credit facility at September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, were 4.65% and 4.25%, respectively. At September 3, 2006, standby letters of credit totaling $21 million issued under the bank credit facility left $33 million available for commercial paper support. At August 28, 2005, standby letters of credit totaling $23 million issued under the bank credit facility left $27 million available for commercial paper support. Our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary has a short term $13 million bank line of credit ($14 million at August 28, 2005) that expires in February 2007, which we intend to renew. At September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, $2.5 million and $6 million, respectively, were borrowed under the line of credit, and $4 million in both years was used to support standby letters of credit. A second $13 million bank line of credit also expires in February 2007, which we intend to renew. At September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, $0.9 million and $9 million, respectively, were borrowed under the second facility. Applicable interest rates on the credit facilities at September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, were 0.95% and 0.84%, respectively. Our Korean subsidiary has a short term $13 million bank line of credit, which expires in February 2007, and which we intend to renew. At September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, no amounts were borrowed under the line of credit and $2 million in both years was used to support standby letters of credit. Applicable interest rates on the credit facility at September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005 were 5.48% and 4.51%, respectively. Our Taiwan subsidiary has a $5 million bank revolving credit facility that expires in January 2007, which we intend to renew. At September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, no amounts were borrowed under the credit facility and $2 million and $3 million, respectively, were used to support standby letters of credit. A second $15 million bank revolving credit facility is in place, which expires in August 2007. At September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, no amounts were borrowed under the second credit facility and $2 million and $1 million, respectively, were used to support standby letters of credit. Applicable interest rates on the credit facility at September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, were 4.00% and 3.75%, respectively. Our wholly owned United Kingdom subsidiary has a $114 million bank revolving credit facility expiring in February 2007, and a $67 million bank overdraft facility renewable on a yearly basis in March 2007. We intend to renew both facilities. At September 3, 2006, $38 million was outstanding under the revolving credit facility with an applicable interest rate of 5.32% and no amounts were outstanding under the bank overdraft facility. At August 28, 2005, $40 million was outstanding under the revolving credit facility, with an applicable interest rate of 5.30%, and no amounts were outstanding under the bank overdraft facility. 25 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) On November 15, 2005, upon the expiration of our $150 million bank credit facility in the U.S. with a group of nine banks, we terminated our $500 million commercial paper program. At August 28, 2005, no amounts were outstanding under the commercial paper program and no amounts were outstanding under the credit facility. The applicable interest rate on the credit facility at August 28, 2005, was 3.92%. Letters of Credit We have letter of credit facilities (for commercial and standby letters of credit) totaling $400 million. The outstanding commitments under these facilities at September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005 totaled $85 million and $131 million, respectively, including $55 million and $65 million, respectively, in standby letters of credit. Financing Activities In April 2003, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.92% in the aggregate amount of $34 million, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due in April 2010. In March 2002, we issued $300 million of 5 1/2% Senior Notes, carried at $301 million, due in March 2007. Interest is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15. Simultaneous with the issuance of the 5 1/2% Senior Notes, we entered into interest rate swap agreements converting the interest to a floating rate indexed to LIBOR. We plan to repay the 5 1/2% Senior Notes at maturity from our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances. In February 1996, we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a shelf registration statement for $500 million of senior debt securities. In October 2001, additional debt securities of $100 million were registered. The $300 million of 5 1/2% Senior Notes issued in March 2002 reduced the amount of registered securities available for future issuance to $300 million. In April 2006, we cancelled the shelf registration. During fiscal 2006, $191 million in principal amount of our 3 1/2% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes were converted by note holders into 6.5 million shares of common stock. The current Notes outstanding are convertible into a maximum of 2,925,057 shares of Costco common stock at an initial conversion price of $22.71. Derivatives We have limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and use them only to manage well defined interest rate and foreign exchange risks. Forward foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on inventory purchases and typically have very short terms. The aggregate notional amount, which approximates the fair value of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, was $63 million and $42 million, respectively. The majority of the forward foreign exchange contracts were entered into by our wholly owned United Kingdom subsidiary, primarily to hedge U.S. dollar merchandise inventory purchases. We also hold interest rate swaps to manage the interest rate risk associated with our borrowings and the mix of fixed rate and variable rate debt. As of September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, we had fixed to floating interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $300 million and an aggregate fair value of $1 million and $8 million, respectively. These amounts were recorded in deferred income taxes and other current assets as of September 3, 2006 and in other assets as of 26 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) August 28, 2005, in our consolidated balance sheets. These swaps were entered into effective March 25, 2002, and are designated and qualify as fair value hedges of our $300 million 5 1/2% Senior Notes. As the terms of the swaps match those of the underlying hedged debt, the changes in the fair value of these swaps are offset by corresponding changes in the carrying amount of the hedged debt and result in no net earnings impact. We are exposed to market risk for changes in utility commodity pricing, which we partially mitigate through the use of firm price contracts with counterparties for approximately 19% of our locations in the U.S. and Canada. The effects of these arrangements are not significant for any period presented. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements With the exception of our operating leases, we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition or consolidated financial statements. Stock Repurchase Programs Our Board of Directors has approved the following stock repurchase programs (000s): AmountApproved AmountRemaining August 2005 $ 1,000,000 $ 0 January 2006(1) 1,000,000 625,534 July 2006(2) 2,000,000 2,000,000 Total $ 4,000,000 $ 2,625,534 (1) Expires in January 2009. (2) Expires in July 2009. During fiscal 2005, we repurchased 9.2 million shares of common stock, at an average price of $44.89, totaling approximately $413 million. During fiscal 2006, we repurchased 28.4 million shares at an average price of $51.44, totaling approximately $1.46 billion. The amount available to be purchased under the approved plans was approximately $2.63 billion at September 3, 2006. Purchases are made from time to time as conditions warrant in the open market or in block purchases, or pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5 1. Repurchased shares are retired. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our financial statements requires that management make estimates and judgments that affect the financial position and results of operations. Management continues to review its accounting policies and evaluate its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, merchandise inventory valuation, impairment of long lived assets, warehouse closing costs, insurance/self insurance liabilities, stock based compensation and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Revenue Recognition We recognize sales, net of estimated returns, at the time customers take possession of merchandise or receive services. When we collect payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of 27 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) merchandise or the performance of services, the amount received is recorded as deferred revenue on the balance sheet until the sale or service is completed. We provide for estimated sales returns based on historical returns levels. We evaluate the criteria of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal Versus Net as an Agent, in determining whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, when we are the primary obligor, subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, influence product or service specifications, or have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded on a gross basis. If we are not the primary obligor and do not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above, we record the net amounts as commissions earned, which is reflected in net sales. Membership fee revenue represents annual membership fees paid by substantially all of our members. We account for membership fee revenue on a deferred basis, whereby membership fee revenue is recognized ratably over one year. Our Executive members qualify for a 2% reward (which can be redeemed only at Costco warehouses), up to a maximum of $500 per year, on all qualified purchases made at Costco. We account for this 2% reward as a reduction in sales, with the related liability being classified within other current liabilities. Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, as determined primarily by the retail method of accounting, and are stated using the last in, first out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail method of accounting and are stated using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. We believe the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. We record an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the expected annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end. At both September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005 merchandise inventories valued at LIFO approximated FIFO after considering the lower of cost or market principle. We provide for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts as a percentage of net sales. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect the actual physical inventory count results, which generally occur in the second and fourth fiscal quarters of the fiscal year. Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as we progress toward earning those rebates, provided they are probable and reasonably estimable. Other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of agreement, or other systematic and rational approach. Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Warehouse Closing costs We periodically evaluate our long lived assets for indicators of impairment. Our judgments are based on existing market and operational conditions. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring an adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value. We provide estimates for warehouse closing costs based on applicable U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Future circumstances may result in actual closing costs or the amount recognized upon the sale of the property to differ substantially from the original estimates. 28 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Insurance/Self Insurance Liabilities We use a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance pool, to provide for potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property damage, director and officers liability, vehicle liability and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience and evaluations of outside expertise, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. StockBased Compensation We account for stockbased compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123R. We use the BlackScholes optionpricing model, which requires the input of subjective assumptions. These assumptions include: estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them (expected term); the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term (volatility), and the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements (forfeitures). Changes in these assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stockbased compensation. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, we ceased the granting of stock options in favor of restricted stock units. Income Taxes The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Significant judgment is required in assessing, among other things, the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items. We establish reserves when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable, we believe that certain positions may be successfully challenged. When facts and circumstances change, we adjust these reserves through our provision for income taxes. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in the Current Year Financial Statements (SAB 108). SAB 108 addresses how the effects of prior year uncorrected misstatements should be considered when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements. SAB 108 requires an entity to quantify misstatements using a balance sheet and income statement approach and to evaluate whether either approach results in quantifying an error that is material in light of relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. We early adopted SAB 108 as of August 29, 2005, the beginning of our fiscal year. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report for further discussion. In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157). SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements required under other accounting pronouncements but does not change existing guidance as to whether or not an instrument is carried at fair value. SFAS 157 is effective for our fiscal year 2008. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting SFAS 157. 29 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. FIN 48 is effective beginning in fiscal 2008. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting FIN 48. In June 2006, the FASB ratified the consensus reached on Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 06 03, How Sales Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities Should Be Presented in the Income Statement (that is, Gross Versus Net Presentation). The EITF reached a consensus that the presentation of taxes on either a gross or net basis is an accounting policy decision that requires disclosure. EITF 06 03 is effective for the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after December 15, 2006. Amounts collected from our members, which under common trade practices are referred to as sales taxes, are and have been recorded on a net basis. We have no intention of modifying this accounting policy. Therefore, the adoption of EITF 06 03 will not have any effect on our financial position or results of operations. In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, a Replacement of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 20, and FASB Statement No. 3. SFAS 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements for changes in accounting principles, unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change. SFAS 154 also requires that retrospective application of a change in accounting principle be limited to the direct effects of the change. Indirect effects of a change in accounting principle, such as a change in non discretionary profit sharing payments resulting from an accounting change, should be recognized in the period of the accounting change. SFAS 154 also requires that a change in depreciation, amortization, or depletion method for long lived, non financial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate effected by a change in accounting principle. SFAS 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. We will adopt the provisions of SFAS 154 beginning in fiscal 2007. We do not believe the adoption will have a significant effect on our future consolidated financial statements. 30 Table of Contents Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to financial market risk resulting from changes in interest and foreign currency rates. As a policy, we do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions, nor hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. The nature and amount of our long and short term debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As of September 3, 2006, our fixed rate long term debt included $129 million principal amount at maturity Zero Coupon Subordinated Notes carried at $88 million and additional notes and capital lease obligations totaling $135 million. Our debt also includes $300 million 51/2% Senior Notes carried at $301 million. We entered into fixed to floating interest rate swaps on the Senior Notes, effectively converting these fixed interest rate securities to variable rate securities. As of September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, we had fixed to floating interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $300 million and an aggregate fair value of $1 million and $8 million, respectively. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt and may affect the interest expense related to the variable rate debt. We hold interest bearing instruments that are classified as cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. Our investment policy is to manage our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances to preserve principal and liquidity, while seeking to maximize the return on our investment portfolio through the full investment of available funds. We diversify our investment portfolio by investing in multiple types of investment grade securities and through a combination of internal and third party investment management. Short term investments generally have a maturity of three months to five years from the purchase date. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. As the majority of these instruments are of a short term nature, if interest rates were to increase or decrease, there is no material risk of a valuation adjustment related to these instruments. For those instruments that are classified as available for sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in interest rates are reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss. Based on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances at September 3, 2006, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $9 million to interest income (pre tax) on an annual basis. Most transactions of our foreign subsidiaries are conducted in local currencies, limiting our exposure to changes in currency rates. We periodically enter into short term forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates on inventory purchases. The notional value of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at September 3, 2006 was $62 million. 31 Table of Contents 
 
Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Additional Equity Investments in Subsidiaries and Joint Ventures During fiscal 2006 and 2005, we contributed an additional $15 million each year to our investment in Costco Mexico (a 50% owned joint venture), which did not impact our percentage ownership of this entity, as our joint venture partner contributed a like amount. In addition, in fiscal 2005, we acquired the remaining 4% interest in CWC Travel Inc. for $4 million, bringing our ownership in this entity to 100%. Bank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs (all amounts stated in U.S. dollars) A wholly owned Canadian subsidiary has a $181 million commercial paper program ($167 million at August 28, 2005) supported by a $54 million bank credit facility ($50 million at August 28, 2005) with a Canadian bank, which we guarantee and which expires in March 2007. We intend to renew the bank credit facility. At both September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, there were no amounts outstanding under the Canadian commercial paper program or the bank credit facility. Applicable interest rates on the credit facility at September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, were 4.65% and 4.25%, respectively. At September 3, 2006, standby letters of credit totaling $21 million issued under the bank credit facility left $33 million available for commercial paper support. At August 28, 2005, standby letters of credit totaling $23 million issued under the bank credit facility left $27 million available for commercial paper support. Our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary has a short term $13 million bank line of credit ($14 million at August 28, 2005) that expires in February 2007, which we intend to renew. At September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, $2.5 million and $6 million, respectively, were borrowed under the line of credit, and $4 million in both years was used to support standby letters of credit. A second $13 million bank line of credit also expires in February 2007, which we intend to renew. At September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, $0.9 million and $9 million, respectively, were borrowed under the second facility. Applicable interest rates on the credit facilities at September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, were 0.95% and 0.84%, respectively. Our Korean subsidiary has a short term $13 million bank line of credit, which expires in February 2007, and which we intend to renew. At September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, no amounts were borrowed under the line of credit and $2 million in both years was used to support standby letters of credit. Applicable interest rates on the credit facility at September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005 were 5.48% and 4.51%, respectively. Our Taiwan subsidiary has a $5 million bank revolving credit facility that expires in January 2007, which we intend to renew. At September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, no amounts were borrowed under the credit facility and $2 million and $3 million, respectively, were used to support standby letters of credit. A second $15 million bank revolving credit facility is in place, which expires in August 2007. At September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, no amounts were borrowed under the second credit facility and $2 million and $1 million, respectively, were used to support standby letters of credit. Applicable interest rates on the credit facility at September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, were 4.00% and 3.75%, respectively. Our wholly owned United Kingdom subsidiary has a $114 million bank revolving credit facility expiring in February 2007, and a $67 million bank overdraft facility renewable on a yearly basis in March 2007. We intend to renew both facilities. At September 3, 2006, $38 million was outstanding under the revolving credit facility with an applicable interest rate of 5.32% and no amounts were outstanding under the bank overdraft facility. At August 28, 2005, $40 million was outstanding under the revolving credit facility, with an applicable interest rate of 5.30%, and no amounts were outstanding under the bank overdraft facility. 25 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) On November 15, 2005, upon the expiration of our $150 million bank credit facility in the U.S. with a group of nine banks, we terminated our $500 million commercial paper program. At August 28, 2005, no amounts were outstanding under the commercial paper program and no amounts were outstanding under the credit facility. The applicable interest rate on the credit facility at August 28, 2005, was 3.92%. Letters of Credit We have letter of credit facilities (for commercial and standby letters of credit) totaling $400 million. The outstanding commitments under these facilities at September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005 totaled $85 million and $131 million, respectively, including $55 million and $65 million, respectively, in standby letters of credit. Financing Activities In April 2003, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.92% in the aggregate amount of $34 million, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due in April 2010. In March 2002, we issued $300 million of 5 1/2% Senior Notes, carried at $301 million, due in March 2007. Interest is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15. Simultaneous with the issuance of the 5 1/2% Senior Notes, we entered into interest rate swap agreements converting the interest to a floating rate indexed to LIBOR. We plan to repay the 5 1/2% Senior Notes at maturity from our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances. In February 1996, we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a shelf registration statement for $500 million of senior debt securities. In October 2001, additional debt securities of $100 million were registered. The $300 million of 5 1/2% Senior Notes issued in March 2002 reduced the amount of registered securities available for future issuance to $300 million. In April 2006, we cancelled the shelf registration. During fiscal 2006, $191 million in principal amount of our 3 1/2% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes were converted by note holders into 6.5 million shares of common stock. The current Notes outstanding are convertible into a maximum of 2,925,057 shares of Costco common stock at an initial conversion price of $22.71. Derivatives We have limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and use them only to manage well defined interest rate and foreign exchange risks. Forward foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on inventory purchases and typically have very short terms. The aggregate notional amount, which approximates the fair value of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, was $63 million and $42 million, respectively.

We also hold interest rate swaps to manage the interest rate risk associated with our borrowings and the mix of fixed rate and variable rate debt. As of September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, we had fixed to floating interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $300 million and an aggregate fair value of $1 million and $8 million, respectively. These amounts were recorded in deferred income taxes and other current assets as of September 3, 2006 and in other assets as of 26 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) August 28, 2005, in our consolidated balance sheets. These swaps were entered into effective March 25, 2002, and are designated and qualify as fair value hedges of our $300 million 5 1/2% Senior Notes. As the terms of the swaps match those of the underlying hedged debt, the changes in the fair value of these swaps are offset by corresponding changes in the carrying amount of the hedged debt and result in no net earnings impact. We are exposed to market risk for changes in utility commodity pricing, which we partially mitigate through the use of firm price contracts with counterparties for approximately 19% of our locations in the U.S. and Canada. The effects of these arrangements are not significant for any period presented. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements With the exception of our operating leases, we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition or consolidated financial statements. Stock Repurchase Programs Our Board of Directors has approved the following stock repurchase programs (000s): AmountApproved AmountRemaining August 2005 $ 1,000,000 $ 0 January 2006(1) 1,000,000 625,534 July 2006(2) 2,000,000 2,000,000 Total $ 4,000,000 $ 2,625,534 (1) Expires in January 2009.

During fiscal 2006, we repurchased 28.4 million shares at an average price of $51.44, totaling approximately $1.46 billion. The amount available to be purchased under the approved plans was approximately $2.63 billion at September 3, 2006. Purchases are made from time to time as conditions warrant in the open market or in block purchases, or pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5 1. Repurchased shares are retired. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our financial statements requires that management make estimates and judgments that affect the financial position and results of operations. Management continues to review its accounting policies and evaluate its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, merchandise inventory valuation, impairment of long lived assets, warehouse closing costs, insurance/self insurance liabilities, stock based compensation and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Revenue Recognition We recognize sales, net of estimated returns, at the time customers take possession of merchandise or receive services. When we collect payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of 27 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) merchandise or the performance of services, the amount received is recorded as deferred revenue on the balance sheet until the sale or service is completed. We provide for estimated sales returns based on historical returns levels. We evaluate the criteria of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal Versus Net as an Agent, in determining whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, when we are the primary obligor, subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, influence product or service specifications, or have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded on a gross basis. If we are not the primary obligor and do not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above, we record the net amounts as commissions earned, which is reflected in net sales. Membership fee revenue represents annual membership fees paid by substantially all of our members. We account for membership fee revenue on a deferred basis, whereby membership fee revenue is recognized ratably over one year. Our Executive members qualify for a 2% reward (which can be redeemed only at Costco warehouses), up to a maximum of $500 per year, on all qualified purchases made at Costco. We account for this 2% reward as a reduction in sales, with the related liability being classified within other current liabilities. Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, as determined primarily by the retail method of accounting, and are stated using the last in, first out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail method of accounting and are stated using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. We believe the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. We record an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the expected annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end. At both September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005 merchandise inventories valued at LIFO approximated FIFO after considering the lower of cost or market principle. We provide for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts as a percentage of net sales. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect the actual physical inventory count results, which generally occur in the second and fourth fiscal quarters of the fiscal year. Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as we progress toward earning those rebates, provided they are probable and reasonably estimable. Other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of agreement, or other systematic and rational approach. Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Warehouse Closing costs We periodically evaluate our long lived assets for indicators of impairment. Our judgments are based on existing market and operational conditions. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring an adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value. We provide estimates for warehouse closing costs based on applicable U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Future circumstances may result in actual closing costs or the amount recognized upon the sale of the property to differ substantially from the original estimates. 28 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Insurance/Self Insurance Liabilities We use a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance pool, to provide for potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property damage, director and officers liability, vehicle liability and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience and evaluations of outside expertise, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. StockBased Compensation We account for stockbased compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123R. We use the BlackScholes optionpricing model, which requires the input of subjective assumptions. These assumptions include: estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them (expected term); the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term (volatility), and the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements (forfeitures). Changes in these assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stockbased compensation. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, we ceased the granting of stock options in favor of restricted stock units. Income Taxes The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Significant judgment is required in assessing, among other things, the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items. We establish reserves when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable, we believe that certain positions may be successfully challenged. When facts and circumstances change, we adjust these reserves through our provision for income taxes. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in the Current Year Financial Statements (SAB 108). SAB 108 addresses how the effects of prior year uncorrected misstatements should be considered when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements. SAB 108 requires an entity to quantify misstatements using a balance sheet and income statement approach and to evaluate whether either approach results in quantifying an error that is material in light of relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. We early adopted SAB 108 as of August 29, 2005, the beginning of our fiscal year. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report for further discussion. In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157). SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements required under other accounting pronouncements but does not change existing guidance as to whether or not an instrument is carried at fair value. SFAS 157 is effective for our fiscal year 2008. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting SFAS 157. 29 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. FIN 48 is effective beginning in fiscal 2008. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting FIN 48. In June 2006, the FASB ratified the consensus reached on Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 06 03, How Sales Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities Should Be Presented in the Income Statement (that is, Gross Versus Net Presentation). The EITF reached a consensus that the presentation of taxes on either a gross or net basis is an accounting policy decision that requires disclosure. EITF 06 03 is effective for the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after December 15, 2006. Amounts collected from our members, which under common trade practices are referred to as sales taxes, are and have been recorded on a net basis. We have no intention of modifying this accounting policy. Therefore, the adoption of EITF 06 03 will not have any effect on our financial position or results of operations. In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, a Replacement of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 20, and FASB Statement No. 3. SFAS 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements for changes in accounting principles, unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change. SFAS 154 also requires that retrospective application of a change in accounting principle be limited to the direct effects of the change. Indirect effects of a change in accounting principle, such as a change in non discretionary profit sharing payments resulting from an accounting change, should be recognized in the period of the accounting change. SFAS 154 also requires that a change in depreciation, amortization, or depletion method for long lived, non financial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate effected by a change in accounting principle. SFAS 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. We will adopt the provisions of SFAS 154 beginning in fiscal 2007. We do not believe the adoption will have a significant effect on our future consolidated financial statements. 30 Table of Contents Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to financial market risk resulting from changes in interest and foreign currency rates. As a policy, we do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions, nor hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. The nature and amount of our long and short term debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As of September 3, 2006, our fixed rate long term debt included $129 million principal amount at maturity Zero Coupon Subordinated Notes carried at $88 million and additional notes and capital lease obligations totaling $135 million. Our debt also includes $300 million 51/2% Senior Notes carried at $301 million. We entered into fixed to floating interest rate swaps on the Senior Notes, effectively converting these fixed interest rate securities to variable rate securities. As of September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, we had fixed to floating interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $300 million and an aggregate fair value of $1 million and $8 million, respectively. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt and may affect the interest expense related to the variable rate debt. We hold interest bearing instruments that are classified as cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. Our investment policy is to manage our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances to preserve principal and liquidity, while seeking to maximize the return on our investment portfolio through the full investment of available funds. We diversify our investment portfolio by investing in multiple types of investment grade securities and through a combination of internal and third party investment management. Short term investments generally have a maturity of three months to five years from the purchase date. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. As the majority of these instruments are of a short term nature, if interest rates were to increase or decrease, there is no material risk of a valuation adjustment related to these instruments. For those instruments that are classified as available for sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in interest rates are reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss. Based on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances at September 3, 2006, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $9 million to interest income (pre tax) on an annual basis. Most transactions of our foreign subsidiaries are conducted in local currencies, limiting our exposure to changes in currency rates. We periodically enter into short term forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates on inventory purchases. The notional value of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at September 3, 2006 was $62 million. 31 Table of Contents 
 
Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) On November 15, 2005, upon the expiration of our $150 million bank credit facility in the U.S. with a group of nine banks, we terminated our $500 million commercial paper program. At August 28, 2005, no amounts were outstanding under the commercial paper program and no amounts were outstanding under the credit facility. The applicable interest rate on the credit facility at August 28, 2005, was 3.92%. Letters of Credit We have letter of credit facilities (for commercial and standby letters of credit) totaling $400 million. The outstanding commitments under these facilities at September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005 totaled $85 million and $131 million, respectively, including $55 million and $65 million, respectively, in standby letters of credit. Financing Activities In April 2003, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.92% in the aggregate amount of $34 million, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due in April 2010. In March 2002, we issued $300 million of 5 1/2% Senior Notes, carried at $301 million, due in March 2007. Interest is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15. Simultaneous with the issuance of the 5 1/2% Senior Notes, we entered into interest rate swap agreements converting the interest to a floating rate indexed to LIBOR. We plan to repay the 5 1/2% Senior Notes at maturity from our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances. In February 1996, we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a shelf registration statement for $500 million of senior debt securities. In October 2001, additional debt securities of $100 million were registered. The $300 million of 5 1/2% Senior Notes issued in March 2002 reduced the amount of registered securities available for future issuance to $300 million. In April 2006, we cancelled the shelf registration. During fiscal 2006, $191 million in principal amount of our 3 1/2% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes were converted by note holders into 6.5 million shares of common stock. The current Notes outstanding are convertible into a maximum of 2,925,057 shares of Costco common stock at an initial conversion price of $22.71. Derivatives We have limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and use them only to manage well defined interest rate and foreign exchange risks. Forward foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on inventory purchases and typically have very short terms. The aggregate notional amount, which approximates the fair value of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, was $63 million and $42 million, respectively. The majority of the forward foreign exchange contracts were entered into by our wholly owned United Kingdom subsidiary, primarily to hedge U.S. dollar merchandise inventory purchases. We also hold interest rate swaps to manage the interest rate risk associated with our borrowings and the mix of fixed rate and variable rate debt. As of September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, we had fixed to floating interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $300 million and an aggregate fair value of $1 million and $8 million, respectively. These amounts were recorded in deferred income taxes and other current assets as of September 3, 2006 and in other assets as of 26 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) August 28, 2005, in our consolidated balance sheets. These swaps were entered into effective March 25, 2002, and are designated and qualify as fair value hedges of our $300 million 5 1/2% Senior Notes. As the terms of the swaps match those of the underlying hedged debt, the changes in the fair value of these swaps are offset by corresponding changes in the carrying amount of the hedged debt and result in no net earnings impact. We are exposed to market risk for changes in utility commodity pricing, which we partially mitigate through the use of firm price contracts with counterparties for approximately 19% of our locations in the U.S. and Canada. The effects of these arrangements are not significant for any period presented. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements With the exception of our operating leases, we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition or consolidated financial statements. Stock Repurchase Programs Our Board of Directors has approved the following stock repurchase programs (000s): AmountApproved AmountRemaining August 2005 $ 1,000,000 $ 0 January 2006(1) 1,000,000 625,534 July 2006(2) 2,000,000 2,000,000 Total $ 4,000,000 $ 2,625,534 (1) Expires in January 2009. (2) Expires in July 2009. During fiscal 2005, we repurchased 9.2 million shares of common stock, at an average price of $44.89, totaling approximately $413 million. During fiscal 2006, we repurchased 28.4 million shares at an average price of $51.44, totaling approximately $1.46 billion. The amount available to be purchased under the approved plans was approximately $2.63 billion at September 3, 2006. Purchases are made from time to time as conditions warrant in the open market or in block purchases, or pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5 1. Repurchased shares are retired. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our financial statements requires that management make estimates and judgments that affect the financial position and results of operations. Management continues to review its accounting policies and evaluate its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, merchandise inventory valuation, impairment of long lived assets, warehouse closing costs, insurance/self insurance liabilities, stock based compensation and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances.

Revenue Recognition We recognize sales, net of estimated returns, at the time customers take possession of merchandise or receive services. When we collect payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of 27 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) merchandise or the performance of services, the amount received is recorded as deferred revenue on the balance sheet until the sale or service is completed. We provide for estimated sales returns based on historical returns levels. We evaluate the criteria of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal Versus Net as an Agent, in determining whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, when we are the primary obligor, subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, influence product or service specifications, or have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded on a gross basis. If we are not the primary obligor and do not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above, we record the net amounts as commissions earned, which is reflected in net sales. Membership fee revenue represents annual membership fees paid by substantially all of our members. We account for membership fee revenue on a deferred basis, whereby membership fee revenue is recognized ratably over one year. Our Executive members qualify for a 2% reward (which can be redeemed only at Costco warehouses), up to a maximum of $500 per year, on all qualified purchases made at Costco. We account for this 2% reward as a reduction in sales, with the related liability being classified within other current liabilities. Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, as determined primarily by the retail method of accounting, and are stated using the last in, first out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail method of accounting and are stated using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. We believe the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. We record an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the expected annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end. At both September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005 merchandise inventories valued at LIFO approximated FIFO after considering the lower of cost or market principle. We provide for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts as a percentage of net sales. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect the actual physical inventory count results, which generally occur in the second and fourth fiscal quarters of the fiscal year. Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as we progress toward earning those rebates, provided they are probable and reasonably estimable. Other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of agreement, or other systematic and rational approach. Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Warehouse Closing costs We periodically evaluate our long lived assets for indicators of impairment. Our judgments are based on existing market and operational conditions. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring an adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value. We provide estimates for warehouse closing costs based on applicable U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Future circumstances may result in actual closing costs or the amount recognized upon the sale of the property to differ substantially from the original estimates. 28 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Insurance/Self Insurance Liabilities We use a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance pool, to provide for potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property damage, director and officers liability, vehicle liability and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience and evaluations of outside expertise, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. StockBased Compensation We account for stockbased compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123R. We use the BlackScholes optionpricing model, which requires the input of subjective assumptions. These assumptions include: estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them (expected term); the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term (volatility), and the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements (forfeitures). Changes in these assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stockbased compensation. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, we ceased the granting of stock options in favor of restricted stock units. Income Taxes The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Significant judgment is required in assessing, among other things, the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items. We establish reserves when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable, we believe that certain positions may be successfully challenged. When facts and circumstances change, we adjust these reserves through our provision for income taxes. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in the Current Year Financial Statements (SAB 108). SAB 108 addresses how the effects of prior year uncorrected misstatements should be considered when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements. SAB 108 requires an entity to quantify misstatements using a balance sheet and income statement approach and to evaluate whether either approach results in quantifying an error that is material in light of relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. We early adopted SAB 108 as of August 29, 2005, the beginning of our fiscal year. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report for further discussion. In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157). SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements required under other accounting pronouncements but does not change existing guidance as to whether or not an instrument is carried at fair value. SFAS 157 is effective for our fiscal year 2008. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting SFAS 157. 29 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. FIN 48 is effective beginning in fiscal 2008. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting FIN 48. In June 2006, the FASB ratified the consensus reached on Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 06 03, How Sales Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities Should Be Presented in the Income Statement (that is, Gross Versus Net Presentation). The EITF reached a consensus that the presentation of taxes on either a gross or net basis is an accounting policy decision that requires disclosure. EITF 06 03 is effective for the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after December 15, 2006. Amounts collected from our members, which under common trade practices are referred to as sales taxes, are and have been recorded on a net basis. We have no intention of modifying this accounting policy. Therefore, the adoption of EITF 06 03 will not have any effect on our financial position or results of operations. In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, a Replacement of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 20, and FASB Statement No. 3. SFAS 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements for changes in accounting principles, unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change. SFAS 154 also requires that retrospective application of a change in accounting principle be limited to the direct effects of the change. Indirect effects of a change in accounting principle, such as a change in non discretionary profit sharing payments resulting from an accounting change, should be recognized in the period of the accounting change. SFAS 154 also requires that a change in depreciation, amortization, or depletion method for long lived, non financial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate effected by a change in accounting principle. SFAS 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. We will adopt the provisions of SFAS 154 beginning in fiscal 2007. We do not believe the adoption will have a significant effect on our future consolidated financial statements. 30 Table of Contents Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to financial market risk resulting from changes in interest and foreign currency rates. As a policy, we do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions, nor hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. The nature and amount of our long and short term debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As of September 3, 2006, our fixed rate long term debt included $129 million principal amount at maturity Zero Coupon Subordinated Notes carried at $88 million and additional notes and capital lease obligations totaling $135 million. Our debt also includes $300 million 51/2% Senior Notes carried at $301 million. We entered into fixed to floating interest rate swaps on the Senior Notes, effectively converting these fixed interest rate securities to variable rate securities. As of September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, we had fixed to floating interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $300 million and an aggregate fair value of $1 million and $8 million, respectively. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt and may affect the interest expense related to the variable rate debt. We hold interest bearing instruments that are classified as cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. Our investment policy is to manage our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances to preserve principal and liquidity, while seeking to maximize the return on our investment portfolio through the full investment of available funds. We diversify our investment portfolio by investing in multiple types of investment grade securities and through a combination of internal and third party investment management. Short term investments generally have a maturity of three months to five years from the purchase date. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. As the majority of these instruments are of a short term nature, if interest rates were to increase or decrease, there is no material risk of a valuation adjustment related to these instruments. For those instruments that are classified as available for sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in interest rates are reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss. Based on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances at September 3, 2006, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $9 million to interest income (pre tax) on an annual basis. Most transactions of our foreign subsidiaries are conducted in local currencies, limiting our exposure to changes in currency rates. We periodically enter into short term forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates on inventory purchases. The notional value of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at September 3, 2006 was $62 million. 31 Table of Contents

SFAS 154 also requires that a change in depreciation, amortization, or depletion method for long lived, non financial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate effected by a change in accounting principle. SFAS 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. We will adopt the provisions of SFAS 154 beginning in fiscal 2007. We do not believe the adoption will have a significant effect on our future consolidated financial statements. 30 Table of Contents Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to financial market risk resulting from changes in interest and foreign currency rates. As a policy, we do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions, nor hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. The nature and amount of our long and short term debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As of September 3, 2006, our fixed rate long term debt included $129 million principal amount at maturity Zero Coupon Subordinated Notes carried at $88 million and additional notes and capital lease obligations totaling $135 million. Our debt also includes $300 million 51/2% Senior Notes carried at $301 million. We entered into fixed to floating interest rate swaps on the Senior Notes, effectively converting these fixed interest rate securities to variable rate securities. As of September 3, 2006 and August 28, 2005, we had fixed to floating interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $300 million and an aggregate fair value of $1 million and $8 million, respectively. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt and may affect the interest expense related to the variable rate debt. We hold interest bearing instruments that are classified as cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. Our investment policy is to manage our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances to preserve principal and liquidity, while seeking to maximize the return on our investment portfolio through the full investment of available funds. We diversify our investment portfolio by investing in multiple types of investment grade securities and through a combination of internal and third party investment management. Short term investments generally have a maturity of three months to five years from the purchase date. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. As the majority of these instruments are of a short term nature, if interest rates were to increase or decrease, there is no material risk of a valuation adjustment related to these instruments. For those instruments that are classified as available for sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in interest rates are reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss. Based on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances at September 3, 2006, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $9 million to interest income (pre tax) on an annual basis. Most transactions of our foreign subsidiaries are conducted in local currencies, limiting our exposure to changes in currency rates. We periodically enter into short term forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates on inventory purchases. The notional value of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at September 3, 2006 was $62 million. 31 Table of Contents
