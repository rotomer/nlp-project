Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview Our fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to the end of August. Fiscal years 2007 and 2005 included 52 weeks. Fiscal year 2006 included 53 weeks, with the extra week included in the fiscal fourth quarter. Key items for fiscal year 2007 included: Net sales in fiscal 2007 (52 weeks) increased 7.0% over fiscal 2006 (53 weeks), driven by an increase in comparable sales (sales in warehouses open for at least one year) of 6% and the opening of 30 new warehouses; Membership fees for fiscal 2007 increased 10.5%, to $1.31 billion, primarily due to the $5 increase in our annual membership fee in 2006 for our non Executive members; Gross margin (net sales less merchandise costs) as a percentage of net sales decreased 3 basis points over the prior year; Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 22 basis points over the prior year; Net income for fiscal 2007 was $1.08 billion, or $2.37 per diluted share, compared to $1.10 billion, or $2.30 per diluted share, in fiscal 2006; On February 20, 2007, we issued $900 million of 5.3% Senior Notes due March 15, 2012 and $1.1 billion of 5.5% Senior Notes due March 15, 2017; The Board of Directors approved an increase in the quarterly cash dividend from $0.13 to $0.145 per share in April 2007; and We repurchased 36.4 million shares of our common stock, expending approximately $1.98 billion at an average cost of $54.39 per share. Results of Operations (dollars in thousands, except per share and warehouse number data) The following unusual items impacted fiscal 2007 results: Sales returns reserve: In connection with changes to our consumer electronics returns policy, we completed a review of historical data of trends in sales returns, which indicated a longer timeframe over which returns are received than was previously estimated. We revised our estimate of our sales returns reserve to include the longer timeframe, as well as a lower realization rate on certain returned items. The effect of the revisions to our estimated reserve resulted in a decrease in net sales of $452.6 million and a charge to gross margin of approximately $94.3 million. Employee tax consequences on stock options: In connection with the review of stock option grants and guidance issued by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service on November 30, 2006, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved a program intended to protect approximately 1,000 employees who are United States taxpayers from certain adverse tax consequences arising from that review. The program involved increasing the exercise prices on certain stock options granted from 2000 to 2003 and, in turn, making payments to employees in an amount approximately equal to the increase in the exercise price. While we are still examining the availability of similar alternatives for employees outside the United States, we recorded a charge in fiscal 2007 for the estimated amount to remedy adverse tax consequences related to stock options held and previously exercised by employees outside the United States. In aggregate, these charges totaled $47.3 million. 16 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Excise tax refund: We received a $10.1 million refund, related to fiscal 2002 through fiscal 2006, as a result of a settlement with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service relating to excise taxes previously paid. Deferred membership: In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, we performed a detailed analysis of the timing of recognition of membership fees based on each members specific renewal date (daily convention) as this methodology represented an improvement over our historical method (based on the period in which the fee was collected). This review resulted in a $56.2 million reduction to membership fee revenue and a corresponding increase to deferred membership fees on our consolidated balance sheet. This adjustment includes both a change in method of applying an accounting principle to a preferable method and a correction for cumulative timing errors. Prospectively, we will account for membership fee revenue on a deferred basis over the specific membership term using the daily convention. We believe it is helpful to disclose the effects of these items for purposes of providing a meaningful comparison of our current fiscal year results to prior fiscal years, as well as provide a more representative expectation of future operating results. The impact of each of these items noted above is presented below: Fiscal 2007 (amounts in thousands) Sales returnreserve Employee taxconsequences onstock options DeferredMembership Excise taxrefund Total Net sales $ (452,553 ) $ $ $ (452,553 ) Membership fees (56,183 ) (56,183 ) Total revenue (452,553 ) (56,183 ) (508,736 ) Merchandise costs 358,290 (157 ) 8,661 366,794 Gross margin(1) (94,263 ) (157 ) 8,661 (85,759 ) SG&A (47,115 ) 300 (46,815 ) Operating income (94,263 ) (47,272 ) (56,183 ) 8,961 (188,757 ) Interest expense (50 ) (50 ) Interest income and other (1,000 ) 1,090 90 Income before income taxes (95,263 ) (47,322 ) (56,183 ) 10,051 (188,717 ) Provision for income taxes 34,942 17,358 20,608 (3,687 ) 69,221 Net Income $ (60,321 ) (29,964 ) $ (35,575 ) 6,364 $ (119,496 ) (1) Net sales less merchandise costs. Net Sales Fiscal 2007 Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 Net sales $ 63,087,601 $ 58,963,180 $ 51,879,070 Effect of change in estimated sales returns reserve 452,553 Net sales, as adjusted $ 63,540,154 $ 58,963,180 $ 51,879,070 Net sales increase 7.0 % 13.7 % 10.0 % Net sales increase, as adjusted 7.8 % 13.7 % 10.0 % Increase in comparable warehouse sales 6 % 8 % 7 % Warehouse openings, net of relocations 30 25 16 17 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) 2007 vs. 2006 Net sales increased $4.13 billion, or 7.0% to $63.09 billion in fiscal 2007 (a 52 week fiscal year) from $58.96 billion in fiscal 2006 (a 53 week fiscal year). The $4.13 billion increase in net sales is comprised of $2.10 billion from the increase in comparable warehouse sales and $2.03 billion from sales at new warehouses opened during fiscal 2007 and 2006, partially offset by the change in the reserve for estimated sales returns. Changes in prices of merchandise did not materially affect the sales increase. Gasoline sales contributed to the $4.13 billion net sales growth by approximately $356.1 million, with approximately $17.8 million of this increase related to the increase in gasoline sales prices. Most of the comparable sales growth derived from increased amounts spent by members visiting our warehouses, while increases in frequency of shopping contributed slightly. Reported comparable sales growth includes the negative impact of cannibalization (established warehouses losing sales to our newly opened locations). Gasoline sales did not have a material impact on comparable warehouse sales growth. Changes in foreign currencies positively impacted comparable sales by approximately $418.4 million, or 72 basis points. In our fourth fiscal quarter, the decrease in our estimated sales returns reserve resulted in an increase to net sales of $57.9 million as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 where our reserve was increased, resulting in a decrease to net sales of $33.1 million. This improvement is primarily a result of the changes to our consumer electronics returns policy implemented in the spring of 2007. 2006 vs. 2005 Net sales increased 13.7% to $58.96 billion in fiscal 2006, from $51.88 billion in fiscal 2005. The increase in net sales was primarily due to: 8% from comparable warehouse sales growth; 3.7% increase primarily from warehouse sales excluded from the comparable warehouse sales calculation; and 2% from an additional week in fiscal 2006 as compared to the prior year. Gasoline sales positively impacted comparable warehouse sales growth by approximately 150 basis points. Changes in foreign currencies positively impacted comparable sales by approximately 90 basis points. Most of the comparable sales growth was derived from increased amounts spent by members visiting our warehouses, while increases in frequency of shopping contributed slightly. Comparable sales growth was slightly offset by cannibalization (established warehouses losing sales to our newly opened locations). Changes in prices of merchandise, with the exception of gasoline, did not materially affect the sales increase. Gasoline sales contributed to the 13.7% net sales growth by approximately 235 basis points in fiscal 2006, with approximately 70% of this increase related to the increase in gasoline sales prices. Membership Fees Fiscal 2007 Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 Membership fees $ 1,312,554 $ 1,188,047 $ 1,073,156 Adjustment to deferred membership balance 56,183 Membership fees, as adjusted $ 1,368,737 $ 1,188,047 $ 1,073,156 Membership fees increase 10.5 % 10.7 % 11.6 % Membership fees increase, as adjusted 15.2 % 10.7 % 11.6 % Membership fees as a percent of net sales 2.08 % 2.02 % 2.07 % Adjusted membership fees, as a percent of adjusted net sales 2.16 % 2.02 % 2.07 % Total cardholders 50,400 47,700 45,300 18 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) 2007 vs. 2006 Membership fees increased 10.5% to $1.31 billion, or 2.08% of net sales, in fiscal 2007 from $1.19 billion, or 2.02% of net sales, in fiscal 2006. Excluding the adjustment to deferred membership fees in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 discussed above, adjusted membership fees increased 15.2% from fiscal 2006. This increase was primarily due to: a five dollar increase in our annual membership fee for our U.S. and Canada Gold Star (individual), Business and Business Add on members, which was effective May 1, 2006 for new members and July 1, 2006 for existing members; increased penetration of the higher fee Executive Membership program; and additional membership sign ups at the 30 new warehouses opened in fiscal 2007. 2006 vs. 2005 Membership fees increased 10.7% to $1.19 billion, or 2.02% of net sales, in fiscal 2006 from $1.07 billion, or 2.07% of net sales, in fiscal 2005. This increase was primarily due to increased penetration of the Executive Membership program and additional membership sign ups at the 25 new warehouses opened in fiscal 2006. Gross Margin Fiscal 2007 Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 Gross margin $ 6,637,899 $ 6,217,683 $ 5,532,109 Unusual items 85,759 Gross margin, as adjusted $ 6,723,658 $ 6,217,683 $ 5,532,109 Gross margin increase 6.8 % 12.4 % 9.4 % Gross margin increase, as adjusted 8.1 % 12.4 % 9.4 % Gross margin as a percent of net sales 10.52 % 10.55 % 10.66 % Adjusted gross margin as a percent of adjusted net sales 10.58 % 10.55 % 10.66 % 2007 vs. 2006 Gross margin was $6.64 billion in fiscal 2007 or 10.52% of net sales, compared to $6.22 billion or 10.55% of net sales in fiscal 2006. Excluding the unusual items affecting net sales and gross margin in fiscal 2007, adjusted gross margin as a percentage of adjusted net sales was 10.58%, or an increase of 3 basis points as compared to fiscal 2006. This increase was primarily due to a 24 basis point increase in certain merchandise departments, largely food and sundries, as well as smaller increases in certain warehouse ancillary businesses, costco.com and our international operations, offset by a decrease in our hardlines and softlines categories of approximately 15 basis points. In addition, increased penetration of the Executive Membership two percent reward program and increased spending by Executive members negatively affected gross margin by six basis points. In our fourth fiscal quarter, the decrease in our reserve for estimated sales returns resulted in an improvement of gross margin of approximately 2 basis points. This improvement is primarily a result of the changes to our consumer electronics returns policy implemented in the spring of 2007. 2006 vs. 2005 Gross margin was $6.22 billion in fiscal 2006 or 10.55% of net sales, compared to $5.53 billion or 10.66% of net sales in fiscal 2005. This eleven basis point decrease reflected increased penetration of 19 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) the Executive Membership two percent reward program and increased spending by executive members, which decreased gross margin by ten basis points. Additionally, a decrease of four basis points in gross margin in our merchandise departments and warehouse ancillary businesses was primarily due to changes in the sales mix, with higher sales penetration of lower margin departments and slightly lower overall gross margins in our hardlines and softlines categories. These decreases were partially offset by a three basis point improvement related to valuing inventories following the last in first out (LIFO) method. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Fiscal 2007 Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 Selling, general and administrative expense (SG&A) $ 6,273,096 $ 5,732,141 $ 5,061,339 Unusual items (46,815 ) SG&A, as adjusted $ 6,226,281 $ 5,732,141 $ 5,061,339 SG&A a percent of net sales 9.94 % 9.72 % 9.76 % Adjusted SG&A as percent of adjusted net sales 9.80 % 9.72 % 9.76 % 2007 vs. 2006 SG&A expenses were $6.27 billion, or 9.94% of net sales in fiscal 2007, compared to $5.73 billion, or 9.72% of net sales in fiscal 2006. Excluding the unusual items affecting net sales and SG&A expenses in fiscal 2007, adjusted SG&A as a percentage of adjusted net sales was 9.80%, an increase of eight basis points. Of this increase, 3 basis points were primarily due to an increase in stock based compensation, and a net 5 basis points were due to an increase in warehouse payroll and benefits costs. The payroll increase was largely attributed to hourly rate increases that went into effect in March 2007 and a lower overall comparable warehouse sales increase. 2006 vs. 2005 SG&A expenses were $5.73 billion, or 9.72% of net sales in fiscal 2006, compared to $5.06 billion, or 9.76% of net sales in fiscal 2005. Improved warehouse and central operating costs positively impacted SG&A by approximately nine basis points, primarily due to increased expense leverage of warehouse payroll, which was positively impacted by strong comparable warehouse sales and a lower rate of increase in workers compensation costs. This improvement was partially offset by an increase in stock based compensation cost of approximately five basis points in fiscal 2006. Preopening Expenses Fiscal 2007 Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 Preopening expenses $ 55,163 $ 42,504 $ 53,230 Warehouse openings 30 28 21 Relocations (3 ) (5 ) Warehouse openings, net of relocations 30 25 16 Preopening expenses include costs incurred for startup operations related to new warehouses, warehouse remodel projects and the expansion of ancillary operations at existing warehouses. Preopening 20 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) expenses per warehouse opening can vary due to the timing of the opening relative to our fiscal year end, whether the warehouse is owned or leased, whether the opening is in an existing, new or international market and the number and magnitude of warehouse remodel projects. 2007 vs. 2006 Preopening expenses totaled $55.2 million in fiscal 2007 compared to $42.5 million in fiscal 2006. This increase is primarily due to increased warehouse remodel activity and international openings. 2006 vs. 2005 Preopening expenses totaled $42.5 million in fiscal 2006 compared to $53.2 million in fiscal 2005. During fiscal 2005, we adjusted our method of accounting for leases (entered into over the previous twenty years), primarily related to ground leases at certain owned warehouse locations that did not require rental payments during the period of construction. We recorded a cumulative pre tax, non cash charge of $16.0 million to preopening expenses in the second quarter of fiscal 2005. Excluding this charge, preopening expenses increased year over year, due to the increase in warehouse openings. Provision for Impaired Assets and Closing Costs, net Fiscal 2007 Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 Provision for impaired assets and closing costs, net: Warehouse closing expenses $ 15,887 $ 3,762 $ 11,619 Impairment of long lived assets 3,893 Net (gains) losses on the sale of real property (2,279 ) 1,691 881 Total $ 13,608 $ 5,453 $ 16,393 The provision primarily includes costs related to impairment of long lived assets, future lease obligations of warehouses that have been relocated to new facilities, accelerated depreciation on buildings to be demolished or sold and that are not otherwise impaired, and losses or gains resulting from the sale of real property. 2007 vs. 2006 The net provision for impaired assets and closing costs was $13.6 million in fiscal 2007, compared to $5.5 million in fiscal 2006. In fiscal 2007, approximately $13.0 million of this provision related to the acceleration of depreciation on ten buildings expected to be relocated in fiscal 2008. 2006 vs. 2005 The net provision for impaired assets and closing costs was $5.5 million in fiscal 2006, compared to $16.4 million in fiscal 2005. The provision for fiscal 2006 included charges of $3.8 million for warehouse closing expenses and $1.7 million for net losses on the sale of real property. The provision for fiscal 2005 included charges of $11.6 million for warehouse closing expenses, primarily related to lease obligations and accelerated building depreciation, $3.9 million for impairment of long lived assets, and $0.9 million for net losses on the sale of real property. 21 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) The reserve for warehouse closing costs, classified within other current liabilities, at the end of fiscal 2007 and 2006 included: September 2,2007 September 3,2006 Reserve for warehouse closing costs: Future lease obligations $ 6,086 $ 5,950 Other 737 1,091 Total $ 6,823 $ 7,041 Interest Expense Fiscal 2007 Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 Interest expense $ 64,079 $ 12,570 $ 34,437 2007 vs. 2006 Interest expense totaled $64.1 million in fiscal 2007, compared to $12.6 million in fiscal 2006. On February 20, 2007, we issued $900 million of 5.3% Senior Notes due March 15, 2012 (2012 Notes) at a discount of $2.5 million and $1.1 billion of 5.5% Senior Notes due March 15, 2017 (2017 Notes) at a discount of $5.9 million, (together the 2007 Senior Notes). The increase in interest expense for fiscal 2007 resulted primarily from the additional interest incurred related to the 2007 Senior Notes, offset by lower interest expense resulting from the repayment of the $300 million 5.5% Senior Notes (2002 Senior Notes) in March 2007. In addition, interest expense decreased on the 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes (Zero Coupon Notes) as note holders converted approximately $61.2 million in principal amount of the Zero Coupon Notes into common stock, or $42.3 million after factoring in the related debt discount. 2006 vs. 2005 Interest expense totaled $12.6 million in fiscal 2006, compared to $34.4 million in fiscal 2005. Interest expense in fiscal 2006 primarily included interest on the 2002 Senior Notes, the Zero Coupon Notes, and balances outstanding under our bank credit facilities and promissory notes. In fiscal 2005, interest expense also included interest on the 7 1/8% Senior Notes. The decrease in interest expense in fiscal 2006 resulted primarily from the repayment of the 7 1/8% Senior Notes in June 2005. In addition, interest expense decreased on the Zero Coupon Notes as note holders converted into common stock approximately $286.5 million in principal amount of the Zero Coupon Notes, or $188.9 million after factoring in the related debt discount. The amount of interest capitalized increased in fiscal 2006 due to increased warehouse openings, contributing to the decrease in interest expense, as both interest rates and the dollar amount of projects under construction increased. The overall decrease in interest expense in fiscal 2006 was partially offset by the increase in interest rates on the 2002 Senior Notes, which were swapped into variable rate debt in March 2002. Interest Income and Other Fiscal 2007 Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 Interest income $ 128,413 $ 113,712 $ 81,915 Earnings of affiliates 35,622 28,180 26,459 Minority interest and other 1,449 (3,537 ) 722 Interest Income and other $ 165,484 $ 138,355 $ 109,096 22 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) 2007 vs. 2006 Interest income and other totaled $165.5 million in fiscal 2007, compared to $138.4 million in fiscal 2006. This increase is largely due to the increase in our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments resulting from increased earnings from operations and the proceeds of the issuance of the 2007 Senior Notes, as well as an increase in the earnings of affiliates, primarily our investment in Costco Mexico (a 50% owned joint venture). 2006 vs. 2005 Interest income and other totaled $138.4 million in fiscal 2006, compared to $109.1 million in fiscal 2005. This increase primarily reflects increased interest income resulting from higher interest rates earned, as well as an extra week in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005. Provision for Income Taxes Fiscal 2007 Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 Income tax expense $ 627,219 $ 648,202 $ 485,870 Effective tax rate 36.68 % 37.01 % 31.37 % The effective income tax rate on earnings in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005 was 36.68%, 37.01% and 31.37%, respectively. The lower rate in fiscal 2005 was primarily attributable to a non recurring $54.2 million income tax benefit, primarily from the settlement of a transfer pricing dispute between the United States and Canada (covering the years 1996 2003) and a net tax benefit on excess foreign tax credits on unremitted foreign earnings subject to repatriation of $20.6 million. Excluding these benefits the effective income tax rate on earnings in fiscal 2005 would have been 36.20%. Net Income Fiscal 2007 Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 Net income $ 1,082,772 $ 1,103,215 $ 1,063,092 Unusual items (net of tax) 119,496 Net income, as adjusted $ 1,202,268 $ 1,103,215 $ 1,063,092 Diluted earnings per share $ 2.37 $ 2.30 $ 2.18 Shares used to calculate diluted net income per common share 457,641 480,341 492,035 Diluted earnings per share increase 3 % 6 % 18 % 2007 vs. 2006 Net income for fiscal 2007 was $1.08 billion, or $2.37 per diluted share, compared to $1.10 billion, or $2.30 per diluted share, during fiscal 2006. During fiscal 2007, we repurchased 36.4 million shares of common stock, favorably impacting earnings per diluted share by approximately $0.03. The unusual items previously discussed totaled $119.5 million, net of tax, or $0.26 per diluted share in fiscal 2007. Exclusive of these items, earnings for fiscal 2007 were $2.63 per diluted share, a 14% increase over the prior year. 23 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) 2006 vs. 2005 Net income for fiscal 2006 increased 3.8%, to $1.10 billion or $2.30 per diluted share, from $1.06 billion or $2.18 per diluted share, during fiscal 2005. During fiscal 2006, we repurchased 28.4 million shares of common stock, favorably impacting earnings per diluted share by approximately $0.02. The fiscal 2005 results included several non recurring items that in the aggregate positively impacted reported earnings for all of fiscal 2005 by approximately $0.14 per share: a $54.2 million (approximately $0.11 per diluted share) income tax benefit resulting primarily from the settlement of a transfer pricing dispute between the United States and Canada; a cumulative pre tax, non cash charge to preopening expenses of $16.0 million (approximately $0.02 per diluted share) related to a correction to our method of accounting for ground leases; and a net tax benefit with respect to excess foreign tax credits on unremitted foreign earnings recorded in the fourth quarter of $20.6 million (approximately $0.04 per diluted share). Exclusive of these items, fiscal 2005 earnings were $2.04 per diluted share. Fiscal 2006s earnings per diluted share represents an increase of 13% over that figure. Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table itemizes our most liquid assets (dollars in thousands): September 2,2007 September 3,2006 Cash and cash equivalents $ 2,779,733 $ 1,510,939 Short term investments 575,787 1,322,181 Total $ 3,355,520 $ 2,833,120 Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from warehouse operations and our existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances, which were $3.36 billion and $2.83 billion at September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, respectively. Of these balances, approximately $655.2 million and $593.6 million at September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, respectively, represented debit and credit card receivables, primarily related to weekend sales immediately prior to the year end close. The increase in our most liquid assets of $522.4 million to $3.36 billion at September 2, 2007 was due primarily to the issuance of the 2007 Senior Notes and the cash provided by our operating activities, offset by expenditures for the repurchase of our common stock and the acquisition of property and equipment related to warehouse expansion. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $2.08 billion in fiscal 2007 compared to $1.83 billion in fiscal 2006, an increase of $245.2 million. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in cash flow due to a decrease in our investment in net merchandise inventories (merchandise inventory less accounts payable) of $378.8 million, offset by a decrease in cash flow from operating assets and liabilities of $130.4 million. Net cash used in investing activities totaled $655.3 million in fiscal 2007 compared to $1.16 billion in fiscal 2006, respectively, a decrease of approximately $502.2 million. The decrease in cash used in investing activities relates primarily to an increase of $169.2 million in additions to property and equipment related to warehouse expansion and remodel projects, offset by an increase in cash provided by the net reductions in short term investments of $663.8 million. Net cash used in financing activities totaled $164.6 million in fiscal 2007 compared to $1.23 billion in fiscal 2006. The $1.1 billion decrease in net cash used in financing activities was primarily due to the issuance of the 2007 Senior Notes in February 2007, which provided approximately $1.99 billion in 24 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) proceeds. This was partially offset by the repurchase of common stock in fiscal 2007, which used $1.98 billion of cash, compared to $1.44 billion in fiscal 2006, an increase of approximately $534.8 million and the repayment of long term debt of $307.9 million related primarily to the 2002 Senior Notes retired in March 2007. Dividends In April 2007, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash dividend from $0.13 to $0.145 per share or $0.58 on an annualized basis. Our quarterly cash dividends paid in fiscal 2007 totaled $0.55 per share. In fiscal 2006, we paid quarterly cash dividends totaling $0.49 per share. Contractual Obligations Our commitments at fiscal year end to make future payments under contractual obligations were as follows, as of September 2, 2007 (amounts in thousands): Payments Due by Fiscal Year 2008 2009 to2010 2011 to2012 2013 andthereafter Total Contractual obligations Purchase obligations (merchandise)(1) $ 3,626,627 $ 1,357 $ $ $ 3,627,984 Long term debt(2) 173,160 277,652 1,116,400 1,470,117 3,037,329 Operating leases(3) 137,225 242,461 209,723 1,305,035 1,894,444 Purchase obligations (equipment, services and other)(4) 350,108 40,517 1,089 391,714 Construction Commitments 329,941 329,941 Capital lease obligations and other(2) 3,990 1,937 686 5,193 11,806 Other(5) 2,168 3,936 2,546 4,928 13,578 Total $ 4,623,219 $ 567,860 $ 1,330,444 $ 2,785,273 $ 9,306,796 (1) Includes open merchandise purchase orders.

(4) The amounts exclude certain services negotiated at the individual warehouse or regional level that are not significant and generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty. (5) Consists of asset retirement and deferred compensation obligations. Expansion Plans Our primary requirement for capital is the domestic and international financing of land, building and equipment costs for new and remodeled warehouses, plus the costs of initial warehouse operations and working capital requirements. While there can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized and plans are subject to change upon further review, it is managements current intention to spend approximately $1.6 billion to 25 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) $1.8 billion during fiscal 2008 for real estate, construction, remodeling and equipment for warehouse clubs and related operations. These expenditures are expected to be financed with a combination of cash provided from operations and the use of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. Plans for the United States and Canada during fiscal 2008 are to open approximately 38 to 42 new warehouses, inclusive of 8 to 10 relocations to larger and better located facilities. We expect to continue our review of expansion plans in our international operations, including the United Kingdom and Asia, along with other international markets. Additional Equity Investments in Subsidiaries and Joint Ventures In each of fiscal years 2006 and 2005, we contributed an additional $15 million to our investment in Costco Mexico (a 50% owned joint venture), which did not impact our percentage ownership of this entity, as our joint venture partner contributed a like amount. There were no such contributions in 2007. Bank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs (all amounts stated in U.S. dollars) A wholly owned Canadian subsidiary has a $189.8 million commercial paper program ($180.9 million at September 3, 2006) supported by a $113.9 million bank credit facility that expires in March 2008 ($54.2 million at September 3, 2006) with a Canadian bank, which we guarantee. At September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, no amounts were outstanding under the Canadian commercial paper program or the bank credit facility. Applicable interest rates on the credit facility at September 2, 2007, and September 3, 2006 were 5.00% and 4.65%, respectively. At September 2, 2007, standby letters of credit totaling $24.1 million issued under the bank credit facility left $89.8 million available for commercial paper support. At September 3, 2006, standby letters of credit totaling $20.8 million issued under the bank credit facility left $33.4 million available for commercial paper support. Our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary has a short term $38.7 million bank line of credit ($12.8 million at September 3, 2006) that expires in February 2008. At September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, $10.3 million and $2.5 million, respectively, were borrowed under the line of credit, and $8.6 million and $4.3 million, respectively, were used to support standby letters of credit. Applicable interest rates on the credit facility at September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, were 1.09% and 0.94%, respectively. A second $30.1 million bank line of credit also expires in February 2008. At September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, $7.8 million and $0.9 million, respectively, were borrowed under the second facility. Applicable interest rates on the second credit facility at September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, were 1.10% and 0.95%, respectively. Our Korean subsidiary has a short term $12.8 million bank line of credit ($12.5 million at September 3, 2006) which expires in March 2008. At September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, no amounts were borrowed under the line of credit and $2.0 million in both years was used to support standby letters of credit. Applicable interest rates on the credit facility at September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006 were 6.09% and 5.48%, respectively. Our Taiwan subsidiary has a $6.1 million bank revolving credit facility ($5.2 million at September 3, 2006) and a $3.0 million bank overdraft facility, both expiring in January 2008. At September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, no amounts were borrowed under the credit facility and $1.2 million and $1.9 million, respectively, were used to support standby letters of credit. Applicable interest rates on the credit facility at September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, were 4.50% and 4.00%, respectively. A second $15.2 million bank revolving credit facility is in place, which expires in July 2008. At September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, no amounts were borrowed under the second credit facility 26 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) and $4.2 million and $2.0 million, respectively, were used to support standby letters of credit. Applicable interest rates on the credit facility at September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, were 4.44% and 4.00%, respectively. A third $9.1 million bank revolving credit facility is in place, which expires in March 2008. At September 2, 2007 no amounts were borrowed under the third credit facility and no amounts were used to support standby letters of credit. The applicable interest rate on the credit facility at September 2, 2007 was 4.57%. Our wholly owned United Kingdom subsidiary has a $80.6 million bank revolving credit facility ($113.9 million at September 3, 2006) expiring in February 2010, a $70.5 million bank overdraft facility ($66.5 million at September 3, 2006), renewable on a yearly basis in May 2008, and a $40.3 million uncommitted money market line entered into in February 2007 and renewable on a yearly basis beginning in May 2008. At September 2, 2007, $20.1 million was outstanding under the revolving credit facility with an applicable interest rate of 6.23%, $15.6 million was outstanding under the uncommitted line with an applicable interest rate of 6.47% and no amounts were outstanding under the bank overdraft facility with an applicable interest rate of 6.75%. At September 3, 2006, $38.0 million was outstanding under the revolving credit facility, with an applicable interest rate of 5.32%, and no amounts were outstanding under the bank overdraft facility. Letters of Credit We have letter of credit facilities (for commercial and standby letters of credit) totaling $475.0 million. The outstanding commitments under these facilities at September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006 totaled $119.1 million and $84.9 million, respectively, including $71.7 million and $54.9 million, respectively, in standby letters of credit. Financing Activities On February 20, 2007, we issued $900 million of 5.3% Senior Notes due March 15, 2012 at a discount of $2.5 million and $1.1 billion of 5.5% Senior Notes due March 15, 2017 at a discount of $5.9 million (together, the 2007 Senior Notes). Interest on the 2007 Senior Notes is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year, with the first payment due on September 15, 2007. The net proceeds were used, in part, to repay the 2002 Senior Notes in March 2007, and the balance has been and will be used for general corporate purposes, including repurchases of our common stock. The $8.4 million discount and $2.0 million issuance costs associated with the 2007 Senior Notes are being amortized to interest expense over the terms of those notes. At our option, we may redeem the 2007 Senior Notes at any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest up to the redemption date. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount of the 2007 Senior Notes to be redeemed, or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, we will be required to make an offer to purchase the 2007 Senior Notes at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase, upon certain events as defined by the terms of the 2007 Senior Notes. In April 2003, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.92% in the aggregate amount of $34.4 million, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due in April 2010. In November 2002, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.88% in the aggregate amount of $25.8 million, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due in November 2009. In July 27 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) 2001, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued 1.187% promissory notes in the aggregate amount of $25.8 million, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due in July 2008. In October 2000, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued 2.070% promissory notes in the aggregate amount of $30.1 million, through a private placement. Interest is payable annually and principal is due in October 2007 and will be refinanced. As of September 2, 2007, the 1.187% and the 2.070% promissory notes are reported in the current portion of long term debt on our consolidated balance sheets. In August 1997, we completed the sale of $900.0 million principal amount at maturity Zero Coupon Notes due in August 2017. The Zero Coupon Notes were priced with a yield to maturity of 3.5%, resulting in gross proceeds to us of $449.6 million. The current Notes outstanding are convertible into a maximum of 1.5 million shares of Costco Common Stock shares at an initial conversion price of $22.71. Holders of the Zero Coupon Notes may require us to purchase the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of purchase) in August 2012. We may redeem, at our option, the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of redemption) any time in or after August 2002. As of September 2, 2007, $832.4 million in principal amount of the Zero Coupon Notes had been converted by note holders to shares of Costco Common Stock, of which $61.2 million and $286.5 million in principal were converted in fiscal 2007 and 2006, respectively, or $42.3 million and $188.9 million in fiscal 2007 and 2006, respectively, after factoring in the related debt discount. Derivatives We have limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and use them only to manage well defined interest rate and foreign exchange risks. Forward foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on inventory purchases and typically have very short terms. These forward contracts do not qualify for derivative hedge accounting. The aggregate notional amount, which approximates the fair value of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, was $75.0 million and $63.5 million, respectively. The mark to market adjustment related to these contracts was $0.9 million and $1.1 million at September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, respectively. The majority of the forward foreign exchange contracts were entered into by our wholly owned United Kingdom subsidiary, primarily to hedge U.S. dollar merchandise inventory purchases. Effective March 25, 2002, we entered into fixed to floating interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk associated with our 2002 Senior Notes, which matured and were retired in March 2007. The swaps were designated and qualified as fair value hedges of the debt. As the terms of the swaps matched those of the underlying hedged debt, changes in the fair value of the swaps were offset by corresponding changes in the carrying amount of the hedged debt and resulted in no net earnings impact. At September 3, 2006, the aggregate value of the swaps was $1 million and was recorded in deferred income taxes and other current assets in our consolidated balance sheets. In March 2007, upon maturity of the debt and expiration of the swap agreements, the aggregate fair value of the swaps was zero. We are exposed to market risk for changes in utility commodity pricing, which we partially mitigate through the use of firm price contracts with counterparties for approximately 23% of our locations in the U.S. and Canada. The effects of these arrangements are not significant for any period presented. 28 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements With the exception of our operating leases, we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition or consolidated financial statements. Stock Repurchase Programs In January and July of 2006, our Board of Directors approved an additional $1.00 billion and $2.00 billion of stock repurchases, respectively, which expire in 2009, bringing total authorizations by our Board of Directors since inception of the program in fiscal 2001 to $4.50 billion. Subsequent to the end of fiscal 2007, our Board of Directors approved an additional $300.0 million of stock repurchases, which expires in 2010. During fiscal 2007, we repurchased 36.4 million shares at an average price of $54.39 totaling approximately $1.98 billion. During fiscal 2006, we repurchased 28.4 million shares of common stock, at an average price of $51.44, totaling approximately $1.46 billion. The remaining amount available to be purchased under our approved plan was approximately $646.4 million at September 2, 2007. Purchases are made from time to time as conditions warrant in the open market or in block purchases, or pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5 1. Repurchased shares are retired. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments. We continue to review our accounting policies and evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, merchandise inventory valuation, impairment of long lived assets, warehouse closing costs, insurance/self insurance liabilities and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. Revenue Recognition We generally recognize sales, net of estimated returns, at the time the member takes possession of merchandise or receives services. When we collect payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services, the amount received is generally recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed. We provide for estimated sales returns based on historical merchandise returns levels. In connection with changes to our consumer electronics returns policy in the spring of 2007, we examined operational data regarding member return patterns that had not been previously analyzed. The data indicated a longer timeframe over which returns are received than previously used to estimate the sales return reserve. Accordingly, as previously disclosed, during fiscal 2007 we increased the reserve balance and recorded an adjustment to sales of $452.6 million and a pretax charge to income of $94.3 million for the related gross margin and disposition costs. We evaluate the criteria of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal Versus Net as an Agent, in determining whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, when we are the primary obligor, subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, influence product or service specifications, or have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded on a gross basis. If we are not the 29 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) primary obligor and do not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above, we record the net amounts as commissions earned, which is reflected in net sales. Membership fee revenue represents annual membership fees paid by substantially all of our members. We account for membership fee revenue on a deferred basis, whereby membership fee revenue is recognized ratably over one year. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, we performed a detailed analysis of the timing of recognition of membership fees based on each members specific renewal date as this methodology represented an improvement over our historical method, which was based on the period in which the fee was collected. This review resulted in a $56.2 million reduction to membership fee revenue and corresponding increase to deferred membership fees on our consolidated balance sheet. This adjustment includes both a change in method of applying an accounting principle to a preferable method and a correction for cumulative timing errors. Our Executive members qualify for a 2% reward (which can be redeemed only at Costco warehouses), up to a maximum of $500 per year, on all qualified purchases made at Costco. We account for this 2% reward as a reduction in sales, with the related liability being classified within other current liabilities. The sales reduction and corresponding liability are computed after giving effect to the estimated impact of non redemptions based on historical data. Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, as determined primarily by the retail method of accounting, and are stated using the last in, first out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail method of accounting and are stated using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. We believe the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. We record an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the expected annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at fiscal year end. At both September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006 merchandise inventories valued at LIFO approximated FIFO after considering the lower of cost or market principle. We provide for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts as a percentage of net sales. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect results of the actual physical inventory count, which generally occur in the second and fourth fiscal quarters of the fiscal year. Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as we progress toward earning those rebates, provided they are probable and reasonably estimable. Other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of agreement, or other systematic and rational approaches. Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Warehouse Closing costs We periodically evaluate our long lived assets for indicators of impairment, such as a decision to relocate or close a warehouse location. Our judgments are based on existing market and operational conditions. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring a downward adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value. We provide estimates for warehouse closing costs for both leased and owned locations to be closed or relocated. A considerable amount of judgment is involved in determining any impairment or our net 30 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) liability, particularly related to the estimated sales price of owned locations and the potential sublease income at leased locations. These estimates are based on real estate conditions in the markets and our experience in those markets. We make assumptions about the average period of time it would take to sublease the location and the amount of potential sublease income for each leased location. We reassess our liability each quarter and adjust our liability accordingly when our estimates change. Insurance/Self Insurance Liabilities We use a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance pool, to provide for potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property damage, director and officers liability, vehicle liability and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience and evaluations of outside experts, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Income Taxes The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Significant judgment is required in assessing, among other things, the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items. We establish reserves when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable, we determine that certain positions may be successfully challenged. When facts and circumstances change, we adjust these reserves through our provision for income taxes. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48), which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006 and we will adopt these new requirements as of the beginning of fiscal 2008. The estimated cumulative impact of adopting FIN 48 in fiscal 2008 is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157), which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements required under other accounting pronouncements, but does not change existing guidance as to whether or not an instrument is carried at fair value. SFAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. We must adopt these new requirements no later than our first quarter of fiscal 2009. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, Including an Amendment to FASB No. 115 (SFAS 159). Under SFAS 159, entities may elect to measure specified financial instruments and warranty and insurance contracts at fair value 31 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) on a contract by contract basis, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings each reporting period. The election, called the fair value option, will enable entities to achieve an offset accounting effect for changes in fair value of certain related assets and liabilities without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions. SFAS 159 is effective as of the beginning of a companys first fiscal year that begins after November 15, 2007. We must adopt these new requirements no later than our first quarter of fiscal 2009. We are in the process of evaluating the impact that adoption of SFAS 157 and SFAS 159 will have on our future consolidated financial statements. Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to financial market risk resulting from changes in interest and foreign currency rates. We do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions, nor hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. The nature and amount of our long and short term debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As of September 2, 2007, our fixed rate long term debt included $67.6 million principal amount at maturity of 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes carried at $47.8 million, $900.0 million of 5.3% Senior Notes carried at $897.8 million, $1.10 billion of 5.5% Senior Notes carried at $1.09 billion and additional notes and capital lease obligations totaling $127.9 million. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt. We hold interest bearing instruments that are classified as cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. Our investment policy is to manage our cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances to preserve principal and liquidity, while seeking to enhance the return on our investment portfolio through the investment of available funds. We diversify our investment portfolio by investing in multiple types of investment grade securities through a combination of internal and third party investment management. Short term investments generally have a maturity of three months to five years from the purchase date. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. As the majority of these instruments are of a short term nature, if interest rates were to increase or decrease, there is no material risk of a material valuation adjustment related to these instruments. For those instruments that are classified as available for sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in interest rates are reflected within stockholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss. Based on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances at September 2, 2007, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $15.2 million (pre tax) to interest income on an annual basis. Most transactions of our foreign subsidiaries are conducted in local currencies, limiting our exposure to changes in currency rates. We periodically enter into short term forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates on inventory purchases. The notional value of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at September 2, 2007 was $75.0 million. 32 Table of Contents 
 
Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Excise tax refund: We received a $10.1 million refund, related to fiscal 2002 through fiscal 2006, as a result of a settlement with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service relating to excise taxes previously paid. Deferred membership: In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, we performed a detailed analysis of the timing of recognition of membership fees based on each members specific renewal date (daily convention) as this methodology represented an improvement over our historical method (based on the period in which the fee was collected). This review resulted in a $56.2 million reduction to membership fee revenue and a corresponding increase to deferred membership fees on our consolidated balance sheet. This adjustment includes both a change in method of applying an accounting principle to a preferable method and a correction for cumulative timing errors. Prospectively, we will account for membership fee revenue on a deferred basis over the specific membership term using the daily convention. We believe it is helpful to disclose the effects of these items for purposes of providing a meaningful comparison of our current fiscal year results to prior fiscal years, as well as provide a more representative expectation of future operating results. The impact of each of these items noted above is presented below: Fiscal 2007 (amounts in thousands) Sales returnreserve Employee taxconsequences onstock options DeferredMembership Excise taxrefund Total Net sales $ (452,553 ) $ $ $ (452,553 ) Membership fees (56,183 ) (56,183 ) Total revenue (452,553 ) (56,183 ) (508,736 ) Merchandise costs 358,290 (157 ) 8,661 366,794 Gross margin(1) (94,263 ) (157 ) 8,661 (85,759 ) SG&A (47,115 ) 300 (46,815 ) Operating income (94,263 ) (47,272 ) (56,183 ) 8,961 (188,757 ) Interest expense (50 ) (50 ) Interest income and other (1,000 ) 1,090 90 Income before income taxes (95,263 ) (47,322 ) (56,183 ) 10,051 (188,717 ) Provision for income taxes 34,942 17,358 20,608 (3,687 ) 69,221 Net Income $ (60,321 ) (29,964 ) $ (35,575 ) 6,364 $ (119,496 ) (1) Net sales less merchandise costs.

The $4.13 billion increase in net sales is comprised of $2.10 billion from the increase in comparable warehouse sales and $2.03 billion from sales at new warehouses opened during fiscal 2007 and 2006, partially offset by the change in the reserve for estimated sales returns. Changes in prices of merchandise did not materially affect the sales increase. Gasoline sales contributed to the $4.13 billion net sales growth by approximately $356.1 million, with approximately $17.8 million of this increase related to the increase in gasoline sales prices. Most of the comparable sales growth derived from increased amounts spent by members visiting our warehouses, while increases in frequency of shopping contributed slightly. Reported comparable sales growth includes the negative impact of cannibalization (established warehouses losing sales to our newly opened locations). Gasoline sales did not have a material impact on comparable warehouse sales growth. Changes in foreign currencies positively impacted comparable sales by approximately $418.4 million, or 72 basis points. In our fourth fiscal quarter, the decrease in our estimated sales returns reserve resulted in an increase to net sales of $57.9 million as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 where our reserve was increased, resulting in a decrease to net sales of $33.1 million. This improvement is primarily a result of the changes to our consumer electronics returns policy implemented in the spring of 2007. 2006 vs. 2005 Net sales increased 13.7% to $58.96 billion in fiscal 2006, from $51.88 billion in fiscal 2005. The increase in net sales was primarily due to: 8% from comparable warehouse sales growth; 3.7% increase primarily from warehouse sales excluded from the comparable warehouse sales calculation; and 2% from an additional week in fiscal 2006 as compared to the prior year. Gasoline sales positively impacted comparable warehouse sales growth by approximately 150 basis points. Changes in foreign currencies positively impacted comparable sales by approximately 90 basis points. Most of the comparable sales growth was derived from increased amounts spent by members visiting our warehouses, while increases in frequency of shopping contributed slightly. Comparable sales growth was slightly offset by cannibalization (established warehouses losing sales to our newly opened locations). Changes in prices of merchandise, with the exception of gasoline, did not materially affect the sales increase. Gasoline sales contributed to the 13.7% net sales growth by approximately 235 basis points in fiscal 2006, with approximately 70% of this increase related to the increase in gasoline sales prices. Membership Fees Fiscal 2007 Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 Membership fees $ 1,312,554 $ 1,188,047 $ 1,073,156 Adjustment to deferred membership balance 56,183 Membership fees, as adjusted $ 1,368,737 $ 1,188,047 $ 1,073,156 Membership fees increase 10.5 % 10.7 % 11.6 % Membership fees increase, as adjusted 15.2 % 10.7 % 11.6 % Membership fees as a percent of net sales 2.08 % 2.02 % 2.07 % Adjusted membership fees, as a percent of adjusted net sales 2.16 % 2.02 % 2.07 % Total cardholders 50,400 47,700 45,300 18 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) 2007 vs. 2006 Membership fees increased 10.5% to $1.31 billion, or 2.08% of net sales, in fiscal 2007 from $1.19 billion, or 2.02% of net sales, in fiscal 2006. Excluding the adjustment to deferred membership fees in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 discussed above, adjusted membership fees increased 15.2% from fiscal 2006. This increase was primarily due to: a five dollar increase in our annual membership fee for our U.S. and Canada Gold Star (individual), Business and Business Add on members, which was effective May 1, 2006 for new members and July 1, 2006 for existing members; increased penetration of the higher fee Executive Membership program; and additional membership sign ups at the 30 new warehouses opened in fiscal 2007. 2006 vs. 2005 Membership fees increased 10.7% to $1.19 billion, or 2.02% of net sales, in fiscal 2006 from $1.07 billion, or 2.07% of net sales, in fiscal 2005. This increase was primarily due to increased penetration of the Executive Membership program and additional membership sign ups at the 25 new warehouses opened in fiscal 2006. Gross Margin Fiscal 2007 Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 Gross margin $ 6,637,899 $ 6,217,683 $ 5,532,109 Unusual items 85,759 Gross margin, as adjusted $ 6,723,658 $ 6,217,683 $ 5,532,109 Gross margin increase 6.8 % 12.4 % 9.4 % Gross margin increase, as adjusted 8.1 % 12.4 % 9.4 % Gross margin as a percent of net sales 10.52 % 10.55 % 10.66 % Adjusted gross margin as a percent of adjusted net sales 10.58 % 10.55 % 10.66 % 2007 vs. 2006 Gross margin was $6.64 billion in fiscal 2007 or 10.52% of net sales, compared to $6.22 billion or 10.55% of net sales in fiscal 2006. Excluding the unusual items affecting net sales and gross margin in fiscal 2007, adjusted gross margin as a percentage of adjusted net sales was 10.58%, or an increase of 3 basis points as compared to fiscal 2006. This increase was primarily due to a 24 basis point increase in certain merchandise departments, largely food and sundries, as well as smaller increases in certain warehouse ancillary businesses, costco.com and our international operations, offset by a decrease in our hardlines and softlines categories of approximately 15 basis points. In addition, increased penetration of the Executive Membership two percent reward program and increased spending by Executive members negatively affected gross margin by six basis points. In our fourth fiscal quarter, the decrease in our reserve for estimated sales returns resulted in an improvement of gross margin of approximately 2 basis points. This improvement is primarily a result of the changes to our consumer electronics returns policy implemented in the spring of 2007. 2006 vs. 2005 Gross margin was $6.22 billion in fiscal 2006 or 10.55% of net sales, compared to $5.53 billion or 10.66% of net sales in fiscal 2005. This eleven basis point decrease reflected increased penetration of 19 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) the Executive Membership two percent reward program and increased spending by executive members, which decreased gross margin by ten basis points. Additionally, a decrease of four basis points in gross margin in our merchandise departments and warehouse ancillary businesses was primarily due to changes in the sales mix, with higher sales penetration of lower margin departments and slightly lower overall gross margins in our hardlines and softlines categories. These decreases were partially offset by a three basis point improvement related to valuing inventories following the last in first out (LIFO) method. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Fiscal 2007 Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 Selling, general and administrative expense (SG&A) $ 6,273,096 $ 5,732,141 $ 5,061,339 Unusual items (46,815 ) SG&A, as adjusted $ 6,226,281 $ 5,732,141 $ 5,061,339 SG&A a percent of net sales 9.94 % 9.72 % 9.76 % Adjusted SG&A as percent of adjusted net sales 9.80 % 9.72 % 9.76 % 2007 vs. 2006 SG&A expenses were $6.27 billion, or 9.94% of net sales in fiscal 2007, compared to $5.73 billion, or 9.72% of net sales in fiscal 2006. Excluding the unusual items affecting net sales and SG&A expenses in fiscal 2007, adjusted SG&A as a percentage of adjusted net sales was 9.80%, an increase of eight basis points. Of this increase, 3 basis points were primarily due to an increase in stock based compensation, and a net 5 basis points were due to an increase in warehouse payroll and benefits costs. The payroll increase was largely attributed to hourly rate increases that went into effect in March 2007 and a lower overall comparable warehouse sales increase. 2006 vs. 2005 SG&A expenses were $5.73 billion, or 9.72% of net sales in fiscal 2006, compared to $5.06 billion, or 9.76% of net sales in fiscal 2005. Improved warehouse and central operating costs positively impacted SG&A by approximately nine basis points, primarily due to increased expense leverage of warehouse payroll, which was positively impacted by strong comparable warehouse sales and a lower rate of increase in workers compensation costs. This improvement was partially offset by an increase in stock based compensation cost of approximately five basis points in fiscal 2006. Preopening Expenses Fiscal 2007 Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 Preopening expenses $ 55,163 $ 42,504 $ 53,230 Warehouse openings 30 28 21 Relocations (3 ) (5 ) Warehouse openings, net of relocations 30 25 16 Preopening expenses include costs incurred for startup operations related to new warehouses, warehouse remodel projects and the expansion of ancillary operations at existing warehouses. Preopening 20 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) expenses per warehouse opening can vary due to the timing of the opening relative to our fiscal year end, whether the warehouse is owned or leased, whether the opening is in an existing, new or international market and the number and magnitude of warehouse remodel projects. 2007 vs. 2006 Preopening expenses totaled $55.2 million in fiscal 2007 compared to $42.5 million in fiscal 2006. This increase is primarily due to increased warehouse remodel activity and international openings. 2006 vs. 2005 Preopening expenses totaled $42.5 million in fiscal 2006 compared to $53.2 million in fiscal 2005. During fiscal 2005, we adjusted our method of accounting for leases (entered into over the previous twenty years), primarily related to ground leases at certain owned warehouse locations that did not require rental payments during the period of construction. We recorded a cumulative pre tax, non cash charge of $16.0 million to preopening expenses in the second quarter of fiscal 2005. Excluding this charge, preopening expenses increased year over year, due to the increase in warehouse openings. Provision for Impaired Assets and Closing Costs, net Fiscal 2007 Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 Provision for impaired assets and closing costs, net: Warehouse closing expenses $ 15,887 $ 3,762 $ 11,619 Impairment of long lived assets 3,893 Net (gains) losses on the sale of real property (2,279 ) 1,691 881 Total $ 13,608 $ 5,453 $ 16,393 The provision primarily includes costs related to impairment of long lived assets, future lease obligations of warehouses that have been relocated to new facilities, accelerated depreciation on buildings to be demolished or sold and that are not otherwise impaired, and losses or gains resulting from the sale of real property. 2007 vs. 2006 The net provision for impaired assets and closing costs was $13.6 million in fiscal 2007, compared to $5.5 million in fiscal 2006. In fiscal 2007, approximately $13.0 million of this provision related to the acceleration of depreciation on ten buildings expected to be relocated in fiscal 2008. 2006 vs. 2005 The net provision for impaired assets and closing costs was $5.5 million in fiscal 2006, compared to $16.4 million in fiscal 2005. The provision for fiscal 2006 included charges of $3.8 million for warehouse closing expenses and $1.7 million for net losses on the sale of real property. The provision for fiscal 2005 included charges of $11.6 million for warehouse closing expenses, primarily related to lease obligations and accelerated building depreciation, $3.9 million for impairment of long lived assets, and $0.9 million for net losses on the sale of real property. 21 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) The reserve for warehouse closing costs, classified within other current liabilities, at the end of fiscal 2007 and 2006 included: September 2,2007 September 3,2006 Reserve for warehouse closing costs: Future lease obligations $ 6,086 $ 5,950 Other 737 1,091 Total $ 6,823 $ 7,041 Interest Expense Fiscal 2007 Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 Interest expense $ 64,079 $ 12,570 $ 34,437 2007 vs. 2006 Interest expense totaled $64.1 million in fiscal 2007, compared to $12.6 million in fiscal 2006. On February 20, 2007, we issued $900 million of 5.3% Senior Notes due March 15, 2012 (2012 Notes) at a discount of $2.5 million and $1.1 billion of 5.5% Senior Notes due March 15, 2017 (2017 Notes) at a discount of $5.9 million, (together the 2007 Senior Notes). The increase in interest expense for fiscal 2007 resulted primarily from the additional interest incurred related to the 2007 Senior Notes, offset by lower interest expense resulting from the repayment of the $300 million 5.5% Senior Notes (2002 Senior Notes) in March 2007. In addition, interest expense decreased on the 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes (Zero Coupon Notes) as note holders converted approximately $61.2 million in principal amount of the Zero Coupon Notes into common stock, or $42.3 million after factoring in the related debt discount. 2006 vs. 2005 Interest expense totaled $12.6 million in fiscal 2006, compared to $34.4 million in fiscal 2005. Interest expense in fiscal 2006 primarily included interest on the 2002 Senior Notes, the Zero Coupon Notes, and balances outstanding under our bank credit facilities and promissory notes. In fiscal 2005, interest expense also included interest on the 7 1/8% Senior Notes. The decrease in interest expense in fiscal 2006 resulted primarily from the repayment of the 7 1/8% Senior Notes in June 2005. In addition, interest expense decreased on the Zero Coupon Notes as note holders converted into common stock approximately $286.5 million in principal amount of the Zero Coupon Notes, or $188.9 million after factoring in the related debt discount. The amount of interest capitalized increased in fiscal 2006 due to increased warehouse openings, contributing to the decrease in interest expense, as both interest rates and the dollar amount of projects under construction increased. The overall decrease in interest expense in fiscal 2006 was partially offset by the increase in interest rates on the 2002 Senior Notes, which were swapped into variable rate debt in March 2002. Interest Income and Other Fiscal 2007 Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 Interest income $ 128,413 $ 113,712 $ 81,915 Earnings of affiliates 35,622 28,180 26,459 Minority interest and other 1,449 (3,537 ) 722 Interest Income and other $ 165,484 $ 138,355 $ 109,096 22 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) 2007 vs. 2006 Interest income and other totaled $165.5 million in fiscal 2007, compared to $138.4 million in fiscal 2006. This increase is largely due to the increase in our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments resulting from increased earnings from operations and the proceeds of the issuance of the 2007 Senior Notes, as well as an increase in the earnings of affiliates, primarily our investment in Costco Mexico (a 50% owned joint venture). 2006 vs. 2005 Interest income and other totaled $138.4 million in fiscal 2006, compared to $109.1 million in fiscal 2005. This increase primarily reflects increased interest income resulting from higher interest rates earned, as well as an extra week in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005. Provision for Income Taxes Fiscal 2007 Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 Income tax expense $ 627,219 $ 648,202 $ 485,870 Effective tax rate 36.68 % 37.01 % 31.37 % The effective income tax rate on earnings in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005 was 36.68%, 37.01% and 31.37%, respectively. The lower rate in fiscal 2005 was primarily attributable to a non recurring $54.2 million income tax benefit, primarily from the settlement of a transfer pricing dispute between the United States and Canada (covering the years 1996 2003) and a net tax benefit on excess foreign tax credits on unremitted foreign earnings subject to repatriation of $20.6 million. Excluding these benefits the effective income tax rate on earnings in fiscal 2005 would have been 36.20%. Net Income Fiscal 2007 Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 Net income $ 1,082,772 $ 1,103,215 $ 1,063,092 Unusual items (net of tax) 119,496 Net income, as adjusted $ 1,202,268 $ 1,103,215 $ 1,063,092 Diluted earnings per share $ 2.37 $ 2.30 $ 2.18 Shares used to calculate diluted net income per common share 457,641 480,341 492,035 Diluted earnings per share increase 3 % 6 % 18 % 2007 vs. 2006 Net income for fiscal 2007 was $1.08 billion, or $2.37 per diluted share, compared to $1.10 billion, or $2.30 per diluted share, during fiscal 2006. During fiscal 2007, we repurchased 36.4 million shares of common stock, favorably impacting earnings per diluted share by approximately $0.03. The unusual items previously discussed totaled $119.5 million, net of tax, or $0.26 per diluted share in fiscal 2007. Exclusive of these items, earnings for fiscal 2007 were $2.63 per diluted share, a 14% increase over the prior year. 23 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) 2006 vs. 2005 Net income for fiscal 2006 increased 3.8%, to $1.10 billion or $2.30 per diluted share, from $1.06 billion or $2.18 per diluted share, during fiscal 2005. During fiscal 2006, we repurchased 28.4 million shares of common stock, favorably impacting earnings per diluted share by approximately $0.02. The fiscal 2005 results included several non recurring items that in the aggregate positively impacted reported earnings for all of fiscal 2005 by approximately $0.14 per share: a $54.2 million (approximately $0.11 per diluted share) income tax benefit resulting primarily from the settlement of a transfer pricing dispute between the United States and Canada; a cumulative pre tax, non cash charge to preopening expenses of $16.0 million (approximately $0.02 per diluted share) related to a correction to our method of accounting for ground leases; and a net tax benefit with respect to excess foreign tax credits on unremitted foreign earnings recorded in the fourth quarter of $20.6 million (approximately $0.04 per diluted share). Exclusive of these items, fiscal 2005 earnings were $2.04 per diluted share. Fiscal 2006s earnings per diluted share represents an increase of 13% over that figure. Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table itemizes our most liquid assets (dollars in thousands): September 2,2007 September 3,2006 Cash and cash equivalents $ 2,779,733 $ 1,510,939 Short term investments 575,787 1,322,181 Total $ 3,355,520 $ 2,833,120 Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from warehouse operations and our existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances, which were $3.36 billion and $2.83 billion at September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, respectively. Of these balances, approximately $655.2 million and $593.6 million at September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, respectively, represented debit and credit card receivables, primarily related to weekend sales immediately prior to the year end close. The increase in our most liquid assets of $522.4 million to $3.36 billion at September 2, 2007 was due primarily to the issuance of the 2007 Senior Notes and the cash provided by our operating activities, offset by expenditures for the repurchase of our common stock and the acquisition of property and equipment related to warehouse expansion. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $2.08 billion in fiscal 2007 compared to $1.83 billion in fiscal 2006, an increase of $245.2 million. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in cash flow due to a decrease in our investment in net merchandise inventories (merchandise inventory less accounts payable) of $378.8 million, offset by a decrease in cash flow from operating assets and liabilities of $130.4 million. Net cash used in investing activities totaled $655.3 million in fiscal 2007 compared to $1.16 billion in fiscal 2006, respectively, a decrease of approximately $502.2 million. The decrease in cash used in investing activities relates primarily to an increase of $169.2 million in additions to property and equipment related to warehouse expansion and remodel projects, offset by an increase in cash provided by the net reductions in short term investments of $663.8 million. Net cash used in financing activities totaled $164.6 million in fiscal 2007 compared to $1.23 billion in fiscal 2006. The $1.1 billion decrease in net cash used in financing activities was primarily due to the issuance of the 2007 Senior Notes in February 2007, which provided approximately $1.99 billion in 24 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) proceeds. This was partially offset by the repurchase of common stock in fiscal 2007, which used $1.98 billion of cash, compared to $1.44 billion in fiscal 2006, an increase of approximately $534.8 million and the repayment of long term debt of $307.9 million related primarily to the 2002 Senior Notes retired in March 2007. Dividends In April 2007, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash dividend from $0.13 to $0.145 per share or $0.58 on an annualized basis. Our quarterly cash dividends paid in fiscal 2007 totaled $0.55 per share. In fiscal 2006, we paid quarterly cash dividends totaling $0.49 per share. Contractual Obligations Our commitments at fiscal year end to make future payments under contractual obligations were as follows, as of September 2, 2007 (amounts in thousands): Payments Due by Fiscal Year 2008 2009 to2010 2011 to2012 2013 andthereafter Total Contractual obligations Purchase obligations (merchandise)(1) $ 3,626,627 $ 1,357 $ $ $ 3,627,984 Long term debt(2) 173,160 277,652 1,116,400 1,470,117 3,037,329 Operating leases(3) 137,225 242,461 209,723 1,305,035 1,894,444 Purchase obligations (equipment, services and other)(4) 350,108 40,517 1,089 391,714 Construction Commitments 329,941 329,941 Capital lease obligations and other(2) 3,990 1,937 686 5,193 11,806 Other(5) 2,168 3,936 2,546 4,928 13,578 Total $ 4,623,219 $ 567,860 $ 1,330,444 $ 2,785,273 $ 9,306,796 (1) Includes open merchandise purchase orders. (2) Amounts include contractual interest payments. (3) Operating lease obligations exclude amounts commonly referred to as common area maintenance, taxes and insurance and have been reduced by $149,407 to reflect sub lease income. (4) The amounts exclude certain services negotiated at the individual warehouse or regional level that are not significant and generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty. (5) Consists of asset retirement and deferred compensation obligations. Expansion Plans Our primary requirement for capital is the domestic and international financing of land, building and equipment costs for new and remodeled warehouses, plus the costs of initial warehouse operations and working capital requirements. While there can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized and plans are subject to change upon further review, it is managements current intention to spend approximately $1.6 billion to 25 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) $1.8 billion during fiscal 2008 for real estate, construction, remodeling and equipment for warehouse clubs and related operations. These expenditures are expected to be financed with a combination of cash provided from operations and the use of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. Plans for the United States and Canada during fiscal 2008 are to open approximately 38 to 42 new warehouses, inclusive of 8 to 10 relocations to larger and better located facilities. We expect to continue our review of expansion plans in our international operations, including the United Kingdom and Asia, along with other international markets. Additional Equity Investments in Subsidiaries and Joint Ventures In each of fiscal years 2006 and 2005, we contributed an additional $15 million to our investment in Costco Mexico (a 50% owned joint venture), which did not impact our percentage ownership of this entity, as our joint venture partner contributed a like amount. There were no such contributions in 2007. Bank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs (all amounts stated in U.S. dollars) A wholly owned Canadian subsidiary has a $189.8 million commercial paper program ($180.9 million at September 3, 2006) supported by a $113.9 million bank credit facility that expires in March 2008 ($54.2 million at September 3, 2006) with a Canadian bank, which we guarantee.

At September 3, 2006, $38.0 million was outstanding under the revolving credit facility, with an applicable interest rate of 5.32%, and no amounts were outstanding under the bank overdraft facility. Letters of Credit We have letter of credit facilities (for commercial and standby letters of credit) totaling $475.0 million. The outstanding commitments under these facilities at September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006 totaled $119.1 million and $84.9 million, respectively, including $71.7 million and $54.9 million, respectively, in standby letters of credit. Financing Activities On February 20, 2007, we issued $900 million of 5.3% Senior Notes due March 15, 2012 at a discount of $2.5 million and $1.1 billion of 5.5% Senior Notes due March 15, 2017 at a discount of $5.9 million (together, the 2007 Senior Notes). Interest on the 2007 Senior Notes is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year, with the first payment due on September 15, 2007. The net proceeds were used, in part, to repay the 2002 Senior Notes in March 2007, and the balance has been and will be used for general corporate purposes, including repurchases of our common stock. The $8.4 million discount and $2.0 million issuance costs associated with the 2007 Senior Notes are being amortized to interest expense over the terms of those notes. At our option, we may redeem the 2007 Senior Notes at any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest up to the redemption date. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount of the 2007 Senior Notes to be redeemed, or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, we will be required to make an offer to purchase the 2007 Senior Notes at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase, upon certain events as defined by the terms of the 2007 Senior Notes. In April 2003, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.92% in the aggregate amount of $34.4 million, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due in April 2010. In November 2002, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.88% in the aggregate amount of $25.8 million, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due in November 2009. In July 27 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) 2001, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued 1.187% promissory notes in the aggregate amount of $25.8 million, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due in July 2008. In October 2000, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued 2.070% promissory notes in the aggregate amount of $30.1 million, through a private placement. Interest is payable annually and principal is due in October 2007 and will be refinanced. As of September 2, 2007, the 1.187% and the 2.070% promissory notes are reported in the current portion of long term debt on our consolidated balance sheets. In August 1997, we completed the sale of $900.0 million principal amount at maturity Zero Coupon Notes due in August 2017. The Zero Coupon Notes were priced with a yield to maturity of 3.5%, resulting in gross proceeds to us of $449.6 million. The current Notes outstanding are convertible into a maximum of 1.5 million shares of Costco Common Stock shares at an initial conversion price of $22.71. Holders of the Zero Coupon Notes may require us to purchase the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of purchase) in August 2012. We may redeem, at our option, the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of redemption) any time in or after August 2002. As of September 2, 2007, $832.4 million in principal amount of the Zero Coupon Notes had been converted by note holders to shares of Costco Common Stock, of which $61.2 million and $286.5 million in principal were converted in fiscal 2007 and 2006, respectively, or $42.3 million and $188.9 million in fiscal 2007 and 2006, respectively, after factoring in the related debt discount. Derivatives We have limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and use them only to manage well defined interest rate and foreign exchange risks. Forward foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on inventory purchases and typically have very short terms. These forward contracts do not qualify for derivative hedge accounting. The aggregate notional amount, which approximates the fair value of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, was $75.0 million and $63.5 million, respectively. The mark to market adjustment related to these contracts was $0.9 million and $1.1 million at September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, respectively. The majority of the forward foreign exchange contracts were entered into by our wholly owned United Kingdom subsidiary, primarily to hedge U.S. dollar merchandise inventory purchases. Effective March 25, 2002, we entered into fixed to floating interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk associated with our 2002 Senior Notes, which matured and were retired in March 2007. The swaps were designated and qualified as fair value hedges of the debt. As the terms of the swaps matched those of the underlying hedged debt, changes in the fair value of the swaps were offset by corresponding changes in the carrying amount of the hedged debt and resulted in no net earnings impact. At September 3, 2006, the aggregate value of the swaps was $1 million and was recorded in deferred income taxes and other current assets in our consolidated balance sheets. In March 2007, upon maturity of the debt and expiration of the swap agreements, the aggregate fair value of the swaps was zero. We are exposed to market risk for changes in utility commodity pricing, which we partially mitigate through the use of firm price contracts with counterparties for approximately 23% of our locations in the U.S. and Canada. The effects of these arrangements are not significant for any period presented. 28 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements With the exception of our operating leases, we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition or consolidated financial statements. Stock Repurchase Programs In January and July of 2006, our Board of Directors approved an additional $1.00 billion and $2.00 billion of stock repurchases, respectively, which expire in 2009, bringing total authorizations by our Board of Directors since inception of the program in fiscal 2001 to $4.50 billion. Subsequent to the end of fiscal 2007, our Board of Directors approved an additional $300.0 million of stock repurchases, which expires in 2010. During fiscal 2007, we repurchased 36.4 million shares at an average price of $54.39 totaling approximately $1.98 billion. During fiscal 2006, we repurchased 28.4 million shares of common stock, at an average price of $51.44, totaling approximately $1.46 billion. The remaining amount available to be purchased under our approved plan was approximately $646.4 million at September 2, 2007. Purchases are made from time to time as conditions warrant in the open market or in block purchases, or pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5 1. Repurchased shares are retired. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments. We continue to review our accounting policies and evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, merchandise inventory valuation, impairment of long lived assets, warehouse closing costs, insurance/self insurance liabilities and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. Revenue Recognition We generally recognize sales, net of estimated returns, at the time the member takes possession of merchandise or receives services. When we collect payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services, the amount received is generally recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed. We provide for estimated sales returns based on historical merchandise returns levels. In connection with changes to our consumer electronics returns policy in the spring of 2007, we examined operational data regarding member return patterns that had not been previously analyzed. The data indicated a longer timeframe over which returns are received than previously used to estimate the sales return reserve. Accordingly, as previously disclosed, during fiscal 2007 we increased the reserve balance and recorded an adjustment to sales of $452.6 million and a pretax charge to income of $94.3 million for the related gross margin and disposition costs. We evaluate the criteria of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal Versus Net as an Agent, in determining whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, when we are the primary obligor, subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, influence product or service specifications, or have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded on a gross basis. If we are not the 29 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) primary obligor and do not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above, we record the net amounts as commissions earned, which is reflected in net sales. Membership fee revenue represents annual membership fees paid by substantially all of our members. We account for membership fee revenue on a deferred basis, whereby membership fee revenue is recognized ratably over one year. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, we performed a detailed analysis of the timing of recognition of membership fees based on each members specific renewal date as this methodology represented an improvement over our historical method, which was based on the period in which the fee was collected. This review resulted in a $56.2 million reduction to membership fee revenue and corresponding increase to deferred membership fees on our consolidated balance sheet. This adjustment includes both a change in method of applying an accounting principle to a preferable method and a correction for cumulative timing errors. Our Executive members qualify for a 2% reward (which can be redeemed only at Costco warehouses), up to a maximum of $500 per year, on all qualified purchases made at Costco. We account for this 2% reward as a reduction in sales, with the related liability being classified within other current liabilities. The sales reduction and corresponding liability are computed after giving effect to the estimated impact of non redemptions based on historical data. Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, as determined primarily by the retail method of accounting, and are stated using the last in, first out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail method of accounting and are stated using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. We believe the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. We record an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the expected annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at fiscal year end. At both September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006 merchandise inventories valued at LIFO approximated FIFO after considering the lower of cost or market principle. We provide for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts as a percentage of net sales. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect results of the actual physical inventory count, which generally occur in the second and fourth fiscal quarters of the fiscal year. Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as we progress toward earning those rebates, provided they are probable and reasonably estimable. Other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of agreement, or other systematic and rational approaches. Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Warehouse Closing costs We periodically evaluate our long lived assets for indicators of impairment, such as a decision to relocate or close a warehouse location. Our judgments are based on existing market and operational conditions. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring a downward adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value. We provide estimates for warehouse closing costs for both leased and owned locations to be closed or relocated. A considerable amount of judgment is involved in determining any impairment or our net 30 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) liability, particularly related to the estimated sales price of owned locations and the potential sublease income at leased locations. These estimates are based on real estate conditions in the markets and our experience in those markets. We make assumptions about the average period of time it would take to sublease the location and the amount of potential sublease income for each leased location. We reassess our liability each quarter and adjust our liability accordingly when our estimates change. Insurance/Self Insurance Liabilities We use a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance pool, to provide for potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property damage, director and officers liability, vehicle liability and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience and evaluations of outside experts, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Income Taxes The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Significant judgment is required in assessing, among other things, the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items. We establish reserves when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable, we determine that certain positions may be successfully challenged. When facts and circumstances change, we adjust these reserves through our provision for income taxes. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48), which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006 and we will adopt these new requirements as of the beginning of fiscal 2008. The estimated cumulative impact of adopting FIN 48 in fiscal 2008 is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157), which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements required under other accounting pronouncements, but does not change existing guidance as to whether or not an instrument is carried at fair value. SFAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. We must adopt these new requirements no later than our first quarter of fiscal 2009. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, Including an Amendment to FASB No. 115 (SFAS 159). Under SFAS 159, entities may elect to measure specified financial instruments and warranty and insurance contracts at fair value 31 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) on a contract by contract basis, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings each reporting period. The election, called the fair value option, will enable entities to achieve an offset accounting effect for changes in fair value of certain related assets and liabilities without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions. SFAS 159 is effective as of the beginning of a companys first fiscal year that begins after November 15, 2007. We must adopt these new requirements no later than our first quarter of fiscal 2009. We are in the process of evaluating the impact that adoption of SFAS 157 and SFAS 159 will have on our future consolidated financial statements. Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to financial market risk resulting from changes in interest and foreign currency rates. We do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions, nor hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. The nature and amount of our long and short term debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As of September 2, 2007, our fixed rate long term debt included $67.6 million principal amount at maturity of 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes carried at $47.8 million, $900.0 million of 5.3% Senior Notes carried at $897.8 million, $1.10 billion of 5.5% Senior Notes carried at $1.09 billion and additional notes and capital lease obligations totaling $127.9 million. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt. We hold interest bearing instruments that are classified as cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. Our investment policy is to manage our cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances to preserve principal and liquidity, while seeking to enhance the return on our investment portfolio through the investment of available funds. We diversify our investment portfolio by investing in multiple types of investment grade securities through a combination of internal and third party investment management. Short term investments generally have a maturity of three months to five years from the purchase date. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. As the majority of these instruments are of a short term nature, if interest rates were to increase or decrease, there is no material risk of a material valuation adjustment related to these instruments. For those instruments that are classified as available for sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in interest rates are reflected within stockholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss. Based on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances at September 2, 2007, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $15.2 million (pre tax) to interest income on an annual basis. Most transactions of our foreign subsidiaries are conducted in local currencies, limiting our exposure to changes in currency rates. We periodically enter into short term forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates on inventory purchases. The notional value of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at September 2, 2007 was $75.0 million. 32 Table of Contents 
 
Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) 2007 vs. 2006 Net sales increased $4.13 billion, or 7.0% to $63.09 billion in fiscal 2007 (a 52 week fiscal year) from $58.96 billion in fiscal 2006 (a 53 week fiscal year). The $4.13 billion increase in net sales is comprised of $2.10 billion from the increase in comparable warehouse sales and $2.03 billion from sales at new warehouses opened during fiscal 2007 and 2006, partially offset by the change in the reserve for estimated sales returns. Changes in prices of merchandise did not materially affect the sales increase. Gasoline sales contributed to the $4.13 billion net sales growth by approximately $356.1 million, with approximately $17.8 million of this increase related to the increase in gasoline sales prices. Most of the comparable sales growth derived from increased amounts spent by members visiting our warehouses, while increases in frequency of shopping contributed slightly. Reported comparable sales growth includes the negative impact of cannibalization (established warehouses losing sales to our newly opened locations). Gasoline sales did not have a material impact on comparable warehouse sales growth. Changes in foreign currencies positively impacted comparable sales by approximately $418.4 million, or 72 basis points. In our fourth fiscal quarter, the decrease in our estimated sales returns reserve resulted in an increase to net sales of $57.9 million as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 where our reserve was increased, resulting in a decrease to net sales of $33.1 million. This improvement is primarily a result of the changes to our consumer electronics returns policy implemented in the spring of 2007. 2006 vs. 2005 Net sales increased 13.7% to $58.96 billion in fiscal 2006, from $51.88 billion in fiscal 2005. The increase in net sales was primarily due to: 8% from comparable warehouse sales growth; 3.7% increase primarily from warehouse sales excluded from the comparable warehouse sales calculation; and 2% from an additional week in fiscal 2006 as compared to the prior year. Gasoline sales positively impacted comparable warehouse sales growth by approximately 150 basis points. Changes in foreign currencies positively impacted comparable sales by approximately 90 basis points. Most of the comparable sales growth was derived from increased amounts spent by members visiting our warehouses, while increases in frequency of shopping contributed slightly. Comparable sales growth was slightly offset by cannibalization (established warehouses losing sales to our newly opened locations). Changes in prices of merchandise, with the exception of gasoline, did not materially affect the sales increase. Gasoline sales contributed to the 13.7% net sales growth by approximately 235 basis points in fiscal 2006, with approximately 70% of this increase related to the increase in gasoline sales prices. Membership Fees Fiscal 2007 Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 Membership fees $ 1,312,554 $ 1,188,047 $ 1,073,156 Adjustment to deferred membership balance 56,183 Membership fees, as adjusted $ 1,368,737 $ 1,188,047 $ 1,073,156 Membership fees increase 10.5 % 10.7 % 11.6 % Membership fees increase, as adjusted 15.2 % 10.7 % 11.6 % Membership fees as a percent of net sales 2.08 % 2.02 % 2.07 % Adjusted membership fees, as a percent of adjusted net sales 2.16 % 2.02 % 2.07 % Total cardholders 50,400 47,700 45,300 18 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) 2007 vs. 2006 Membership fees increased 10.5% to $1.31 billion, or 2.08% of net sales, in fiscal 2007 from $1.19 billion, or 2.02% of net sales, in fiscal 2006. Excluding the adjustment to deferred membership fees in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 discussed above, adjusted membership fees increased 15.2% from fiscal 2006. This increase was primarily due to: a five dollar increase in our annual membership fee for our U.S. and Canada Gold Star (individual), Business and Business Add on members, which was effective May 1, 2006 for new members and July 1, 2006 for existing members; increased penetration of the higher fee Executive Membership program; and additional membership sign ups at the 30 new warehouses opened in fiscal 2007. 2006 vs. 2005 Membership fees increased 10.7% to $1.19 billion, or 2.02% of net sales, in fiscal 2006 from $1.07 billion, or 2.07% of net sales, in fiscal 2005. This increase was primarily due to increased penetration of the Executive Membership program and additional membership sign ups at the 25 new warehouses opened in fiscal 2006. Gross Margin Fiscal 2007 Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 Gross margin $ 6,637,899 $ 6,217,683 $ 5,532,109 Unusual items 85,759 Gross margin, as adjusted $ 6,723,658 $ 6,217,683 $ 5,532,109 Gross margin increase 6.8 % 12.4 % 9.4 % Gross margin increase, as adjusted 8.1 % 12.4 % 9.4 % Gross margin as a percent of net sales 10.52 % 10.55 % 10.66 % Adjusted gross margin as a percent of adjusted net sales 10.58 % 10.55 % 10.66 % 2007 vs. 2006 Gross margin was $6.64 billion in fiscal 2007 or 10.52% of net sales, compared to $6.22 billion or 10.55% of net sales in fiscal 2006. Excluding the unusual items affecting net sales and gross margin in fiscal 2007, adjusted gross margin as a percentage of adjusted net sales was 10.58%, or an increase of 3 basis points as compared to fiscal 2006. This increase was primarily due to a 24 basis point increase in certain merchandise departments, largely food and sundries, as well as smaller increases in certain warehouse ancillary businesses, costco.com and our international operations, offset by a decrease in our hardlines and softlines categories of approximately 15 basis points. In addition, increased penetration of the Executive Membership two percent reward program and increased spending by Executive members negatively affected gross margin by six basis points. In our fourth fiscal quarter, the decrease in our reserve for estimated sales returns resulted in an improvement of gross margin of approximately 2 basis points. This improvement is primarily a result of the changes to our consumer electronics returns policy implemented in the spring of 2007. 2006 vs. 2005 Gross margin was $6.22 billion in fiscal 2006 or 10.55% of net sales, compared to $5.53 billion or 10.66% of net sales in fiscal 2005. This eleven basis point decrease reflected increased penetration of 19 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) the Executive Membership two percent reward program and increased spending by executive members, which decreased gross margin by ten basis points. Additionally, a decrease of four basis points in gross margin in our merchandise departments and warehouse ancillary businesses was primarily due to changes in the sales mix, with higher sales penetration of lower margin departments and slightly lower overall gross margins in our hardlines and softlines categories. These decreases were partially offset by a three basis point improvement related to valuing inventories following the last in first out (LIFO) method. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Fiscal 2007 Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 Selling, general and administrative expense (SG&A) $ 6,273,096 $ 5,732,141 $ 5,061,339 Unusual items (46,815 ) SG&A, as adjusted $ 6,226,281 $ 5,732,141 $ 5,061,339 SG&A a percent of net sales 9.94 % 9.72 % 9.76 % Adjusted SG&A as percent of adjusted net sales 9.80 % 9.72 % 9.76 % 2007 vs. 2006 SG&A expenses were $6.27 billion, or 9.94% of net sales in fiscal 2007, compared to $5.73 billion, or 9.72% of net sales in fiscal 2006. Excluding the unusual items affecting net sales and SG&A expenses in fiscal 2007, adjusted SG&A as a percentage of adjusted net sales was 9.80%, an increase of eight basis points. Of this increase, 3 basis points were primarily due to an increase in stock based compensation, and a net 5 basis points were due to an increase in warehouse payroll and benefits costs. The payroll increase was largely attributed to hourly rate increases that went into effect in March 2007 and a lower overall comparable warehouse sales increase. 2006 vs. 2005 SG&A expenses were $5.73 billion, or 9.72% of net sales in fiscal 2006, compared to $5.06 billion, or 9.76% of net sales in fiscal 2005. Improved warehouse and central operating costs positively impacted SG&A by approximately nine basis points, primarily due to increased expense leverage of warehouse payroll, which was positively impacted by strong comparable warehouse sales and a lower rate of increase in workers compensation costs. This improvement was partially offset by an increase in stock based compensation cost of approximately five basis points in fiscal 2006. Preopening Expenses Fiscal 2007 Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 Preopening expenses $ 55,163 $ 42,504 $ 53,230 Warehouse openings 30 28 21 Relocations (3 ) (5 ) Warehouse openings, net of relocations 30 25 16 Preopening expenses include costs incurred for startup operations related to new warehouses, warehouse remodel projects and the expansion of ancillary operations at existing warehouses. Preopening 20 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) expenses per warehouse opening can vary due to the timing of the opening relative to our fiscal year end, whether the warehouse is owned or leased, whether the opening is in an existing, new or international market and the number and magnitude of warehouse remodel projects. 2007 vs. 2006 Preopening expenses totaled $55.2 million in fiscal 2007 compared to $42.5 million in fiscal 2006. This increase is primarily due to increased warehouse remodel activity and international openings. 2006 vs. 2005 Preopening expenses totaled $42.5 million in fiscal 2006 compared to $53.2 million in fiscal 2005. During fiscal 2005, we adjusted our method of accounting for leases (entered into over the previous twenty years), primarily related to ground leases at certain owned warehouse locations that did not require rental payments during the period of construction. We recorded a cumulative pre tax, non cash charge of $16.0 million to preopening expenses in the second quarter of fiscal 2005. Excluding this charge, preopening expenses increased year over year, due to the increase in warehouse openings. Provision for Impaired Assets and Closing Costs, net Fiscal 2007 Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 Provision for impaired assets and closing costs, net: Warehouse closing expenses $ 15,887 $ 3,762 $ 11,619 Impairment of long lived assets 3,893 Net (gains) losses on the sale of real property (2,279 ) 1,691 881 Total $ 13,608 $ 5,453 $ 16,393 The provision primarily includes costs related to impairment of long lived assets, future lease obligations of warehouses that have been relocated to new facilities, accelerated depreciation on buildings to be demolished or sold and that are not otherwise impaired, and losses or gains resulting from the sale of real property. 2007 vs. 2006 The net provision for impaired assets and closing costs was $13.6 million in fiscal 2007, compared to $5.5 million in fiscal 2006. In fiscal 2007, approximately $13.0 million of this provision related to the acceleration of depreciation on ten buildings expected to be relocated in fiscal 2008. 2006 vs. 2005 The net provision for impaired assets and closing costs was $5.5 million in fiscal 2006, compared to $16.4 million in fiscal 2005. The provision for fiscal 2006 included charges of $3.8 million for warehouse closing expenses and $1.7 million for net losses on the sale of real property. The provision for fiscal 2005 included charges of $11.6 million for warehouse closing expenses, primarily related to lease obligations and accelerated building depreciation, $3.9 million for impairment of long lived assets, and $0.9 million for net losses on the sale of real property. 21 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) The reserve for warehouse closing costs, classified within other current liabilities, at the end of fiscal 2007 and 2006 included: September 2,2007 September 3,2006 Reserve for warehouse closing costs: Future lease obligations $ 6,086 $ 5,950 Other 737 1,091 Total $ 6,823 $ 7,041 Interest Expense Fiscal 2007 Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 Interest expense $ 64,079 $ 12,570 $ 34,437 2007 vs. 2006 Interest expense totaled $64.1 million in fiscal 2007, compared to $12.6 million in fiscal 2006. On February 20, 2007, we issued $900 million of 5.3% Senior Notes due March 15, 2012 (2012 Notes) at a discount of $2.5 million and $1.1 billion of 5.5% Senior Notes due March 15, 2017 (2017 Notes) at a discount of $5.9 million, (together the 2007 Senior Notes). The increase in interest expense for fiscal 2007 resulted primarily from the additional interest incurred related to the 2007 Senior Notes, offset by lower interest expense resulting from the repayment of the $300 million 5.5% Senior Notes (2002 Senior Notes) in March 2007. In addition, interest expense decreased on the 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes (Zero Coupon Notes) as note holders converted approximately $61.2 million in principal amount of the Zero Coupon Notes into common stock, or $42.3 million after factoring in the related debt discount. 2006 vs. 2005 Interest expense totaled $12.6 million in fiscal 2006, compared to $34.4 million in fiscal 2005. Interest expense in fiscal 2006 primarily included interest on the 2002 Senior Notes, the Zero Coupon Notes, and balances outstanding under our bank credit facilities and promissory notes. In fiscal 2005, interest expense also included interest on the 7 1/8% Senior Notes. The decrease in interest expense in fiscal 2006 resulted primarily from the repayment of the 7 1/8% Senior Notes in June 2005. In addition, interest expense decreased on the Zero Coupon Notes as note holders converted into common stock approximately $286.5 million in principal amount of the Zero Coupon Notes, or $188.9 million after factoring in the related debt discount. The amount of interest capitalized increased in fiscal 2006 due to increased warehouse openings, contributing to the decrease in interest expense, as both interest rates and the dollar amount of projects under construction increased. The overall decrease in interest expense in fiscal 2006 was partially offset by the increase in interest rates on the 2002 Senior Notes, which were swapped into variable rate debt in March 2002. Interest Income and Other Fiscal 2007 Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 Interest income $ 128,413 $ 113,712 $ 81,915 Earnings of affiliates 35,622 28,180 26,459 Minority interest and other 1,449 (3,537 ) 722 Interest Income and other $ 165,484 $ 138,355 $ 109,096 22 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) 2007 vs. 2006 Interest income and other totaled $165.5 million in fiscal 2007, compared to $138.4 million in fiscal 2006. This increase is largely due to the increase in our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments resulting from increased earnings from operations and the proceeds of the issuance of the 2007 Senior Notes, as well as an increase in the earnings of affiliates, primarily our investment in Costco Mexico (a 50% owned joint venture). 2006 vs. 2005 Interest income and other totaled $138.4 million in fiscal 2006, compared to $109.1 million in fiscal 2005. This increase primarily reflects increased interest income resulting from higher interest rates earned, as well as an extra week in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005. Provision for Income Taxes Fiscal 2007 Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 Income tax expense $ 627,219 $ 648,202 $ 485,870 Effective tax rate 36.68 % 37.01 % 31.37 % The effective income tax rate on earnings in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005 was 36.68%, 37.01% and 31.37%, respectively. The lower rate in fiscal 2005 was primarily attributable to a non recurring $54.2 million income tax benefit, primarily from the settlement of a transfer pricing dispute between the United States and Canada (covering the years 1996 2003) and a net tax benefit on excess foreign tax credits on unremitted foreign earnings subject to repatriation of $20.6 million. Excluding these benefits the effective income tax rate on earnings in fiscal 2005 would have been 36.20%. Net Income Fiscal 2007 Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 Net income $ 1,082,772 $ 1,103,215 $ 1,063,092 Unusual items (net of tax) 119,496 Net income, as adjusted $ 1,202,268 $ 1,103,215 $ 1,063,092 Diluted earnings per share $ 2.37 $ 2.30 $ 2.18 Shares used to calculate diluted net income per common share 457,641 480,341 492,035 Diluted earnings per share increase 3 % 6 % 18 % 2007 vs. 2006 Net income for fiscal 2007 was $1.08 billion, or $2.37 per diluted share, compared to $1.10 billion, or $2.30 per diluted share, during fiscal 2006. During fiscal 2007, we repurchased 36.4 million shares of common stock, favorably impacting earnings per diluted share by approximately $0.03. The unusual items previously discussed totaled $119.5 million, net of tax, or $0.26 per diluted share in fiscal 2007. Exclusive of these items, earnings for fiscal 2007 were $2.63 per diluted share, a 14% increase over the prior year. 23 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) 2006 vs. 2005 Net income for fiscal 2006 increased 3.8%, to $1.10 billion or $2.30 per diluted share, from $1.06 billion or $2.18 per diluted share, during fiscal 2005. During fiscal 2006, we repurchased 28.4 million shares of common stock, favorably impacting earnings per diluted share by approximately $0.02. The fiscal 2005 results included several non recurring items that in the aggregate positively impacted reported earnings for all of fiscal 2005 by approximately $0.14 per share: a $54.2 million (approximately $0.11 per diluted share) income tax benefit resulting primarily from the settlement of a transfer pricing dispute between the United States and Canada; a cumulative pre tax, non cash charge to preopening expenses of $16.0 million (approximately $0.02 per diluted share) related to a correction to our method of accounting for ground leases; and a net tax benefit with respect to excess foreign tax credits on unremitted foreign earnings recorded in the fourth quarter of $20.6 million (approximately $0.04 per diluted share). Exclusive of these items, fiscal 2005 earnings were $2.04 per diluted share. Fiscal 2006s earnings per diluted share represents an increase of 13% over that figure. Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table itemizes our most liquid assets (dollars in thousands): September 2,2007 September 3,2006 Cash and cash equivalents $ 2,779,733 $ 1,510,939 Short term investments 575,787 1,322,181 Total $ 3,355,520 $ 2,833,120 Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from warehouse operations and our existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances, which were $3.36 billion and $2.83 billion at September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, respectively. Of these balances, approximately $655.2 million and $593.6 million at September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, respectively, represented debit and credit card receivables, primarily related to weekend sales immediately prior to the year end close. The increase in our most liquid assets of $522.4 million to $3.36 billion at September 2, 2007 was due primarily to the issuance of the 2007 Senior Notes and the cash provided by our operating activities, offset by expenditures for the repurchase of our common stock and the acquisition of property and equipment related to warehouse expansion. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $2.08 billion in fiscal 2007 compared to $1.83 billion in fiscal 2006, an increase of $245.2 million. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in cash flow due to a decrease in our investment in net merchandise inventories (merchandise inventory less accounts payable) of $378.8 million, offset by a decrease in cash flow from operating assets and liabilities of $130.4 million. Net cash used in investing activities totaled $655.3 million in fiscal 2007 compared to $1.16 billion in fiscal 2006, respectively, a decrease of approximately $502.2 million. The decrease in cash used in investing activities relates primarily to an increase of $169.2 million in additions to property and equipment related to warehouse expansion and remodel projects, offset by an increase in cash provided by the net reductions in short term investments of $663.8 million. Net cash used in financing activities totaled $164.6 million in fiscal 2007 compared to $1.23 billion in fiscal 2006. The $1.1 billion decrease in net cash used in financing activities was primarily due to the issuance of the 2007 Senior Notes in February 2007, which provided approximately $1.99 billion in 24 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) proceeds. This was partially offset by the repurchase of common stock in fiscal 2007, which used $1.98 billion of cash, compared to $1.44 billion in fiscal 2006, an increase of approximately $534.8 million and the repayment of long term debt of $307.9 million related primarily to the 2002 Senior Notes retired in March 2007. Dividends In April 2007, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash dividend from $0.13 to $0.145 per share or $0.58 on an annualized basis. Our quarterly cash dividends paid in fiscal 2007 totaled $0.55 per share. In fiscal 2006, we paid quarterly cash dividends totaling $0.49 per share. Contractual Obligations Our commitments at fiscal year end to make future payments under contractual obligations were as follows, as of September 2, 2007 (amounts in thousands): Payments Due by Fiscal Year 2008 2009 to2010 2011 to2012 2013 andthereafter Total Contractual obligations Purchase obligations (merchandise)(1) $ 3,626,627 $ 1,357 $ $ $ 3,627,984 Long term debt(2) 173,160 277,652 1,116,400 1,470,117 3,037,329 Operating leases(3) 137,225 242,461 209,723 1,305,035 1,894,444 Purchase obligations (equipment, services and other)(4) 350,108 40,517 1,089 391,714 Construction Commitments 329,941 329,941 Capital lease obligations and other(2) 3,990 1,937 686 5,193 11,806 Other(5) 2,168 3,936 2,546 4,928 13,578 Total $ 4,623,219 $ 567,860 $ 1,330,444 $ 2,785,273 $ 9,306,796 (1) Includes open merchandise purchase orders. (2) Amounts include contractual interest payments. (3) Operating lease obligations exclude amounts commonly referred to as common area maintenance, taxes and insurance and have been reduced by $149,407 to reflect sub lease income. (4) The amounts exclude certain services negotiated at the individual warehouse or regional level that are not significant and generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty. (5) Consists of asset retirement and deferred compensation obligations. Expansion Plans Our primary requirement for capital is the domestic and international financing of land, building and equipment costs for new and remodeled warehouses, plus the costs of initial warehouse operations and working capital requirements. While there can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized and plans are subject to change upon further review, it is managements current intention to spend approximately $1.6 billion to 25 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) $1.8 billion during fiscal 2008 for real estate, construction, remodeling and equipment for warehouse clubs and related operations. These expenditures are expected to be financed with a combination of cash provided from operations and the use of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. Plans for the United States and Canada during fiscal 2008 are to open approximately 38 to 42 new warehouses, inclusive of 8 to 10 relocations to larger and better located facilities. We expect to continue our review of expansion plans in our international operations, including the United Kingdom and Asia, along with other international markets. Additional Equity Investments in Subsidiaries and Joint Ventures In each of fiscal years 2006 and 2005, we contributed an additional $15 million to our investment in Costco Mexico (a 50% owned joint venture), which did not impact our percentage ownership of this entity, as our joint venture partner contributed a like amount. There were no such contributions in 2007. Bank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs (all amounts stated in U.S. dollars) A wholly owned Canadian subsidiary has a $189.8 million commercial paper program ($180.9 million at September 3, 2006) supported by a $113.9 million bank credit facility that expires in March 2008 ($54.2 million at September 3, 2006) with a Canadian bank, which we guarantee. At September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, no amounts were outstanding under the Canadian commercial paper program or the bank credit facility. Applicable interest rates on the credit facility at September 2, 2007, and September 3, 2006 were 5.00% and 4.65%, respectively. At September 2, 2007, standby letters of credit totaling $24.1 million issued under the bank credit facility left $89.8 million available for commercial paper support. At September 3, 2006, standby letters of credit totaling $20.8 million issued under the bank credit facility left $33.4 million available for commercial paper support. Our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary has a short term $38.7 million bank line of credit ($12.8 million at September 3, 2006) that expires in February 2008. At September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, $10.3 million and $2.5 million, respectively, were borrowed under the line of credit, and $8.6 million and $4.3 million, respectively, were used to support standby letters of credit. Applicable interest rates on the credit facility at September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, were 1.09% and 0.94%, respectively. A second $30.1 million bank line of credit also expires in February 2008. At September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, $7.8 million and $0.9 million, respectively, were borrowed under the second facility. Applicable interest rates on the second credit facility at September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, were 1.10% and 0.95%, respectively. Our Korean subsidiary has a short term $12.8 million bank line of credit ($12.5 million at September 3, 2006) which expires in March 2008. At September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, no amounts were borrowed under the line of credit and $2.0 million in both years was used to support standby letters of credit. Applicable interest rates on the credit facility at September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006 were 6.09% and 5.48%, respectively. Our Taiwan subsidiary has a $6.1 million bank revolving credit facility ($5.2 million at September 3, 2006) and a $3.0 million bank overdraft facility, both expiring in January 2008. At September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, no amounts were borrowed under the credit facility and $1.2 million and $1.9 million, respectively, were used to support standby letters of credit. Applicable interest rates on the credit facility at September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, were 4.50% and 4.00%, respectively. A second $15.2 million bank revolving credit facility is in place, which expires in July 2008. At September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, no amounts were borrowed under the second credit facility 26 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) and $4.2 million and $2.0 million, respectively, were used to support standby letters of credit. Applicable interest rates on the credit facility at September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, were 4.44% and 4.00%, respectively. A third $9.1 million bank revolving credit facility is in place, which expires in March 2008. At September 2, 2007 no amounts were borrowed under the third credit facility and no amounts were used to support standby letters of credit. The applicable interest rate on the credit facility at September 2, 2007 was 4.57%. Our wholly owned United Kingdom subsidiary has a $80.6 million bank revolving credit facility ($113.9 million at September 3, 2006) expiring in February 2010, a $70.5 million bank overdraft facility ($66.5 million at September 3, 2006), renewable on a yearly basis in May 2008, and a $40.3 million uncommitted money market line entered into in February 2007 and renewable on a yearly basis beginning in May 2008. At September 2, 2007, $20.1 million was outstanding under the revolving credit facility with an applicable interest rate of 6.23%, $15.6 million was outstanding under the uncommitted line with an applicable interest rate of 6.47% and no amounts were outstanding under the bank overdraft facility with an applicable interest rate of 6.75%. At September 3, 2006, $38.0 million was outstanding under the revolving credit facility, with an applicable interest rate of 5.32%, and no amounts were outstanding under the bank overdraft facility. Letters of Credit We have letter of credit facilities (for commercial and standby letters of credit) totaling $475.0 million. The outstanding commitments under these facilities at September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006 totaled $119.1 million and $84.9 million, respectively, including $71.7 million and $54.9 million, respectively, in standby letters of credit. Financing Activities On February 20, 2007, we issued $900 million of 5.3% Senior Notes due March 15, 2012 at a discount of $2.5 million and $1.1 billion of 5.5% Senior Notes due March 15, 2017 at a discount of $5.9 million (together, the 2007 Senior Notes). Interest on the 2007 Senior Notes is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year, with the first payment due on September 15, 2007. The net proceeds were used, in part, to repay the 2002 Senior Notes in March 2007, and the balance has been and will be used for general corporate purposes, including repurchases of our common stock. The $8.4 million discount and $2.0 million issuance costs associated with the 2007 Senior Notes are being amortized to interest expense over the terms of those notes. At our option, we may redeem the 2007 Senior Notes at any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest up to the redemption date. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount of the 2007 Senior Notes to be redeemed, or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, we will be required to make an offer to purchase the 2007 Senior Notes at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase, upon certain events as defined by the terms of the 2007 Senior Notes. In April 2003, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.92% in the aggregate amount of $34.4 million, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due in April 2010. In November 2002, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.88% in the aggregate amount of $25.8 million, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due in November 2009. In July 27 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) 2001, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued 1.187% promissory notes in the aggregate amount of $25.8 million, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due in July 2008. In October 2000, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued 2.070% promissory notes in the aggregate amount of $30.1 million, through a private placement. Interest is payable annually and principal is due in October 2007 and will be refinanced. As of September 2, 2007, the 1.187% and the 2.070% promissory notes are reported in the current portion of long term debt on our consolidated balance sheets. In August 1997, we completed the sale of $900.0 million principal amount at maturity Zero Coupon Notes due in August 2017. The Zero Coupon Notes were priced with a yield to maturity of 3.5%, resulting in gross proceeds to us of $449.6 million. The current Notes outstanding are convertible into a maximum of 1.5 million shares of Costco Common Stock shares at an initial conversion price of $22.71. Holders of the Zero Coupon Notes may require us to purchase the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of purchase) in August 2012. We may redeem, at our option, the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of redemption) any time in or after August 2002. As of September 2, 2007, $832.4 million in principal amount of the Zero Coupon Notes had been converted by note holders to shares of Costco Common Stock, of which $61.2 million and $286.5 million in principal were converted in fiscal 2007 and 2006, respectively, or $42.3 million and $188.9 million in fiscal 2007 and 2006, respectively, after factoring in the related debt discount. Derivatives We have limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and use them only to manage well defined interest rate and foreign exchange risks. Forward foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on inventory purchases and typically have very short terms. These forward contracts do not qualify for derivative hedge accounting. The aggregate notional amount, which approximates the fair value of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, was $75.0 million and $63.5 million, respectively. The mark to market adjustment related to these contracts was $0.9 million and $1.1 million at September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, respectively. The majority of the forward foreign exchange contracts were entered into by our wholly owned United Kingdom subsidiary, primarily to hedge U.S. dollar merchandise inventory purchases. Effective March 25, 2002, we entered into fixed to floating interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk associated with our 2002 Senior Notes, which matured and were retired in March 2007. The swaps were designated and qualified as fair value hedges of the debt. As the terms of the swaps matched those of the underlying hedged debt, changes in the fair value of the swaps were offset by corresponding changes in the carrying amount of the hedged debt and resulted in no net earnings impact. At September 3, 2006, the aggregate value of the swaps was $1 million and was recorded in deferred income taxes and other current assets in our consolidated balance sheets. In March 2007, upon maturity of the debt and expiration of the swap agreements, the aggregate fair value of the swaps was zero. We are exposed to market risk for changes in utility commodity pricing, which we partially mitigate through the use of firm price contracts with counterparties for approximately 23% of our locations in the U.S. and Canada. The effects of these arrangements are not significant for any period presented. 28 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements With the exception of our operating leases, we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition or consolidated financial statements. Stock Repurchase Programs In January and July of 2006, our Board of Directors approved an additional $1.00 billion and $2.00 billion of stock repurchases, respectively, which expire in 2009, bringing total authorizations by our Board of Directors since inception of the program in fiscal 2001 to $4.50 billion. Subsequent to the end of fiscal 2007, our Board of Directors approved an additional $300.0 million of stock repurchases, which expires in 2010. During fiscal 2007, we repurchased 36.4 million shares at an average price of $54.39 totaling approximately $1.98 billion. During fiscal 2006, we repurchased 28.4 million shares of common stock, at an average price of $51.44, totaling approximately $1.46 billion. The remaining amount available to be purchased under our approved plan was approximately $646.4 million at September 2, 2007. Purchases are made from time to time as conditions warrant in the open market or in block purchases, or pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5 1. Repurchased shares are retired. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments. We continue to review our accounting policies and evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, merchandise inventory valuation, impairment of long lived assets, warehouse closing costs, insurance/self insurance liabilities and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. Revenue Recognition We generally recognize sales, net of estimated returns, at the time the member takes possession of merchandise or receives services. When we collect payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services, the amount received is generally recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed. We provide for estimated sales returns based on historical merchandise returns levels. In connection with changes to our consumer electronics returns policy in the spring of 2007, we examined operational data regarding member return patterns that had not been previously analyzed. The data indicated a longer timeframe over which returns are received than previously used to estimate the sales return reserve. Accordingly, as previously disclosed, during fiscal 2007 we increased the reserve balance and recorded an adjustment to sales of $452.6 million and a pretax charge to income of $94.3 million for the related gross margin and disposition costs. We evaluate the criteria of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal Versus Net as an Agent, in determining whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, when we are the primary obligor, subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, influence product or service specifications, or have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded on a gross basis. If we are not the 29 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) primary obligor and do not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above, we record the net amounts as commissions earned, which is reflected in net sales. Membership fee revenue represents annual membership fees paid by substantially all of our members. We account for membership fee revenue on a deferred basis, whereby membership fee revenue is recognized ratably over one year. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, we performed a detailed analysis of the timing of recognition of membership fees based on each members specific renewal date as this methodology represented an improvement over our historical method, which was based on the period in which the fee was collected. This review resulted in a $56.2 million reduction to membership fee revenue and corresponding increase to deferred membership fees on our consolidated balance sheet. This adjustment includes both a change in method of applying an accounting principle to a preferable method and a correction for cumulative timing errors. Our Executive members qualify for a 2% reward (which can be redeemed only at Costco warehouses), up to a maximum of $500 per year, on all qualified purchases made at Costco. We account for this 2% reward as a reduction in sales, with the related liability being classified within other current liabilities. The sales reduction and corresponding liability are computed after giving effect to the estimated impact of non redemptions based on historical data. Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, as determined primarily by the retail method of accounting, and are stated using the last in, first out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail method of accounting and are stated using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. We believe the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. We record an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the expected annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at fiscal year end. At both September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006 merchandise inventories valued at LIFO approximated FIFO after considering the lower of cost or market principle. We provide for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts as a percentage of net sales. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect results of the actual physical inventory count, which generally occur in the second and fourth fiscal quarters of the fiscal year. Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as we progress toward earning those rebates, provided they are probable and reasonably estimable. Other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of agreement, or other systematic and rational approaches. Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Warehouse Closing costs We periodically evaluate our long lived assets for indicators of impairment, such as a decision to relocate or close a warehouse location. Our judgments are based on existing market and operational conditions. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring a downward adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value. We provide estimates for warehouse closing costs for both leased and owned locations to be closed or relocated. A considerable amount of judgment is involved in determining any impairment or our net 30 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) liability, particularly related to the estimated sales price of owned locations and the potential sublease income at leased locations. These estimates are based on real estate conditions in the markets and our experience in those markets. We make assumptions about the average period of time it would take to sublease the location and the amount of potential sublease income for each leased location. We reassess our liability each quarter and adjust our liability accordingly when our estimates change. Insurance/Self Insurance Liabilities We use a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance pool, to provide for potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property damage, director and officers liability, vehicle liability and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience and evaluations of outside experts, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Income Taxes The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Significant judgment is required in assessing, among other things, the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items. We establish reserves when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable, we determine that certain positions may be successfully challenged. When facts and circumstances change, we adjust these reserves through our provision for income taxes. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48), which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006 and we will adopt these new requirements as of the beginning of fiscal 2008. The estimated cumulative impact of adopting FIN 48 in fiscal 2008 is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157), which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements required under other accounting pronouncements, but does not change existing guidance as to whether or not an instrument is carried at fair value. SFAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. We must adopt these new requirements no later than our first quarter of fiscal 2009. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, Including an Amendment to FASB No. 115 (SFAS 159). Under SFAS 159, entities may elect to measure specified financial instruments and warranty and insurance contracts at fair value 31 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) on a contract by contract basis, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings each reporting period. The election, called the fair value option, will enable entities to achieve an offset accounting effect for changes in fair value of certain related assets and liabilities without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions. SFAS 159 is effective as of the beginning of a companys first fiscal year that begins after November 15, 2007. We must adopt these new requirements no later than our first quarter of fiscal 2009. We are in the process of evaluating the impact that adoption of SFAS 157 and SFAS 159 will have on our future consolidated financial statements. Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to financial market risk resulting from changes in interest and foreign currency rates. We do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions, nor hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. The nature and amount of our long and short term debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As of September 2, 2007, our fixed rate long term debt included $67.6 million principal amount at maturity of 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes carried at $47.8 million, $900.0 million of 5.3% Senior Notes carried at $897.8 million, $1.10 billion of 5.5% Senior Notes carried at $1.09 billion and additional notes and capital lease obligations totaling $127.9 million. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt. We hold interest bearing instruments that are classified as cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. Our investment policy is to manage our cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances to preserve principal and liquidity, while seeking to enhance the return on our investment portfolio through the investment of available funds. We diversify our investment portfolio by investing in multiple types of investment grade securities through a combination of internal and third party investment management. Short term investments generally have a maturity of three months to five years from the purchase date. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. As the majority of these instruments are of a short term nature, if interest rates were to increase or decrease, there is no material risk of a material valuation adjustment related to these instruments. For those instruments that are classified as available for sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in interest rates are reflected within stockholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss. Based on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances at September 2, 2007, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $15.2 million (pre tax) to interest income on an annual basis. Most transactions of our foreign subsidiaries are conducted in local currencies, limiting our exposure to changes in currency rates. We periodically enter into short term forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates on inventory purchases. The notional value of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at September 2, 2007 was $75.0 million. 32 Table of Contents 
 
Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) 2007 vs. 2006 Membership fees increased 10.5% to $1.31 billion, or 2.08% of net sales, in fiscal 2007 from $1.19 billion, or 2.02% of net sales, in fiscal 2006. Excluding the adjustment to deferred membership fees in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 discussed above, adjusted membership fees increased 15.2% from fiscal 2006. This increase was primarily due to: a five dollar increase in our annual membership fee for our U.S. and Canada Gold Star (individual), Business and Business Add on members, which was effective May 1, 2006 for new members and July 1, 2006 for existing members; increased penetration of the higher fee Executive Membership program; and additional membership sign ups at the 30 new warehouses opened in fiscal 2007. 2006 vs. 2005 Membership fees increased 10.7% to $1.19 billion, or 2.02% of net sales, in fiscal 2006 from $1.07 billion, or 2.07% of net sales, in fiscal 2005. This increase was primarily due to increased penetration of the Executive Membership program and additional membership sign ups at the 25 new warehouses opened in fiscal 2006. Gross Margin Fiscal 2007 Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 Gross margin $ 6,637,899 $ 6,217,683 $ 5,532,109 Unusual items 85,759 Gross margin, as adjusted $ 6,723,658 $ 6,217,683 $ 5,532,109 Gross margin increase 6.8 % 12.4 % 9.4 % Gross margin increase, as adjusted 8.1 % 12.4 % 9.4 % Gross margin as a percent of net sales 10.52 % 10.55 % 10.66 % Adjusted gross margin as a percent of adjusted net sales 10.58 % 10.55 % 10.66 % 2007 vs. 2006 Gross margin was $6.64 billion in fiscal 2007 or 10.52% of net sales, compared to $6.22 billion or 10.55% of net sales in fiscal 2006. Excluding the unusual items affecting net sales and gross margin in fiscal 2007, adjusted gross margin as a percentage of adjusted net sales was 10.58%, or an increase of 3 basis points as compared to fiscal 2006. This increase was primarily due to a 24 basis point increase in certain merchandise departments, largely food and sundries, as well as smaller increases in certain warehouse ancillary businesses, costco.com and our international operations, offset by a decrease in our hardlines and softlines categories of approximately 15 basis points. In addition, increased penetration of the Executive Membership two percent reward program and increased spending by Executive members negatively affected gross margin by six basis points. In our fourth fiscal quarter, the decrease in our reserve for estimated sales returns resulted in an improvement of gross margin of approximately 2 basis points. This improvement is primarily a result of the changes to our consumer electronics returns policy implemented in the spring of 2007. 2006 vs. 2005 Gross margin was $6.22 billion in fiscal 2006 or 10.55% of net sales, compared to $5.53 billion or 10.66% of net sales in fiscal 2005. This eleven basis point decrease reflected increased penetration of 19 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) the Executive Membership two percent reward program and increased spending by executive members, which decreased gross margin by ten basis points. Additionally, a decrease of four basis points in gross margin in our merchandise departments and warehouse ancillary businesses was primarily due to changes in the sales mix, with higher sales penetration of lower margin departments and slightly lower overall gross margins in our hardlines and softlines categories. These decreases were partially offset by a three basis point improvement related to valuing inventories following the last in first out (LIFO) method. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Fiscal 2007 Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 Selling, general and administrative expense (SG&A) $ 6,273,096 $ 5,732,141 $ 5,061,339 Unusual items (46,815 ) SG&A, as adjusted $ 6,226,281 $ 5,732,141 $ 5,061,339 SG&A a percent of net sales 9.94 % 9.72 % 9.76 % Adjusted SG&A as percent of adjusted net sales 9.80 % 9.72 % 9.76 % 2007 vs. 2006 SG&A expenses were $6.27 billion, or 9.94% of net sales in fiscal 2007, compared to $5.73 billion, or 9.72% of net sales in fiscal 2006. Excluding the unusual items affecting net sales and SG&A expenses in fiscal 2007, adjusted SG&A as a percentage of adjusted net sales was 9.80%, an increase of eight basis points. Of this increase, 3 basis points were primarily due to an increase in stock based compensation, and a net 5 basis points were due to an increase in warehouse payroll and benefits costs. The payroll increase was largely attributed to hourly rate increases that went into effect in March 2007 and a lower overall comparable warehouse sales increase. 2006 vs. 2005 SG&A expenses were $5.73 billion, or 9.72% of net sales in fiscal 2006, compared to $5.06 billion, or 9.76% of net sales in fiscal 2005. Improved warehouse and central operating costs positively impacted SG&A by approximately nine basis points, primarily due to increased expense leverage of warehouse payroll, which was positively impacted by strong comparable warehouse sales and a lower rate of increase in workers compensation costs. This improvement was partially offset by an increase in stock based compensation cost of approximately five basis points in fiscal 2006. Preopening Expenses Fiscal 2007 Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 Preopening expenses $ 55,163 $ 42,504 $ 53,230 Warehouse openings 30 28 21 Relocations (3 ) (5 ) Warehouse openings, net of relocations 30 25 16 Preopening expenses include costs incurred for startup operations related to new warehouses, warehouse remodel projects and the expansion of ancillary operations at existing warehouses. Preopening 20 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) expenses per warehouse opening can vary due to the timing of the opening relative to our fiscal year end, whether the warehouse is owned or leased, whether the opening is in an existing, new or international market and the number and magnitude of warehouse remodel projects. 2007 vs. 2006 Preopening expenses totaled $55.2 million in fiscal 2007 compared to $42.5 million in fiscal 2006. This increase is primarily due to increased warehouse remodel activity and international openings. 2006 vs. 2005 Preopening expenses totaled $42.5 million in fiscal 2006 compared to $53.2 million in fiscal 2005. During fiscal 2005, we adjusted our method of accounting for leases (entered into over the previous twenty years), primarily related to ground leases at certain owned warehouse locations that did not require rental payments during the period of construction. We recorded a cumulative pre tax, non cash charge of $16.0 million to preopening expenses in the second quarter of fiscal 2005. Excluding this charge, preopening expenses increased year over year, due to the increase in warehouse openings. Provision for Impaired Assets and Closing Costs, net Fiscal 2007 Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 Provision for impaired assets and closing costs, net: Warehouse closing expenses $ 15,887 $ 3,762 $ 11,619 Impairment of long lived assets 3,893 Net (gains) losses on the sale of real property (2,279 ) 1,691 881 Total $ 13,608 $ 5,453 $ 16,393 The provision primarily includes costs related to impairment of long lived assets, future lease obligations of warehouses that have been relocated to new facilities, accelerated depreciation on buildings to be demolished or sold and that are not otherwise impaired, and losses or gains resulting from the sale of real property. 2007 vs. 2006 The net provision for impaired assets and closing costs was $13.6 million in fiscal 2007, compared to $5.5 million in fiscal 2006. In fiscal 2007, approximately $13.0 million of this provision related to the acceleration of depreciation on ten buildings expected to be relocated in fiscal 2008. 2006 vs. 2005 The net provision for impaired assets and closing costs was $5.5 million in fiscal 2006, compared to $16.4 million in fiscal 2005. The provision for fiscal 2006 included charges of $3.8 million for warehouse closing expenses and $1.7 million for net losses on the sale of real property. The provision for fiscal 2005 included charges of $11.6 million for warehouse closing expenses, primarily related to lease obligations and accelerated building depreciation, $3.9 million for impairment of long lived assets, and $0.9 million for net losses on the sale of real property. 21 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) The reserve for warehouse closing costs, classified within other current liabilities, at the end of fiscal 2007 and 2006 included: September 2,2007 September 3,2006 Reserve for warehouse closing costs: Future lease obligations $ 6,086 $ 5,950 Other 737 1,091 Total $ 6,823 $ 7,041 Interest Expense Fiscal 2007 Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 Interest expense $ 64,079 $ 12,570 $ 34,437 2007 vs. 2006 Interest expense totaled $64.1 million in fiscal 2007, compared to $12.6 million in fiscal 2006. On February 20, 2007, we issued $900 million of 5.3% Senior Notes due March 15, 2012 (2012 Notes) at a discount of $2.5 million and $1.1 billion of 5.5% Senior Notes due March 15, 2017 (2017 Notes) at a discount of $5.9 million, (together the 2007 Senior Notes). The increase in interest expense for fiscal 2007 resulted primarily from the additional interest incurred related to the 2007 Senior Notes, offset by lower interest expense resulting from the repayment of the $300 million 5.5% Senior Notes (2002 Senior Notes) in March 2007. In addition, interest expense decreased on the 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes (Zero Coupon Notes) as note holders converted approximately $61.2 million in principal amount of the Zero Coupon Notes into common stock, or $42.3 million after factoring in the related debt discount. 2006 vs. 2005 Interest expense totaled $12.6 million in fiscal 2006, compared to $34.4 million in fiscal 2005. Interest expense in fiscal 2006 primarily included interest on the 2002 Senior Notes, the Zero Coupon Notes, and balances outstanding under our bank credit facilities and promissory notes. In fiscal 2005, interest expense also included interest on the 7 1/8% Senior Notes. The decrease in interest expense in fiscal 2006 resulted primarily from the repayment of the 7 1/8% Senior Notes in June 2005. In addition, interest expense decreased on the Zero Coupon Notes as note holders converted into common stock approximately $286.5 million in principal amount of the Zero Coupon Notes, or $188.9 million after factoring in the related debt discount. The amount of interest capitalized increased in fiscal 2006 due to increased warehouse openings, contributing to the decrease in interest expense, as both interest rates and the dollar amount of projects under construction increased. The overall decrease in interest expense in fiscal 2006 was partially offset by the increase in interest rates on the 2002 Senior Notes, which were swapped into variable rate debt in March 2002. Interest Income and Other Fiscal 2007 Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 Interest income $ 128,413 $ 113,712 $ 81,915 Earnings of affiliates 35,622 28,180 26,459 Minority interest and other 1,449 (3,537 ) 722 Interest Income and other $ 165,484 $ 138,355 $ 109,096 22 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) 2007 vs. 2006 Interest income and other totaled $165.5 million in fiscal 2007, compared to $138.4 million in fiscal 2006. This increase is largely due to the increase in our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments resulting from increased earnings from operations and the proceeds of the issuance of the 2007 Senior Notes, as well as an increase in the earnings of affiliates, primarily our investment in Costco Mexico (a 50% owned joint venture). 2006 vs. 2005 Interest income and other totaled $138.4 million in fiscal 2006, compared to $109.1 million in fiscal 2005. This increase primarily reflects increased interest income resulting from higher interest rates earned, as well as an extra week in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005. Provision for Income Taxes Fiscal 2007 Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 Income tax expense $ 627,219 $ 648,202 $ 485,870 Effective tax rate 36.68 % 37.01 % 31.37 % The effective income tax rate on earnings in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005 was 36.68%, 37.01% and 31.37%, respectively. The lower rate in fiscal 2005 was primarily attributable to a non recurring $54.2 million income tax benefit, primarily from the settlement of a transfer pricing dispute between the United States and Canada (covering the years 1996 2003) and a net tax benefit on excess foreign tax credits on unremitted foreign earnings subject to repatriation of $20.6 million. Excluding these benefits the effective income tax rate on earnings in fiscal 2005 would have been 36.20%. Net Income Fiscal 2007 Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 Net income $ 1,082,772 $ 1,103,215 $ 1,063,092 Unusual items (net of tax) 119,496 Net income, as adjusted $ 1,202,268 $ 1,103,215 $ 1,063,092 Diluted earnings per share $ 2.37 $ 2.30 $ 2.18 Shares used to calculate diluted net income per common share 457,641 480,341 492,035 Diluted earnings per share increase 3 % 6 % 18 % 2007 vs. 2006 Net income for fiscal 2007 was $1.08 billion, or $2.37 per diluted share, compared to $1.10 billion, or $2.30 per diluted share, during fiscal 2006. During fiscal 2007, we repurchased 36.4 million shares of common stock, favorably impacting earnings per diluted share by approximately $0.03. The unusual items previously discussed totaled $119.5 million, net of tax, or $0.26 per diluted share in fiscal 2007. Exclusive of these items, earnings for fiscal 2007 were $2.63 per diluted share, a 14% increase over the prior year. 23 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) 2006 vs. 2005 Net income for fiscal 2006 increased 3.8%, to $1.10 billion or $2.30 per diluted share, from $1.06 billion or $2.18 per diluted share, during fiscal 2005. During fiscal 2006, we repurchased 28.4 million shares of common stock, favorably impacting earnings per diluted share by approximately $0.02. The fiscal 2005 results included several non recurring items that in the aggregate positively impacted reported earnings for all of fiscal 2005 by approximately $0.14 per share: a $54.2 million (approximately $0.11 per diluted share) income tax benefit resulting primarily from the settlement of a transfer pricing dispute between the United States and Canada; a cumulative pre tax, non cash charge to preopening expenses of $16.0 million (approximately $0.02 per diluted share) related to a correction to our method of accounting for ground leases; and a net tax benefit with respect to excess foreign tax credits on unremitted foreign earnings recorded in the fourth quarter of $20.6 million (approximately $0.04 per diluted share). Exclusive of these items, fiscal 2005 earnings were $2.04 per diluted share. Fiscal 2006s earnings per diluted share represents an increase of 13% over that figure. Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table itemizes our most liquid assets (dollars in thousands): September 2,2007 September 3,2006 Cash and cash equivalents $ 2,779,733 $ 1,510,939 Short term investments 575,787 1,322,181 Total $ 3,355,520 $ 2,833,120 Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from warehouse operations and our existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances, which were $3.36 billion and $2.83 billion at September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, respectively. Of these balances, approximately $655.2 million and $593.6 million at September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, respectively, represented debit and credit card receivables, primarily related to weekend sales immediately prior to the year end close. The increase in our most liquid assets of $522.4 million to $3.36 billion at September 2, 2007 was due primarily to the issuance of the 2007 Senior Notes and the cash provided by our operating activities, offset by expenditures for the repurchase of our common stock and the acquisition of property and equipment related to warehouse expansion. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $2.08 billion in fiscal 2007 compared to $1.83 billion in fiscal 2006, an increase of $245.2 million. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in cash flow due to a decrease in our investment in net merchandise inventories (merchandise inventory less accounts payable) of $378.8 million, offset by a decrease in cash flow from operating assets and liabilities of $130.4 million. Net cash used in investing activities totaled $655.3 million in fiscal 2007 compared to $1.16 billion in fiscal 2006, respectively, a decrease of approximately $502.2 million. The decrease in cash used in investing activities relates primarily to an increase of $169.2 million in additions to property and equipment related to warehouse expansion and remodel projects, offset by an increase in cash provided by the net reductions in short term investments of $663.8 million. Net cash used in financing activities totaled $164.6 million in fiscal 2007 compared to $1.23 billion in fiscal 2006. The $1.1 billion decrease in net cash used in financing activities was primarily due to the issuance of the 2007 Senior Notes in February 2007, which provided approximately $1.99 billion in 24 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) proceeds. This was partially offset by the repurchase of common stock in fiscal 2007, which used $1.98 billion of cash, compared to $1.44 billion in fiscal 2006, an increase of approximately $534.8 million and the repayment of long term debt of $307.9 million related primarily to the 2002 Senior Notes retired in March 2007. Dividends In April 2007, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash dividend from $0.13 to $0.145 per share or $0.58 on an annualized basis. Our quarterly cash dividends paid in fiscal 2007 totaled $0.55 per share. In fiscal 2006, we paid quarterly cash dividends totaling $0.49 per share. Contractual Obligations Our commitments at fiscal year end to make future payments under contractual obligations were as follows, as of September 2, 2007 (amounts in thousands): Payments Due by Fiscal Year 2008 2009 to2010 2011 to2012 2013 andthereafter Total Contractual obligations Purchase obligations (merchandise)(1) $ 3,626,627 $ 1,357 $ $ $ 3,627,984 Long term debt(2) 173,160 277,652 1,116,400 1,470,117 3,037,329 Operating leases(3) 137,225 242,461 209,723 1,305,035 1,894,444 Purchase obligations (equipment, services and other)(4) 350,108 40,517 1,089 391,714 Construction Commitments 329,941 329,941 Capital lease obligations and other(2) 3,990 1,937 686 5,193 11,806 Other(5) 2,168 3,936 2,546 4,928 13,578 Total $ 4,623,219 $ 567,860 $ 1,330,444 $ 2,785,273 $ 9,306,796 (1) Includes open merchandise purchase orders. (2) Amounts include contractual interest payments. (3) Operating lease obligations exclude amounts commonly referred to as common area maintenance, taxes and insurance and have been reduced by $149,407 to reflect sub lease income. (4) The amounts exclude certain services negotiated at the individual warehouse or regional level that are not significant and generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty. (5) Consists of asset retirement and deferred compensation obligations. Expansion Plans Our primary requirement for capital is the domestic and international financing of land, building and equipment costs for new and remodeled warehouses, plus the costs of initial warehouse operations and working capital requirements. While there can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized and plans are subject to change upon further review, it is managements current intention to spend approximately $1.6 billion to 25 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) $1.8 billion during fiscal 2008 for real estate, construction, remodeling and equipment for warehouse clubs and related operations. These expenditures are expected to be financed with a combination of cash provided from operations and the use of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. Plans for the United States and Canada during fiscal 2008 are to open approximately 38 to 42 new warehouses, inclusive of 8 to 10 relocations to larger and better located facilities. We expect to continue our review of expansion plans in our international operations, including the United Kingdom and Asia, along with other international markets. Additional Equity Investments in Subsidiaries and Joint Ventures In each of fiscal years 2006 and 2005, we contributed an additional $15 million to our investment in Costco Mexico (a 50% owned joint venture), which did not impact our percentage ownership of this entity, as our joint venture partner contributed a like amount. There were no such contributions in 2007. Bank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs (all amounts stated in U.S. dollars) A wholly owned Canadian subsidiary has a $189.8 million commercial paper program ($180.9 million at September 3, 2006) supported by a $113.9 million bank credit facility that expires in March 2008 ($54.2 million at September 3, 2006) with a Canadian bank, which we guarantee. At September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, no amounts were outstanding under the Canadian commercial paper program or the bank credit facility. Applicable interest rates on the credit facility at September 2, 2007, and September 3, 2006 were 5.00% and 4.65%, respectively. At September 2, 2007, standby letters of credit totaling $24.1 million issued under the bank credit facility left $89.8 million available for commercial paper support. At September 3, 2006, standby letters of credit totaling $20.8 million issued under the bank credit facility left $33.4 million available for commercial paper support. Our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary has a short term $38.7 million bank line of credit ($12.8 million at September 3, 2006) that expires in February 2008. At September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, $10.3 million and $2.5 million, respectively, were borrowed under the line of credit, and $8.6 million and $4.3 million, respectively, were used to support standby letters of credit. Applicable interest rates on the credit facility at September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, were 1.09% and 0.94%, respectively. A second $30.1 million bank line of credit also expires in February 2008. At September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, $7.8 million and $0.9 million, respectively, were borrowed under the second facility. Applicable interest rates on the second credit facility at September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, were 1.10% and 0.95%, respectively. Our Korean subsidiary has a short term $12.8 million bank line of credit ($12.5 million at September 3, 2006) which expires in March 2008. At September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, no amounts were borrowed under the line of credit and $2.0 million in both years was used to support standby letters of credit. Applicable interest rates on the credit facility at September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006 were 6.09% and 5.48%, respectively. Our Taiwan subsidiary has a $6.1 million bank revolving credit facility ($5.2 million at September 3, 2006) and a $3.0 million bank overdraft facility, both expiring in January 2008. At September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, no amounts were borrowed under the credit facility and $1.2 million and $1.9 million, respectively, were used to support standby letters of credit. Applicable interest rates on the credit facility at September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, were 4.50% and 4.00%, respectively. A second $15.2 million bank revolving credit facility is in place, which expires in July 2008. At September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, no amounts were borrowed under the second credit facility 26 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) and $4.2 million and $2.0 million, respectively, were used to support standby letters of credit. Applicable interest rates on the credit facility at September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, were 4.44% and 4.00%, respectively. A third $9.1 million bank revolving credit facility is in place, which expires in March 2008. At September 2, 2007 no amounts were borrowed under the third credit facility and no amounts were used to support standby letters of credit. The applicable interest rate on the credit facility at September 2, 2007 was 4.57%. Our wholly owned United Kingdom subsidiary has a $80.6 million bank revolving credit facility ($113.9 million at September 3, 2006) expiring in February 2010, a $70.5 million bank overdraft facility ($66.5 million at September 3, 2006), renewable on a yearly basis in May 2008, and a $40.3 million uncommitted money market line entered into in February 2007 and renewable on a yearly basis beginning in May 2008. At September 2, 2007, $20.1 million was outstanding under the revolving credit facility with an applicable interest rate of 6.23%, $15.6 million was outstanding under the uncommitted line with an applicable interest rate of 6.47% and no amounts were outstanding under the bank overdraft facility with an applicable interest rate of 6.75%. At September 3, 2006, $38.0 million was outstanding under the revolving credit facility, with an applicable interest rate of 5.32%, and no amounts were outstanding under the bank overdraft facility. Letters of Credit We have letter of credit facilities (for commercial and standby letters of credit) totaling $475.0 million. The outstanding commitments under these facilities at September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006 totaled $119.1 million and $84.9 million, respectively, including $71.7 million and $54.9 million, respectively, in standby letters of credit. Financing Activities On February 20, 2007, we issued $900 million of 5.3% Senior Notes due March 15, 2012 at a discount of $2.5 million and $1.1 billion of 5.5% Senior Notes due March 15, 2017 at a discount of $5.9 million (together, the 2007 Senior Notes). Interest on the 2007 Senior Notes is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year, with the first payment due on September 15, 2007. The net proceeds were used, in part, to repay the 2002 Senior Notes in March 2007, and the balance has been and will be used for general corporate purposes, including repurchases of our common stock. The $8.4 million discount and $2.0 million issuance costs associated with the 2007 Senior Notes are being amortized to interest expense over the terms of those notes. At our option, we may redeem the 2007 Senior Notes at any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest up to the redemption date. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount of the 2007 Senior Notes to be redeemed, or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, we will be required to make an offer to purchase the 2007 Senior Notes at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase, upon certain events as defined by the terms of the 2007 Senior Notes. In April 2003, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.92% in the aggregate amount of $34.4 million, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due in April 2010. In November 2002, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.88% in the aggregate amount of $25.8 million, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due in November 2009. In July 27 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) 2001, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued 1.187% promissory notes in the aggregate amount of $25.8 million, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due in July 2008. In October 2000, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued 2.070% promissory notes in the aggregate amount of $30.1 million, through a private placement. Interest is payable annually and principal is due in October 2007 and will be refinanced. As of September 2, 2007, the 1.187% and the 2.070% promissory notes are reported in the current portion of long term debt on our consolidated balance sheets. In August 1997, we completed the sale of $900.0 million principal amount at maturity Zero Coupon Notes due in August 2017. The Zero Coupon Notes were priced with a yield to maturity of 3.5%, resulting in gross proceeds to us of $449.6 million. The current Notes outstanding are convertible into a maximum of 1.5 million shares of Costco Common Stock shares at an initial conversion price of $22.71. Holders of the Zero Coupon Notes may require us to purchase the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of purchase) in August 2012. We may redeem, at our option, the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of redemption) any time in or after August 2002. As of September 2, 2007, $832.4 million in principal amount of the Zero Coupon Notes had been converted by note holders to shares of Costco Common Stock, of which $61.2 million and $286.5 million in principal were converted in fiscal 2007 and 2006, respectively, or $42.3 million and $188.9 million in fiscal 2007 and 2006, respectively, after factoring in the related debt discount. Derivatives We have limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and use them only to manage well defined interest rate and foreign exchange risks. Forward foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on inventory purchases and typically have very short terms. These forward contracts do not qualify for derivative hedge accounting. The aggregate notional amount, which approximates the fair value of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, was $75.0 million and $63.5 million, respectively. The mark to market adjustment related to these contracts was $0.9 million and $1.1 million at September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, respectively. The majority of the forward foreign exchange contracts were entered into by our wholly owned United Kingdom subsidiary, primarily to hedge U.S. dollar merchandise inventory purchases. Effective March 25, 2002, we entered into fixed to floating interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk associated with our 2002 Senior Notes, which matured and were retired in March 2007. The swaps were designated and qualified as fair value hedges of the debt. As the terms of the swaps matched those of the underlying hedged debt, changes in the fair value of the swaps were offset by corresponding changes in the carrying amount of the hedged debt and resulted in no net earnings impact. At September 3, 2006, the aggregate value of the swaps was $1 million and was recorded in deferred income taxes and other current assets in our consolidated balance sheets. In March 2007, upon maturity of the debt and expiration of the swap agreements, the aggregate fair value of the swaps was zero. We are exposed to market risk for changes in utility commodity pricing, which we partially mitigate through the use of firm price contracts with counterparties for approximately 23% of our locations in the U.S. and Canada. The effects of these arrangements are not significant for any period presented. 28 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements With the exception of our operating leases, we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition or consolidated financial statements. Stock Repurchase Programs In January and July of 2006, our Board of Directors approved an additional $1.00 billion and $2.00 billion of stock repurchases, respectively, which expire in 2009, bringing total authorizations by our Board of Directors since inception of the program in fiscal 2001 to $4.50 billion. Subsequent to the end of fiscal 2007, our Board of Directors approved an additional $300.0 million of stock repurchases, which expires in 2010. During fiscal 2007, we repurchased 36.4 million shares at an average price of $54.39 totaling approximately $1.98 billion. During fiscal 2006, we repurchased 28.4 million shares of common stock, at an average price of $51.44, totaling approximately $1.46 billion. The remaining amount available to be purchased under our approved plan was approximately $646.4 million at September 2, 2007. Purchases are made from time to time as conditions warrant in the open market or in block purchases, or pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5 1. Repurchased shares are retired. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments. We continue to review our accounting policies and evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, merchandise inventory valuation, impairment of long lived assets, warehouse closing costs, insurance/self insurance liabilities and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. Revenue Recognition We generally recognize sales, net of estimated returns, at the time the member takes possession of merchandise or receives services. When we collect payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services, the amount received is generally recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed. We provide for estimated sales returns based on historical merchandise returns levels. In connection with changes to our consumer electronics returns policy in the spring of 2007, we examined operational data regarding member return patterns that had not been previously analyzed. The data indicated a longer timeframe over which returns are received than previously used to estimate the sales return reserve. Accordingly, as previously disclosed, during fiscal 2007 we increased the reserve balance and recorded an adjustment to sales of $452.6 million and a pretax charge to income of $94.3 million for the related gross margin and disposition costs. We evaluate the criteria of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal Versus Net as an Agent, in determining whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, when we are the primary obligor, subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, influence product or service specifications, or have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded on a gross basis. If we are not the 29 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) primary obligor and do not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above, we record the net amounts as commissions earned, which is reflected in net sales. Membership fee revenue represents annual membership fees paid by substantially all of our members. We account for membership fee revenue on a deferred basis, whereby membership fee revenue is recognized ratably over one year. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, we performed a detailed analysis of the timing of recognition of membership fees based on each members specific renewal date as this methodology represented an improvement over our historical method, which was based on the period in which the fee was collected. This review resulted in a $56.2 million reduction to membership fee revenue and corresponding increase to deferred membership fees on our consolidated balance sheet. This adjustment includes both a change in method of applying an accounting principle to a preferable method and a correction for cumulative timing errors. Our Executive members qualify for a 2% reward (which can be redeemed only at Costco warehouses), up to a maximum of $500 per year, on all qualified purchases made at Costco. We account for this 2% reward as a reduction in sales, with the related liability being classified within other current liabilities. The sales reduction and corresponding liability are computed after giving effect to the estimated impact of non redemptions based on historical data. Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, as determined primarily by the retail method of accounting, and are stated using the last in, first out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail method of accounting and are stated using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. We believe the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. We record an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the expected annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at fiscal year end. At both September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006 merchandise inventories valued at LIFO approximated FIFO after considering the lower of cost or market principle. We provide for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts as a percentage of net sales. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect results of the actual physical inventory count, which generally occur in the second and fourth fiscal quarters of the fiscal year. Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as we progress toward earning those rebates, provided they are probable and reasonably estimable. Other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of agreement, or other systematic and rational approaches. Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Warehouse Closing costs We periodically evaluate our long lived assets for indicators of impairment, such as a decision to relocate or close a warehouse location. Our judgments are based on existing market and operational conditions. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring a downward adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value. We provide estimates for warehouse closing costs for both leased and owned locations to be closed or relocated. A considerable amount of judgment is involved in determining any impairment or our net 30 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) liability, particularly related to the estimated sales price of owned locations and the potential sublease income at leased locations. These estimates are based on real estate conditions in the markets and our experience in those markets. We make assumptions about the average period of time it would take to sublease the location and the amount of potential sublease income for each leased location. We reassess our liability each quarter and adjust our liability accordingly when our estimates change. Insurance/Self Insurance Liabilities We use a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance pool, to provide for potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property damage, director and officers liability, vehicle liability and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience and evaluations of outside experts, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Income Taxes The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Significant judgment is required in assessing, among other things, the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items. We establish reserves when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable, we determine that certain positions may be successfully challenged. When facts and circumstances change, we adjust these reserves through our provision for income taxes. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48), which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006 and we will adopt these new requirements as of the beginning of fiscal 2008. The estimated cumulative impact of adopting FIN 48 in fiscal 2008 is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157), which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements required under other accounting pronouncements, but does not change existing guidance as to whether or not an instrument is carried at fair value. SFAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. We must adopt these new requirements no later than our first quarter of fiscal 2009. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, Including an Amendment to FASB No. 115 (SFAS 159). Under SFAS 159, entities may elect to measure specified financial instruments and warranty and insurance contracts at fair value 31 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) on a contract by contract basis, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings each reporting period. The election, called the fair value option, will enable entities to achieve an offset accounting effect for changes in fair value of certain related assets and liabilities without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions. SFAS 159 is effective as of the beginning of a companys first fiscal year that begins after November 15, 2007. We must adopt these new requirements no later than our first quarter of fiscal 2009. We are in the process of evaluating the impact that adoption of SFAS 157 and SFAS 159 will have on our future consolidated financial statements. Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to financial market risk resulting from changes in interest and foreign currency rates. We do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions, nor hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. The nature and amount of our long and short term debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As of September 2, 2007, our fixed rate long term debt included $67.6 million principal amount at maturity of 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes carried at $47.8 million, $900.0 million of 5.3% Senior Notes carried at $897.8 million, $1.10 billion of 5.5% Senior Notes carried at $1.09 billion and additional notes and capital lease obligations totaling $127.9 million. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt. We hold interest bearing instruments that are classified as cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. Our investment policy is to manage our cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances to preserve principal and liquidity, while seeking to enhance the return on our investment portfolio through the investment of available funds. We diversify our investment portfolio by investing in multiple types of investment grade securities through a combination of internal and third party investment management. Short term investments generally have a maturity of three months to five years from the purchase date. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. As the majority of these instruments are of a short term nature, if interest rates were to increase or decrease, there is no material risk of a material valuation adjustment related to these instruments. For those instruments that are classified as available for sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in interest rates are reflected within stockholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss. Based on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances at September 2, 2007, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $15.2 million (pre tax) to interest income on an annual basis. Most transactions of our foreign subsidiaries are conducted in local currencies, limiting our exposure to changes in currency rates. We periodically enter into short term forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates on inventory purchases. The notional value of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at September 2, 2007 was $75.0 million. 32 Table of Contents 
 
Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) the Executive Membership two percent reward program and increased spending by executive members, which decreased gross margin by ten basis points. Additionally, a decrease of four basis points in gross margin in our merchandise departments and warehouse ancillary businesses was primarily due to changes in the sales mix, with higher sales penetration of lower margin departments and slightly lower overall gross margins in our hardlines and softlines categories. These decreases were partially offset by a three basis point improvement related to valuing inventories following the last in first out (LIFO) method. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Fiscal 2007 Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 Selling, general and administrative expense (SG&A) $ 6,273,096 $ 5,732,141 $ 5,061,339 Unusual items (46,815 ) SG&A, as adjusted $ 6,226,281 $ 5,732,141 $ 5,061,339 SG&A a percent of net sales 9.94 % 9.72 % 9.76 % Adjusted SG&A as percent of adjusted net sales 9.80 % 9.72 % 9.76 % 2007 vs. 2006 SG&A expenses were $6.27 billion, or 9.94% of net sales in fiscal 2007, compared to $5.73 billion, or 9.72% of net sales in fiscal 2006. Excluding the unusual items affecting net sales and SG&A expenses in fiscal 2007, adjusted SG&A as a percentage of adjusted net sales was 9.80%, an increase of eight basis points. Of this increase, 3 basis points were primarily due to an increase in stock based compensation, and a net 5 basis points were due to an increase in warehouse payroll and benefits costs. The payroll increase was largely attributed to hourly rate increases that went into effect in March 2007 and a lower overall comparable warehouse sales increase. 2006 vs. 2005 SG&A expenses were $5.73 billion, or 9.72% of net sales in fiscal 2006, compared to $5.06 billion, or 9.76% of net sales in fiscal 2005. Improved warehouse and central operating costs positively impacted SG&A by approximately nine basis points, primarily due to increased expense leverage of warehouse payroll, which was positively impacted by strong comparable warehouse sales and a lower rate of increase in workers compensation costs. This improvement was partially offset by an increase in stock based compensation cost of approximately five basis points in fiscal 2006. Preopening Expenses Fiscal 2007 Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 Preopening expenses $ 55,163 $ 42,504 $ 53,230 Warehouse openings 30 28 21 Relocations (3 ) (5 ) Warehouse openings, net of relocations 30 25 16 Preopening expenses include costs incurred for startup operations related to new warehouses, warehouse remodel projects and the expansion of ancillary operations at existing warehouses. Preopening 20 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) expenses per warehouse opening can vary due to the timing of the opening relative to our fiscal year end, whether the warehouse is owned or leased, whether the opening is in an existing, new or international market and the number and magnitude of warehouse remodel projects. 2007 vs. 2006 Preopening expenses totaled $55.2 million in fiscal 2007 compared to $42.5 million in fiscal 2006. This increase is primarily due to increased warehouse remodel activity and international openings. 2006 vs. 2005 Preopening expenses totaled $42.5 million in fiscal 2006 compared to $53.2 million in fiscal 2005. During fiscal 2005, we adjusted our method of accounting for leases (entered into over the previous twenty years), primarily related to ground leases at certain owned warehouse locations that did not require rental payments during the period of construction. We recorded a cumulative pre tax, non cash charge of $16.0 million to preopening expenses in the second quarter of fiscal 2005. Excluding this charge, preopening expenses increased year over year, due to the increase in warehouse openings. Provision for Impaired Assets and Closing Costs, net Fiscal 2007 Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 Provision for impaired assets and closing costs, net: Warehouse closing expenses $ 15,887 $ 3,762 $ 11,619 Impairment of long lived assets 3,893 Net (gains) losses on the sale of real property (2,279 ) 1,691 881 Total $ 13,608 $ 5,453 $ 16,393 The provision primarily includes costs related to impairment of long lived assets, future lease obligations of warehouses that have been relocated to new facilities, accelerated depreciation on buildings to be demolished or sold and that are not otherwise impaired, and losses or gains resulting from the sale of real property. 2007 vs. 2006 The net provision for impaired assets and closing costs was $13.6 million in fiscal 2007, compared to $5.5 million in fiscal 2006. In fiscal 2007, approximately $13.0 million of this provision related to the acceleration of depreciation on ten buildings expected to be relocated in fiscal 2008. 2006 vs. 2005 The net provision for impaired assets and closing costs was $5.5 million in fiscal 2006, compared to $16.4 million in fiscal 2005. The provision for fiscal 2006 included charges of $3.8 million for warehouse closing expenses and $1.7 million for net losses on the sale of real property. The provision for fiscal 2005 included charges of $11.6 million for warehouse closing expenses, primarily related to lease obligations and accelerated building depreciation, $3.9 million for impairment of long lived assets, and $0.9 million for net losses on the sale of real property. 21 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) The reserve for warehouse closing costs, classified within other current liabilities, at the end of fiscal 2007 and 2006 included: September 2,2007 September 3,2006 Reserve for warehouse closing costs: Future lease obligations $ 6,086 $ 5,950 Other 737 1,091 Total $ 6,823 $ 7,041 Interest Expense Fiscal 2007 Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 Interest expense $ 64,079 $ 12,570 $ 34,437 2007 vs. 2006 Interest expense totaled $64.1 million in fiscal 2007, compared to $12.6 million in fiscal 2006. On February 20, 2007, we issued $900 million of 5.3% Senior Notes due March 15, 2012 (2012 Notes) at a discount of $2.5 million and $1.1 billion of 5.5% Senior Notes due March 15, 2017 (2017 Notes) at a discount of $5.9 million, (together the 2007 Senior Notes). The increase in interest expense for fiscal 2007 resulted primarily from the additional interest incurred related to the 2007 Senior Notes, offset by lower interest expense resulting from the repayment of the $300 million 5.5% Senior Notes (2002 Senior Notes) in March 2007. In addition, interest expense decreased on the 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes (Zero Coupon Notes) as note holders converted approximately $61.2 million in principal amount of the Zero Coupon Notes into common stock, or $42.3 million after factoring in the related debt discount. 2006 vs. 2005 Interest expense totaled $12.6 million in fiscal 2006, compared to $34.4 million in fiscal 2005. Interest expense in fiscal 2006 primarily included interest on the 2002 Senior Notes, the Zero Coupon Notes, and balances outstanding under our bank credit facilities and promissory notes. In fiscal 2005, interest expense also included interest on the 7 1/8% Senior Notes. The decrease in interest expense in fiscal 2006 resulted primarily from the repayment of the 7 1/8% Senior Notes in June 2005. In addition, interest expense decreased on the Zero Coupon Notes as note holders converted into common stock approximately $286.5 million in principal amount of the Zero Coupon Notes, or $188.9 million after factoring in the related debt discount. The amount of interest capitalized increased in fiscal 2006 due to increased warehouse openings, contributing to the decrease in interest expense, as both interest rates and the dollar amount of projects under construction increased. The overall decrease in interest expense in fiscal 2006 was partially offset by the increase in interest rates on the 2002 Senior Notes, which were swapped into variable rate debt in March 2002.

This increase is largely due to the increase in our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments resulting from increased earnings from operations and the proceeds of the issuance of the 2007 Senior Notes, as well as an increase in the earnings of affiliates, primarily our investment in Costco Mexico (a 50% owned joint venture). 2006 vs. 2005 Interest income and other totaled $138.4 million in fiscal 2006, compared to $109.1 million in fiscal 2005. This increase primarily reflects increased interest income resulting from higher interest rates earned, as well as an extra week in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005. Provision for Income Taxes Fiscal 2007 Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 Income tax expense $ 627,219 $ 648,202 $ 485,870 Effective tax rate 36.68 % 37.01 % 31.37 % The effective income tax rate on earnings in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005 was 36.68%, 37.01% and 31.37%, respectively. The lower rate in fiscal 2005 was primarily attributable to a non recurring $54.2 million income tax benefit, primarily from the settlement of a transfer pricing dispute between the United States and Canada (covering the years 1996 2003) and a net tax benefit on excess foreign tax credits on unremitted foreign earnings subject to repatriation of $20.6 million. Excluding these benefits the effective income tax rate on earnings in fiscal 2005 would have been 36.20%. Net Income Fiscal 2007 Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 Net income $ 1,082,772 $ 1,103,215 $ 1,063,092 Unusual items (net of tax) 119,496 Net income, as adjusted $ 1,202,268 $ 1,103,215 $ 1,063,092 Diluted earnings per share $ 2.37 $ 2.30 $ 2.18 Shares used to calculate diluted net income per common share 457,641 480,341 492,035 Diluted earnings per share increase 3 % 6 % 18 % 2007 vs. 2006 Net income for fiscal 2007 was $1.08 billion, or $2.37 per diluted share, compared to $1.10 billion, or $2.30 per diluted share, during fiscal 2006. During fiscal 2007, we repurchased 36.4 million shares of common stock, favorably impacting earnings per diluted share by approximately $0.03. The unusual items previously discussed totaled $119.5 million, net of tax, or $0.26 per diluted share in fiscal 2007. Exclusive of these items, earnings for fiscal 2007 were $2.63 per diluted share, a 14% increase over the prior year. 23 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) 2006 vs. 2005 Net income for fiscal 2006 increased 3.8%, to $1.10 billion or $2.30 per diluted share, from $1.06 billion or $2.18 per diluted share, during fiscal 2005. During fiscal 2006, we repurchased 28.4 million shares of common stock, favorably impacting earnings per diluted share by approximately $0.02. The fiscal 2005 results included several non recurring items that in the aggregate positively impacted reported earnings for all of fiscal 2005 by approximately $0.14 per share: a $54.2 million (approximately $0.11 per diluted share) income tax benefit resulting primarily from the settlement of a transfer pricing dispute between the United States and Canada; a cumulative pre tax, non cash charge to preopening expenses of $16.0 million (approximately $0.02 per diluted share) related to a correction to our method of accounting for ground leases; and a net tax benefit with respect to excess foreign tax credits on unremitted foreign earnings recorded in the fourth quarter of $20.6 million (approximately $0.04 per diluted share). Exclusive of these items, fiscal 2005 earnings were $2.04 per diluted share. Fiscal 2006s earnings per diluted share represents an increase of 13% over that figure. Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table itemizes our most liquid assets (dollars in thousands): September 2,2007 September 3,2006 Cash and cash equivalents $ 2,779,733 $ 1,510,939 Short term investments 575,787 1,322,181 Total $ 3,355,520 $ 2,833,120 Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from warehouse operations and our existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances, which were $3.36 billion and $2.83 billion at September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, respectively. Of these balances, approximately $655.2 million and $593.6 million at September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, respectively, represented debit and credit card receivables, primarily related to weekend sales immediately prior to the year end close. The increase in our most liquid assets of $522.4 million to $3.36 billion at September 2, 2007 was due primarily to the issuance of the 2007 Senior Notes and the cash provided by our operating activities, offset by expenditures for the repurchase of our common stock and the acquisition of property and equipment related to warehouse expansion. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $2.08 billion in fiscal 2007 compared to $1.83 billion in fiscal 2006, an increase of $245.2 million. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in cash flow due to a decrease in our investment in net merchandise inventories (merchandise inventory less accounts payable) of $378.8 million, offset by a decrease in cash flow from operating assets and liabilities of $130.4 million. Net cash used in investing activities totaled $655.3 million in fiscal 2007 compared to $1.16 billion in fiscal 2006, respectively, a decrease of approximately $502.2 million. The decrease in cash used in investing activities relates primarily to an increase of $169.2 million in additions to property and equipment related to warehouse expansion and remodel projects, offset by an increase in cash provided by the net reductions in short term investments of $663.8 million. Net cash used in financing activities totaled $164.6 million in fiscal 2007 compared to $1.23 billion in fiscal 2006. The $1.1 billion decrease in net cash used in financing activities was primarily due to the issuance of the 2007 Senior Notes in February 2007, which provided approximately $1.99 billion in 24 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) proceeds. This was partially offset by the repurchase of common stock in fiscal 2007, which used $1.98 billion of cash, compared to $1.44 billion in fiscal 2006, an increase of approximately $534.8 million and the repayment of long term debt of $307.9 million related primarily to the 2002 Senior Notes retired in March 2007. Dividends In April 2007, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash dividend from $0.13 to $0.145 per share or $0.58 on an annualized basis. Our quarterly cash dividends paid in fiscal 2007 totaled $0.55 per share. In fiscal 2006, we paid quarterly cash dividends totaling $0.49 per share. Contractual Obligations Our commitments at fiscal year end to make future payments under contractual obligations were as follows, as of September 2, 2007 (amounts in thousands): Payments Due by Fiscal Year 2008 2009 to2010 2011 to2012 2013 andthereafter Total Contractual obligations Purchase obligations (merchandise)(1) $ 3,626,627 $ 1,357 $ $ $ 3,627,984 Long term debt(2) 173,160 277,652 1,116,400 1,470,117 3,037,329 Operating leases(3) 137,225 242,461 209,723 1,305,035 1,894,444 Purchase obligations (equipment, services and other)(4) 350,108 40,517 1,089 391,714 Construction Commitments 329,941 329,941 Capital lease obligations and other(2) 3,990 1,937 686 5,193 11,806 Other(5) 2,168 3,936 2,546 4,928 13,578 Total $ 4,623,219 $ 567,860 $ 1,330,444 $ 2,785,273 $ 9,306,796 (1) Includes open merchandise purchase orders. (2) Amounts include contractual interest payments. (3) Operating lease obligations exclude amounts commonly referred to as common area maintenance, taxes and insurance and have been reduced by $149,407 to reflect sub lease income. (4) The amounts exclude certain services negotiated at the individual warehouse or regional level that are not significant and generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty. (5) Consists of asset retirement and deferred compensation obligations. Expansion Plans Our primary requirement for capital is the domestic and international financing of land, building and equipment costs for new and remodeled warehouses, plus the costs of initial warehouse operations and working capital requirements. While there can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized and plans are subject to change upon further review, it is managements current intention to spend approximately $1.6 billion to 25 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) $1.8 billion during fiscal 2008 for real estate, construction, remodeling and equipment for warehouse clubs and related operations. These expenditures are expected to be financed with a combination of cash provided from operations and the use of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. Plans for the United States and Canada during fiscal 2008 are to open approximately 38 to 42 new warehouses, inclusive of 8 to 10 relocations to larger and better located facilities. We expect to continue our review of expansion plans in our international operations, including the United Kingdom and Asia, along with other international markets. Additional Equity Investments in Subsidiaries and Joint Ventures In each of fiscal years 2006 and 2005, we contributed an additional $15 million to our investment in Costco Mexico (a 50% owned joint venture), which did not impact our percentage ownership of this entity, as our joint venture partner contributed a like amount. There were no such contributions in 2007. Bank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs (all amounts stated in U.S. dollars) A wholly owned Canadian subsidiary has a $189.8 million commercial paper program ($180.9 million at September 3, 2006) supported by a $113.9 million bank credit facility that expires in March 2008 ($54.2 million at September 3, 2006) with a Canadian bank, which we guarantee. At September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, no amounts were outstanding under the Canadian commercial paper program or the bank credit facility. Applicable interest rates on the credit facility at September 2, 2007, and September 3, 2006 were 5.00% and 4.65%, respectively. At September 2, 2007, standby letters of credit totaling $24.1 million issued under the bank credit facility left $89.8 million available for commercial paper support. At September 3, 2006, standby letters of credit totaling $20.8 million issued under the bank credit facility left $33.4 million available for commercial paper support. Our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary has a short term $38.7 million bank line of credit ($12.8 million at September 3, 2006) that expires in February 2008. At September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, $10.3 million and $2.5 million, respectively, were borrowed under the line of credit, and $8.6 million and $4.3 million, respectively, were used to support standby letters of credit. Applicable interest rates on the credit facility at September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, were 1.09% and 0.94%, respectively. A second $30.1 million bank line of credit also expires in February 2008. At September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, $7.8 million and $0.9 million, respectively, were borrowed under the second facility. Applicable interest rates on the second credit facility at September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, were 1.10% and 0.95%, respectively. Our Korean subsidiary has a short term $12.8 million bank line of credit ($12.5 million at September 3, 2006) which expires in March 2008. At September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, no amounts were borrowed under the line of credit and $2.0 million in both years was used to support standby letters of credit. Applicable interest rates on the credit facility at September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006 were 6.09% and 5.48%, respectively. Our Taiwan subsidiary has a $6.1 million bank revolving credit facility ($5.2 million at September 3, 2006) and a $3.0 million bank overdraft facility, both expiring in January 2008. At September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, no amounts were borrowed under the credit facility and $1.2 million and $1.9 million, respectively, were used to support standby letters of credit. Applicable interest rates on the credit facility at September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, were 4.50% and 4.00%, respectively. A second $15.2 million bank revolving credit facility is in place, which expires in July 2008. At September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, no amounts were borrowed under the second credit facility 26 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) and $4.2 million and $2.0 million, respectively, were used to support standby letters of credit. Applicable interest rates on the credit facility at September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, were 4.44% and 4.00%, respectively. A third $9.1 million bank revolving credit facility is in place, which expires in March 2008. At September 2, 2007 no amounts were borrowed under the third credit facility and no amounts were used to support standby letters of credit. The applicable interest rate on the credit facility at September 2, 2007 was 4.57%. Our wholly owned United Kingdom subsidiary has a $80.6 million bank revolving credit facility ($113.9 million at September 3, 2006) expiring in February 2010, a $70.5 million bank overdraft facility ($66.5 million at September 3, 2006), renewable on a yearly basis in May 2008, and a $40.3 million uncommitted money market line entered into in February 2007 and renewable on a yearly basis beginning in May 2008. At September 2, 2007, $20.1 million was outstanding under the revolving credit facility with an applicable interest rate of 6.23%, $15.6 million was outstanding under the uncommitted line with an applicable interest rate of 6.47% and no amounts were outstanding under the bank overdraft facility with an applicable interest rate of 6.75%. At September 3, 2006, $38.0 million was outstanding under the revolving credit facility, with an applicable interest rate of 5.32%, and no amounts were outstanding under the bank overdraft facility. Letters of Credit We have letter of credit facilities (for commercial and standby letters of credit) totaling $475.0 million. The outstanding commitments under these facilities at September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006 totaled $119.1 million and $84.9 million, respectively, including $71.7 million and $54.9 million, respectively, in standby letters of credit. Financing Activities On February 20, 2007, we issued $900 million of 5.3% Senior Notes due March 15, 2012 at a discount of $2.5 million and $1.1 billion of 5.5% Senior Notes due March 15, 2017 at a discount of $5.9 million (together, the 2007 Senior Notes). Interest on the 2007 Senior Notes is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year, with the first payment due on September 15, 2007. The net proceeds were used, in part, to repay the 2002 Senior Notes in March 2007, and the balance has been and will be used for general corporate purposes, including repurchases of our common stock. The $8.4 million discount and $2.0 million issuance costs associated with the 2007 Senior Notes are being amortized to interest expense over the terms of those notes. At our option, we may redeem the 2007 Senior Notes at any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest up to the redemption date. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount of the 2007 Senior Notes to be redeemed, or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, we will be required to make an offer to purchase the 2007 Senior Notes at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase, upon certain events as defined by the terms of the 2007 Senior Notes. In April 2003, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.92% in the aggregate amount of $34.4 million, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due in April 2010. In November 2002, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.88% in the aggregate amount of $25.8 million, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due in November 2009. In July 27 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) 2001, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued 1.187% promissory notes in the aggregate amount of $25.8 million, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due in July 2008. In October 2000, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued 2.070% promissory notes in the aggregate amount of $30.1 million, through a private placement. Interest is payable annually and principal is due in October 2007 and will be refinanced. As of September 2, 2007, the 1.187% and the 2.070% promissory notes are reported in the current portion of long term debt on our consolidated balance sheets. In August 1997, we completed the sale of $900.0 million principal amount at maturity Zero Coupon Notes due in August 2017. The Zero Coupon Notes were priced with a yield to maturity of 3.5%, resulting in gross proceeds to us of $449.6 million. The current Notes outstanding are convertible into a maximum of 1.5 million shares of Costco Common Stock shares at an initial conversion price of $22.71. Holders of the Zero Coupon Notes may require us to purchase the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of purchase) in August 2012. We may redeem, at our option, the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of redemption) any time in or after August 2002. As of September 2, 2007, $832.4 million in principal amount of the Zero Coupon Notes had been converted by note holders to shares of Costco Common Stock, of which $61.2 million and $286.5 million in principal were converted in fiscal 2007 and 2006, respectively, or $42.3 million and $188.9 million in fiscal 2007 and 2006, respectively, after factoring in the related debt discount. Derivatives We have limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and use them only to manage well defined interest rate and foreign exchange risks. Forward foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on inventory purchases and typically have very short terms. These forward contracts do not qualify for derivative hedge accounting. The aggregate notional amount, which approximates the fair value of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, was $75.0 million and $63.5 million, respectively. The mark to market adjustment related to these contracts was $0.9 million and $1.1 million at September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, respectively. The majority of the forward foreign exchange contracts were entered into by our wholly owned United Kingdom subsidiary, primarily to hedge U.S. dollar merchandise inventory purchases. Effective March 25, 2002, we entered into fixed to floating interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk associated with our 2002 Senior Notes, which matured and were retired in March 2007. The swaps were designated and qualified as fair value hedges of the debt. As the terms of the swaps matched those of the underlying hedged debt, changes in the fair value of the swaps were offset by corresponding changes in the carrying amount of the hedged debt and resulted in no net earnings impact. At September 3, 2006, the aggregate value of the swaps was $1 million and was recorded in deferred income taxes and other current assets in our consolidated balance sheets. In March 2007, upon maturity of the debt and expiration of the swap agreements, the aggregate fair value of the swaps was zero. We are exposed to market risk for changes in utility commodity pricing, which we partially mitigate through the use of firm price contracts with counterparties for approximately 23% of our locations in the U.S. and Canada. The effects of these arrangements are not significant for any period presented. 28 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements With the exception of our operating leases, we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition or consolidated financial statements. Stock Repurchase Programs In January and July of 2006, our Board of Directors approved an additional $1.00 billion and $2.00 billion of stock repurchases, respectively, which expire in 2009, bringing total authorizations by our Board of Directors since inception of the program in fiscal 2001 to $4.50 billion. Subsequent to the end of fiscal 2007, our Board of Directors approved an additional $300.0 million of stock repurchases, which expires in 2010. During fiscal 2007, we repurchased 36.4 million shares at an average price of $54.39 totaling approximately $1.98 billion. During fiscal 2006, we repurchased 28.4 million shares of common stock, at an average price of $51.44, totaling approximately $1.46 billion. The remaining amount available to be purchased under our approved plan was approximately $646.4 million at September 2, 2007. Purchases are made from time to time as conditions warrant in the open market or in block purchases, or pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5 1. Repurchased shares are retired. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments. We continue to review our accounting policies and evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, merchandise inventory valuation, impairment of long lived assets, warehouse closing costs, insurance/self insurance liabilities and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. Revenue Recognition We generally recognize sales, net of estimated returns, at the time the member takes possession of merchandise or receives services. When we collect payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services, the amount received is generally recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed. We provide for estimated sales returns based on historical merchandise returns levels. In connection with changes to our consumer electronics returns policy in the spring of 2007, we examined operational data regarding member return patterns that had not been previously analyzed. The data indicated a longer timeframe over which returns are received than previously used to estimate the sales return reserve. Accordingly, as previously disclosed, during fiscal 2007 we increased the reserve balance and recorded an adjustment to sales of $452.6 million and a pretax charge to income of $94.3 million for the related gross margin and disposition costs. We evaluate the criteria of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal Versus Net as an Agent, in determining whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, when we are the primary obligor, subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, influence product or service specifications, or have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded on a gross basis. If we are not the 29 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) primary obligor and do not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above, we record the net amounts as commissions earned, which is reflected in net sales. Membership fee revenue represents annual membership fees paid by substantially all of our members. We account for membership fee revenue on a deferred basis, whereby membership fee revenue is recognized ratably over one year. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, we performed a detailed analysis of the timing of recognition of membership fees based on each members specific renewal date as this methodology represented an improvement over our historical method, which was based on the period in which the fee was collected. This review resulted in a $56.2 million reduction to membership fee revenue and corresponding increase to deferred membership fees on our consolidated balance sheet. This adjustment includes both a change in method of applying an accounting principle to a preferable method and a correction for cumulative timing errors. Our Executive members qualify for a 2% reward (which can be redeemed only at Costco warehouses), up to a maximum of $500 per year, on all qualified purchases made at Costco. We account for this 2% reward as a reduction in sales, with the related liability being classified within other current liabilities. The sales reduction and corresponding liability are computed after giving effect to the estimated impact of non redemptions based on historical data. Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, as determined primarily by the retail method of accounting, and are stated using the last in, first out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail method of accounting and are stated using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. We believe the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. We record an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the expected annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at fiscal year end. At both September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006 merchandise inventories valued at LIFO approximated FIFO after considering the lower of cost or market principle. We provide for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts as a percentage of net sales. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect results of the actual physical inventory count, which generally occur in the second and fourth fiscal quarters of the fiscal year. Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as we progress toward earning those rebates, provided they are probable and reasonably estimable. Other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of agreement, or other systematic and rational approaches. Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Warehouse Closing costs We periodically evaluate our long lived assets for indicators of impairment, such as a decision to relocate or close a warehouse location. Our judgments are based on existing market and operational conditions. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring a downward adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value. We provide estimates for warehouse closing costs for both leased and owned locations to be closed or relocated. A considerable amount of judgment is involved in determining any impairment or our net 30 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) liability, particularly related to the estimated sales price of owned locations and the potential sublease income at leased locations. These estimates are based on real estate conditions in the markets and our experience in those markets. We make assumptions about the average period of time it would take to sublease the location and the amount of potential sublease income for each leased location. We reassess our liability each quarter and adjust our liability accordingly when our estimates change. Insurance/Self Insurance Liabilities We use a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance pool, to provide for potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property damage, director and officers liability, vehicle liability and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience and evaluations of outside experts, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Income Taxes The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Significant judgment is required in assessing, among other things, the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items. We establish reserves when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable, we determine that certain positions may be successfully challenged. When facts and circumstances change, we adjust these reserves through our provision for income taxes. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48), which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006 and we will adopt these new requirements as of the beginning of fiscal 2008. The estimated cumulative impact of adopting FIN 48 in fiscal 2008 is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157), which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements required under other accounting pronouncements, but does not change existing guidance as to whether or not an instrument is carried at fair value. SFAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. We must adopt these new requirements no later than our first quarter of fiscal 2009. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, Including an Amendment to FASB No. 115 (SFAS 159). Under SFAS 159, entities may elect to measure specified financial instruments and warranty and insurance contracts at fair value 31 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) on a contract by contract basis, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings each reporting period. The election, called the fair value option, will enable entities to achieve an offset accounting effect for changes in fair value of certain related assets and liabilities without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions. SFAS 159 is effective as of the beginning of a companys first fiscal year that begins after November 15, 2007. We must adopt these new requirements no later than our first quarter of fiscal 2009. We are in the process of evaluating the impact that adoption of SFAS 157 and SFAS 159 will have on our future consolidated financial statements. Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to financial market risk resulting from changes in interest and foreign currency rates. We do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions, nor hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. The nature and amount of our long and short term debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As of September 2, 2007, our fixed rate long term debt included $67.6 million principal amount at maturity of 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes carried at $47.8 million, $900.0 million of 5.3% Senior Notes carried at $897.8 million, $1.10 billion of 5.5% Senior Notes carried at $1.09 billion and additional notes and capital lease obligations totaling $127.9 million. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt. We hold interest bearing instruments that are classified as cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. Our investment policy is to manage our cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances to preserve principal and liquidity, while seeking to enhance the return on our investment portfolio through the investment of available funds. We diversify our investment portfolio by investing in multiple types of investment grade securities through a combination of internal and third party investment management. Short term investments generally have a maturity of three months to five years from the purchase date. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. As the majority of these instruments are of a short term nature, if interest rates were to increase or decrease, there is no material risk of a material valuation adjustment related to these instruments. For those instruments that are classified as available for sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in interest rates are reflected within stockholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss. Based on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances at September 2, 2007, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $15.2 million (pre tax) to interest income on an annual basis. Most transactions of our foreign subsidiaries are conducted in local currencies, limiting our exposure to changes in currency rates. We periodically enter into short term forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates on inventory purchases. The notional value of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at September 2, 2007 was $75.0 million. 32 Table of Contents 
 
Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) expenses per warehouse opening can vary due to the timing of the opening relative to our fiscal year end, whether the warehouse is owned or leased, whether the opening is in an existing, new or international market and the number and magnitude of warehouse remodel projects. 2007 vs. 2006 Preopening expenses totaled $55.2 million in fiscal 2007 compared to $42.5 million in fiscal 2006. This increase is primarily due to increased warehouse remodel activity and international openings. 2006 vs. 2005 Preopening expenses totaled $42.5 million in fiscal 2006 compared to $53.2 million in fiscal 2005. During fiscal 2005, we adjusted our method of accounting for leases (entered into over the previous twenty years), primarily related to ground leases at certain owned warehouse locations that did not require rental payments during the period of construction. We recorded a cumulative pre tax, non cash charge of $16.0 million to preopening expenses in the second quarter of fiscal 2005. Excluding this charge, preopening expenses increased year over year, due to the increase in warehouse openings. Provision for Impaired Assets and Closing Costs, net Fiscal 2007 Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 Provision for impaired assets and closing costs, net: Warehouse closing expenses $ 15,887 $ 3,762 $ 11,619 Impairment of long lived assets 3,893 Net (gains) losses on the sale of real property (2,279 ) 1,691 881 Total $ 13,608 $ 5,453 $ 16,393 The provision primarily includes costs related to impairment of long lived assets, future lease obligations of warehouses that have been relocated to new facilities, accelerated depreciation on buildings to be demolished or sold and that are not otherwise impaired, and losses or gains resulting from the sale of real property. 2007 vs. 2006 The net provision for impaired assets and closing costs was $13.6 million in fiscal 2007, compared to $5.5 million in fiscal 2006. In fiscal 2007, approximately $13.0 million of this provision related to the acceleration of depreciation on ten buildings expected to be relocated in fiscal 2008. 2006 vs. 2005 The net provision for impaired assets and closing costs was $5.5 million in fiscal 2006, compared to $16.4 million in fiscal 2005. The provision for fiscal 2006 included charges of $3.8 million for warehouse closing expenses and $1.7 million for net losses on the sale of real property. The provision for fiscal 2005 included charges of $11.6 million for warehouse closing expenses, primarily related to lease obligations and accelerated building depreciation, $3.9 million for impairment of long lived assets, and $0.9 million for net losses on the sale of real property. 21 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) The reserve for warehouse closing costs, classified within other current liabilities, at the end of fiscal 2007 and 2006 included: September 2,2007 September 3,2006 Reserve for warehouse closing costs: Future lease obligations $ 6,086 $ 5,950 Other 737 1,091 Total $ 6,823 $ 7,041 Interest Expense Fiscal 2007 Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 Interest expense $ 64,079 $ 12,570 $ 34,437 2007 vs. 2006 Interest expense totaled $64.1 million in fiscal 2007, compared to $12.6 million in fiscal 2006. On February 20, 2007, we issued $900 million of 5.3% Senior Notes due March 15, 2012 (2012 Notes) at a discount of $2.5 million and $1.1 billion of 5.5% Senior Notes due March 15, 2017 (2017 Notes) at a discount of $5.9 million, (together the 2007 Senior Notes). The increase in interest expense for fiscal 2007 resulted primarily from the additional interest incurred related to the 2007 Senior Notes, offset by lower interest expense resulting from the repayment of the $300 million 5.5% Senior Notes (2002 Senior Notes) in March 2007. In addition, interest expense decreased on the 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes (Zero Coupon Notes) as note holders converted approximately $61.2 million in principal amount of the Zero Coupon Notes into common stock, or $42.3 million after factoring in the related debt discount. 2006 vs. 2005 Interest expense totaled $12.6 million in fiscal 2006, compared to $34.4 million in fiscal 2005. Interest expense in fiscal 2006 primarily included interest on the 2002 Senior Notes, the Zero Coupon Notes, and balances outstanding under our bank credit facilities and promissory notes. In fiscal 2005, interest expense also included interest on the 7 1/8% Senior Notes. The decrease in interest expense in fiscal 2006 resulted primarily from the repayment of the 7 1/8% Senior Notes in June 2005. In addition, interest expense decreased on the Zero Coupon Notes as note holders converted into common stock approximately $286.5 million in principal amount of the Zero Coupon Notes, or $188.9 million after factoring in the related debt discount. The amount of interest capitalized increased in fiscal 2006 due to increased warehouse openings, contributing to the decrease in interest expense, as both interest rates and the dollar amount of projects under construction increased. The overall decrease in interest expense in fiscal 2006 was partially offset by the increase in interest rates on the 2002 Senior Notes, which were swapped into variable rate debt in March 2002. Interest Income and Other Fiscal 2007 Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 Interest income $ 128,413 $ 113,712 $ 81,915 Earnings of affiliates 35,622 28,180 26,459 Minority interest and other 1,449 (3,537 ) 722 Interest Income and other $ 165,484 $ 138,355 $ 109,096 22 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) 2007 vs. 2006 Interest income and other totaled $165.5 million in fiscal 2007, compared to $138.4 million in fiscal 2006. This increase is largely due to the increase in our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments resulting from increased earnings from operations and the proceeds of the issuance of the 2007 Senior Notes, as well as an increase in the earnings of affiliates, primarily our investment in Costco Mexico (a 50% owned joint venture). 2006 vs. 2005 Interest income and other totaled $138.4 million in fiscal 2006, compared to $109.1 million in fiscal 2005. This increase primarily reflects increased interest income resulting from higher interest rates earned, as well as an extra week in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005. Provision for Income Taxes Fiscal 2007 Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 Income tax expense $ 627,219 $ 648,202 $ 485,870 Effective tax rate 36.68 % 37.01 % 31.37 % The effective income tax rate on earnings in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005 was 36.68%, 37.01% and 31.37%, respectively. The lower rate in fiscal 2005 was primarily attributable to a non recurring $54.2 million income tax benefit, primarily from the settlement of a transfer pricing dispute between the United States and Canada (covering the years 1996 2003) and a net tax benefit on excess foreign tax credits on unremitted foreign earnings subject to repatriation of $20.6 million. Excluding these benefits the effective income tax rate on earnings in fiscal 2005 would have been 36.20%. Net Income Fiscal 2007 Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 Net income $ 1,082,772 $ 1,103,215 $ 1,063,092 Unusual items (net of tax) 119,496 Net income, as adjusted $ 1,202,268 $ 1,103,215 $ 1,063,092 Diluted earnings per share $ 2.37 $ 2.30 $ 2.18 Shares used to calculate diluted net income per common share 457,641 480,341 492,035 Diluted earnings per share increase 3 % 6 % 18 % 2007 vs. 2006 Net income for fiscal 2007 was $1.08 billion, or $2.37 per diluted share, compared to $1.10 billion, or $2.30 per diluted share, during fiscal 2006. During fiscal 2007, we repurchased 36.4 million shares of common stock, favorably impacting earnings per diluted share by approximately $0.03. The unusual items previously discussed totaled $119.5 million, net of tax, or $0.26 per diluted share in fiscal 2007. Exclusive of these items, earnings for fiscal 2007 were $2.63 per diluted share, a 14% increase over the prior year. 23 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) 2006 vs. 2005 Net income for fiscal 2006 increased 3.8%, to $1.10 billion or $2.30 per diluted share, from $1.06 billion or $2.18 per diluted share, during fiscal 2005. During fiscal 2006, we repurchased 28.4 million shares of common stock, favorably impacting earnings per diluted share by approximately $0.02. The fiscal 2005 results included several non recurring items that in the aggregate positively impacted reported earnings for all of fiscal 2005 by approximately $0.14 per share: a $54.2 million (approximately $0.11 per diluted share) income tax benefit resulting primarily from the settlement of a transfer pricing dispute between the United States and Canada; a cumulative pre tax, non cash charge to preopening expenses of $16.0 million (approximately $0.02 per diluted share) related to a correction to our method of accounting for ground leases; and a net tax benefit with respect to excess foreign tax credits on unremitted foreign earnings recorded in the fourth quarter of $20.6 million (approximately $0.04 per diluted share). Exclusive of these items, fiscal 2005 earnings were $2.04 per diluted share. Fiscal 2006s earnings per diluted share represents an increase of 13% over that figure. Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table itemizes our most liquid assets (dollars in thousands): September 2,2007 September 3,2006 Cash and cash equivalents $ 2,779,733 $ 1,510,939 Short term investments 575,787 1,322,181 Total $ 3,355,520 $ 2,833,120 Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from warehouse operations and our existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances, which were $3.36 billion and $2.83 billion at September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, respectively. Of these balances, approximately $655.2 million and $593.6 million at September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, respectively, represented debit and credit card receivables, primarily related to weekend sales immediately prior to the year end close. The increase in our most liquid assets of $522.4 million to $3.36 billion at September 2, 2007 was due primarily to the issuance of the 2007 Senior Notes and the cash provided by our operating activities, offset by expenditures for the repurchase of our common stock and the acquisition of property and equipment related to warehouse expansion. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $2.08 billion in fiscal 2007 compared to $1.83 billion in fiscal 2006, an increase of $245.2 million. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in cash flow due to a decrease in our investment in net merchandise inventories (merchandise inventory less accounts payable) of $378.8 million, offset by a decrease in cash flow from operating assets and liabilities of $130.4 million. Net cash used in investing activities totaled $655.3 million in fiscal 2007 compared to $1.16 billion in fiscal 2006, respectively, a decrease of approximately $502.2 million. The decrease in cash used in investing activities relates primarily to an increase of $169.2 million in additions to property and equipment related to warehouse expansion and remodel projects, offset by an increase in cash provided by the net reductions in short term investments of $663.8 million. Net cash used in financing activities totaled $164.6 million in fiscal 2007 compared to $1.23 billion in fiscal 2006. The $1.1 billion decrease in net cash used in financing activities was primarily due to the issuance of the 2007 Senior Notes in February 2007, which provided approximately $1.99 billion in 24 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) proceeds. This was partially offset by the repurchase of common stock in fiscal 2007, which used $1.98 billion of cash, compared to $1.44 billion in fiscal 2006, an increase of approximately $534.8 million and the repayment of long term debt of $307.9 million related primarily to the 2002 Senior Notes retired in March 2007. Dividends In April 2007, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash dividend from $0.13 to $0.145 per share or $0.58 on an annualized basis. Our quarterly cash dividends paid in fiscal 2007 totaled $0.55 per share. In fiscal 2006, we paid quarterly cash dividends totaling $0.49 per share. Contractual Obligations Our commitments at fiscal year end to make future payments under contractual obligations were as follows, as of September 2, 2007 (amounts in thousands): Payments Due by Fiscal Year 2008 2009 to2010 2011 to2012 2013 andthereafter Total Contractual obligations Purchase obligations (merchandise)(1) $ 3,626,627 $ 1,357 $ $ $ 3,627,984 Long term debt(2) 173,160 277,652 1,116,400 1,470,117 3,037,329 Operating leases(3) 137,225 242,461 209,723 1,305,035 1,894,444 Purchase obligations (equipment, services and other)(4) 350,108 40,517 1,089 391,714 Construction Commitments 329,941 329,941 Capital lease obligations and other(2) 3,990 1,937 686 5,193 11,806 Other(5) 2,168 3,936 2,546 4,928 13,578 Total $ 4,623,219 $ 567,860 $ 1,330,444 $ 2,785,273 $ 9,306,796 (1) Includes open merchandise purchase orders. (2) Amounts include contractual interest payments. (3) Operating lease obligations exclude amounts commonly referred to as common area maintenance, taxes and insurance and have been reduced by $149,407 to reflect sub lease income. (4) The amounts exclude certain services negotiated at the individual warehouse or regional level that are not significant and generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty. (5) Consists of asset retirement and deferred compensation obligations. Expansion Plans Our primary requirement for capital is the domestic and international financing of land, building and equipment costs for new and remodeled warehouses, plus the costs of initial warehouse operations and working capital requirements. While there can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized and plans are subject to change upon further review, it is managements current intention to spend approximately $1.6 billion to 25 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) $1.8 billion during fiscal 2008 for real estate, construction, remodeling and equipment for warehouse clubs and related operations. These expenditures are expected to be financed with a combination of cash provided from operations and the use of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. Plans for the United States and Canada during fiscal 2008 are to open approximately 38 to 42 new warehouses, inclusive of 8 to 10 relocations to larger and better located facilities. We expect to continue our review of expansion plans in our international operations, including the United Kingdom and Asia, along with other international markets. Additional Equity Investments in Subsidiaries and Joint Ventures In each of fiscal years 2006 and 2005, we contributed an additional $15 million to our investment in Costco Mexico (a 50% owned joint venture), which did not impact our percentage ownership of this entity, as our joint venture partner contributed a like amount. There were no such contributions in 2007. Bank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs (all amounts stated in U.S. dollars) A wholly owned Canadian subsidiary has a $189.8 million commercial paper program ($180.9 million at September 3, 2006) supported by a $113.9 million bank credit facility that expires in March 2008 ($54.2 million at September 3, 2006) with a Canadian bank, which we guarantee. At September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, no amounts were outstanding under the Canadian commercial paper program or the bank credit facility. Applicable interest rates on the credit facility at September 2, 2007, and September 3, 2006 were 5.00% and 4.65%, respectively. At September 2, 2007, standby letters of credit totaling $24.1 million issued under the bank credit facility left $89.8 million available for commercial paper support. At September 3, 2006, standby letters of credit totaling $20.8 million issued under the bank credit facility left $33.4 million available for commercial paper support. Our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary has a short term $38.7 million bank line of credit ($12.8 million at September 3, 2006) that expires in February 2008.

A second $30.1 million bank line of credit also expires in February 2008. At September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, $7.8 million and $0.9 million, respectively, were borrowed under the second facility. Applicable interest rates on the second credit facility at September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, were 1.10% and 0.95%, respectively. Our Korean subsidiary has a short term $12.8 million bank line of credit ($12.5 million at September 3, 2006) which expires in March 2008. At September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, no amounts were borrowed under the line of credit and $2.0 million in both years was used to support standby letters of credit. Applicable interest rates on the credit facility at September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006 were 6.09% and 5.48%, respectively. Our Taiwan subsidiary has a $6.1 million bank revolving credit facility ($5.2 million at September 3, 2006) and a $3.0 million bank overdraft facility, both expiring in January 2008. At September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, no amounts were borrowed under the credit facility and $1.2 million and $1.9 million, respectively, were used to support standby letters of credit. Applicable interest rates on the credit facility at September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, were 4.50% and 4.00%, respectively. A second $15.2 million bank revolving credit facility is in place, which expires in July 2008. At September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, no amounts were borrowed under the second credit facility 26 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) and $4.2 million and $2.0 million, respectively, were used to support standby letters of credit. Applicable interest rates on the credit facility at September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, were 4.44% and 4.00%, respectively. A third $9.1 million bank revolving credit facility is in place, which expires in March 2008. At September 2, 2007 no amounts were borrowed under the third credit facility and no amounts were used to support standby letters of credit. The applicable interest rate on the credit facility at September 2, 2007 was 4.57%. Our wholly owned United Kingdom subsidiary has a $80.6 million bank revolving credit facility ($113.9 million at September 3, 2006) expiring in February 2010, a $70.5 million bank overdraft facility ($66.5 million at September 3, 2006), renewable on a yearly basis in May 2008, and a $40.3 million uncommitted money market line entered into in February 2007 and renewable on a yearly basis beginning in May 2008. At September 2, 2007, $20.1 million was outstanding under the revolving credit facility with an applicable interest rate of 6.23%, $15.6 million was outstanding under the uncommitted line with an applicable interest rate of 6.47% and no amounts were outstanding under the bank overdraft facility with an applicable interest rate of 6.75%. At September 3, 2006, $38.0 million was outstanding under the revolving credit facility, with an applicable interest rate of 5.32%, and no amounts were outstanding under the bank overdraft facility. Letters of Credit We have letter of credit facilities (for commercial and standby letters of credit) totaling $475.0 million. The outstanding commitments under these facilities at September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006 totaled $119.1 million and $84.9 million, respectively, including $71.7 million and $54.9 million, respectively, in standby letters of credit. Financing Activities On February 20, 2007, we issued $900 million of 5.3% Senior Notes due March 15, 2012 at a discount of $2.5 million and $1.1 billion of 5.5% Senior Notes due March 15, 2017 at a discount of $5.9 million (together, the 2007 Senior Notes). Interest on the 2007 Senior Notes is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year, with the first payment due on September 15, 2007. The net proceeds were used, in part, to repay the 2002 Senior Notes in March 2007, and the balance has been and will be used for general corporate purposes, including repurchases of our common stock. The $8.4 million discount and $2.0 million issuance costs associated with the 2007 Senior Notes are being amortized to interest expense over the terms of those notes. At our option, we may redeem the 2007 Senior Notes at any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest up to the redemption date. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount of the 2007 Senior Notes to be redeemed, or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, we will be required to make an offer to purchase the 2007 Senior Notes at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase, upon certain events as defined by the terms of the 2007 Senior Notes. In April 2003, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.92% in the aggregate amount of $34.4 million, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due in April 2010. In November 2002, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.88% in the aggregate amount of $25.8 million, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due in November 2009. In July 27 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) 2001, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued 1.187% promissory notes in the aggregate amount of $25.8 million, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due in July 2008. In October 2000, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued 2.070% promissory notes in the aggregate amount of $30.1 million, through a private placement. Interest is payable annually and principal is due in October 2007 and will be refinanced. As of September 2, 2007, the 1.187% and the 2.070% promissory notes are reported in the current portion of long term debt on our consolidated balance sheets. In August 1997, we completed the sale of $900.0 million principal amount at maturity Zero Coupon Notes due in August 2017. The Zero Coupon Notes were priced with a yield to maturity of 3.5%, resulting in gross proceeds to us of $449.6 million. The current Notes outstanding are convertible into a maximum of 1.5 million shares of Costco Common Stock shares at an initial conversion price of $22.71. Holders of the Zero Coupon Notes may require us to purchase the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of purchase) in August 2012. We may redeem, at our option, the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of redemption) any time in or after August 2002. As of September 2, 2007, $832.4 million in principal amount of the Zero Coupon Notes had been converted by note holders to shares of Costco Common Stock, of which $61.2 million and $286.5 million in principal were converted in fiscal 2007 and 2006, respectively, or $42.3 million and $188.9 million in fiscal 2007 and 2006, respectively, after factoring in the related debt discount. Derivatives We have limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and use them only to manage well defined interest rate and foreign exchange risks. Forward foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on inventory purchases and typically have very short terms. These forward contracts do not qualify for derivative hedge accounting. The aggregate notional amount, which approximates the fair value of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, was $75.0 million and $63.5 million, respectively. The mark to market adjustment related to these contracts was $0.9 million and $1.1 million at September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, respectively. The majority of the forward foreign exchange contracts were entered into by our wholly owned United Kingdom subsidiary, primarily to hedge U.S. dollar merchandise inventory purchases. Effective March 25, 2002, we entered into fixed to floating interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk associated with our 2002 Senior Notes, which matured and were retired in March 2007. The swaps were designated and qualified as fair value hedges of the debt. As the terms of the swaps matched those of the underlying hedged debt, changes in the fair value of the swaps were offset by corresponding changes in the carrying amount of the hedged debt and resulted in no net earnings impact. At September 3, 2006, the aggregate value of the swaps was $1 million and was recorded in deferred income taxes and other current assets in our consolidated balance sheets. In March 2007, upon maturity of the debt and expiration of the swap agreements, the aggregate fair value of the swaps was zero. We are exposed to market risk for changes in utility commodity pricing, which we partially mitigate through the use of firm price contracts with counterparties for approximately 23% of our locations in the U.S. and Canada. The effects of these arrangements are not significant for any period presented. 28 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements With the exception of our operating leases, we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition or consolidated financial statements. Stock Repurchase Programs In January and July of 2006, our Board of Directors approved an additional $1.00 billion and $2.00 billion of stock repurchases, respectively, which expire in 2009, bringing total authorizations by our Board of Directors since inception of the program in fiscal 2001 to $4.50 billion. Subsequent to the end of fiscal 2007, our Board of Directors approved an additional $300.0 million of stock repurchases, which expires in 2010. During fiscal 2007, we repurchased 36.4 million shares at an average price of $54.39 totaling approximately $1.98 billion. During fiscal 2006, we repurchased 28.4 million shares of common stock, at an average price of $51.44, totaling approximately $1.46 billion. The remaining amount available to be purchased under our approved plan was approximately $646.4 million at September 2, 2007. Purchases are made from time to time as conditions warrant in the open market or in block purchases, or pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5 1. Repurchased shares are retired. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments. We continue to review our accounting policies and evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, merchandise inventory valuation, impairment of long lived assets, warehouse closing costs, insurance/self insurance liabilities and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. Revenue Recognition We generally recognize sales, net of estimated returns, at the time the member takes possession of merchandise or receives services. When we collect payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services, the amount received is generally recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed. We provide for estimated sales returns based on historical merchandise returns levels. In connection with changes to our consumer electronics returns policy in the spring of 2007, we examined operational data regarding member return patterns that had not been previously analyzed. The data indicated a longer timeframe over which returns are received than previously used to estimate the sales return reserve. Accordingly, as previously disclosed, during fiscal 2007 we increased the reserve balance and recorded an adjustment to sales of $452.6 million and a pretax charge to income of $94.3 million for the related gross margin and disposition costs. We evaluate the criteria of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal Versus Net as an Agent, in determining whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, when we are the primary obligor, subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, influence product or service specifications, or have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded on a gross basis. If we are not the 29 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) primary obligor and do not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above, we record the net amounts as commissions earned, which is reflected in net sales. Membership fee revenue represents annual membership fees paid by substantially all of our members. We account for membership fee revenue on a deferred basis, whereby membership fee revenue is recognized ratably over one year. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, we performed a detailed analysis of the timing of recognition of membership fees based on each members specific renewal date as this methodology represented an improvement over our historical method, which was based on the period in which the fee was collected. This review resulted in a $56.2 million reduction to membership fee revenue and corresponding increase to deferred membership fees on our consolidated balance sheet. This adjustment includes both a change in method of applying an accounting principle to a preferable method and a correction for cumulative timing errors. Our Executive members qualify for a 2% reward (which can be redeemed only at Costco warehouses), up to a maximum of $500 per year, on all qualified purchases made at Costco. We account for this 2% reward as a reduction in sales, with the related liability being classified within other current liabilities. The sales reduction and corresponding liability are computed after giving effect to the estimated impact of non redemptions based on historical data. Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, as determined primarily by the retail method of accounting, and are stated using the last in, first out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail method of accounting and are stated using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. We believe the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. We record an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the expected annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at fiscal year end. At both September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006 merchandise inventories valued at LIFO approximated FIFO after considering the lower of cost or market principle. We provide for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts as a percentage of net sales. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect results of the actual physical inventory count, which generally occur in the second and fourth fiscal quarters of the fiscal year. Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as we progress toward earning those rebates, provided they are probable and reasonably estimable. Other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of agreement, or other systematic and rational approaches. Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Warehouse Closing costs We periodically evaluate our long lived assets for indicators of impairment, such as a decision to relocate or close a warehouse location. Our judgments are based on existing market and operational conditions. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring a downward adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value. We provide estimates for warehouse closing costs for both leased and owned locations to be closed or relocated. A considerable amount of judgment is involved in determining any impairment or our net 30 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) liability, particularly related to the estimated sales price of owned locations and the potential sublease income at leased locations. These estimates are based on real estate conditions in the markets and our experience in those markets. We make assumptions about the average period of time it would take to sublease the location and the amount of potential sublease income for each leased location. We reassess our liability each quarter and adjust our liability accordingly when our estimates change. Insurance/Self Insurance Liabilities We use a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance pool, to provide for potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property damage, director and officers liability, vehicle liability and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience and evaluations of outside experts, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Income Taxes The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Significant judgment is required in assessing, among other things, the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items. We establish reserves when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable, we determine that certain positions may be successfully challenged. When facts and circumstances change, we adjust these reserves through our provision for income taxes. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48), which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006 and we will adopt these new requirements as of the beginning of fiscal 2008. The estimated cumulative impact of adopting FIN 48 in fiscal 2008 is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157), which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements required under other accounting pronouncements, but does not change existing guidance as to whether or not an instrument is carried at fair value. SFAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. We must adopt these new requirements no later than our first quarter of fiscal 2009. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, Including an Amendment to FASB No. 115 (SFAS 159). Under SFAS 159, entities may elect to measure specified financial instruments and warranty and insurance contracts at fair value 31 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) on a contract by contract basis, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings each reporting period. The election, called the fair value option, will enable entities to achieve an offset accounting effect for changes in fair value of certain related assets and liabilities without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions. SFAS 159 is effective as of the beginning of a companys first fiscal year that begins after November 15, 2007. We must adopt these new requirements no later than our first quarter of fiscal 2009. We are in the process of evaluating the impact that adoption of SFAS 157 and SFAS 159 will have on our future consolidated financial statements. Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to financial market risk resulting from changes in interest and foreign currency rates. We do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions, nor hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. The nature and amount of our long and short term debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As of September 2, 2007, our fixed rate long term debt included $67.6 million principal amount at maturity of 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes carried at $47.8 million, $900.0 million of 5.3% Senior Notes carried at $897.8 million, $1.10 billion of 5.5% Senior Notes carried at $1.09 billion and additional notes and capital lease obligations totaling $127.9 million. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt. We hold interest bearing instruments that are classified as cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. Our investment policy is to manage our cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances to preserve principal and liquidity, while seeking to enhance the return on our investment portfolio through the investment of available funds. We diversify our investment portfolio by investing in multiple types of investment grade securities through a combination of internal and third party investment management. Short term investments generally have a maturity of three months to five years from the purchase date. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. As the majority of these instruments are of a short term nature, if interest rates were to increase or decrease, there is no material risk of a material valuation adjustment related to these instruments. For those instruments that are classified as available for sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in interest rates are reflected within stockholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss. Based on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances at September 2, 2007, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $15.2 million (pre tax) to interest income on an annual basis. Most transactions of our foreign subsidiaries are conducted in local currencies, limiting our exposure to changes in currency rates. We periodically enter into short term forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates on inventory purchases. The notional value of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at September 2, 2007 was $75.0 million. 32 Table of Contents 
 
Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) The reserve for warehouse closing costs, classified within other current liabilities, at the end of fiscal 2007 and 2006 included: September 2,2007 September 3,2006 Reserve for warehouse closing costs: Future lease obligations $ 6,086 $ 5,950 Other 737 1,091 Total $ 6,823 $ 7,041 Interest Expense Fiscal 2007 Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 Interest expense $ 64,079 $ 12,570 $ 34,437 2007 vs. 2006 Interest expense totaled $64.1 million in fiscal 2007, compared to $12.6 million in fiscal 2006. On February 20, 2007, we issued $900 million of 5.3% Senior Notes due March 15, 2012 (2012 Notes) at a discount of $2.5 million and $1.1 billion of 5.5% Senior Notes due March 15, 2017 (2017 Notes) at a discount of $5.9 million, (together the 2007 Senior Notes). The increase in interest expense for fiscal 2007 resulted primarily from the additional interest incurred related to the 2007 Senior Notes, offset by lower interest expense resulting from the repayment of the $300 million 5.5% Senior Notes (2002 Senior Notes) in March 2007. In addition, interest expense decreased on the 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes (Zero Coupon Notes) as note holders converted approximately $61.2 million in principal amount of the Zero Coupon Notes into common stock, or $42.3 million after factoring in the related debt discount. 2006 vs. 2005 Interest expense totaled $12.6 million in fiscal 2006, compared to $34.4 million in fiscal 2005. Interest expense in fiscal 2006 primarily included interest on the 2002 Senior Notes, the Zero Coupon Notes, and balances outstanding under our bank credit facilities and promissory notes. In fiscal 2005, interest expense also included interest on the 7 1/8% Senior Notes. The decrease in interest expense in fiscal 2006 resulted primarily from the repayment of the 7 1/8% Senior Notes in June 2005. In addition, interest expense decreased on the Zero Coupon Notes as note holders converted into common stock approximately $286.5 million in principal amount of the Zero Coupon Notes, or $188.9 million after factoring in the related debt discount. The amount of interest capitalized increased in fiscal 2006 due to increased warehouse openings, contributing to the decrease in interest expense, as both interest rates and the dollar amount of projects under construction increased. The overall decrease in interest expense in fiscal 2006 was partially offset by the increase in interest rates on the 2002 Senior Notes, which were swapped into variable rate debt in March 2002. Interest Income and Other Fiscal 2007 Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 Interest income $ 128,413 $ 113,712 $ 81,915 Earnings of affiliates 35,622 28,180 26,459 Minority interest and other 1,449 (3,537 ) 722 Interest Income and other $ 165,484 $ 138,355 $ 109,096 22 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) 2007 vs. 2006 Interest income and other totaled $165.5 million in fiscal 2007, compared to $138.4 million in fiscal 2006. This increase is largely due to the increase in our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments resulting from increased earnings from operations and the proceeds of the issuance of the 2007 Senior Notes, as well as an increase in the earnings of affiliates, primarily our investment in Costco Mexico (a 50% owned joint venture). 2006 vs. 2005 Interest income and other totaled $138.4 million in fiscal 2006, compared to $109.1 million in fiscal 2005. This increase primarily reflects increased interest income resulting from higher interest rates earned, as well as an extra week in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005. Provision for Income Taxes Fiscal 2007 Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 Income tax expense $ 627,219 $ 648,202 $ 485,870 Effective tax rate 36.68 % 37.01 % 31.37 % The effective income tax rate on earnings in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005 was 36.68%, 37.01% and 31.37%, respectively. The lower rate in fiscal 2005 was primarily attributable to a non recurring $54.2 million income tax benefit, primarily from the settlement of a transfer pricing dispute between the United States and Canada (covering the years 1996 2003) and a net tax benefit on excess foreign tax credits on unremitted foreign earnings subject to repatriation of $20.6 million. Excluding these benefits the effective income tax rate on earnings in fiscal 2005 would have been 36.20%. Net Income Fiscal 2007 Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 Net income $ 1,082,772 $ 1,103,215 $ 1,063,092 Unusual items (net of tax) 119,496 Net income, as adjusted $ 1,202,268 $ 1,103,215 $ 1,063,092 Diluted earnings per share $ 2.37 $ 2.30 $ 2.18 Shares used to calculate diluted net income per common share 457,641 480,341 492,035 Diluted earnings per share increase 3 % 6 % 18 % 2007 vs. 2006 Net income for fiscal 2007 was $1.08 billion, or $2.37 per diluted share, compared to $1.10 billion, or $2.30 per diluted share, during fiscal 2006. During fiscal 2007, we repurchased 36.4 million shares of common stock, favorably impacting earnings per diluted share by approximately $0.03. The unusual items previously discussed totaled $119.5 million, net of tax, or $0.26 per diluted share in fiscal 2007. Exclusive of these items, earnings for fiscal 2007 were $2.63 per diluted share, a 14% increase over the prior year. 23 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) 2006 vs. 2005 Net income for fiscal 2006 increased 3.8%, to $1.10 billion or $2.30 per diluted share, from $1.06 billion or $2.18 per diluted share, during fiscal 2005. During fiscal 2006, we repurchased 28.4 million shares of common stock, favorably impacting earnings per diluted share by approximately $0.02. The fiscal 2005 results included several non recurring items that in the aggregate positively impacted reported earnings for all of fiscal 2005 by approximately $0.14 per share: a $54.2 million (approximately $0.11 per diluted share) income tax benefit resulting primarily from the settlement of a transfer pricing dispute between the United States and Canada; a cumulative pre tax, non cash charge to preopening expenses of $16.0 million (approximately $0.02 per diluted share) related to a correction to our method of accounting for ground leases; and a net tax benefit with respect to excess foreign tax credits on unremitted foreign earnings recorded in the fourth quarter of $20.6 million (approximately $0.04 per diluted share). Exclusive of these items, fiscal 2005 earnings were $2.04 per diluted share. Fiscal 2006s earnings per diluted share represents an increase of 13% over that figure. Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table itemizes our most liquid assets (dollars in thousands): September 2,2007 September 3,2006 Cash and cash equivalents $ 2,779,733 $ 1,510,939 Short term investments 575,787 1,322,181 Total $ 3,355,520 $ 2,833,120 Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from warehouse operations and our existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances, which were $3.36 billion and $2.83 billion at September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, respectively. Of these balances, approximately $655.2 million and $593.6 million at September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, respectively, represented debit and credit card receivables, primarily related to weekend sales immediately prior to the year end close. The increase in our most liquid assets of $522.4 million to $3.36 billion at September 2, 2007 was due primarily to the issuance of the 2007 Senior Notes and the cash provided by our operating activities, offset by expenditures for the repurchase of our common stock and the acquisition of property and equipment related to warehouse expansion. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $2.08 billion in fiscal 2007 compared to $1.83 billion in fiscal 2006, an increase of $245.2 million. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in cash flow due to a decrease in our investment in net merchandise inventories (merchandise inventory less accounts payable) of $378.8 million, offset by a decrease in cash flow from operating assets and liabilities of $130.4 million. Net cash used in investing activities totaled $655.3 million in fiscal 2007 compared to $1.16 billion in fiscal 2006, respectively, a decrease of approximately $502.2 million. The decrease in cash used in investing activities relates primarily to an increase of $169.2 million in additions to property and equipment related to warehouse expansion and remodel projects, offset by an increase in cash provided by the net reductions in short term investments of $663.8 million. Net cash used in financing activities totaled $164.6 million in fiscal 2007 compared to $1.23 billion in fiscal 2006. The $1.1 billion decrease in net cash used in financing activities was primarily due to the issuance of the 2007 Senior Notes in February 2007, which provided approximately $1.99 billion in 24 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) proceeds. This was partially offset by the repurchase of common stock in fiscal 2007, which used $1.98 billion of cash, compared to $1.44 billion in fiscal 2006, an increase of approximately $534.8 million and the repayment of long term debt of $307.9 million related primarily to the 2002 Senior Notes retired in March 2007. Dividends In April 2007, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash dividend from $0.13 to $0.145 per share or $0.58 on an annualized basis. Our quarterly cash dividends paid in fiscal 2007 totaled $0.55 per share. In fiscal 2006, we paid quarterly cash dividends totaling $0.49 per share. Contractual Obligations Our commitments at fiscal year end to make future payments under contractual obligations were as follows, as of September 2, 2007 (amounts in thousands): Payments Due by Fiscal Year 2008 2009 to2010 2011 to2012 2013 andthereafter Total Contractual obligations Purchase obligations (merchandise)(1) $ 3,626,627 $ 1,357 $ $ $ 3,627,984 Long term debt(2) 173,160 277,652 1,116,400 1,470,117 3,037,329 Operating leases(3) 137,225 242,461 209,723 1,305,035 1,894,444 Purchase obligations (equipment, services and other)(4) 350,108 40,517 1,089 391,714 Construction Commitments 329,941 329,941 Capital lease obligations and other(2) 3,990 1,937 686 5,193 11,806 Other(5) 2,168 3,936 2,546 4,928 13,578 Total $ 4,623,219 $ 567,860 $ 1,330,444 $ 2,785,273 $ 9,306,796 (1) Includes open merchandise purchase orders. (2) Amounts include contractual interest payments. (3) Operating lease obligations exclude amounts commonly referred to as common area maintenance, taxes and insurance and have been reduced by $149,407 to reflect sub lease income. (4) The amounts exclude certain services negotiated at the individual warehouse or regional level that are not significant and generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty. (5) Consists of asset retirement and deferred compensation obligations. Expansion Plans Our primary requirement for capital is the domestic and international financing of land, building and equipment costs for new and remodeled warehouses, plus the costs of initial warehouse operations and working capital requirements. While there can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized and plans are subject to change upon further review, it is managements current intention to spend approximately $1.6 billion to 25 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) $1.8 billion during fiscal 2008 for real estate, construction, remodeling and equipment for warehouse clubs and related operations. These expenditures are expected to be financed with a combination of cash provided from operations and the use of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. Plans for the United States and Canada during fiscal 2008 are to open approximately 38 to 42 new warehouses, inclusive of 8 to 10 relocations to larger and better located facilities. We expect to continue our review of expansion plans in our international operations, including the United Kingdom and Asia, along with other international markets. Additional Equity Investments in Subsidiaries and Joint Ventures In each of fiscal years 2006 and 2005, we contributed an additional $15 million to our investment in Costco Mexico (a 50% owned joint venture), which did not impact our percentage ownership of this entity, as our joint venture partner contributed a like amount. There were no such contributions in 2007. Bank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs (all amounts stated in U.S. dollars) A wholly owned Canadian subsidiary has a $189.8 million commercial paper program ($180.9 million at September 3, 2006) supported by a $113.9 million bank credit facility that expires in March 2008 ($54.2 million at September 3, 2006) with a Canadian bank, which we guarantee. At September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, no amounts were outstanding under the Canadian commercial paper program or the bank credit facility. Applicable interest rates on the credit facility at September 2, 2007, and September 3, 2006 were 5.00% and 4.65%, respectively. At September 2, 2007, standby letters of credit totaling $24.1 million issued under the bank credit facility left $89.8 million available for commercial paper support. At September 3, 2006, standby letters of credit totaling $20.8 million issued under the bank credit facility left $33.4 million available for commercial paper support. Our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary has a short term $38.7 million bank line of credit ($12.8 million at September 3, 2006) that expires in February 2008. At September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, $10.3 million and $2.5 million, respectively, were borrowed under the line of credit, and $8.6 million and $4.3 million, respectively, were used to support standby letters of credit. Applicable interest rates on the credit facility at September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, were 1.09% and 0.94%, respectively. A second $30.1 million bank line of credit also expires in February 2008. At September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, $7.8 million and $0.9 million, respectively, were borrowed under the second facility. Applicable interest rates on the second credit facility at September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, were 1.10% and 0.95%, respectively. Our Korean subsidiary has a short term $12.8 million bank line of credit ($12.5 million at September 3, 2006) which expires in March 2008. At September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, no amounts were borrowed under the line of credit and $2.0 million in both years was used to support standby letters of credit. Applicable interest rates on the credit facility at September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006 were 6.09% and 5.48%, respectively. Our Taiwan subsidiary has a $6.1 million bank revolving credit facility ($5.2 million at September 3, 2006) and a $3.0 million bank overdraft facility, both expiring in January 2008. At September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, no amounts were borrowed under the credit facility and $1.2 million and $1.9 million, respectively, were used to support standby letters of credit. Applicable interest rates on the credit facility at September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, were 4.50% and 4.00%, respectively. A second $15.2 million bank revolving credit facility is in place, which expires in July 2008. At September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, no amounts were borrowed under the second credit facility 26 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) and $4.2 million and $2.0 million, respectively, were used to support standby letters of credit. Applicable interest rates on the credit facility at September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, were 4.44% and 4.00%, respectively. A third $9.1 million bank revolving credit facility is in place, which expires in March 2008. At September 2, 2007 no amounts were borrowed under the third credit facility and no amounts were used to support standby letters of credit. The applicable interest rate on the credit facility at September 2, 2007 was 4.57%. Our wholly owned United Kingdom subsidiary has a $80.6 million bank revolving credit facility ($113.9 million at September 3, 2006) expiring in February 2010, a $70.5 million bank overdraft facility ($66.5 million at September 3, 2006), renewable on a yearly basis in May 2008, and a $40.3 million uncommitted money market line entered into in February 2007 and renewable on a yearly basis beginning in May 2008. At September 2, 2007, $20.1 million was outstanding under the revolving credit facility with an applicable interest rate of 6.23%, $15.6 million was outstanding under the uncommitted line with an applicable interest rate of 6.47% and no amounts were outstanding under the bank overdraft facility with an applicable interest rate of 6.75%. At September 3, 2006, $38.0 million was outstanding under the revolving credit facility, with an applicable interest rate of 5.32%, and no amounts were outstanding under the bank overdraft facility. Letters of Credit We have letter of credit facilities (for commercial and standby letters of credit) totaling $475.0 million. The outstanding commitments under these facilities at September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006 totaled $119.1 million and $84.9 million, respectively, including $71.7 million and $54.9 million, respectively, in standby letters of credit. Financing Activities On February 20, 2007, we issued $900 million of 5.3% Senior Notes due March 15, 2012 at a discount of $2.5 million and $1.1 billion of 5.5% Senior Notes due March 15, 2017 at a discount of $5.9 million (together, the 2007 Senior Notes). Interest on the 2007 Senior Notes is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year, with the first payment due on September 15, 2007. The net proceeds were used, in part, to repay the 2002 Senior Notes in March 2007, and the balance has been and will be used for general corporate purposes, including repurchases of our common stock. The $8.4 million discount and $2.0 million issuance costs associated with the 2007 Senior Notes are being amortized to interest expense over the terms of those notes. At our option, we may redeem the 2007 Senior Notes at any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest up to the redemption date. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount of the 2007 Senior Notes to be redeemed, or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, we will be required to make an offer to purchase the 2007 Senior Notes at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase, upon certain events as defined by the terms of the 2007 Senior Notes. In April 2003, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.92% in the aggregate amount of $34.4 million, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due in April 2010. In November 2002, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.88% in the aggregate amount of $25.8 million, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due in November 2009. In July 27 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) 2001, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued 1.187% promissory notes in the aggregate amount of $25.8 million, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due in July 2008. In October 2000, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued 2.070% promissory notes in the aggregate amount of $30.1 million, through a private placement. Interest is payable annually and principal is due in October 2007 and will be refinanced. As of September 2, 2007, the 1.187% and the 2.070% promissory notes are reported in the current portion of long term debt on our consolidated balance sheets. In August 1997, we completed the sale of $900.0 million principal amount at maturity Zero Coupon Notes due in August 2017. The Zero Coupon Notes were priced with a yield to maturity of 3.5%, resulting in gross proceeds to us of $449.6 million. The current Notes outstanding are convertible into a maximum of 1.5 million shares of Costco Common Stock shares at an initial conversion price of $22.71. Holders of the Zero Coupon Notes may require us to purchase the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of purchase) in August 2012. We may redeem, at our option, the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of redemption) any time in or after August 2002. As of September 2, 2007, $832.4 million in principal amount of the Zero Coupon Notes had been converted by note holders to shares of Costco Common Stock, of which $61.2 million and $286.5 million in principal were converted in fiscal 2007 and 2006, respectively, or $42.3 million and $188.9 million in fiscal 2007 and 2006, respectively, after factoring in the related debt discount. Derivatives We have limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and use them only to manage well defined interest rate and foreign exchange risks. Forward foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on inventory purchases and typically have very short terms. These forward contracts do not qualify for derivative hedge accounting. The aggregate notional amount, which approximates the fair value of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, was $75.0 million and $63.5 million, respectively. The mark to market adjustment related to these contracts was $0.9 million and $1.1 million at September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, respectively. The majority of the forward foreign exchange contracts were entered into by our wholly owned United Kingdom subsidiary, primarily to hedge U.S. dollar merchandise inventory purchases. Effective March 25, 2002, we entered into fixed to floating interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk associated with our 2002 Senior Notes, which matured and were retired in March 2007. The swaps were designated and qualified as fair value hedges of the debt. As the terms of the swaps matched those of the underlying hedged debt, changes in the fair value of the swaps were offset by corresponding changes in the carrying amount of the hedged debt and resulted in no net earnings impact. At September 3, 2006, the aggregate value of the swaps was $1 million and was recorded in deferred income taxes and other current assets in our consolidated balance sheets. In March 2007, upon maturity of the debt and expiration of the swap agreements, the aggregate fair value of the swaps was zero. We are exposed to market risk for changes in utility commodity pricing, which we partially mitigate through the use of firm price contracts with counterparties for approximately 23% of our locations in the U.S. and Canada. The effects of these arrangements are not significant for any period presented. 28 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements With the exception of our operating leases, we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition or consolidated financial statements. Stock Repurchase Programs In January and July of 2006, our Board of Directors approved an additional $1.00 billion and $2.00 billion of stock repurchases, respectively, which expire in 2009, bringing total authorizations by our Board of Directors since inception of the program in fiscal 2001 to $4.50 billion. Subsequent to the end of fiscal 2007, our Board of Directors approved an additional $300.0 million of stock repurchases, which expires in 2010. During fiscal 2007, we repurchased 36.4 million shares at an average price of $54.39 totaling approximately $1.98 billion. During fiscal 2006, we repurchased 28.4 million shares of common stock, at an average price of $51.44, totaling approximately $1.46 billion. The remaining amount available to be purchased under our approved plan was approximately $646.4 million at September 2, 2007. Purchases are made from time to time as conditions warrant in the open market or in block purchases, or pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5 1. Repurchased shares are retired. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments. We continue to review our accounting policies and evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, merchandise inventory valuation, impairment of long lived assets, warehouse closing costs, insurance/self insurance liabilities and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. Revenue Recognition We generally recognize sales, net of estimated returns, at the time the member takes possession of merchandise or receives services. When we collect payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services, the amount received is generally recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed. We provide for estimated sales returns based on historical merchandise returns levels. In connection with changes to our consumer electronics returns policy in the spring of 2007, we examined operational data regarding member return patterns that had not been previously analyzed. The data indicated a longer timeframe over which returns are received than previously used to estimate the sales return reserve. Accordingly, as previously disclosed, during fiscal 2007 we increased the reserve balance and recorded an adjustment to sales of $452.6 million and a pretax charge to income of $94.3 million for the related gross margin and disposition costs. We evaluate the criteria of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal Versus Net as an Agent, in determining whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, when we are the primary obligor, subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, influence product or service specifications, or have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded on a gross basis. If we are not the 29 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) primary obligor and do not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above, we record the net amounts as commissions earned, which is reflected in net sales. Membership fee revenue represents annual membership fees paid by substantially all of our members. We account for membership fee revenue on a deferred basis, whereby membership fee revenue is recognized ratably over one year. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, we performed a detailed analysis of the timing of recognition of membership fees based on each members specific renewal date as this methodology represented an improvement over our historical method, which was based on the period in which the fee was collected. This review resulted in a $56.2 million reduction to membership fee revenue and corresponding increase to deferred membership fees on our consolidated balance sheet. This adjustment includes both a change in method of applying an accounting principle to a preferable method and a correction for cumulative timing errors. Our Executive members qualify for a 2% reward (which can be redeemed only at Costco warehouses), up to a maximum of $500 per year, on all qualified purchases made at Costco. We account for this 2% reward as a reduction in sales, with the related liability being classified within other current liabilities. The sales reduction and corresponding liability are computed after giving effect to the estimated impact of non redemptions based on historical data. Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, as determined primarily by the retail method of accounting, and are stated using the last in, first out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail method of accounting and are stated using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. We believe the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. We record an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the expected annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at fiscal year end. At both September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006 merchandise inventories valued at LIFO approximated FIFO after considering the lower of cost or market principle. We provide for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts as a percentage of net sales. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect results of the actual physical inventory count, which generally occur in the second and fourth fiscal quarters of the fiscal year. Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as we progress toward earning those rebates, provided they are probable and reasonably estimable. Other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of agreement, or other systematic and rational approaches. Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Warehouse Closing costs We periodically evaluate our long lived assets for indicators of impairment, such as a decision to relocate or close a warehouse location. Our judgments are based on existing market and operational conditions. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring a downward adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value. We provide estimates for warehouse closing costs for both leased and owned locations to be closed or relocated. A considerable amount of judgment is involved in determining any impairment or our net 30 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) liability, particularly related to the estimated sales price of owned locations and the potential sublease income at leased locations. These estimates are based on real estate conditions in the markets and our experience in those markets. We make assumptions about the average period of time it would take to sublease the location and the amount of potential sublease income for each leased location. We reassess our liability each quarter and adjust our liability accordingly when our estimates change. Insurance/Self Insurance Liabilities We use a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance pool, to provide for potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property damage, director and officers liability, vehicle liability and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience and evaluations of outside experts, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Income Taxes The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Significant judgment is required in assessing, among other things, the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items. We establish reserves when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable, we determine that certain positions may be successfully challenged. When facts and circumstances change, we adjust these reserves through our provision for income taxes. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48), which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006 and we will adopt these new requirements as of the beginning of fiscal 2008. The estimated cumulative impact of adopting FIN 48 in fiscal 2008 is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157), which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements required under other accounting pronouncements, but does not change existing guidance as to whether or not an instrument is carried at fair value. SFAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. We must adopt these new requirements no later than our first quarter of fiscal 2009. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, Including an Amendment to FASB No. 115 (SFAS 159). Under SFAS 159, entities may elect to measure specified financial instruments and warranty and insurance contracts at fair value 31 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) on a contract by contract basis, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings each reporting period. The election, called the fair value option, will enable entities to achieve an offset accounting effect for changes in fair value of certain related assets and liabilities without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions. SFAS 159 is effective as of the beginning of a companys first fiscal year that begins after November 15, 2007. We must adopt these new requirements no later than our first quarter of fiscal 2009. We are in the process of evaluating the impact that adoption of SFAS 157 and SFAS 159 will have on our future consolidated financial statements. Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to financial market risk resulting from changes in interest and foreign currency rates. We do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions, nor hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. The nature and amount of our long and short term debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As of September 2, 2007, our fixed rate long term debt included $67.6 million principal amount at maturity of 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes carried at $47.8 million, $900.0 million of 5.3% Senior Notes carried at $897.8 million, $1.10 billion of 5.5% Senior Notes carried at $1.09 billion and additional notes and capital lease obligations totaling $127.9 million. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt. We hold interest bearing instruments that are classified as cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. Our investment policy is to manage our cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances to preserve principal and liquidity, while seeking to enhance the return on our investment portfolio through the investment of available funds. We diversify our investment portfolio by investing in multiple types of investment grade securities through a combination of internal and third party investment management. Short term investments generally have a maturity of three months to five years from the purchase date. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. As the majority of these instruments are of a short term nature, if interest rates were to increase or decrease, there is no material risk of a material valuation adjustment related to these instruments. For those instruments that are classified as available for sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in interest rates are reflected within stockholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss. Based on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances at September 2, 2007, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $15.2 million (pre tax) to interest income on an annual basis. Most transactions of our foreign subsidiaries are conducted in local currencies, limiting our exposure to changes in currency rates. We periodically enter into short term forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates on inventory purchases. The notional value of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at September 2, 2007 was $75.0 million. 32 Table of Contents 
 
Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) 2007 vs. 2006 Interest income and other totaled $165.5 million in fiscal 2007, compared to $138.4 million in fiscal 2006. This increase is largely due to the increase in our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments resulting from increased earnings from operations and the proceeds of the issuance of the 2007 Senior Notes, as well as an increase in the earnings of affiliates, primarily our investment in Costco Mexico (a 50% owned joint venture). 2006 vs. 2005 Interest income and other totaled $138.4 million in fiscal 2006, compared to $109.1 million in fiscal 2005. This increase primarily reflects increased interest income resulting from higher interest rates earned, as well as an extra week in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005. Provision for Income Taxes Fiscal 2007 Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 Income tax expense $ 627,219 $ 648,202 $ 485,870 Effective tax rate 36.68 % 37.01 % 31.37 % The effective income tax rate on earnings in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005 was 36.68%, 37.01% and 31.37%, respectively. The lower rate in fiscal 2005 was primarily attributable to a non recurring $54.2 million income tax benefit, primarily from the settlement of a transfer pricing dispute between the United States and Canada (covering the years 1996 2003) and a net tax benefit on excess foreign tax credits on unremitted foreign earnings subject to repatriation of $20.6 million. Excluding these benefits the effective income tax rate on earnings in fiscal 2005 would have been 36.20%. Net Income Fiscal 2007 Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 Net income $ 1,082,772 $ 1,103,215 $ 1,063,092 Unusual items (net of tax) 119,496 Net income, as adjusted $ 1,202,268 $ 1,103,215 $ 1,063,092 Diluted earnings per share $ 2.37 $ 2.30 $ 2.18 Shares used to calculate diluted net income per common share 457,641 480,341 492,035 Diluted earnings per share increase 3 % 6 % 18 % 2007 vs. 2006 Net income for fiscal 2007 was $1.08 billion, or $2.37 per diluted share, compared to $1.10 billion, or $2.30 per diluted share, during fiscal 2006. During fiscal 2007, we repurchased 36.4 million shares of common stock, favorably impacting earnings per diluted share by approximately $0.03. The unusual items previously discussed totaled $119.5 million, net of tax, or $0.26 per diluted share in fiscal 2007. Exclusive of these items, earnings for fiscal 2007 were $2.63 per diluted share, a 14% increase over the prior year. 23 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) 2006 vs. 2005 Net income for fiscal 2006 increased 3.8%, to $1.10 billion or $2.30 per diluted share, from $1.06 billion or $2.18 per diluted share, during fiscal 2005. During fiscal 2006, we repurchased 28.4 million shares of common stock, favorably impacting earnings per diluted share by approximately $0.02. The fiscal 2005 results included several non recurring items that in the aggregate positively impacted reported earnings for all of fiscal 2005 by approximately $0.14 per share: a $54.2 million (approximately $0.11 per diluted share) income tax benefit resulting primarily from the settlement of a transfer pricing dispute between the United States and Canada; a cumulative pre tax, non cash charge to preopening expenses of $16.0 million (approximately $0.02 per diluted share) related to a correction to our method of accounting for ground leases; and a net tax benefit with respect to excess foreign tax credits on unremitted foreign earnings recorded in the fourth quarter of $20.6 million (approximately $0.04 per diluted share). Exclusive of these items, fiscal 2005 earnings were $2.04 per diluted share. Fiscal 2006s earnings per diluted share represents an increase of 13% over that figure. Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table itemizes our most liquid assets (dollars in thousands): September 2,2007 September 3,2006 Cash and cash equivalents $ 2,779,733 $ 1,510,939 Short term investments 575,787 1,322,181 Total $ 3,355,520 $ 2,833,120 Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from warehouse operations and our existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances, which were $3.36 billion and $2.83 billion at September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, respectively. Of these balances, approximately $655.2 million and $593.6 million at September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, respectively, represented debit and credit card receivables, primarily related to weekend sales immediately prior to the year end close. The increase in our most liquid assets of $522.4 million to $3.36 billion at September 2, 2007 was due primarily to the issuance of the 2007 Senior Notes and the cash provided by our operating activities, offset by expenditures for the repurchase of our common stock and the acquisition of property and equipment related to warehouse expansion. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $2.08 billion in fiscal 2007 compared to $1.83 billion in fiscal 2006, an increase of $245.2 million. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in cash flow due to a decrease in our investment in net merchandise inventories (merchandise inventory less accounts payable) of $378.8 million, offset by a decrease in cash flow from operating assets and liabilities of $130.4 million. Net cash used in investing activities totaled $655.3 million in fiscal 2007 compared to $1.16 billion in fiscal 2006, respectively, a decrease of approximately $502.2 million. The decrease in cash used in investing activities relates primarily to an increase of $169.2 million in additions to property and equipment related to warehouse expansion and remodel projects, offset by an increase in cash provided by the net reductions in short term investments of $663.8 million. Net cash used in financing activities totaled $164.6 million in fiscal 2007 compared to $1.23 billion in fiscal 2006. The $1.1 billion decrease in net cash used in financing activities was primarily due to the issuance of the 2007 Senior Notes in February 2007, which provided approximately $1.99 billion in 24 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) proceeds. This was partially offset by the repurchase of common stock in fiscal 2007, which used $1.98 billion of cash, compared to $1.44 billion in fiscal 2006, an increase of approximately $534.8 million and the repayment of long term debt of $307.9 million related primarily to the 2002 Senior Notes retired in March 2007. Dividends In April 2007, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash dividend from $0.13 to $0.145 per share or $0.58 on an annualized basis. Our quarterly cash dividends paid in fiscal 2007 totaled $0.55 per share. In fiscal 2006, we paid quarterly cash dividends totaling $0.49 per share. Contractual Obligations Our commitments at fiscal year end to make future payments under contractual obligations were as follows, as of September 2, 2007 (amounts in thousands): Payments Due by Fiscal Year 2008 2009 to2010 2011 to2012 2013 andthereafter Total Contractual obligations Purchase obligations (merchandise)(1) $ 3,626,627 $ 1,357 $ $ $ 3,627,984 Long term debt(2) 173,160 277,652 1,116,400 1,470,117 3,037,329 Operating leases(3) 137,225 242,461 209,723 1,305,035 1,894,444 Purchase obligations (equipment, services and other)(4) 350,108 40,517 1,089 391,714 Construction Commitments 329,941 329,941 Capital lease obligations and other(2) 3,990 1,937 686 5,193 11,806 Other(5) 2,168 3,936 2,546 4,928 13,578 Total $ 4,623,219 $ 567,860 $ 1,330,444 $ 2,785,273 $ 9,306,796 (1) Includes open merchandise purchase orders. (2) Amounts include contractual interest payments. (3) Operating lease obligations exclude amounts commonly referred to as common area maintenance, taxes and insurance and have been reduced by $149,407 to reflect sub lease income. (4) The amounts exclude certain services negotiated at the individual warehouse or regional level that are not significant and generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty. (5) Consists of asset retirement and deferred compensation obligations. Expansion Plans Our primary requirement for capital is the domestic and international financing of land, building and equipment costs for new and remodeled warehouses, plus the costs of initial warehouse operations and working capital requirements. While there can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized and plans are subject to change upon further review, it is managements current intention to spend approximately $1.6 billion to 25 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) $1.8 billion during fiscal 2008 for real estate, construction, remodeling and equipment for warehouse clubs and related operations. These expenditures are expected to be financed with a combination of cash provided from operations and the use of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. Plans for the United States and Canada during fiscal 2008 are to open approximately 38 to 42 new warehouses, inclusive of 8 to 10 relocations to larger and better located facilities. We expect to continue our review of expansion plans in our international operations, including the United Kingdom and Asia, along with other international markets. Additional Equity Investments in Subsidiaries and Joint Ventures In each of fiscal years 2006 and 2005, we contributed an additional $15 million to our investment in Costco Mexico (a 50% owned joint venture), which did not impact our percentage ownership of this entity, as our joint venture partner contributed a like amount. There were no such contributions in 2007. Bank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs (all amounts stated in U.S. dollars) A wholly owned Canadian subsidiary has a $189.8 million commercial paper program ($180.9 million at September 3, 2006) supported by a $113.9 million bank credit facility that expires in March 2008 ($54.2 million at September 3, 2006) with a Canadian bank, which we guarantee. At September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, no amounts were outstanding under the Canadian commercial paper program or the bank credit facility. Applicable interest rates on the credit facility at September 2, 2007, and September 3, 2006 were 5.00% and 4.65%, respectively. At September 2, 2007, standby letters of credit totaling $24.1 million issued under the bank credit facility left $89.8 million available for commercial paper support. At September 3, 2006, standby letters of credit totaling $20.8 million issued under the bank credit facility left $33.4 million available for commercial paper support. Our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary has a short term $38.7 million bank line of credit ($12.8 million at September 3, 2006) that expires in February 2008. At September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, $10.3 million and $2.5 million, respectively, were borrowed under the line of credit, and $8.6 million and $4.3 million, respectively, were used to support standby letters of credit. Applicable interest rates on the credit facility at September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, were 1.09% and 0.94%, respectively. A second $30.1 million bank line of credit also expires in February 2008. At September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, $7.8 million and $0.9 million, respectively, were borrowed under the second facility. Applicable interest rates on the second credit facility at September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, were 1.10% and 0.95%, respectively. Our Korean subsidiary has a short term $12.8 million bank line of credit ($12.5 million at September 3, 2006) which expires in March 2008. At September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, no amounts were borrowed under the line of credit and $2.0 million in both years was used to support standby letters of credit. Applicable interest rates on the credit facility at September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006 were 6.09% and 5.48%, respectively. Our Taiwan subsidiary has a $6.1 million bank revolving credit facility ($5.2 million at September 3, 2006) and a $3.0 million bank overdraft facility, both expiring in January 2008. At September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, no amounts were borrowed under the credit facility and $1.2 million and $1.9 million, respectively, were used to support standby letters of credit. Applicable interest rates on the credit facility at September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, were 4.50% and 4.00%, respectively. A second $15.2 million bank revolving credit facility is in place, which expires in July 2008. At September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, no amounts were borrowed under the second credit facility 26 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) and $4.2 million and $2.0 million, respectively, were used to support standby letters of credit. Applicable interest rates on the credit facility at September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, were 4.44% and 4.00%, respectively. A third $9.1 million bank revolving credit facility is in place, which expires in March 2008. At September 2, 2007 no amounts were borrowed under the third credit facility and no amounts were used to support standby letters of credit. The applicable interest rate on the credit facility at September 2, 2007 was 4.57%. Our wholly owned United Kingdom subsidiary has a $80.6 million bank revolving credit facility ($113.9 million at September 3, 2006) expiring in February 2010, a $70.5 million bank overdraft facility ($66.5 million at September 3, 2006), renewable on a yearly basis in May 2008, and a $40.3 million uncommitted money market line entered into in February 2007 and renewable on a yearly basis beginning in May 2008. At September 2, 2007, $20.1 million was outstanding under the revolving credit facility with an applicable interest rate of 6.23%, $15.6 million was outstanding under the uncommitted line with an applicable interest rate of 6.47% and no amounts were outstanding under the bank overdraft facility with an applicable interest rate of 6.75%. At September 3, 2006, $38.0 million was outstanding under the revolving credit facility, with an applicable interest rate of 5.32%, and no amounts were outstanding under the bank overdraft facility. Letters of Credit We have letter of credit facilities (for commercial and standby letters of credit) totaling $475.0 million. The outstanding commitments under these facilities at September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006 totaled $119.1 million and $84.9 million, respectively, including $71.7 million and $54.9 million, respectively, in standby letters of credit. Financing Activities On February 20, 2007, we issued $900 million of 5.3% Senior Notes due March 15, 2012 at a discount of $2.5 million and $1.1 billion of 5.5% Senior Notes due March 15, 2017 at a discount of $5.9 million (together, the 2007 Senior Notes). Interest on the 2007 Senior Notes is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year, with the first payment due on September 15, 2007. The net proceeds were used, in part, to repay the 2002 Senior Notes in March 2007, and the balance has been and will be used for general corporate purposes, including repurchases of our common stock. The $8.4 million discount and $2.0 million issuance costs associated with the 2007 Senior Notes are being amortized to interest expense over the terms of those notes. At our option, we may redeem the 2007 Senior Notes at any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest up to the redemption date. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount of the 2007 Senior Notes to be redeemed, or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, we will be required to make an offer to purchase the 2007 Senior Notes at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase, upon certain events as defined by the terms of the 2007 Senior Notes. In April 2003, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.92% in the aggregate amount of $34.4 million, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due in April 2010. In November 2002, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.88% in the aggregate amount of $25.8 million, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due in November 2009. In July 27 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) 2001, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued 1.187% promissory notes in the aggregate amount of $25.8 million, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due in July 2008. In October 2000, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued 2.070% promissory notes in the aggregate amount of $30.1 million, through a private placement. Interest is payable annually and principal is due in October 2007 and will be refinanced. As of September 2, 2007, the 1.187% and the 2.070% promissory notes are reported in the current portion of long term debt on our consolidated balance sheets. In August 1997, we completed the sale of $900.0 million principal amount at maturity Zero Coupon Notes due in August 2017. The Zero Coupon Notes were priced with a yield to maturity of 3.5%, resulting in gross proceeds to us of $449.6 million. The current Notes outstanding are convertible into a maximum of 1.5 million shares of Costco Common Stock shares at an initial conversion price of $22.71. Holders of the Zero Coupon Notes may require us to purchase the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of purchase) in August 2012. We may redeem, at our option, the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of redemption) any time in or after August 2002. As of September 2, 2007, $832.4 million in principal amount of the Zero Coupon Notes had been converted by note holders to shares of Costco Common Stock, of which $61.2 million and $286.5 million in principal were converted in fiscal 2007 and 2006, respectively, or $42.3 million and $188.9 million in fiscal 2007 and 2006, respectively, after factoring in the related debt discount. Derivatives We have limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and use them only to manage well defined interest rate and foreign exchange risks. Forward foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on inventory purchases and typically have very short terms. These forward contracts do not qualify for derivative hedge accounting. The aggregate notional amount, which approximates the fair value of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, was $75.0 million and $63.5 million, respectively. The mark to market adjustment related to these contracts was $0.9 million and $1.1 million at September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, respectively. The majority of the forward foreign exchange contracts were entered into by our wholly owned United Kingdom subsidiary, primarily to hedge U.S. dollar merchandise inventory purchases. Effective March 25, 2002, we entered into fixed to floating interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk associated with our 2002 Senior Notes, which matured and were retired in March 2007. The swaps were designated and qualified as fair value hedges of the debt. As the terms of the swaps matched those of the underlying hedged debt, changes in the fair value of the swaps were offset by corresponding changes in the carrying amount of the hedged debt and resulted in no net earnings impact. At September 3, 2006, the aggregate value of the swaps was $1 million and was recorded in deferred income taxes and other current assets in our consolidated balance sheets. In March 2007, upon maturity of the debt and expiration of the swap agreements, the aggregate fair value of the swaps was zero. We are exposed to market risk for changes in utility commodity pricing, which we partially mitigate through the use of firm price contracts with counterparties for approximately 23% of our locations in the U.S. and Canada. The effects of these arrangements are not significant for any period presented. 28 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements With the exception of our operating leases, we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition or consolidated financial statements. Stock Repurchase Programs In January and July of 2006, our Board of Directors approved an additional $1.00 billion and $2.00 billion of stock repurchases, respectively, which expire in 2009, bringing total authorizations by our Board of Directors since inception of the program in fiscal 2001 to $4.50 billion. Subsequent to the end of fiscal 2007, our Board of Directors approved an additional $300.0 million of stock repurchases, which expires in 2010. During fiscal 2007, we repurchased 36.4 million shares at an average price of $54.39 totaling approximately $1.98 billion. During fiscal 2006, we repurchased 28.4 million shares of common stock, at an average price of $51.44, totaling approximately $1.46 billion. The remaining amount available to be purchased under our approved plan was approximately $646.4 million at September 2, 2007. Purchases are made from time to time as conditions warrant in the open market or in block purchases, or pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5 1. Repurchased shares are retired. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments. We continue to review our accounting policies and evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, merchandise inventory valuation, impairment of long lived assets, warehouse closing costs, insurance/self insurance liabilities and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. Revenue Recognition We generally recognize sales, net of estimated returns, at the time the member takes possession of merchandise or receives services. When we collect payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services, the amount received is generally recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed. We provide for estimated sales returns based on historical merchandise returns levels. In connection with changes to our consumer electronics returns policy in the spring of 2007, we examined operational data regarding member return patterns that had not been previously analyzed. The data indicated a longer timeframe over which returns are received than previously used to estimate the sales return reserve. Accordingly, as previously disclosed, during fiscal 2007 we increased the reserve balance and recorded an adjustment to sales of $452.6 million and a pretax charge to income of $94.3 million for the related gross margin and disposition costs. We evaluate the criteria of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal Versus Net as an Agent, in determining whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, when we are the primary obligor, subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, influence product or service specifications, or have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded on a gross basis. If we are not the 29 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) primary obligor and do not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above, we record the net amounts as commissions earned, which is reflected in net sales. Membership fee revenue represents annual membership fees paid by substantially all of our members. We account for membership fee revenue on a deferred basis, whereby membership fee revenue is recognized ratably over one year. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, we performed a detailed analysis of the timing of recognition of membership fees based on each members specific renewal date as this methodology represented an improvement over our historical method, which was based on the period in which the fee was collected. This review resulted in a $56.2 million reduction to membership fee revenue and corresponding increase to deferred membership fees on our consolidated balance sheet. This adjustment includes both a change in method of applying an accounting principle to a preferable method and a correction for cumulative timing errors. Our Executive members qualify for a 2% reward (which can be redeemed only at Costco warehouses), up to a maximum of $500 per year, on all qualified purchases made at Costco. We account for this 2% reward as a reduction in sales, with the related liability being classified within other current liabilities. The sales reduction and corresponding liability are computed after giving effect to the estimated impact of non redemptions based on historical data. Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, as determined primarily by the retail method of accounting, and are stated using the last in, first out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail method of accounting and are stated using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. We believe the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. We record an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the expected annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at fiscal year end. At both September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006 merchandise inventories valued at LIFO approximated FIFO after considering the lower of cost or market principle. We provide for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts as a percentage of net sales. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect results of the actual physical inventory count, which generally occur in the second and fourth fiscal quarters of the fiscal year. Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as we progress toward earning those rebates, provided they are probable and reasonably estimable. Other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of agreement, or other systematic and rational approaches. Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Warehouse Closing costs We periodically evaluate our long lived assets for indicators of impairment, such as a decision to relocate or close a warehouse location. Our judgments are based on existing market and operational conditions. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring a downward adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value. We provide estimates for warehouse closing costs for both leased and owned locations to be closed or relocated. A considerable amount of judgment is involved in determining any impairment or our net 30 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) liability, particularly related to the estimated sales price of owned locations and the potential sublease income at leased locations. These estimates are based on real estate conditions in the markets and our experience in those markets. We make assumptions about the average period of time it would take to sublease the location and the amount of potential sublease income for each leased location. We reassess our liability each quarter and adjust our liability accordingly when our estimates change. Insurance/Self Insurance Liabilities We use a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance pool, to provide for potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property damage, director and officers liability, vehicle liability and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience and evaluations of outside experts, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Income Taxes The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Significant judgment is required in assessing, among other things, the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items. We establish reserves when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable, we determine that certain positions may be successfully challenged. When facts and circumstances change, we adjust these reserves through our provision for income taxes. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48), which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006 and we will adopt these new requirements as of the beginning of fiscal 2008. The estimated cumulative impact of adopting FIN 48 in fiscal 2008 is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157), which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements required under other accounting pronouncements, but does not change existing guidance as to whether or not an instrument is carried at fair value. SFAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. We must adopt these new requirements no later than our first quarter of fiscal 2009. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, Including an Amendment to FASB No. 115 (SFAS 159). Under SFAS 159, entities may elect to measure specified financial instruments and warranty and insurance contracts at fair value 31 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) on a contract by contract basis, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings each reporting period. The election, called the fair value option, will enable entities to achieve an offset accounting effect for changes in fair value of certain related assets and liabilities without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions. SFAS 159 is effective as of the beginning of a companys first fiscal year that begins after November 15, 2007. We must adopt these new requirements no later than our first quarter of fiscal 2009. We are in the process of evaluating the impact that adoption of SFAS 157 and SFAS 159 will have on our future consolidated financial statements. Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to financial market risk resulting from changes in interest and foreign currency rates. We do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions, nor hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. The nature and amount of our long and short term debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As of September 2, 2007, our fixed rate long term debt included $67.6 million principal amount at maturity of 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes carried at $47.8 million, $900.0 million of 5.3% Senior Notes carried at $897.8 million, $1.10 billion of 5.5% Senior Notes carried at $1.09 billion and additional notes and capital lease obligations totaling $127.9 million. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt. We hold interest bearing instruments that are classified as cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. Our investment policy is to manage our cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances to preserve principal and liquidity, while seeking to enhance the return on our investment portfolio through the investment of available funds. We diversify our investment portfolio by investing in multiple types of investment grade securities through a combination of internal and third party investment management. Short term investments generally have a maturity of three months to five years from the purchase date. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. As the majority of these instruments are of a short term nature, if interest rates were to increase or decrease, there is no material risk of a material valuation adjustment related to these instruments. For those instruments that are classified as available for sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in interest rates are reflected within stockholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss. Based on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances at September 2, 2007, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $15.2 million (pre tax) to interest income on an annual basis. Most transactions of our foreign subsidiaries are conducted in local currencies, limiting our exposure to changes in currency rates. We periodically enter into short term forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates on inventory purchases. The notional value of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at September 2, 2007 was $75.0 million. 32 Table of Contents 
 
Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) 2006 vs. 2005 Net income for fiscal 2006 increased 3.8%, to $1.10 billion or $2.30 per diluted share, from $1.06 billion or $2.18 per diluted share, during fiscal 2005. During fiscal 2006, we repurchased 28.4 million shares of common stock, favorably impacting earnings per diluted share by approximately $0.02. The fiscal 2005 results included several non recurring items that in the aggregate positively impacted reported earnings for all of fiscal 2005 by approximately $0.14 per share: a $54.2 million (approximately $0.11 per diluted share) income tax benefit resulting primarily from the settlement of a transfer pricing dispute between the United States and Canada; a cumulative pre tax, non cash charge to preopening expenses of $16.0 million (approximately $0.02 per diluted share) related to a correction to our method of accounting for ground leases; and a net tax benefit with respect to excess foreign tax credits on unremitted foreign earnings recorded in the fourth quarter of $20.6 million (approximately $0.04 per diluted share). Exclusive of these items, fiscal 2005 earnings were $2.04 per diluted share. Fiscal 2006s earnings per diluted share represents an increase of 13% over that figure. Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table itemizes our most liquid assets (dollars in thousands): September 2,2007 September 3,2006 Cash and cash equivalents $ 2,779,733 $ 1,510,939 Short term investments 575,787 1,322,181 Total $ 3,355,520 $ 2,833,120 Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from warehouse operations and our existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances, which were $3.36 billion and $2.83 billion at September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, respectively. Of these balances, approximately $655.2 million and $593.6 million at September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, respectively, represented debit and credit card receivables, primarily related to weekend sales immediately prior to the year end close. The increase in our most liquid assets of $522.4 million to $3.36 billion at September 2, 2007 was due primarily to the issuance of the 2007 Senior Notes and the cash provided by our operating activities, offset by expenditures for the repurchase of our common stock and the acquisition of property and equipment related to warehouse expansion. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $2.08 billion in fiscal 2007 compared to $1.83 billion in fiscal 2006, an increase of $245.2 million. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in cash flow due to a decrease in our investment in net merchandise inventories (merchandise inventory less accounts payable) of $378.8 million, offset by a decrease in cash flow from operating assets and liabilities of $130.4 million. Net cash used in investing activities totaled $655.3 million in fiscal 2007 compared to $1.16 billion in fiscal 2006, respectively, a decrease of approximately $502.2 million. The decrease in cash used in investing activities relates primarily to an increase of $169.2 million in additions to property and equipment related to warehouse expansion and remodel projects, offset by an increase in cash provided by the net reductions in short term investments of $663.8 million. Net cash used in financing activities totaled $164.6 million in fiscal 2007 compared to $1.23 billion in fiscal 2006. The $1.1 billion decrease in net cash used in financing activities was primarily due to the issuance of the 2007 Senior Notes in February 2007, which provided approximately $1.99 billion in 24 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) proceeds. This was partially offset by the repurchase of common stock in fiscal 2007, which used $1.98 billion of cash, compared to $1.44 billion in fiscal 2006, an increase of approximately $534.8 million and the repayment of long term debt of $307.9 million related primarily to the 2002 Senior Notes retired in March 2007. Dividends In April 2007, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash dividend from $0.13 to $0.145 per share or $0.58 on an annualized basis. Our quarterly cash dividends paid in fiscal 2007 totaled $0.55 per share. In fiscal 2006, we paid quarterly cash dividends totaling $0.49 per share. Contractual Obligations Our commitments at fiscal year end to make future payments under contractual obligations were as follows, as of September 2, 2007 (amounts in thousands): Payments Due by Fiscal Year 2008 2009 to2010 2011 to2012 2013 andthereafter Total Contractual obligations Purchase obligations (merchandise)(1) $ 3,626,627 $ 1,357 $ $ $ 3,627,984 Long term debt(2) 173,160 277,652 1,116,400 1,470,117 3,037,329 Operating leases(3) 137,225 242,461 209,723 1,305,035 1,894,444 Purchase obligations (equipment, services and other)(4) 350,108 40,517 1,089 391,714 Construction Commitments 329,941 329,941 Capital lease obligations and other(2) 3,990 1,937 686 5,193 11,806 Other(5) 2,168 3,936 2,546 4,928 13,578 Total $ 4,623,219 $ 567,860 $ 1,330,444 $ 2,785,273 $ 9,306,796 (1) Includes open merchandise purchase orders. (2) Amounts include contractual interest payments. (3) Operating lease obligations exclude amounts commonly referred to as common area maintenance, taxes and insurance and have been reduced by $149,407 to reflect sub lease income. (4) The amounts exclude certain services negotiated at the individual warehouse or regional level that are not significant and generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty. (5) Consists of asset retirement and deferred compensation obligations. Expansion Plans Our primary requirement for capital is the domestic and international financing of land, building and equipment costs for new and remodeled warehouses, plus the costs of initial warehouse operations and working capital requirements. While there can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized and plans are subject to change upon further review, it is managements current intention to spend approximately $1.6 billion to 25 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) $1.8 billion during fiscal 2008 for real estate, construction, remodeling and equipment for warehouse clubs and related operations. These expenditures are expected to be financed with a combination of cash provided from operations and the use of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. Plans for the United States and Canada during fiscal 2008 are to open approximately 38 to 42 new warehouses, inclusive of 8 to 10 relocations to larger and better located facilities. We expect to continue our review of expansion plans in our international operations, including the United Kingdom and Asia, along with other international markets. Additional Equity Investments in Subsidiaries and Joint Ventures In each of fiscal years 2006 and 2005, we contributed an additional $15 million to our investment in Costco Mexico (a 50% owned joint venture), which did not impact our percentage ownership of this entity, as our joint venture partner contributed a like amount. There were no such contributions in 2007. Bank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs (all amounts stated in U.S. dollars) A wholly owned Canadian subsidiary has a $189.8 million commercial paper program ($180.9 million at September 3, 2006) supported by a $113.9 million bank credit facility that expires in March 2008 ($54.2 million at September 3, 2006) with a Canadian bank, which we guarantee. At September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, no amounts were outstanding under the Canadian commercial paper program or the bank credit facility. Applicable interest rates on the credit facility at September 2, 2007, and September 3, 2006 were 5.00% and 4.65%, respectively. At September 2, 2007, standby letters of credit totaling $24.1 million issued under the bank credit facility left $89.8 million available for commercial paper support. At September 3, 2006, standby letters of credit totaling $20.8 million issued under the bank credit facility left $33.4 million available for commercial paper support. Our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary has a short term $38.7 million bank line of credit ($12.8 million at September 3, 2006) that expires in February 2008. At September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, $10.3 million and $2.5 million, respectively, were borrowed under the line of credit, and $8.6 million and $4.3 million, respectively, were used to support standby letters of credit. Applicable interest rates on the credit facility at September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, were 1.09% and 0.94%, respectively. A second $30.1 million bank line of credit also expires in February 2008. At September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, $7.8 million and $0.9 million, respectively, were borrowed under the second facility. Applicable interest rates on the second credit facility at September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, were 1.10% and 0.95%, respectively. Our Korean subsidiary has a short term $12.8 million bank line of credit ($12.5 million at September 3, 2006) which expires in March 2008. At September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, no amounts were borrowed under the line of credit and $2.0 million in both years was used to support standby letters of credit. Applicable interest rates on the credit facility at September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006 were 6.09% and 5.48%, respectively. Our Taiwan subsidiary has a $6.1 million bank revolving credit facility ($5.2 million at September 3, 2006) and a $3.0 million bank overdraft facility, both expiring in January 2008. At September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, no amounts were borrowed under the credit facility and $1.2 million and $1.9 million, respectively, were used to support standby letters of credit. Applicable interest rates on the credit facility at September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, were 4.50% and 4.00%, respectively. A second $15.2 million bank revolving credit facility is in place, which expires in July 2008. At September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, no amounts were borrowed under the second credit facility 26 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) and $4.2 million and $2.0 million, respectively, were used to support standby letters of credit. Applicable interest rates on the credit facility at September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, were 4.44% and 4.00%, respectively. A third $9.1 million bank revolving credit facility is in place, which expires in March 2008. At September 2, 2007 no amounts were borrowed under the third credit facility and no amounts were used to support standby letters of credit. The applicable interest rate on the credit facility at September 2, 2007 was 4.57%. Our wholly owned United Kingdom subsidiary has a $80.6 million bank revolving credit facility ($113.9 million at September 3, 2006) expiring in February 2010, a $70.5 million bank overdraft facility ($66.5 million at September 3, 2006), renewable on a yearly basis in May 2008, and a $40.3 million uncommitted money market line entered into in February 2007 and renewable on a yearly basis beginning in May 2008. At September 2, 2007, $20.1 million was outstanding under the revolving credit facility with an applicable interest rate of 6.23%, $15.6 million was outstanding under the uncommitted line with an applicable interest rate of 6.47% and no amounts were outstanding under the bank overdraft facility with an applicable interest rate of 6.75%. At September 3, 2006, $38.0 million was outstanding under the revolving credit facility, with an applicable interest rate of 5.32%, and no amounts were outstanding under the bank overdraft facility. Letters of Credit We have letter of credit facilities (for commercial and standby letters of credit) totaling $475.0 million. The outstanding commitments under these facilities at September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006 totaled $119.1 million and $84.9 million, respectively, including $71.7 million and $54.9 million, respectively, in standby letters of credit. Financing Activities On February 20, 2007, we issued $900 million of 5.3% Senior Notes due March 15, 2012 at a discount of $2.5 million and $1.1 billion of 5.5% Senior Notes due March 15, 2017 at a discount of $5.9 million (together, the 2007 Senior Notes). Interest on the 2007 Senior Notes is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year, with the first payment due on September 15, 2007. The net proceeds were used, in part, to repay the 2002 Senior Notes in March 2007, and the balance has been and will be used for general corporate purposes, including repurchases of our common stock. The $8.4 million discount and $2.0 million issuance costs associated with the 2007 Senior Notes are being amortized to interest expense over the terms of those notes. At our option, we may redeem the 2007 Senior Notes at any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest up to the redemption date. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount of the 2007 Senior Notes to be redeemed, or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, we will be required to make an offer to purchase the 2007 Senior Notes at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase, upon certain events as defined by the terms of the 2007 Senior Notes. In April 2003, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.92% in the aggregate amount of $34.4 million, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due in April 2010. In November 2002, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.88% in the aggregate amount of $25.8 million, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due in November 2009. In July 27 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) 2001, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued 1.187% promissory notes in the aggregate amount of $25.8 million, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due in July 2008. In October 2000, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued 2.070% promissory notes in the aggregate amount of $30.1 million, through a private placement. Interest is payable annually and principal is due in October 2007 and will be refinanced. As of September 2, 2007, the 1.187% and the 2.070% promissory notes are reported in the current portion of long term debt on our consolidated balance sheets. In August 1997, we completed the sale of $900.0 million principal amount at maturity Zero Coupon Notes due in August 2017. The Zero Coupon Notes were priced with a yield to maturity of 3.5%, resulting in gross proceeds to us of $449.6 million. The current Notes outstanding are convertible into a maximum of 1.5 million shares of Costco Common Stock shares at an initial conversion price of $22.71. Holders of the Zero Coupon Notes may require us to purchase the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of purchase) in August 2012. We may redeem, at our option, the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of redemption) any time in or after August 2002. As of September 2, 2007, $832.4 million in principal amount of the Zero Coupon Notes had been converted by note holders to shares of Costco Common Stock, of which $61.2 million and $286.5 million in principal were converted in fiscal 2007 and 2006, respectively, or $42.3 million and $188.9 million in fiscal 2007 and 2006, respectively, after factoring in the related debt discount. Derivatives We have limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and use them only to manage well defined interest rate and foreign exchange risks. Forward foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on inventory purchases and typically have very short terms. These forward contracts do not qualify for derivative hedge accounting. The aggregate notional amount, which approximates the fair value of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, was $75.0 million and $63.5 million, respectively. The mark to market adjustment related to these contracts was $0.9 million and $1.1 million at September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, respectively. The majority of the forward foreign exchange contracts were entered into by our wholly owned United Kingdom subsidiary, primarily to hedge U.S. dollar merchandise inventory purchases. Effective March 25, 2002, we entered into fixed to floating interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk associated with our 2002 Senior Notes, which matured and were retired in March 2007. The swaps were designated and qualified as fair value hedges of the debt. As the terms of the swaps matched those of the underlying hedged debt, changes in the fair value of the swaps were offset by corresponding changes in the carrying amount of the hedged debt and resulted in no net earnings impact. At September 3, 2006, the aggregate value of the swaps was $1 million and was recorded in deferred income taxes and other current assets in our consolidated balance sheets. In March 2007, upon maturity of the debt and expiration of the swap agreements, the aggregate fair value of the swaps was zero. We are exposed to market risk for changes in utility commodity pricing, which we partially mitigate through the use of firm price contracts with counterparties for approximately 23% of our locations in the U.S. and Canada. The effects of these arrangements are not significant for any period presented. 28 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements With the exception of our operating leases, we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition or consolidated financial statements. Stock Repurchase Programs In January and July of 2006, our Board of Directors approved an additional $1.00 billion and $2.00 billion of stock repurchases, respectively, which expire in 2009, bringing total authorizations by our Board of Directors since inception of the program in fiscal 2001 to $4.50 billion. Subsequent to the end of fiscal 2007, our Board of Directors approved an additional $300.0 million of stock repurchases, which expires in 2010. During fiscal 2007, we repurchased 36.4 million shares at an average price of $54.39 totaling approximately $1.98 billion. During fiscal 2006, we repurchased 28.4 million shares of common stock, at an average price of $51.44, totaling approximately $1.46 billion. The remaining amount available to be purchased under our approved plan was approximately $646.4 million at September 2, 2007. Purchases are made from time to time as conditions warrant in the open market or in block purchases, or pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5 1. Repurchased shares are retired. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments. We continue to review our accounting policies and evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, merchandise inventory valuation, impairment of long lived assets, warehouse closing costs, insurance/self insurance liabilities and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. Revenue Recognition We generally recognize sales, net of estimated returns, at the time the member takes possession of merchandise or receives services. When we collect payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services, the amount received is generally recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed. We provide for estimated sales returns based on historical merchandise returns levels. In connection with changes to our consumer electronics returns policy in the spring of 2007, we examined operational data regarding member return patterns that had not been previously analyzed. The data indicated a longer timeframe over which returns are received than previously used to estimate the sales return reserve. Accordingly, as previously disclosed, during fiscal 2007 we increased the reserve balance and recorded an adjustment to sales of $452.6 million and a pretax charge to income of $94.3 million for the related gross margin and disposition costs. We evaluate the criteria of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal Versus Net as an Agent, in determining whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, when we are the primary obligor, subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, influence product or service specifications, or have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded on a gross basis. If we are not the 29 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) primary obligor and do not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above, we record the net amounts as commissions earned, which is reflected in net sales. Membership fee revenue represents annual membership fees paid by substantially all of our members. We account for membership fee revenue on a deferred basis, whereby membership fee revenue is recognized ratably over one year. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, we performed a detailed analysis of the timing of recognition of membership fees based on each members specific renewal date as this methodology represented an improvement over our historical method, which was based on the period in which the fee was collected. This review resulted in a $56.2 million reduction to membership fee revenue and corresponding increase to deferred membership fees on our consolidated balance sheet. This adjustment includes both a change in method of applying an accounting principle to a preferable method and a correction for cumulative timing errors. Our Executive members qualify for a 2% reward (which can be redeemed only at Costco warehouses), up to a maximum of $500 per year, on all qualified purchases made at Costco. We account for this 2% reward as a reduction in sales, with the related liability being classified within other current liabilities. The sales reduction and corresponding liability are computed after giving effect to the estimated impact of non redemptions based on historical data. Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, as determined primarily by the retail method of accounting, and are stated using the last in, first out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail method of accounting and are stated using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. We believe the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. We record an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the expected annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at fiscal year end. At both September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006 merchandise inventories valued at LIFO approximated FIFO after considering the lower of cost or market principle. We provide for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts as a percentage of net sales. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect results of the actual physical inventory count, which generally occur in the second and fourth fiscal quarters of the fiscal year. Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as we progress toward earning those rebates, provided they are probable and reasonably estimable. Other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of agreement, or other systematic and rational approaches. Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Warehouse Closing costs We periodically evaluate our long lived assets for indicators of impairment, such as a decision to relocate or close a warehouse location. Our judgments are based on existing market and operational conditions. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring a downward adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value. We provide estimates for warehouse closing costs for both leased and owned locations to be closed or relocated. A considerable amount of judgment is involved in determining any impairment or our net 30 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) liability, particularly related to the estimated sales price of owned locations and the potential sublease income at leased locations. These estimates are based on real estate conditions in the markets and our experience in those markets. We make assumptions about the average period of time it would take to sublease the location and the amount of potential sublease income for each leased location. We reassess our liability each quarter and adjust our liability accordingly when our estimates change. Insurance/Self Insurance Liabilities We use a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance pool, to provide for potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property damage, director and officers liability, vehicle liability and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience and evaluations of outside experts, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Income Taxes The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Significant judgment is required in assessing, among other things, the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items. We establish reserves when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable, we determine that certain positions may be successfully challenged. When facts and circumstances change, we adjust these reserves through our provision for income taxes. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48), which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006 and we will adopt these new requirements as of the beginning of fiscal 2008. The estimated cumulative impact of adopting FIN 48 in fiscal 2008 is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157), which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements required under other accounting pronouncements, but does not change existing guidance as to whether or not an instrument is carried at fair value. SFAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. We must adopt these new requirements no later than our first quarter of fiscal 2009. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, Including an Amendment to FASB No. 115 (SFAS 159). Under SFAS 159, entities may elect to measure specified financial instruments and warranty and insurance contracts at fair value 31 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) on a contract by contract basis, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings each reporting period. The election, called the fair value option, will enable entities to achieve an offset accounting effect for changes in fair value of certain related assets and liabilities without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions. SFAS 159 is effective as of the beginning of a companys first fiscal year that begins after November 15, 2007. We must adopt these new requirements no later than our first quarter of fiscal 2009. We are in the process of evaluating the impact that adoption of SFAS 157 and SFAS 159 will have on our future consolidated financial statements. Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to financial market risk resulting from changes in interest and foreign currency rates. We do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions, nor hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. The nature and amount of our long and short term debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As of September 2, 2007, our fixed rate long term debt included $67.6 million principal amount at maturity of 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes carried at $47.8 million, $900.0 million of 5.3% Senior Notes carried at $897.8 million, $1.10 billion of 5.5% Senior Notes carried at $1.09 billion and additional notes and capital lease obligations totaling $127.9 million. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt. We hold interest bearing instruments that are classified as cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. Our investment policy is to manage our cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances to preserve principal and liquidity, while seeking to enhance the return on our investment portfolio through the investment of available funds. We diversify our investment portfolio by investing in multiple types of investment grade securities through a combination of internal and third party investment management. Short term investments generally have a maturity of three months to five years from the purchase date. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. As the majority of these instruments are of a short term nature, if interest rates were to increase or decrease, there is no material risk of a material valuation adjustment related to these instruments. For those instruments that are classified as available for sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in interest rates are reflected within stockholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss. Based on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances at September 2, 2007, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $15.2 million (pre tax) to interest income on an annual basis. Most transactions of our foreign subsidiaries are conducted in local currencies, limiting our exposure to changes in currency rates. We periodically enter into short term forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates on inventory purchases. The notional value of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at September 2, 2007 was $75.0 million. 32 Table of Contents 
 
Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) proceeds. This was partially offset by the repurchase of common stock in fiscal 2007, which used $1.98 billion of cash, compared to $1.44 billion in fiscal 2006, an increase of approximately $534.8 million and the repayment of long term debt of $307.9 million related primarily to the 2002 Senior Notes retired in March 2007. Dividends In April 2007, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash dividend from $0.13 to $0.145 per share or $0.58 on an annualized basis. Our quarterly cash dividends paid in fiscal 2007 totaled $0.55 per share. In fiscal 2006, we paid quarterly cash dividends totaling $0.49 per share. Contractual Obligations Our commitments at fiscal year end to make future payments under contractual obligations were as follows, as of September 2, 2007 (amounts in thousands): Payments Due by Fiscal Year 2008 2009 to2010 2011 to2012 2013 andthereafter Total Contractual obligations Purchase obligations (merchandise)(1) $ 3,626,627 $ 1,357 $ $ $ 3,627,984 Long term debt(2) 173,160 277,652 1,116,400 1,470,117 3,037,329 Operating leases(3) 137,225 242,461 209,723 1,305,035 1,894,444 Purchase obligations (equipment, services and other)(4) 350,108 40,517 1,089 391,714 Construction Commitments 329,941 329,941 Capital lease obligations and other(2) 3,990 1,937 686 5,193 11,806 Other(5) 2,168 3,936 2,546 4,928 13,578 Total $ 4,623,219 $ 567,860 $ 1,330,444 $ 2,785,273 $ 9,306,796 (1) Includes open merchandise purchase orders.

(3) Operating lease obligations exclude amounts commonly referred to as common area maintenance, taxes and insurance and have been reduced by $149,407 to reflect sub lease income. (4) The amounts exclude certain services negotiated at the individual warehouse or regional level that are not significant and generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty. (5) Consists of asset retirement and deferred compensation obligations. Expansion Plans Our primary requirement for capital is the domestic and international financing of land, building and equipment costs for new and remodeled warehouses, plus the costs of initial warehouse operations and working capital requirements. While there can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized and plans are subject to change upon further review, it is managements current intention to spend approximately $1.6 billion to 25 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) $1.8 billion during fiscal 2008 for real estate, construction, remodeling and equipment for warehouse clubs and related operations. These expenditures are expected to be financed with a combination of cash provided from operations and the use of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. Plans for the United States and Canada during fiscal 2008 are to open approximately 38 to 42 new warehouses, inclusive of 8 to 10 relocations to larger and better located facilities. We expect to continue our review of expansion plans in our international operations, including the United Kingdom and Asia, along with other international markets. Additional Equity Investments in Subsidiaries and Joint Ventures In each of fiscal years 2006 and 2005, we contributed an additional $15 million to our investment in Costco Mexico (a 50% owned joint venture), which did not impact our percentage ownership of this entity, as our joint venture partner contributed a like amount. There were no such contributions in 2007. Bank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs (all amounts stated in U.S. dollars) A wholly owned Canadian subsidiary has a $189.8 million commercial paper program ($180.9 million at September 3, 2006) supported by a $113.9 million bank credit facility that expires in March 2008 ($54.2 million at September 3, 2006) with a Canadian bank, which we guarantee.

The net proceeds were used, in part, to repay the 2002 Senior Notes in March 2007, and the balance has been and will be used for general corporate purposes, including repurchases of our common stock. The $8.4 million discount and $2.0 million issuance costs associated with the 2007 Senior Notes are being amortized to interest expense over the terms of those notes. At our option, we may redeem the 2007 Senior Notes at any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest up to the redemption date. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount of the 2007 Senior Notes to be redeemed, or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, we will be required to make an offer to purchase the 2007 Senior Notes at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase, upon certain events as defined by the terms of the 2007 Senior Notes. In April 2003, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.92% in the aggregate amount of $34.4 million, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due in April 2010. In November 2002, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.88% in the aggregate amount of $25.8 million, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due in November 2009. In July 27 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) 2001, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued 1.187% promissory notes in the aggregate amount of $25.8 million, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due in July 2008. In October 2000, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued 2.070% promissory notes in the aggregate amount of $30.1 million, through a private placement. Interest is payable annually and principal is due in October 2007 and will be refinanced. As of September 2, 2007, the 1.187% and the 2.070% promissory notes are reported in the current portion of long term debt on our consolidated balance sheets. In August 1997, we completed the sale of $900.0 million principal amount at maturity Zero Coupon Notes due in August 2017. The Zero Coupon Notes were priced with a yield to maturity of 3.5%, resulting in gross proceeds to us of $449.6 million. The current Notes outstanding are convertible into a maximum of 1.5 million shares of Costco Common Stock shares at an initial conversion price of $22.71. Holders of the Zero Coupon Notes may require us to purchase the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of purchase) in August 2012. We may redeem, at our option, the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of redemption) any time in or after August 2002. As of September 2, 2007, $832.4 million in principal amount of the Zero Coupon Notes had been converted by note holders to shares of Costco Common Stock, of which $61.2 million and $286.5 million in principal were converted in fiscal 2007 and 2006, respectively, or $42.3 million and $188.9 million in fiscal 2007 and 2006, respectively, after factoring in the related debt discount. Derivatives We have limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and use them only to manage well defined interest rate and foreign exchange risks. Forward foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on inventory purchases and typically have very short terms. These forward contracts do not qualify for derivative hedge accounting. The aggregate notional amount, which approximates the fair value of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, was $75.0 million and $63.5 million, respectively. The mark to market adjustment related to these contracts was $0.9 million and $1.1 million at September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, respectively. The majority of the forward foreign exchange contracts were entered into by our wholly owned United Kingdom subsidiary, primarily to hedge U.S. dollar merchandise inventory purchases. Effective March 25, 2002, we entered into fixed to floating interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk associated with our 2002 Senior Notes, which matured and were retired in March 2007. The swaps were designated and qualified as fair value hedges of the debt. As the terms of the swaps matched those of the underlying hedged debt, changes in the fair value of the swaps were offset by corresponding changes in the carrying amount of the hedged debt and resulted in no net earnings impact. At September 3, 2006, the aggregate value of the swaps was $1 million and was recorded in deferred income taxes and other current assets in our consolidated balance sheets. In March 2007, upon maturity of the debt and expiration of the swap agreements, the aggregate fair value of the swaps was zero. We are exposed to market risk for changes in utility commodity pricing, which we partially mitigate through the use of firm price contracts with counterparties for approximately 23% of our locations in the U.S. and Canada. The effects of these arrangements are not significant for any period presented. 28 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements With the exception of our operating leases, we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition or consolidated financial statements. Stock Repurchase Programs In January and July of 2006, our Board of Directors approved an additional $1.00 billion and $2.00 billion of stock repurchases, respectively, which expire in 2009, bringing total authorizations by our Board of Directors since inception of the program in fiscal 2001 to $4.50 billion. Subsequent to the end of fiscal 2007, our Board of Directors approved an additional $300.0 million of stock repurchases, which expires in 2010. During fiscal 2007, we repurchased 36.4 million shares at an average price of $54.39 totaling approximately $1.98 billion. During fiscal 2006, we repurchased 28.4 million shares of common stock, at an average price of $51.44, totaling approximately $1.46 billion. The remaining amount available to be purchased under our approved plan was approximately $646.4 million at September 2, 2007. Purchases are made from time to time as conditions warrant in the open market or in block purchases, or pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5 1. Repurchased shares are retired. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments. We continue to review our accounting policies and evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, merchandise inventory valuation, impairment of long lived assets, warehouse closing costs, insurance/self insurance liabilities and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. Revenue Recognition We generally recognize sales, net of estimated returns, at the time the member takes possession of merchandise or receives services. When we collect payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services, the amount received is generally recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed. We provide for estimated sales returns based on historical merchandise returns levels. In connection with changes to our consumer electronics returns policy in the spring of 2007, we examined operational data regarding member return patterns that had not been previously analyzed. The data indicated a longer timeframe over which returns are received than previously used to estimate the sales return reserve. Accordingly, as previously disclosed, during fiscal 2007 we increased the reserve balance and recorded an adjustment to sales of $452.6 million and a pretax charge to income of $94.3 million for the related gross margin and disposition costs. We evaluate the criteria of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal Versus Net as an Agent, in determining whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, when we are the primary obligor, subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, influence product or service specifications, or have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded on a gross basis. If we are not the 29 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) primary obligor and do not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above, we record the net amounts as commissions earned, which is reflected in net sales. Membership fee revenue represents annual membership fees paid by substantially all of our members. We account for membership fee revenue on a deferred basis, whereby membership fee revenue is recognized ratably over one year. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, we performed a detailed analysis of the timing of recognition of membership fees based on each members specific renewal date as this methodology represented an improvement over our historical method, which was based on the period in which the fee was collected. This review resulted in a $56.2 million reduction to membership fee revenue and corresponding increase to deferred membership fees on our consolidated balance sheet. This adjustment includes both a change in method of applying an accounting principle to a preferable method and a correction for cumulative timing errors. Our Executive members qualify for a 2% reward (which can be redeemed only at Costco warehouses), up to a maximum of $500 per year, on all qualified purchases made at Costco. We account for this 2% reward as a reduction in sales, with the related liability being classified within other current liabilities. The sales reduction and corresponding liability are computed after giving effect to the estimated impact of non redemptions based on historical data. Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, as determined primarily by the retail method of accounting, and are stated using the last in, first out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail method of accounting and are stated using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. We believe the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. We record an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the expected annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at fiscal year end. At both September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006 merchandise inventories valued at LIFO approximated FIFO after considering the lower of cost or market principle. We provide for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts as a percentage of net sales. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect results of the actual physical inventory count, which generally occur in the second and fourth fiscal quarters of the fiscal year. Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as we progress toward earning those rebates, provided they are probable and reasonably estimable. Other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of agreement, or other systematic and rational approaches. Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Warehouse Closing costs We periodically evaluate our long lived assets for indicators of impairment, such as a decision to relocate or close a warehouse location. Our judgments are based on existing market and operational conditions. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring a downward adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value. We provide estimates for warehouse closing costs for both leased and owned locations to be closed or relocated. A considerable amount of judgment is involved in determining any impairment or our net 30 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) liability, particularly related to the estimated sales price of owned locations and the potential sublease income at leased locations. These estimates are based on real estate conditions in the markets and our experience in those markets. We make assumptions about the average period of time it would take to sublease the location and the amount of potential sublease income for each leased location. We reassess our liability each quarter and adjust our liability accordingly when our estimates change. Insurance/Self Insurance Liabilities We use a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance pool, to provide for potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property damage, director and officers liability, vehicle liability and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience and evaluations of outside experts, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Income Taxes The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Significant judgment is required in assessing, among other things, the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items. We establish reserves when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable, we determine that certain positions may be successfully challenged. When facts and circumstances change, we adjust these reserves through our provision for income taxes. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48), which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006 and we will adopt these new requirements as of the beginning of fiscal 2008. The estimated cumulative impact of adopting FIN 48 in fiscal 2008 is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157), which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements required under other accounting pronouncements, but does not change existing guidance as to whether or not an instrument is carried at fair value. SFAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. We must adopt these new requirements no later than our first quarter of fiscal 2009. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, Including an Amendment to FASB No. 115 (SFAS 159). Under SFAS 159, entities may elect to measure specified financial instruments and warranty and insurance contracts at fair value 31 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) on a contract by contract basis, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings each reporting period. The election, called the fair value option, will enable entities to achieve an offset accounting effect for changes in fair value of certain related assets and liabilities without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions. SFAS 159 is effective as of the beginning of a companys first fiscal year that begins after November 15, 2007. We must adopt these new requirements no later than our first quarter of fiscal 2009. We are in the process of evaluating the impact that adoption of SFAS 157 and SFAS 159 will have on our future consolidated financial statements. Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to financial market risk resulting from changes in interest and foreign currency rates. We do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions, nor hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. The nature and amount of our long and short term debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As of September 2, 2007, our fixed rate long term debt included $67.6 million principal amount at maturity of 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes carried at $47.8 million, $900.0 million of 5.3% Senior Notes carried at $897.8 million, $1.10 billion of 5.5% Senior Notes carried at $1.09 billion and additional notes and capital lease obligations totaling $127.9 million. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt. We hold interest bearing instruments that are classified as cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. Our investment policy is to manage our cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances to preserve principal and liquidity, while seeking to enhance the return on our investment portfolio through the investment of available funds. We diversify our investment portfolio by investing in multiple types of investment grade securities through a combination of internal and third party investment management. Short term investments generally have a maturity of three months to five years from the purchase date. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. As the majority of these instruments are of a short term nature, if interest rates were to increase or decrease, there is no material risk of a material valuation adjustment related to these instruments. For those instruments that are classified as available for sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in interest rates are reflected within stockholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss. Based on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances at September 2, 2007, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $15.2 million (pre tax) to interest income on an annual basis. Most transactions of our foreign subsidiaries are conducted in local currencies, limiting our exposure to changes in currency rates. We periodically enter into short term forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates on inventory purchases. The notional value of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at September 2, 2007 was $75.0 million. 32 Table of Contents 
 
Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) $1.8 billion during fiscal 2008 for real estate, construction, remodeling and equipment for warehouse clubs and related operations. These expenditures are expected to be financed with a combination of cash provided from operations and the use of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. Plans for the United States and Canada during fiscal 2008 are to open approximately 38 to 42 new warehouses, inclusive of 8 to 10 relocations to larger and better located facilities. We expect to continue our review of expansion plans in our international operations, including the United Kingdom and Asia, along with other international markets. Additional Equity Investments in Subsidiaries and Joint Ventures In each of fiscal years 2006 and 2005, we contributed an additional $15 million to our investment in Costco Mexico (a 50% owned joint venture), which did not impact our percentage ownership of this entity, as our joint venture partner contributed a like amount. There were no such contributions in 2007. Bank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs (all amounts stated in U.S. dollars) A wholly owned Canadian subsidiary has a $189.8 million commercial paper program ($180.9 million at September 3, 2006) supported by a $113.9 million bank credit facility that expires in March 2008 ($54.2 million at September 3, 2006) with a Canadian bank, which we guarantee.

The outstanding commitments under these facilities at September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006 totaled $119.1 million and $84.9 million, respectively, including $71.7 million and $54.9 million, respectively, in standby letters of credit. Financing Activities On February 20, 2007, we issued $900 million of 5.3% Senior Notes due March 15, 2012 at a discount of $2.5 million and $1.1 billion of 5.5% Senior Notes due March 15, 2017 at a discount of $5.9 million (together, the 2007 Senior Notes). Interest on the 2007 Senior Notes is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year, with the first payment due on September 15, 2007. The net proceeds were used, in part, to repay the 2002 Senior Notes in March 2007, and the balance has been and will be used for general corporate purposes, including repurchases of our common stock. The $8.4 million discount and $2.0 million issuance costs associated with the 2007 Senior Notes are being amortized to interest expense over the terms of those notes. At our option, we may redeem the 2007 Senior Notes at any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest up to the redemption date. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount of the 2007 Senior Notes to be redeemed, or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, we will be required to make an offer to purchase the 2007 Senior Notes at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase, upon certain events as defined by the terms of the 2007 Senior Notes. In April 2003, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.92% in the aggregate amount of $34.4 million, through a private placement.

In August 1997, we completed the sale of $900.0 million principal amount at maturity Zero Coupon Notes due in August 2017. The Zero Coupon Notes were priced with a yield to maturity of 3.5%, resulting in gross proceeds to us of $449.6 million. The current Notes outstanding are convertible into a maximum of 1.5 million shares of Costco Common Stock shares at an initial conversion price of $22.71.

When we collect payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services, the amount received is generally recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed. We provide for estimated sales returns based on historical merchandise returns levels. In connection with changes to our consumer electronics returns policy in the spring of 2007, we examined operational data regarding member return patterns that had not been previously analyzed. The data indicated a longer timeframe over which returns are received than previously used to estimate the sales return reserve. Accordingly, as previously disclosed, during fiscal 2007 we increased the reserve balance and recorded an adjustment to sales of $452.6 million and a pretax charge to income of $94.3 million for the related gross margin and disposition costs. We evaluate the criteria of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal Versus Net as an Agent, in determining whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, when we are the primary obligor, subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, influence product or service specifications, or have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded on a gross basis. If we are not the 29 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) primary obligor and do not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above, we record the net amounts as commissions earned, which is reflected in net sales. Membership fee revenue represents annual membership fees paid by substantially all of our members. We account for membership fee revenue on a deferred basis, whereby membership fee revenue is recognized ratably over one year. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, we performed a detailed analysis of the timing of recognition of membership fees based on each members specific renewal date as this methodology represented an improvement over our historical method, which was based on the period in which the fee was collected. This review resulted in a $56.2 million reduction to membership fee revenue and corresponding increase to deferred membership fees on our consolidated balance sheet. This adjustment includes both a change in method of applying an accounting principle to a preferable method and a correction for cumulative timing errors. Our Executive members qualify for a 2% reward (which can be redeemed only at Costco warehouses), up to a maximum of $500 per year, on all qualified purchases made at Costco. We account for this 2% reward as a reduction in sales, with the related liability being classified within other current liabilities. The sales reduction and corresponding liability are computed after giving effect to the estimated impact of non redemptions based on historical data. Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, as determined primarily by the retail method of accounting, and are stated using the last in, first out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail method of accounting and are stated using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. We believe the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. We record an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the expected annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at fiscal year end. At both September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006 merchandise inventories valued at LIFO approximated FIFO after considering the lower of cost or market principle. We provide for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts as a percentage of net sales. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect results of the actual physical inventory count, which generally occur in the second and fourth fiscal quarters of the fiscal year. Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as we progress toward earning those rebates, provided they are probable and reasonably estimable. Other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of agreement, or other systematic and rational approaches. Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Warehouse Closing costs We periodically evaluate our long lived assets for indicators of impairment, such as a decision to relocate or close a warehouse location. Our judgments are based on existing market and operational conditions. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring a downward adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value. We provide estimates for warehouse closing costs for both leased and owned locations to be closed or relocated. A considerable amount of judgment is involved in determining any impairment or our net 30 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) liability, particularly related to the estimated sales price of owned locations and the potential sublease income at leased locations. These estimates are based on real estate conditions in the markets and our experience in those markets. We make assumptions about the average period of time it would take to sublease the location and the amount of potential sublease income for each leased location. We reassess our liability each quarter and adjust our liability accordingly when our estimates change. Insurance/Self Insurance Liabilities We use a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance pool, to provide for potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property damage, director and officers liability, vehicle liability and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience and evaluations of outside experts, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Income Taxes The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Significant judgment is required in assessing, among other things, the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items. We establish reserves when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable, we determine that certain positions may be successfully challenged. When facts and circumstances change, we adjust these reserves through our provision for income taxes. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48), which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006 and we will adopt these new requirements as of the beginning of fiscal 2008. The estimated cumulative impact of adopting FIN 48 in fiscal 2008 is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157), which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements required under other accounting pronouncements, but does not change existing guidance as to whether or not an instrument is carried at fair value. SFAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. We must adopt these new requirements no later than our first quarter of fiscal 2009. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, Including an Amendment to FASB No. 115 (SFAS 159). Under SFAS 159, entities may elect to measure specified financial instruments and warranty and insurance contracts at fair value 31 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) on a contract by contract basis, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings each reporting period. The election, called the fair value option, will enable entities to achieve an offset accounting effect for changes in fair value of certain related assets and liabilities without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions. SFAS 159 is effective as of the beginning of a companys first fiscal year that begins after November 15, 2007. We must adopt these new requirements no later than our first quarter of fiscal 2009. We are in the process of evaluating the impact that adoption of SFAS 157 and SFAS 159 will have on our future consolidated financial statements. Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to financial market risk resulting from changes in interest and foreign currency rates. We do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions, nor hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. The nature and amount of our long and short term debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As of September 2, 2007, our fixed rate long term debt included $67.6 million principal amount at maturity of 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes carried at $47.8 million, $900.0 million of 5.3% Senior Notes carried at $897.8 million, $1.10 billion of 5.5% Senior Notes carried at $1.09 billion and additional notes and capital lease obligations totaling $127.9 million. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt. We hold interest bearing instruments that are classified as cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. Our investment policy is to manage our cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances to preserve principal and liquidity, while seeking to enhance the return on our investment portfolio through the investment of available funds. We diversify our investment portfolio by investing in multiple types of investment grade securities through a combination of internal and third party investment management. Short term investments generally have a maturity of three months to five years from the purchase date. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. As the majority of these instruments are of a short term nature, if interest rates were to increase or decrease, there is no material risk of a material valuation adjustment related to these instruments. For those instruments that are classified as available for sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in interest rates are reflected within stockholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss. Based on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances at September 2, 2007, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $15.2 million (pre tax) to interest income on an annual basis. Most transactions of our foreign subsidiaries are conducted in local currencies, limiting our exposure to changes in currency rates. We periodically enter into short term forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates on inventory purchases. The notional value of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at September 2, 2007 was $75.0 million. 32 Table of Contents 
 
Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) and $4.2 million and $2.0 million, respectively, were used to support standby letters of credit. Applicable interest rates on the credit facility at September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, were 4.44% and 4.00%, respectively. A third $9.1 million bank revolving credit facility is in place, which expires in March 2008. At September 2, 2007 no amounts were borrowed under the third credit facility and no amounts were used to support standby letters of credit. The applicable interest rate on the credit facility at September 2, 2007 was 4.57%. Our wholly owned United Kingdom subsidiary has a $80.6 million bank revolving credit facility ($113.9 million at September 3, 2006) expiring in February 2010, a $70.5 million bank overdraft facility ($66.5 million at September 3, 2006), renewable on a yearly basis in May 2008, and a $40.3 million uncommitted money market line entered into in February 2007 and renewable on a yearly basis beginning in May 2008. At September 2, 2007, $20.1 million was outstanding under the revolving credit facility with an applicable interest rate of 6.23%, $15.6 million was outstanding under the uncommitted line with an applicable interest rate of 6.47% and no amounts were outstanding under the bank overdraft facility with an applicable interest rate of 6.75%. At September 3, 2006, $38.0 million was outstanding under the revolving credit facility, with an applicable interest rate of 5.32%, and no amounts were outstanding under the bank overdraft facility. Letters of Credit We have letter of credit facilities (for commercial and standby letters of credit) totaling $475.0 million. The outstanding commitments under these facilities at September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006 totaled $119.1 million and $84.9 million, respectively, including $71.7 million and $54.9 million, respectively, in standby letters of credit. Financing Activities On February 20, 2007, we issued $900 million of 5.3% Senior Notes due March 15, 2012 at a discount of $2.5 million and $1.1 billion of 5.5% Senior Notes due March 15, 2017 at a discount of $5.9 million (together, the 2007 Senior Notes). Interest on the 2007 Senior Notes is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year, with the first payment due on September 15, 2007. The net proceeds were used, in part, to repay the 2002 Senior Notes in March 2007, and the balance has been and will be used for general corporate purposes, including repurchases of our common stock. The $8.4 million discount and $2.0 million issuance costs associated with the 2007 Senior Notes are being amortized to interest expense over the terms of those notes. At our option, we may redeem the 2007 Senior Notes at any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest up to the redemption date. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount of the 2007 Senior Notes to be redeemed, or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, we will be required to make an offer to purchase the 2007 Senior Notes at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase, upon certain events as defined by the terms of the 2007 Senior Notes. In April 2003, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.92% in the aggregate amount of $34.4 million, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due in April 2010. In November 2002, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.88% in the aggregate amount of $25.8 million, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due in November 2009. In July 27 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) 2001, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued 1.187% promissory notes in the aggregate amount of $25.8 million, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due in July 2008. In October 2000, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued 2.070% promissory notes in the aggregate amount of $30.1 million, through a private placement. Interest is payable annually and principal is due in October 2007 and will be refinanced. As of September 2, 2007, the 1.187% and the 2.070% promissory notes are reported in the current portion of long term debt on our consolidated balance sheets. In August 1997, we completed the sale of $900.0 million principal amount at maturity Zero Coupon Notes due in August 2017. The Zero Coupon Notes were priced with a yield to maturity of 3.5%, resulting in gross proceeds to us of $449.6 million. The current Notes outstanding are convertible into a maximum of 1.5 million shares of Costco Common Stock shares at an initial conversion price of $22.71. Holders of the Zero Coupon Notes may require us to purchase the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of purchase) in August 2012. We may redeem, at our option, the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of redemption) any time in or after August 2002. As of September 2, 2007, $832.4 million in principal amount of the Zero Coupon Notes had been converted by note holders to shares of Costco Common Stock, of which $61.2 million and $286.5 million in principal were converted in fiscal 2007 and 2006, respectively, or $42.3 million and $188.9 million in fiscal 2007 and 2006, respectively, after factoring in the related debt discount. Derivatives We have limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and use them only to manage well defined interest rate and foreign exchange risks. Forward foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on inventory purchases and typically have very short terms. These forward contracts do not qualify for derivative hedge accounting. The aggregate notional amount, which approximates the fair value of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, was $75.0 million and $63.5 million, respectively. The mark to market adjustment related to these contracts was $0.9 million and $1.1 million at September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, respectively. The majority of the forward foreign exchange contracts were entered into by our wholly owned United Kingdom subsidiary, primarily to hedge U.S. dollar merchandise inventory purchases. Effective March 25, 2002, we entered into fixed to floating interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk associated with our 2002 Senior Notes, which matured and were retired in March 2007. The swaps were designated and qualified as fair value hedges of the debt. As the terms of the swaps matched those of the underlying hedged debt, changes in the fair value of the swaps were offset by corresponding changes in the carrying amount of the hedged debt and resulted in no net earnings impact. At September 3, 2006, the aggregate value of the swaps was $1 million and was recorded in deferred income taxes and other current assets in our consolidated balance sheets. In March 2007, upon maturity of the debt and expiration of the swap agreements, the aggregate fair value of the swaps was zero. We are exposed to market risk for changes in utility commodity pricing, which we partially mitigate through the use of firm price contracts with counterparties for approximately 23% of our locations in the U.S. and Canada. The effects of these arrangements are not significant for any period presented. 28 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements With the exception of our operating leases, we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition or consolidated financial statements. Stock Repurchase Programs In January and July of 2006, our Board of Directors approved an additional $1.00 billion and $2.00 billion of stock repurchases, respectively, which expire in 2009, bringing total authorizations by our Board of Directors since inception of the program in fiscal 2001 to $4.50 billion. Subsequent to the end of fiscal 2007, our Board of Directors approved an additional $300.0 million of stock repurchases, which expires in 2010. During fiscal 2007, we repurchased 36.4 million shares at an average price of $54.39 totaling approximately $1.98 billion. During fiscal 2006, we repurchased 28.4 million shares of common stock, at an average price of $51.44, totaling approximately $1.46 billion. The remaining amount available to be purchased under our approved plan was approximately $646.4 million at September 2, 2007. Purchases are made from time to time as conditions warrant in the open market or in block purchases, or pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5 1. Repurchased shares are retired. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments. We continue to review our accounting policies and evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, merchandise inventory valuation, impairment of long lived assets, warehouse closing costs, insurance/self insurance liabilities and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. Revenue Recognition We generally recognize sales, net of estimated returns, at the time the member takes possession of merchandise or receives services. When we collect payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services, the amount received is generally recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed. We provide for estimated sales returns based on historical merchandise returns levels. In connection with changes to our consumer electronics returns policy in the spring of 2007, we examined operational data regarding member return patterns that had not been previously analyzed. The data indicated a longer timeframe over which returns are received than previously used to estimate the sales return reserve. Accordingly, as previously disclosed, during fiscal 2007 we increased the reserve balance and recorded an adjustment to sales of $452.6 million and a pretax charge to income of $94.3 million for the related gross margin and disposition costs. We evaluate the criteria of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal Versus Net as an Agent, in determining whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, when we are the primary obligor, subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, influence product or service specifications, or have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded on a gross basis. If we are not the 29 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) primary obligor and do not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above, we record the net amounts as commissions earned, which is reflected in net sales. Membership fee revenue represents annual membership fees paid by substantially all of our members. We account for membership fee revenue on a deferred basis, whereby membership fee revenue is recognized ratably over one year. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, we performed a detailed analysis of the timing of recognition of membership fees based on each members specific renewal date as this methodology represented an improvement over our historical method, which was based on the period in which the fee was collected. This review resulted in a $56.2 million reduction to membership fee revenue and corresponding increase to deferred membership fees on our consolidated balance sheet. This adjustment includes both a change in method of applying an accounting principle to a preferable method and a correction for cumulative timing errors. Our Executive members qualify for a 2% reward (which can be redeemed only at Costco warehouses), up to a maximum of $500 per year, on all qualified purchases made at Costco. We account for this 2% reward as a reduction in sales, with the related liability being classified within other current liabilities. The sales reduction and corresponding liability are computed after giving effect to the estimated impact of non redemptions based on historical data. Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, as determined primarily by the retail method of accounting, and are stated using the last in, first out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail method of accounting and are stated using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. We believe the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. We record an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the expected annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at fiscal year end. At both September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006 merchandise inventories valued at LIFO approximated FIFO after considering the lower of cost or market principle. We provide for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts as a percentage of net sales. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect results of the actual physical inventory count, which generally occur in the second and fourth fiscal quarters of the fiscal year. Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as we progress toward earning those rebates, provided they are probable and reasonably estimable. Other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of agreement, or other systematic and rational approaches. Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Warehouse Closing costs We periodically evaluate our long lived assets for indicators of impairment, such as a decision to relocate or close a warehouse location. Our judgments are based on existing market and operational conditions. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring a downward adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value. We provide estimates for warehouse closing costs for both leased and owned locations to be closed or relocated. A considerable amount of judgment is involved in determining any impairment or our net 30 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) liability, particularly related to the estimated sales price of owned locations and the potential sublease income at leased locations. These estimates are based on real estate conditions in the markets and our experience in those markets. We make assumptions about the average period of time it would take to sublease the location and the amount of potential sublease income for each leased location. We reassess our liability each quarter and adjust our liability accordingly when our estimates change. Insurance/Self Insurance Liabilities We use a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance pool, to provide for potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property damage, director and officers liability, vehicle liability and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience and evaluations of outside experts, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Income Taxes The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Significant judgment is required in assessing, among other things, the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items. We establish reserves when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable, we determine that certain positions may be successfully challenged. When facts and circumstances change, we adjust these reserves through our provision for income taxes. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48), which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006 and we will adopt these new requirements as of the beginning of fiscal 2008. The estimated cumulative impact of adopting FIN 48 in fiscal 2008 is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157), which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements required under other accounting pronouncements, but does not change existing guidance as to whether or not an instrument is carried at fair value. SFAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. We must adopt these new requirements no later than our first quarter of fiscal 2009. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, Including an Amendment to FASB No. 115 (SFAS 159). Under SFAS 159, entities may elect to measure specified financial instruments and warranty and insurance contracts at fair value 31 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) on a contract by contract basis, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings each reporting period. The election, called the fair value option, will enable entities to achieve an offset accounting effect for changes in fair value of certain related assets and liabilities without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions. SFAS 159 is effective as of the beginning of a companys first fiscal year that begins after November 15, 2007. We must adopt these new requirements no later than our first quarter of fiscal 2009. We are in the process of evaluating the impact that adoption of SFAS 157 and SFAS 159 will have on our future consolidated financial statements. Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to financial market risk resulting from changes in interest and foreign currency rates. We do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions, nor hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. The nature and amount of our long and short term debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As of September 2, 2007, our fixed rate long term debt included $67.6 million principal amount at maturity of 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes carried at $47.8 million, $900.0 million of 5.3% Senior Notes carried at $897.8 million, $1.10 billion of 5.5% Senior Notes carried at $1.09 billion and additional notes and capital lease obligations totaling $127.9 million. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt. We hold interest bearing instruments that are classified as cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. Our investment policy is to manage our cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances to preserve principal and liquidity, while seeking to enhance the return on our investment portfolio through the investment of available funds. We diversify our investment portfolio by investing in multiple types of investment grade securities through a combination of internal and third party investment management. Short term investments generally have a maturity of three months to five years from the purchase date. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. As the majority of these instruments are of a short term nature, if interest rates were to increase or decrease, there is no material risk of a material valuation adjustment related to these instruments. For those instruments that are classified as available for sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in interest rates are reflected within stockholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss. Based on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances at September 2, 2007, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $15.2 million (pre tax) to interest income on an annual basis. Most transactions of our foreign subsidiaries are conducted in local currencies, limiting our exposure to changes in currency rates. We periodically enter into short term forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates on inventory purchases. The notional value of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at September 2, 2007 was $75.0 million. 32 Table of Contents 
 
Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) 2001, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued 1.187% promissory notes in the aggregate amount of $25.8 million, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due in July 2008. In October 2000, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued 2.070% promissory notes in the aggregate amount of $30.1 million, through a private placement. Interest is payable annually and principal is due in October 2007 and will be refinanced. As of September 2, 2007, the 1.187% and the 2.070% promissory notes are reported in the current portion of long term debt on our consolidated balance sheets. In August 1997, we completed the sale of $900.0 million principal amount at maturity Zero Coupon Notes due in August 2017. The Zero Coupon Notes were priced with a yield to maturity of 3.5%, resulting in gross proceeds to us of $449.6 million. The current Notes outstanding are convertible into a maximum of 1.5 million shares of Costco Common Stock shares at an initial conversion price of $22.71. Holders of the Zero Coupon Notes may require us to purchase the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of purchase) in August 2012. We may redeem, at our option, the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of redemption) any time in or after August 2002. As of September 2, 2007, $832.4 million in principal amount of the Zero Coupon Notes had been converted by note holders to shares of Costco Common Stock, of which $61.2 million and $286.5 million in principal were converted in fiscal 2007 and 2006, respectively, or $42.3 million and $188.9 million in fiscal 2007 and 2006, respectively, after factoring in the related debt discount. Derivatives We have limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and use them only to manage well defined interest rate and foreign exchange risks. Forward foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on inventory purchases and typically have very short terms. These forward contracts do not qualify for derivative hedge accounting. The aggregate notional amount, which approximates the fair value of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, was $75.0 million and $63.5 million, respectively. The mark to market adjustment related to these contracts was $0.9 million and $1.1 million at September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006, respectively. The majority of the forward foreign exchange contracts were entered into by our wholly owned United Kingdom subsidiary, primarily to hedge U.S. dollar merchandise inventory purchases. Effective March 25, 2002, we entered into fixed to floating interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk associated with our 2002 Senior Notes, which matured and were retired in March 2007. The swaps were designated and qualified as fair value hedges of the debt. As the terms of the swaps matched those of the underlying hedged debt, changes in the fair value of the swaps were offset by corresponding changes in the carrying amount of the hedged debt and resulted in no net earnings impact. At September 3, 2006, the aggregate value of the swaps was $1 million and was recorded in deferred income taxes and other current assets in our consolidated balance sheets. In March 2007, upon maturity of the debt and expiration of the swap agreements, the aggregate fair value of the swaps was zero. We are exposed to market risk for changes in utility commodity pricing, which we partially mitigate through the use of firm price contracts with counterparties for approximately 23% of our locations in the U.S. and Canada. The effects of these arrangements are not significant for any period presented. 28 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements With the exception of our operating leases, we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition or consolidated financial statements. Stock Repurchase Programs In January and July of 2006, our Board of Directors approved an additional $1.00 billion and $2.00 billion of stock repurchases, respectively, which expire in 2009, bringing total authorizations by our Board of Directors since inception of the program in fiscal 2001 to $4.50 billion. Subsequent to the end of fiscal 2007, our Board of Directors approved an additional $300.0 million of stock repurchases, which expires in 2010. During fiscal 2007, we repurchased 36.4 million shares at an average price of $54.39 totaling approximately $1.98 billion. During fiscal 2006, we repurchased 28.4 million shares of common stock, at an average price of $51.44, totaling approximately $1.46 billion. The remaining amount available to be purchased under our approved plan was approximately $646.4 million at September 2, 2007. Purchases are made from time to time as conditions warrant in the open market or in block purchases, or pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5 1. Repurchased shares are retired. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments. We continue to review our accounting policies and evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, merchandise inventory valuation, impairment of long lived assets, warehouse closing costs, insurance/self insurance liabilities and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. Revenue Recognition We generally recognize sales, net of estimated returns, at the time the member takes possession of merchandise or receives services. When we collect payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services, the amount received is generally recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed. We provide for estimated sales returns based on historical merchandise returns levels. In connection with changes to our consumer electronics returns policy in the spring of 2007, we examined operational data regarding member return patterns that had not been previously analyzed. The data indicated a longer timeframe over which returns are received than previously used to estimate the sales return reserve. Accordingly, as previously disclosed, during fiscal 2007 we increased the reserve balance and recorded an adjustment to sales of $452.6 million and a pretax charge to income of $94.3 million for the related gross margin and disposition costs. We evaluate the criteria of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal Versus Net as an Agent, in determining whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, when we are the primary obligor, subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, influence product or service specifications, or have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded on a gross basis. If we are not the 29 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) primary obligor and do not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above, we record the net amounts as commissions earned, which is reflected in net sales. Membership fee revenue represents annual membership fees paid by substantially all of our members. We account for membership fee revenue on a deferred basis, whereby membership fee revenue is recognized ratably over one year. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, we performed a detailed analysis of the timing of recognition of membership fees based on each members specific renewal date as this methodology represented an improvement over our historical method, which was based on the period in which the fee was collected. This review resulted in a $56.2 million reduction to membership fee revenue and corresponding increase to deferred membership fees on our consolidated balance sheet. This adjustment includes both a change in method of applying an accounting principle to a preferable method and a correction for cumulative timing errors. Our Executive members qualify for a 2% reward (which can be redeemed only at Costco warehouses), up to a maximum of $500 per year, on all qualified purchases made at Costco. We account for this 2% reward as a reduction in sales, with the related liability being classified within other current liabilities. The sales reduction and corresponding liability are computed after giving effect to the estimated impact of non redemptions based on historical data. Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, as determined primarily by the retail method of accounting, and are stated using the last in, first out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail method of accounting and are stated using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. We believe the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. We record an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the expected annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at fiscal year end. At both September 2, 2007 and September 3, 2006 merchandise inventories valued at LIFO approximated FIFO after considering the lower of cost or market principle. We provide for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts as a percentage of net sales. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect results of the actual physical inventory count, which generally occur in the second and fourth fiscal quarters of the fiscal year. Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as we progress toward earning those rebates, provided they are probable and reasonably estimable. Other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of agreement, or other systematic and rational approaches. Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Warehouse Closing costs We periodically evaluate our long lived assets for indicators of impairment, such as a decision to relocate or close a warehouse location. Our judgments are based on existing market and operational conditions. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring a downward adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value. We provide estimates for warehouse closing costs for both leased and owned locations to be closed or relocated. A considerable amount of judgment is involved in determining any impairment or our net 30 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) liability, particularly related to the estimated sales price of owned locations and the potential sublease income at leased locations. These estimates are based on real estate conditions in the markets and our experience in those markets. We make assumptions about the average period of time it would take to sublease the location and the amount of potential sublease income for each leased location. We reassess our liability each quarter and adjust our liability accordingly when our estimates change. Insurance/Self Insurance Liabilities We use a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance pool, to provide for potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property damage, director and officers liability, vehicle liability and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience and evaluations of outside experts, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Income Taxes The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Significant judgment is required in assessing, among other things, the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items. We establish reserves when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable, we determine that certain positions may be successfully challenged. When facts and circumstances change, we adjust these reserves through our provision for income taxes. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48), which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006 and we will adopt these new requirements as of the beginning of fiscal 2008. The estimated cumulative impact of adopting FIN 48 in fiscal 2008 is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157), which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements required under other accounting pronouncements, but does not change existing guidance as to whether or not an instrument is carried at fair value. SFAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. We must adopt these new requirements no later than our first quarter of fiscal 2009. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, Including an Amendment to FASB No. 115 (SFAS 159). Under SFAS 159, entities may elect to measure specified financial instruments and warranty and insurance contracts at fair value 31 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) on a contract by contract basis, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings each reporting period. The election, called the fair value option, will enable entities to achieve an offset accounting effect for changes in fair value of certain related assets and liabilities without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions. SFAS 159 is effective as of the beginning of a companys first fiscal year that begins after November 15, 2007. We must adopt these new requirements no later than our first quarter of fiscal 2009. We are in the process of evaluating the impact that adoption of SFAS 157 and SFAS 159 will have on our future consolidated financial statements. Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to financial market risk resulting from changes in interest and foreign currency rates. We do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions, nor hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. The nature and amount of our long and short term debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As of September 2, 2007, our fixed rate long term debt included $67.6 million principal amount at maturity of 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes carried at $47.8 million, $900.0 million of 5.3% Senior Notes carried at $897.8 million, $1.10 billion of 5.5% Senior Notes carried at $1.09 billion and additional notes and capital lease obligations totaling $127.9 million. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt. We hold interest bearing instruments that are classified as cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. Our investment policy is to manage our cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances to preserve principal and liquidity, while seeking to enhance the return on our investment portfolio through the investment of available funds. We diversify our investment portfolio by investing in multiple types of investment grade securities through a combination of internal and third party investment management. Short term investments generally have a maturity of three months to five years from the purchase date. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. As the majority of these instruments are of a short term nature, if interest rates were to increase or decrease, there is no material risk of a material valuation adjustment related to these instruments. For those instruments that are classified as available for sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in interest rates are reflected within stockholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss. Based on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances at September 2, 2007, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $15.2 million (pre tax) to interest income on an annual basis. Most transactions of our foreign subsidiaries are conducted in local currencies, limiting our exposure to changes in currency rates. We periodically enter into short term forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates on inventory purchases. The notional value of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at September 2, 2007 was $75.0 million. 32 Table of Contents

Under SFAS 159, entities may elect to measure specified financial instruments and warranty and insurance contracts at fair value 31 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) on a contract by contract basis, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings each reporting period. The election, called the fair value option, will enable entities to achieve an offset accounting effect for changes in fair value of certain related assets and liabilities without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions. SFAS 159 is effective as of the beginning of a companys first fiscal year that begins after November 15, 2007. We must adopt these new requirements no later than our first quarter of fiscal 2009. We are in the process of evaluating the impact that adoption of SFAS 157 and SFAS 159 will have on our future consolidated financial statements. Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to financial market risk resulting from changes in interest and foreign currency rates. We do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions, nor hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. The nature and amount of our long and short term debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As of September 2, 2007, our fixed rate long term debt included $67.6 million principal amount at maturity of 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes carried at $47.8 million, $900.0 million of 5.3% Senior Notes carried at $897.8 million, $1.10 billion of 5.5% Senior Notes carried at $1.09 billion and additional notes and capital lease obligations totaling $127.9 million. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt. We hold interest bearing instruments that are classified as cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. Our investment policy is to manage our cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances to preserve principal and liquidity, while seeking to enhance the return on our investment portfolio through the investment of available funds. We diversify our investment portfolio by investing in multiple types of investment grade securities through a combination of internal and third party investment management. Short term investments generally have a maturity of three months to five years from the purchase date. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. As the majority of these instruments are of a short term nature, if interest rates were to increase or decrease, there is no material risk of a material valuation adjustment related to these instruments. For those instruments that are classified as available for sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in interest rates are reflected within stockholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss. Based on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances at September 2, 2007, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $15.2 million (pre tax) to interest income on an annual basis. Most transactions of our foreign subsidiaries are conducted in local currencies, limiting our exposure to changes in currency rates. We periodically enter into short term forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates on inventory purchases. The notional value of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at September 2, 2007 was $75.0 million. 32 Table of Contents 
 
Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) liability, particularly related to the estimated sales price of owned locations and the potential sublease income at leased locations. These estimates are based on real estate conditions in the markets and our experience in those markets. We make assumptions about the average period of time it would take to sublease the location and the amount of potential sublease income for each leased location. We reassess our liability each quarter and adjust our liability accordingly when our estimates change. Insurance/Self Insurance Liabilities We use a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance pool, to provide for potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property damage, director and officers liability, vehicle liability and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience and evaluations of outside experts, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Income Taxes The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Significant judgment is required in assessing, among other things, the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items. We establish reserves when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable, we determine that certain positions may be successfully challenged. When facts and circumstances change, we adjust these reserves through our provision for income taxes. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48), which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006 and we will adopt these new requirements as of the beginning of fiscal 2008. The estimated cumulative impact of adopting FIN 48 in fiscal 2008 is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157), which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements required under other accounting pronouncements, but does not change existing guidance as to whether or not an instrument is carried at fair value. SFAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. We must adopt these new requirements no later than our first quarter of fiscal 2009. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, Including an Amendment to FASB No. 115 (SFAS 159).
