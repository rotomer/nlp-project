Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview Our fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to August 31. References to 2008 and 2007 relate to the 52 week years ended August 31, 2008 and September 2, 2007, respectively. References to 2006 relate to the 53 week year ended September 3, 2006. Key items for 2008 included: Net sales increased 12.5% over 2007, driven by an 8% increase in comparable sales (sales in warehouses open for at least one year) and the opening of 24 new warehouses (34 opened and 10 closed due to relocations) in 2008; Membership fees increased 14.7%, to $1.51 billion, primarily due to new membership sign ups at warehouses opened in 2008 and increased penetration of our higher fee Executive Membership program; Gross margin (net sales less merchandise costs) as a percentage of net sales increased one basis point over the prior year, which included a $32.3 million LIFO charge, resulting from increases in the cost of certain food items and gasoline; Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 14 basis points over the prior year; Net income increased 18.5% to $1.28 billion, or $2.89 per diluted share, in 2008 compared to $1.08 billion, or $2.37 per diluted share, in 2007; The Board of Directors approved an increase in the quarterly cash dividend from $0.145 to $0.16 per share in April 2008; and We repurchased 13.8 million shares of our common stock, at an average cost of $64.22 per share, totaling approximately $886.9 million. As previously reported, 2007 was impacted by the following unusual items, the effects of which are reflected in the table below: Sales returns reserve: We revised our estimate of our sales returns reserve to include a longer timeframe for returns, as well as a lower realization rate on certain returned items. Employee tax consequences on stock options: We made payments to employees in connection with changes in exercise prices designed to avoid adverse tax consequences for employees and recorded a charge for the estimated amount to remedy adverse tax consequences related to stock options held and previously exercised by employees outside the United States. Excise tax refund: We received a refund related to 2002 through 2006, as a result of a settlement with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service relating to excise taxes previously paid. Deferred membership: We analyzed the timing of recognition of membership fees, resulting in a reduction to membership fee revenue and a corresponding increase to deferred membership fees on our consolidated balance sheet. 17 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) We believe disclosing the effects of these items helps provide a meaningful comparison of our current year results to prior years, as well as provide a more representative expectation of future operating results. The impact of each of these items noted above is presented below: 2007 (amounts in thousands) Sales returnreserve Employee taxconsequences onstock options DeferredMembership Excise taxrefund Total Net sales $ (452,553 ) $ $ $ $ (452,553 ) Membership fees (56,183 ) (56,183 ) Total revenue (452,553 ) (56,183 ) (508,736 ) Merchandise costs 358,290 (157 ) 8,661 366,794 Gross margin(1) (94,263 ) (157 ) 8,661 (85,759 ) SG&A (47,115 ) 300 (46,815 ) Operating income (94,263 ) (47,272 ) (56,183 ) 8,961 (188,757 ) Interest expense (50 ) (50 ) Interest income and other (1,000 ) 1,090 90 Income before income taxes (95,263 ) (47,322 ) (56,183 ) 10,051 (188,717 ) Provision for income taxes 34,942 17,358 20,608 (3,687 ) 69,221 Net Income $ (60,321 ) $ (29,964 ) $ (35,575 ) $ 6,364 $ (119,496 ) (1) Net sales less merchandise costs. Results of Operations (dollars in thousands, except per share and warehouse number data) Net Sales 2008 2007 2006 Net sales $ 70,977,484 $ 63,087,601 $ 58,963,180 Effect of change in estimated sales returns reserve 452,553 Net sales, as adjusted $ 70,977,484 $ 63,540,154 $ 58,963,180 Net sales increase 12.5 % 7.0 % 13.7 % Net sales increase, as adjusted 11.7 % 7.8 % 13.7 % Increase in comparable warehouse sales 8 % 6 % 8 % Warehouse openings, net 24 30 25 2008 vs. 2007 Net sales increased 12.5% to $70.98 billion in 2008, from $63.09 billion in 2007. Excluding the impact of the change in the estimated sales returns reserve in 2007, net sales, as adjusted, increased $7.44 billion, or 11.7% in 2008 as compared to the previous year. The $7.44 billion increase in adjusted net sales is comprised of $5.15 billion from the increase in comparable warehouse sales and $2.29 billion primarily from sales at new warehouses opened during 2008 and 2007. Significantly stronger foreign currencies, particularly in Canada, positively impacted adjusted net sales by approximately $1.13 billion, or 180 basis points. Gasoline sales also contributed to the $7.44 billion adjusted net sales growth by approximately $2.24 billion, with approximately $1.49 billion related to the increase in gasoline sales prices. Additionally, we experienced price increases in certain foods and fresh foods items that positively impacted net sales, which were partially offset by price decreases in certain items within our hardlines category. 18 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Most of the comparable sales growth was derived from increased amounts spent by members, with a smaller contribution from increases in shopping frequency. Gasoline sales positively impacted comparable warehouse sales growth by approximately $1.94 billion. Comparable warehouse sales growth excluding gasoline would have been lower by approximately 267 basis points. Significantly stronger foreign currencies, particularly in Canada, positively impacted comparable sales by approximately $1.07 billion, or 170 basis points. Reported comparable sales growth includes the negative impact of cannibalization (established warehouses losing sales to our newly opened locations). While overall sales in 2008 were not materially affected by general economic conditions, we believe that those conditions have constrained and will continue to constrain the growth of spending by our members on hardlines and softlines relative to food and sundries. In addition, risks related to general economic conditions, including those arising from price increases due to rising fuel and commodity costs and other factors, will continue to impact overall consumer spending, although due to the nature of our business model we believe we are better positioned than many retailers to compete in such an environment. 2007 vs. 2006 Net sales increased by $4.13 billion, or 7.0% to $63.09 billion in 2007 (a 52 week year), from $58.96 billion in 2006 (a 53 week year). The $4.13 billion increase in net sales is comprised of $2.10 billion from the increase in comparable warehouse sales and $2.03 billion primarily from sales at new warehouses opened during 2007 and 2006, partially offset by the change in the reserve for estimated sales returns. Changes in prices of merchandise did not materially affect the sales increase. Gasoline sales contributed to the $4.13 billion net sales growth by approximately $356.1 million, with approximately $17.8 million related to the increase in gasoline sales prices. Most of the comparable sales growth was derived from increased amounts spent by members, with a smaller contribution from increases in shopping frequency. Gasoline sales did not have a material impact on comparable warehouse sales growth. Significantly stronger foreign currencies positively impacted comparable sales by approximately $418.4 million, or 72 basis points. Reported comparable sales growth includes the negative impact of cannibalization (established warehouses losing sales to our newly opened locations). In the fourth quarter of 2007, the decrease in our estimated sales returns reserve resulted in an increase to net sales of $57.9 million as compared to the fourth quarter of 2006 where our reserve was increased, resulting in a decrease to net sales of $33.1 million. This improvement is primarily a result of the changes to our consumer electronics returns policy implemented in the spring of 2007. Membership Fees 2008 2007 2006 Membership fees $ 1,505,536 $ 1,312,554 $ 1,188,047 Adjustment to deferred membership balance 56,183 Membership fees, as adjusted $ 1,505,536 $ 1,368,737 $ 1,188,047 Membership fees increase 14.7 % 10.5 % 10.7 % Membership fees increase, as adjusted 10.0 % 15.2 % 10.7 % Membership fees as a percent of net sales 2.12 % 2.08 % 2.02 % Adjusted membership fees, as a percent of adjusted net sales 2.12 % 2.16 % 2.02 % Total cardholders 53,500 50,400 47,700 19 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) 2008 vs. 2007 Membership fees increased 14.7% to $1.51 billion, or 2.12% of net sales in 2008, from $1.31 billion, or 2.08% of net sales in 2007. Excluding the adjustment to deferred membership fees in 2007, adjusted membership fees increased 10.0% from 2007. The increase was primarily due to: new membership sign ups at the 24 new warehouses opened (34 opened and 10 closed due to relocations); increased penetration of the higher fee Executive Membership program; and the five dollar increase in our annual membership fee in the second half of 2006 for non Executive members. Our member renewal rate, currently at 87%, is consistent with recent years. 2007 vs. 2006 Membership fees increased 10.5% to $1.31 billion, or 2.08% of net sales in 2007 from $1.19 billion, or 2.02% of net sales in 2006. Excluding the adjustment to deferred membership fees in 2007, adjusted membership fees increased 15.2% from 2006. This increase was primarily due to: a five dollar increase in our annual membership fee for our U.S. and Canada Gold Star (individual), Business and Business Add on members, which was effective May 1, 2006 for new members and July 1, 2006 for existing members; increased penetration of the higher fee Executive Membership program; and additional membership sign ups at the 30 new warehouses opened in 2007. Gross Margin 2008 2007 2006 Gross margin $ 7,474,734 $ 6,637,899 $ 6,217,683 Unusual items 85,759 Gross margin, as adjusted $ 7,474,734 $ 6,723,658 $ 6,217,683 Gross margin increase 12.6 % 6.8 % 12.4 % Gross margin increase, as adjusted 11.2 % 8.1 % 12.4 % Gross margin as a percent of net sales 10.53 % 10.52 % 10.55 % Adjusted gross margin as a percent of adjusted net sales 10.53 % 10.58 % 10.55 % 2008 vs. 2007 Gross margin was $7.47 billion, or 10.53% of net sales in 2008, compared to $6.64 billion, or 10.52% of net sales in 2007. Excluding the unusual items affecting net sales and gross margin in 2007, adjusted gross margin as a percent of adjusted net sales decreased five basis points in 2008 as compared to 2007. This decrease was largely due to a net 12 basis point decrease in our warehouse ancillary businesses, particularly in one hour photo, tire shop and food services, partially offset by an increase in our gasoline business; a $32.3 million, or five basis point LIFO charge, resulting from price increases in certain food items and gasoline; and a three basis point decrease resulting from the increased penetration of the Executive Membership two percent reward program and increased spending by Executive members. These decreases were partially offset by a net 15 basis point increase from our merchandise departments, particularly fresh foods, food and sundries, Costco Online and our international operations, partially offset by a decrease in softlines. Weve experienced price increases from our suppliers at an increased rate, which may continue. Those increases generally are reflected in our selling prices, but to the extent they are not or are delayed, our gross margins will be adversely affected. 20 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) 2007 vs. 2006 Gross margin was $6.64 billion, or 10.52% of net sales in 2007, compared to $6.22 billion, or 10.55% of net sales in 2006. Excluding the unusual items affecting net sales and gross margin in 2007, adjusted gross margin as a percentage of adjusted net sales was 10.58%, or an increase of three basis points as compared to 2006. This increase was primarily due to a 24 basis point increase in certain merchandise departments, largely food and sundries, as well as smaller increases in certain warehouse ancillary businesses, costco.com and our international operations, offset by a decrease in our hardlines and softlines categories of approximately 15 basis points. In addition, increased penetration of the Executive Membership two percent reward program and increased spending by Executive members negatively affected gross margin by six basis points. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 2008 2007 2006 Selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) $ 6,953,804 $ 6,273,096 $ 5,732,141 Unusual items (46,815 ) SG&A, as adjusted $ 6,953,804 $ 6,226,281 $ 5,732,141 SG&A as a percent of net sales 9.80 % 9.94 % 9.72 % Adjusted SG&A as percent of adjusted net sales 9.80 % 9.80 % 9.72 % 2008 vs. 2007 SG&A totaled $6.95 billion, or 9.80% of net sales in 2008, compared to $6.27 billion, or 9.94% of net sales in 2007. Excluding the unusual items affecting net sales and SG&A expenses in 2007, adjusted SG&A as a percentage of adjusted net sales was 9.80% in 2007. Warehouse operating and central administrative costs positively impacted adjusted SG&A comparisons, on a net basis, by approximately seven basis points, primarily due to decreased payroll and benefits costs as a percent of adjusted net sales. Stock based compensation expense negatively impacted adjusted SG&A comparisons by three basis points, primarily due to a higher closing stock price on the date that our October 2007 RSU grant was valued as compared to previous grants. Additionally, we recorded a $15.9 million reserve in connection with a litigation settlement and accrued approximately $9 million for compensation adjustments we made to employees enrolled in our medical and dental plans related to a decision to share a portion of the health plans savings that we achieved. These two items negatively impacted adjusted SG&A comparisons by four basis points. 2007 vs. 2006 SG&A totaled $6.27 billion, or 9.94% of net sales in 2007, compared to $5.73 billion, or 9.72% of net sales in 2006. Excluding the unusual items affecting net sales and SG&A expenses in 2007, adjusted SG&A as a percentage of adjusted net sales was 9.80%, an increase of eight basis points. Of this increase, three basis points were primarily due to an increase in stock based compensation, and a net five basis points were due to an increase in warehouse payroll and benefits costs. The payroll increase was largely attributed to hourly rate increases that went into effect in March 2007 and a lower overall comparable warehouse sales increase. 21 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Preopening Expenses 2008 2007 2006 Preopening expenses $ 57,383 $ 55,163 $ 42,504 Warehouse openings 34 30 28 Relocations (10 ) (3 ) Warehouse openings, net of relocations 24 30 25 Preopening expenses include costs incurred for startup operations related to new warehouses and the expansion of ancillary operations at existing warehouses. Preopening expenses can vary due to the timing of the opening relative to our year end, whether the warehouse is owned or leased, whether the opening is in an existing, new or international market, as well as the number and magnitude of warehouse remodel projects. Provision for Impaired Assets and Closing Costs, Net 2008 2007 2006 Warehouse closing expenses $ 9,091 $ 15,887 $ 3,762 Impairment of long lived assets 9,972 Net (gains) / losses on the sale of real property (18,815 ) (2,279 ) 1,691 Provision for impaired assets & closing costs, net $ 248 $ 13,608 $ 5,453 The provision primarily includes costs related to impairment of long lived assets, future lease obligations of warehouses that have been relocated to new facilities, accelerated depreciation on buildings to be demolished or sold and that are not otherwise impaired, and gains or losses resulting from the sale of real property, largely comprised of former warehouse locations. 2008 vs. 2007 The net provision for impaired assets and closing costs was $0.2 million in 2008, compared to $13.6 million in 2007. The provision in 2008 included charges of $9.1 million for warehouse closing expenses, and impairment charges of $10.0 million, primarily related to a location in Michigan that was demolished and is being rebuilt. These charges were offset by $18.8 million of net gains on the sale of real property, largely former warehouse locations. 2007 vs. 2006 The net provision for impaired assets and closing costs was $13.6 million in 2007, compared to $5.5 million in 2006. In 2007, approximately $13.0 million of this provision related to the acceleration of depreciation on ten buildings that were relocated in 2008. The reserve for warehouse closing costs, classified within other current liabilities, at the end of 2008 and 2007 included: 2008 2007 Future lease obligations $ 4,505 $ 6,086 Other 24 737 Reserve for warehouse closing costs $ 4,529 $ 6,823 22 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Interest Expense 2008 2007 2006 Interest expense $ 102,636 $ 64,079 $ 12,570 2008 vs. 2007 Interest expense totaled $102.6 million in 2008 compared to $64.1 million in 2007. The increase in interest expense resulted primarily from the issuance of our $900 million of 5.3% and $1.1 billion of 5.5% Senior Notes (2007 Senior Notes) in February 2007, partially offset by lower interest expense resulting from the repayment in March 2007 of the $300 Million 5.5% Senior Notes. 2007 vs. 2006 Interest expense totaled $64.1 million in 2007 compared to $12.6 million in 2006. The increase in interest expense as compared to the prior year resulted primarily from the issuance of our 2007 Senior Notes, partially offset by lower interest expense resulting from the repayment of the $300 Million 5.5% Senior Notes in March 2007. In addition, interest expense decreased on the 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes (Zero Coupon Notes) as note holders converted approximately $61.2 million in principal amount of the Zero Coupon Notes into common stock, or $42.3 million after factoring in the related debt discount. Interest Income and Other 2008 2007 2006 Interest income $ 95,506 $ 128,413 $ 113,712 Earnings of affiliates 42,070 35,622 28,180 Minority interest and other (4,801 ) 1,449 (3,537 ) Interest Income and other $ 132,775 $ 165,484 $ 138,355 2008 vs. 2007 Interest income and other totaled $132.8 million in 2008, compared to $165.5 million in 2007. This decrease was largely due to lower interest rates, year over year, on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances. In addition, we recognized $5.0 million of other than temporary impairment losses on certain securities within our investment portfolio: $2.8 million, $1.4 million and $0.8 million in the second, third and fourth quarter, respectively of 2008. See further discussion in Liquidity and Capital Resources. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in the earnings of affiliates, primarily our investment in Costco Mexico (a 50% owned joint venture). 2007 vs. 2006 Interest income and other totaled $165.5 million in 2007, compared to $138.4 million in 2006. This increase was largely due to the increase in our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments resulting from increased earnings from operations and the proceeds of the issuance of the 2007 Senior Notes, as well as an increase in the earnings of affiliates, primarily our investment in Costco Mexico (a 50% owned joint venture). 23 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Provision for Income Taxes 2008 2007 2006 Income tax expense $ 716,249 $ 627,219 $ 648,202 Effective tax rate 35.83 % 36.68 % 37.01 % The effective income tax rate on earnings in 2008, 2007 and 2006 was 35.83%, 36.68% and 37.01%, respectively. The lower tax rate in 2008 was primarily attributable to non recurring benefits recognized during the year. Net Income 2008 2007 2006 Net income $ 1,282,725 $ 1,082,772 $ 1,103,215 Unusual items (net of tax) 119,496 Net income, as adjusted $ 1,282,725 $ 1,202,268 $ 1,103,215 Diluted earnings per share $ 2.89 $ 2.37 $ 2.30 Shares used to calculate diluted net income per common share 444,240 457,641 480,341 Diluted earnings per share increase 22 % 3 % 6 % 2008 vs. 2007 Net income for 2008 was $1.28 billion, or $2.89 per diluted share, compared to $1.08 billion, or $2.37 per diluted share, during 2007. The unusual items previously discussed totaled $119.5 million, net of tax, or $0.26 per diluted share in 2007. Exclusive of these items, earnings in 2007 were $2.63 per diluted share. Net income per diluted share in 2008 represents an increase of 10% over this adjusted amount. During 2008, we repurchased and retired 13.8 million shares of common stock, favorably impacting earnings per diluted share by approximately $0.03. 2007 vs. 2006 Net income for 2007 was $1.08 billion, or $2.37 per diluted share, compared to $1.10 billion, or $2.30 per diluted share during 2006. The unusual items previously discussed totaled $119.5 million, net of tax, or $0.26 per diluted share in 2007. Exclusive of these items, earnings for 2007 were $2.63 per diluted share, a 14% increase over the prior year. During 2007, we repurchased and retired 36.4 million shares of common stock, favorably impacting earnings per diluted share by approximately $0.03. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The following table itemizes our most liquid assets at the end of 2008 and 2007 (dollars in thousands): 2008 2007 Cash and cash equivalents $ 2,619,429 $ 2,779,733 Short term investments 655,584 575,787 Total $ 3,275,013 $ 3,355,520 24 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from warehouse operations and existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances, which were $3.28 billion and $3.36 billion at the end of 2008 and 2007, respectively. Of these balances, approximately $787.5 million and $655.2 million at the end of 2008 and 2007, respectively, represented debit and credit card receivables, primarily related to sales in the week prior to the end of the year. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $2.18 billion in 2008 compared to $2.08 billion in 2007, an increase of $99.8 million. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in net income of $200.0 million, an increase in depreciation and amortization and stock based compensation of $118.2 million, as well as an increase in cash flow from the change in operating assets, liabilities and deferred income taxes of $56.8 million, offset by an increase in net merchandise inventories (merchandise inventory less accounts payable) of $258.0 million. Net cash used in investing activities totaled $1.72 billion in 2008 compared to $655.3 million in 2007, an increase of approximately $1.06 billion. The increase in investing activities relates primarily to a decrease in cash provided by the net investment in short term investments of $534.1 million as a result of less cash needed to fund our decreased common stock repurchase activity. Additions to property and equipment related to warehouse expansion and remodel projects increased $212.9 million in 2008. Additionally, in the second quarter of 2008, $371.1 million formerly classified as cash and cash equivalents was reclassified to short term investments and other non current assets. In December 2007, one of our enhanced money fund investments, Columbia Strategic Cash Portfolio Fund (Columbia), ceased accepting cash redemption requests and changed to a floating net asset value. In light of the restricted liquidity, we elected to receive a pro rata allocation of the underlying securities in a separately managed account. We assessed the fair value of the underlying securities in this account through market quotations and review of current investment ratings, as available, coupled with the evaluation of the liquidation value of each investment and its current performance in meeting scheduled payments of principal and interest. In 2008, we recognized $5.0 million of other than temporary impairment losses related to these securities: $2.8 million, $1.4 million and $0.8 million in the second, third and fourth quarters, respectively. The losses are included in interest income and other in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. The markets relating to these investments remain uncertain, and there may be further declines in the value of these investments that may cause additional losses in future periods. At the end of 2008, the balance of the Columbia fund securities was $103.6 million on the consolidated balance sheet. Additionally, in December 2007, two other enhanced money fund investments, BlackRock Cash Strategies, LLC (BlackRock) and Merrill Lynch Capital Reserve Fund, LLC (Merrill Lynch), ceased accepting redemption requests. These two funds are being liquidated with periodic distributions and the expectation is that the funds will be completely liquidated by 2010. To date, the funds have maintained a $1.00 per unit net asset value. At the end of 2008, the combined balance of the BlackRock and Merrill Lynch funds was $125.1 million on our consolidated balance sheet and we received cash redemptions of $48.2 million from the BlackRock and Merrill Lynch funds subsequent to the end of the year and through October 14, 2008. At the end of 2008, $228.7 million remained in the Columbia, BlackRock and Merrill Lynch funds, with $160.7 million in short term investments and $68.0 million in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet, reflecting the timing of the expected distributions. 25 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) On September 18, 2008, one of our government agency money market funds, The Reserve U.S. Government Fund, announced that the proceeds from a redemption request for this fund would not be transmitted to an investor for a period of up to seven calendar days after the receipt of the redemption request. On September 22, 2008, the SEC granted a temporary order suspending shareholder redemptions as of September 17, 2008 and requiring The Reserve to create a plan to effect an orderly disposition, subject to supervision by the SEC. As of October 14, 2008, the plan to effect an orderly disposition of the U.S. Government Fund has not yet been publicly disclosed. At August 31, 2008 and October 14, 2008, we had $171.4 million and $317.2 million, respectively, invested in the fund. Although market conditions cannot be predicted, we currently do not expect to realize a loss on this fund. The latest per unit net asset value reported for the fund is $1.00. Subsequent to the end of 2008, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (Lehman) filed a petition under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. At August 31, 2008, we held $2.3 million of Lehman securities, within the Columbia portfolio, purchased by the fund manager prior to receipt of our pro rata allocation of the funds investments in December 2007. As of October 14, 2008, we do not have an estimate of the recovery value of the Lehman securities. Additionally, on September 29, 2008, one of Sigma Finance Corporations (Sigma) lenders terminated its repurchase agreements, followed by two additional lenders also terminating agreements. On September 30, 2008 Sigma received a notice of default, which is expected to cause lenders to move to seize Sigmas assets. Sigmas Board of Directors also announced they will cease trading. At August 31, 2008, we held Sigma securities with a market value of $2.2 million and a book value of $1.9 million, within the Columbia portfolio purchased by the fund manager prior to receipt of our pro rata allocation of the funds investments in December 2007. These securities were previously impaired during 2008 and $1.4 million was recorded as an other than temporary impairment. As of October 14, 2008, we do not have an estimate of the recovery value of these securities. Although future market conditions cannot be predicted, we currently do not expect future losses in our investment portfolio to be material to our consolidated financial statements or that we will experience a detriment to our overall liquidity. Net cash used in financing activities totaled $613.0 million in 2008 compared to $164.6 million in 2007. The $448.4 million increase in net cash used in financing activities primarily resulted from a net decrease in cash provided by the issuance of long term debt, net of repayments, of $1.65 billion, largely relating to the issuance of the 2007 Senior Notes. This decrease was partially offset by a reduction in the repurchase of common stock of $1.08 billion, and an increase in the net proceeds from short term borrowings of $76.7 million. Dividends In April 2008, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash dividend from $0.145 to $0.16 per share or $0.64 on an annualized basis. Our quarterly cash dividends paid in 2008 totaled $0.61 per share. In 2007, we paid quarterly cash dividends totaling $0.55 per share. 26 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Contractual Obligations Our commitments at year end to make future payments under contractual obligations were as follows, as of August 31, 2008 (amounts in thousands): Payments Due by Year Contractual obligations 2009 2010 to2011 2012 to2013 2014 andthereafter Total Purchase obligations (merchandise)(1) $ 4,163,530 $ 1,693 $ $ $ 4,165,223 Long term debt(2) 110,735 285,140 1,072,608 1,505,387 2,973,870 Operating leases(3) 139,916 277,885 247,634 1,438,390 2,103,825 Purchase obligations (property, equipment, services and other)(4) 211,311 44,406 1,206 256,923 Construction Commitments 289,730 289,730 Capital lease obligations and other(2) 6,243 6,483 495 5,655 18,876 Other(5) 15,723 4,406 2,405 6,113 28,647 Total $ 4,937,188 $ 620,013 $ 1,324,348 $ 2,955,545 $ 9,837,094 (1) Includes open merchandise purchase orders.

(5) Consists of asset retirement and deferred compensation obligations and includes $13,175 of current unrecognized tax benefits relating to uncertain tax positions, but excludes $39,699 of noncurrent unrecognized tax benefits due to uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash payments. Expansion Plans Our primary requirement for capital is the financing of land, building and equipment costs for new and remodeled warehouses. Capital is also required for initial warehouse operations and working capital. While there can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized and plans are subject to change upon further review, it is our current intention to spend approximately $1.7 billion during fiscal 2009 for real estate, construction, remodeling and equipment for warehouses and related operations. These expenditures are expected to be financed with a combination of cash provided from operations and existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. Plans for the United States and Canada during 2009 are to open approximately 24 to 28 new warehouses, inclusive of one to three relocations of existing warehouses to larger and better located facilities. We expect to continue our review of expansion plans in our international operations, including the United Kingdom and Asia, along with other international markets. 27 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Additional Equity Investments in Subsidiaries and Joint Ventures The Companys investments in the Costco Mexico joint venture and in other unconsolidated joint ventures that are less than majority owned are accounted for under the equity method. In 2006, we contributed an additional $15 million to our investment in Costco Mexico (a 50% owned joint venture), which did not impact our percentage ownership of this entity, as our joint venture partner contributed a like amount. There were no such contributions in 2008 and 2007.

For those entities with multi purpose lines, any increase in either letters of credit (standby and or commercial) issuance and or short term borrowing will result in a corresponding decrease in available credit. Financing Activities On June 16, 2008, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary entered into a ten year term loan in the amount of $27.6 million, with a variable rate of interest of Yen TIBOR (6 month) plus a 0.35% margin (1.24% at August 31, 2008) on the outstanding balance. The net proceeds were used to repay the 1.187% Promissory Notes due in July 2008 and for general corporate purposes. Interest is payable semi annually in December and June, with the first payment due in December 2008 and principal is due in June 2018. 29 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) On October 17, 2007, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued Promissory Notes through a private placement in the amount of $59.8 million, bearing interest at 2.695%. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due in October 2017. The proceeds were used to repay the 2.070% Promissory Notes due in October 2007 and for general corporate purposes. In February 2007, we issued $900 million of 5.3% Senior Notes due March 15, 2012 at a discount of $2.5 million and $1.1 billion of 5.5% Senior Notes due March 15, 2017 at a discount of $5.9 million (together, the 2007 Senior Notes). Interest on the 2007 Senior Notes is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The discount and issuance costs associated with the 2007 Senior Notes are being amortized to interest expense over the terms of those notes. At our option, we may redeem the 2007 Senior Notes at any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount of the 2007 Senior Notes to be redeemed, or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, we will be required to make an offer to purchase the 2007 Senior Notes at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase, upon certain events as defined by the terms of the 2007 Senior Notes. In April 2003, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.92% in the amount of $36.8 million, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due in April 2010. In November 2002, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.88% in the aggregate amount of $27.6 million, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due in November 2009. The U.S. Parent Company, Costco Wholesale Corporation guarantees all of the promissory notes issued by our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary. In August 1997, we sold $900.0 million principal amount at maturity Zero Coupon Notes due in August 2017. The Zero Coupon Notes were priced with a yield to maturity of 3.5%, resulting in gross proceeds to us of $449.6 million. The notes outstanding are convertible into a maximum of 1.5 million shares of Costco Common Stock shares at an initial conversion price of $22.71. Holders of the Zero Coupon Notes may require us to purchase the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of purchase) in August 2012. We may redeem, at our option, the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of redemption) any time after August 2002. As of August 31, 2008, $832.9 million in principal amount of the Zero Coupon Notes had been converted by note holders to shares of Costco Common Stock, of which $0.5 million and $61.2 million in principal were converted in 2008 and 2007, respectively, or $0.4 million and $42.3 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively, after factoring in the related debt discount. Derivatives We follow Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (as amended) (SFAS 133), in accounting for derivative and hedging activities. We use derivative and hedging arrangements only to manage what we believe to be well defined risks. Forward foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on inventory purchases and typically have very short terms. These forward contracts do not qualify for derivative hedge accounting. The aggregate notional amount of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at the end of 2008 and 2007 was $89.8 million and $75.0 million, respectively. The mark to market adjustment related to these contracts resulted in the recording of an asset of $4.6 million and a liability of $0.9 million at the end of 2008 and 2007, respectively, and $5.8 million and $0.4 million were recognized in interest income and other in the consolidated statements of income in 2008 and 2007, respectively. The majority of the forward foreign exchange contracts were entered into by our wholly owned United Kingdom subsidiary, primarily to hedge U.S. dollar merchandise inventory purchases. 30 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) We are exposed to risks in energy costs due to fluctuations in energy prices, particularly electricity, which we partially mitigate through the use of fixed price contracts with counterparties for approximately 19% of our warehouses in the U.S. and Canada, as well as certain depots and other facilities. We have also entered into variable priced contracts for the purchase of natural gas and fuel for our gas stations on an index basis. These contracts qualify for treatment as normal purchase or normal sales under SFAS 133 and require no mark to market adjustment. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements With the exception of our operating leases, we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition or consolidated financial statements. Stock Repurchase Programs In September and November of 2007, our Board of Directors approved $300.0 million and $1.0 billion, respectively, of stock repurchases, both expiring in 2010. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an additional $1.0 billion expiring in 2011, bringing total authorizations by our Board of Directors since inception of the program in 2001 to $6.80 billion. During 2008, we repurchased 13.8 million shares at an average price of $64.22 totaling approximately $886.9 million. During 2007, we repurchased 36.4 million shares of common stock, at an average price of $54.39, totaling approximately $1.98 billion. The remaining amount available to be purchased under our approved plan was approximately $2.06 billion at the end of 2008. Purchases are made from time to time as conditions warrant in the open market or in block purchases, and pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5 1. Repurchased shares are retired, in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments. We continue to review our accounting policies and evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, merchandise inventory valuation, impairment of long lived assets, warehouse closing costs, insurance/self insurance liabilities, investments and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. Revenue Recognition We generally recognize sales, net of estimated returns, at the time the member takes possession of merchandise or receives services. When we collect payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services, the amount received is generally recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed. We provide for estimated sales returns based on historical merchandise returns levels. Amounts collected from members, which under common trade practices are referred to as sales taxes, are recorded on a net basis. We evaluate the criteria of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal Versus Net as an Agent, in determining whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, when we are the primary obligor, subject to inventory risk, 31 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, influence product or service specifications, or have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded on a gross basis. If we are not the primary obligor and do not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above, we record the net amounts as commissions earned, which is reflected in net sales. Membership fee revenue represents annual membership fees paid by substantially all of our members. We account for membership fee revenue on a deferred basis, whereby revenue is recognized ratably over the one year membership period. In 2007, we performed a detailed analysis of the timing of recognition of membership fees based on each members specific renewal date, as this methodology represented an improvement over the historical method, which was based on the period in which the fee was collected. This review resulted in a $56.2 million reduction to membership fee revenue in 2007 and a corresponding increase to deferred membership fees on our consolidated balance sheet. This adjustment included both a change in method of applying an accounting principle to a preferable method and a correction for cumulative timing errors. Our Executive members qualify for a 2% reward (which can be redeemed only at Costco warehouses), up to a maximum of $500 per year, on all qualified purchases made at Costco. We account for this 2% reward as a reduction in sales, with the related liability being classified within other current liabilities. The sales reduction and corresponding liability are computed after giving effect to the estimated impact of non redemptions based on historical data. Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, as determined primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting, and are stated using the last in, first out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all other foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail inventory method of accounting and are stated using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. We believe the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. We record an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the expected annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end. The LIFO inventory adjustment in 2008 reduced ending inventory and gross margin by $32.3 million. At the end of 2007, merchandise inventories valued at LIFO approximated FIFO after considering the lower of cost or market principle. We provide for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts as a percentage of net sales. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect results of the actual physical inventory counts, which generally occur in the second and fourth quarters of the year. Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as we progress toward earning those rebates, provided they are probable and reasonably estimable. Other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of agreement, or other systematic and rational approaches. Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Warehouse Closing costs We periodically evaluate our long lived assets for indicators of impairment, such as a decision to relocate or close a warehouse location. Our judgments are based on existing market and operational conditions. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring a downward adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value. 32 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) We provide estimates for warehouse closing costs for both leased and owned locations to be closed or relocated. A considerable amount of judgment is involved in determining any impairment or our net liability, particularly related to the estimated sales price of owned locations and the potential sublease income at leased locations. These estimates are based on real estate conditions in the markets and our experience in those markets. We make assumptions about the average period of time it would take to sublease the location and the amount of potential sublease income for each leased location. We reassess our liability each quarter and adjust our liability accordingly when our estimates change. Insurance/Self Insurance Liabilities We use a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance pool, to provide for potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property damage, director and officers liability, vehicle liability and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience and evaluations of outside experts, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Investments Investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other than temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and our intent and ability to hold the investment. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the issuer, including industry and sector performance, operational and financing cash flow factors, and rating agency actions. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and or issuer conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments. Income Taxes We adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48), which sets out criteria for the use of judgment in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items, at the beginning of 2008. The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Significant judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions. The benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in our financial statements only after determining a more likely than not probability that the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge, if any, from tax authorities. When facts and circumstances change, we reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the financial statements as appropriate. 33 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Recent Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157), which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements required under other accounting pronouncements. It does not change existing guidance as to whether or not an instrument is carried at fair value. SFAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 157 1 (FSP FAS 157 1), which excludes SFAS No. 13, Accounting for Leases and certain other accounting pronouncements that address fair value measurements under SFAS 13, from the scope of SFAS 157. In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. 157 2 (FSP 157 2), which provides a one year delayed application of SFAS 157 for nonfinancial assets and liabilities, except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). We are required to adopt SFAS 157 as amended by FSP FAS 157 1 and FSP FAS 157 2 on September 1, 2008, the beginning of our fiscal 2009. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In October 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 157 3, Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset in a Market That Is Not Active (FSP 157 3), which clarifies the application of SFAS 157 when the market for a financial asset is inactive. Specifically, FSP 157 3 clarifies how (1) managements internal assumptions should be considered in measuring fair value when observable data are not present, (2) observable market information from an inactive market should be taken into account, and (3) the use of broker quotes or pricing services should be considered in assessing the relevance of observable and unobservable data to measure fair value. The guidance in FSP 157 3 is effective immediately and will apply to us upon adoption of SFAS 157. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, Including an Amendment to FASB No. 115 (SFAS 159). Under SFAS 159, entities may elect to measure specified financial instruments and warranty and insurance contracts at fair value on a contract by contract basis, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings each reporting period. The election, called the fair value option, will enable entities to achieve an offset accounting effect for changes in fair value of certain related assets and liabilities without having to apply more complex hedge accounting provisions. SFAS 159 will be effective for us September 1, 2008, the beginning of our fiscal 2009. We do not intend to elect the fair value option for any of our existing financial assets or financial liabilities; therefore, this statement is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In June 2008, the FASB issued Staff Position EITF 03 06 1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities (FSP EITF 03 06 1). FSP EITF 03 06 1 provides that unvested share based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (whether paid or unpaid) are participating securities and shall be included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two class method in SFAS No. 128, Earnings per Share. Our unvested RSUs are not eligible to receive dividends; therefore EITF 03 06 1 will not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an Amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin No 51 (SFAS 160). SFAS 160 establishes accounting and reporting standards for ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent, changes in a parents ownership of a noncontrolling interest, calculation and disclosure of the consolidated net income attributable to the parent and the noncontrolling interest, 34 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) changes in a parents ownership interest while the parent retains its controlling financial interest and fair value measurement of any retained noncontrolling equity investment. SFAS 160 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is prohibited. We must adopt these new requirements in our first quarter of fiscal 2010. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141R, Business Combinations (SFAS 141R), which establishes principles and requirements for the reporting entity in a business combination, including recognition and measurement in the financial statements of the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree. SFAS 141R applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years. We must adopt these new requirements in our first quarter of fiscal 2010. In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 133 (SFAS 161), which requires enhanced disclosures about derivative and hedging activities. This statement is effective for financial statements issued for periods beginning after November 15, 2008. Early adoption is permitted. We must provide these new disclosures no later than our second quarter of fiscal 2009. We are in the process of evaluating the impact that adoption of SFAS Nos. 141R, 160 and 161 will have on our future consolidated financial statements. Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to financial market risk resulting from changes in interest and foreign currency rates. We do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions, nor hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. Recent developments in the financial markets, however, have rendered risks less predictable, and liquidity concerns and credit risks have increased. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our money market funds, debt securities, corporate notes and bonds and enhanced money funds with effective maturities of generally three months to five years at the date of purchase. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while generating yields without significantly increasing risk. Historically, this was accomplished by investing in high investment grade securities with a minimum overall portfolio average credit rating of AA . A revised investment policy was approved in December 2007 by our Board of Directors, limiting future investments to direct U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations, repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations and U.S. Government and Government Agency Money Market funds. The investment policies of our subsidiaries have been reviewed and are consistent with our primary objective to preserve principal while generating yields without significantly leveraging risk. Our wholly owned insurance subsidiary invests in U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations, corporate notes and bonds and asset and mortgage backed securities with a minimum overall portfolio average credit rating of AA . All of our foreign subsidiaries investments are primarily in money market funds, investment grade securities, bankers acceptances, bank certificates of deposit and term deposits all denominated in their local currencies. Additionally, our Canadian subsidiary may invest a portion of their investments in 35 Table of Contents Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) U.S. dollar investment grade securities and bank term deposits to meet current U.S. dollar obligations. All of the investment policies of the Company and subsidiaries are reviewed at least annually. As the majority of these investments in cash and cash equivalents are of a short term nature, if interest rates were to increase or decrease, there is no material risk of a material valuation adjustment related to these instruments. Based on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances at the end of 2008, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $17.9 million (pre tax) to interest income on an annual basis. For those investments that are classified as available for sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in market volatility and interest rates are reflected within stockholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive income. The nature and amount of our long and short term debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As of the end of 2008, our fixed rate long term debt included: $67.1 million principal amount at maturity of 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes carried at $49.1 million; $900.0 million of 5.3% Senior Notes carried at $898.3 million; and $1.10 billion of 5.5% Senior Notes carried at $1.09 billion and additional notes and capital lease obligations totaling $142.0 million. Additionally, our variable rate long term debt included a 0.35% over Yen Tibor (6 month) Term Loan of $27.6 million. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt and may affect the interest expense related to the variable rate debt. Most transactions of our foreign subsidiaries are conducted in local currencies, limiting our exposure to changes in currency rates. The majority of the forward foreign exchange contracts were entered into by our wholly owned United Kingdom subsidiary, primarily to hedge U.S. dollar merchandise inventory purchases. We periodically enter into short term forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates on inventory purchases. The notional value of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at the end of 2008 was $89.8 million. 
 
Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) We believe disclosing the effects of these items helps provide a meaningful comparison of our current year results to prior years, as well as provide a more representative expectation of future operating results.

Results of Operations (dollars in thousands, except per share and warehouse number data) Net Sales 2008 2007 2006 Net sales $ 70,977,484 $ 63,087,601 $ 58,963,180 Effect of change in estimated sales returns reserve 452,553 Net sales, as adjusted $ 70,977,484 $ 63,540,154 $ 58,963,180 Net sales increase 12.5 % 7.0 % 13.7 % Net sales increase, as adjusted 11.7 % 7.8 % 13.7 % Increase in comparable warehouse sales 8 % 6 % 8 % Warehouse openings, net 24 30 25 2008 vs. 2007 Net sales increased 12.5% to $70.98 billion in 2008, from $63.09 billion in 2007. Excluding the impact of the change in the estimated sales returns reserve in 2007, net sales, as adjusted, increased $7.44 billion, or 11.7% in 2008 as compared to the previous year. The $7.44 billion increase in adjusted net sales is comprised of $5.15 billion from the increase in comparable warehouse sales and $2.29 billion primarily from sales at new warehouses opened during 2008 and 2007. Significantly stronger foreign currencies, particularly in Canada, positively impacted adjusted net sales by approximately $1.13 billion, or 180 basis points. Gasoline sales also contributed to the $7.44 billion adjusted net sales growth by approximately $2.24 billion, with approximately $1.49 billion related to the increase in gasoline sales prices. Additionally, we experienced price increases in certain foods and fresh foods items that positively impacted net sales, which were partially offset by price decreases in certain items within our hardlines category. 18 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Most of the comparable sales growth was derived from increased amounts spent by members, with a smaller contribution from increases in shopping frequency. Gasoline sales positively impacted comparable warehouse sales growth by approximately $1.94 billion. Comparable warehouse sales growth excluding gasoline would have been lower by approximately 267 basis points. Significantly stronger foreign currencies, particularly in Canada, positively impacted comparable sales by approximately $1.07 billion, or 170 basis points. Reported comparable sales growth includes the negative impact of cannibalization (established warehouses losing sales to our newly opened locations). While overall sales in 2008 were not materially affected by general economic conditions, we believe that those conditions have constrained and will continue to constrain the growth of spending by our members on hardlines and softlines relative to food and sundries. In addition, risks related to general economic conditions, including those arising from price increases due to rising fuel and commodity costs and other factors, will continue to impact overall consumer spending, although due to the nature of our business model we believe we are better positioned than many retailers to compete in such an environment. 2007 vs. 2006 Net sales increased by $4.13 billion, or 7.0% to $63.09 billion in 2007 (a 52 week year), from $58.96 billion in 2006 (a 53 week year). The $4.13 billion increase in net sales is comprised of $2.10 billion from the increase in comparable warehouse sales and $2.03 billion primarily from sales at new warehouses opened during 2007 and 2006, partially offset by the change in the reserve for estimated sales returns. Changes in prices of merchandise did not materially affect the sales increase. Gasoline sales contributed to the $4.13 billion net sales growth by approximately $356.1 million, with approximately $17.8 million related to the increase in gasoline sales prices. Most of the comparable sales growth was derived from increased amounts spent by members, with a smaller contribution from increases in shopping frequency. Gasoline sales did not have a material impact on comparable warehouse sales growth. Significantly stronger foreign currencies positively impacted comparable sales by approximately $418.4 million, or 72 basis points. Reported comparable sales growth includes the negative impact of cannibalization (established warehouses losing sales to our newly opened locations). In the fourth quarter of 2007, the decrease in our estimated sales returns reserve resulted in an increase to net sales of $57.9 million as compared to the fourth quarter of 2006 where our reserve was increased, resulting in a decrease to net sales of $33.1 million. This improvement is primarily a result of the changes to our consumer electronics returns policy implemented in the spring of 2007. Membership Fees 2008 2007 2006 Membership fees $ 1,505,536 $ 1,312,554 $ 1,188,047 Adjustment to deferred membership balance 56,183 Membership fees, as adjusted $ 1,505,536 $ 1,368,737 $ 1,188,047 Membership fees increase 14.7 % 10.5 % 10.7 % Membership fees increase, as adjusted 10.0 % 15.2 % 10.7 % Membership fees as a percent of net sales 2.12 % 2.08 % 2.02 % Adjusted membership fees, as a percent of adjusted net sales 2.12 % 2.16 % 2.02 % Total cardholders 53,500 50,400 47,700 19 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) 2008 vs. 2007 Membership fees increased 14.7% to $1.51 billion, or 2.12% of net sales in 2008, from $1.31 billion, or 2.08% of net sales in 2007. Excluding the adjustment to deferred membership fees in 2007, adjusted membership fees increased 10.0% from 2007. The increase was primarily due to: new membership sign ups at the 24 new warehouses opened (34 opened and 10 closed due to relocations); increased penetration of the higher fee Executive Membership program; and the five dollar increase in our annual membership fee in the second half of 2006 for non Executive members. Our member renewal rate, currently at 87%, is consistent with recent years. 2007 vs. 2006 Membership fees increased 10.5% to $1.31 billion, or 2.08% of net sales in 2007 from $1.19 billion, or 2.02% of net sales in 2006. Excluding the adjustment to deferred membership fees in 2007, adjusted membership fees increased 15.2% from 2006. This increase was primarily due to: a five dollar increase in our annual membership fee for our U.S. and Canada Gold Star (individual), Business and Business Add on members, which was effective May 1, 2006 for new members and July 1, 2006 for existing members; increased penetration of the higher fee Executive Membership program; and additional membership sign ups at the 30 new warehouses opened in 2007. Gross Margin 2008 2007 2006 Gross margin $ 7,474,734 $ 6,637,899 $ 6,217,683 Unusual items 85,759 Gross margin, as adjusted $ 7,474,734 $ 6,723,658 $ 6,217,683 Gross margin increase 12.6 % 6.8 % 12.4 % Gross margin increase, as adjusted 11.2 % 8.1 % 12.4 % Gross margin as a percent of net sales 10.53 % 10.52 % 10.55 % Adjusted gross margin as a percent of adjusted net sales 10.53 % 10.58 % 10.55 % 2008 vs. 2007 Gross margin was $7.47 billion, or 10.53% of net sales in 2008, compared to $6.64 billion, or 10.52% of net sales in 2007. Excluding the unusual items affecting net sales and gross margin in 2007, adjusted gross margin as a percent of adjusted net sales decreased five basis points in 2008 as compared to 2007. This decrease was largely due to a net 12 basis point decrease in our warehouse ancillary businesses, particularly in one hour photo, tire shop and food services, partially offset by an increase in our gasoline business; a $32.3 million, or five basis point LIFO charge, resulting from price increases in certain food items and gasoline; and a three basis point decrease resulting from the increased penetration of the Executive Membership two percent reward program and increased spending by Executive members. These decreases were partially offset by a net 15 basis point increase from our merchandise departments, particularly fresh foods, food and sundries, Costco Online and our international operations, partially offset by a decrease in softlines. Weve experienced price increases from our suppliers at an increased rate, which may continue. Those increases generally are reflected in our selling prices, but to the extent they are not or are delayed, our gross margins will be adversely affected. 20 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) 2007 vs. 2006 Gross margin was $6.64 billion, or 10.52% of net sales in 2007, compared to $6.22 billion, or 10.55% of net sales in 2006. Excluding the unusual items affecting net sales and gross margin in 2007, adjusted gross margin as a percentage of adjusted net sales was 10.58%, or an increase of three basis points as compared to 2006. This increase was primarily due to a 24 basis point increase in certain merchandise departments, largely food and sundries, as well as smaller increases in certain warehouse ancillary businesses, costco.com and our international operations, offset by a decrease in our hardlines and softlines categories of approximately 15 basis points. In addition, increased penetration of the Executive Membership two percent reward program and increased spending by Executive members negatively affected gross margin by six basis points. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 2008 2007 2006 Selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) $ 6,953,804 $ 6,273,096 $ 5,732,141 Unusual items (46,815 ) SG&A, as adjusted $ 6,953,804 $ 6,226,281 $ 5,732,141 SG&A as a percent of net sales 9.80 % 9.94 % 9.72 % Adjusted SG&A as percent of adjusted net sales 9.80 % 9.80 % 9.72 % 2008 vs. 2007 SG&A totaled $6.95 billion, or 9.80% of net sales in 2008, compared to $6.27 billion, or 9.94% of net sales in 2007. Excluding the unusual items affecting net sales and SG&A expenses in 2007, adjusted SG&A as a percentage of adjusted net sales was 9.80% in 2007. Warehouse operating and central administrative costs positively impacted adjusted SG&A comparisons, on a net basis, by approximately seven basis points, primarily due to decreased payroll and benefits costs as a percent of adjusted net sales. Stock based compensation expense negatively impacted adjusted SG&A comparisons by three basis points, primarily due to a higher closing stock price on the date that our October 2007 RSU grant was valued as compared to previous grants. Additionally, we recorded a $15.9 million reserve in connection with a litigation settlement and accrued approximately $9 million for compensation adjustments we made to employees enrolled in our medical and dental plans related to a decision to share a portion of the health plans savings that we achieved. These two items negatively impacted adjusted SG&A comparisons by four basis points. 2007 vs. 2006 SG&A totaled $6.27 billion, or 9.94% of net sales in 2007, compared to $5.73 billion, or 9.72% of net sales in 2006. Excluding the unusual items affecting net sales and SG&A expenses in 2007, adjusted SG&A as a percentage of adjusted net sales was 9.80%, an increase of eight basis points. Of this increase, three basis points were primarily due to an increase in stock based compensation, and a net five basis points were due to an increase in warehouse payroll and benefits costs. The payroll increase was largely attributed to hourly rate increases that went into effect in March 2007 and a lower overall comparable warehouse sales increase. 21 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Preopening Expenses 2008 2007 2006 Preopening expenses $ 57,383 $ 55,163 $ 42,504 Warehouse openings 34 30 28 Relocations (10 ) (3 ) Warehouse openings, net of relocations 24 30 25 Preopening expenses include costs incurred for startup operations related to new warehouses and the expansion of ancillary operations at existing warehouses. Preopening expenses can vary due to the timing of the opening relative to our year end, whether the warehouse is owned or leased, whether the opening is in an existing, new or international market, as well as the number and magnitude of warehouse remodel projects. Provision for Impaired Assets and Closing Costs, Net 2008 2007 2006 Warehouse closing expenses $ 9,091 $ 15,887 $ 3,762 Impairment of long lived assets 9,972 Net (gains) / losses on the sale of real property (18,815 ) (2,279 ) 1,691 Provision for impaired assets & closing costs, net $ 248 $ 13,608 $ 5,453 The provision primarily includes costs related to impairment of long lived assets, future lease obligations of warehouses that have been relocated to new facilities, accelerated depreciation on buildings to be demolished or sold and that are not otherwise impaired, and gains or losses resulting from the sale of real property, largely comprised of former warehouse locations. 2008 vs. 2007 The net provision for impaired assets and closing costs was $0.2 million in 2008, compared to $13.6 million in 2007. The provision in 2008 included charges of $9.1 million for warehouse closing expenses, and impairment charges of $10.0 million, primarily related to a location in Michigan that was demolished and is being rebuilt. These charges were offset by $18.8 million of net gains on the sale of real property, largely former warehouse locations. 2007 vs. 2006 The net provision for impaired assets and closing costs was $13.6 million in 2007, compared to $5.5 million in 2006. In 2007, approximately $13.0 million of this provision related to the acceleration of depreciation on ten buildings that were relocated in 2008. The reserve for warehouse closing costs, classified within other current liabilities, at the end of 2008 and 2007 included: 2008 2007 Future lease obligations $ 4,505 $ 6,086 Other 24 737 Reserve for warehouse closing costs $ 4,529 $ 6,823 22 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Interest Expense 2008 2007 2006 Interest expense $ 102,636 $ 64,079 $ 12,570 2008 vs. 2007 Interest expense totaled $102.6 million in 2008 compared to $64.1 million in 2007. The increase in interest expense resulted primarily from the issuance of our $900 million of 5.3% and $1.1 billion of 5.5% Senior Notes (2007 Senior Notes) in February 2007, partially offset by lower interest expense resulting from the repayment in March 2007 of the $300 Million 5.5% Senior Notes. 2007 vs. 2006 Interest expense totaled $64.1 million in 2007 compared to $12.6 million in 2006. The increase in interest expense as compared to the prior year resulted primarily from the issuance of our 2007 Senior Notes, partially offset by lower interest expense resulting from the repayment of the $300 Million 5.5% Senior Notes in March 2007. In addition, interest expense decreased on the 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes (Zero Coupon Notes) as note holders converted approximately $61.2 million in principal amount of the Zero Coupon Notes into common stock, or $42.3 million after factoring in the related debt discount. Interest Income and Other 2008 2007 2006 Interest income $ 95,506 $ 128,413 $ 113,712 Earnings of affiliates 42,070 35,622 28,180 Minority interest and other (4,801 ) 1,449 (3,537 ) Interest Income and other $ 132,775 $ 165,484 $ 138,355 2008 vs. 2007 Interest income and other totaled $132.8 million in 2008, compared to $165.5 million in 2007. This decrease was largely due to lower interest rates, year over year, on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances. In addition, we recognized $5.0 million of other than temporary impairment losses on certain securities within our investment portfolio: $2.8 million, $1.4 million and $0.8 million in the second, third and fourth quarter, respectively of 2008. See further discussion in Liquidity and Capital Resources. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in the earnings of affiliates, primarily our investment in Costco Mexico (a 50% owned joint venture). 2007 vs. 2006 Interest income and other totaled $165.5 million in 2007, compared to $138.4 million in 2006. This increase was largely due to the increase in our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments resulting from increased earnings from operations and the proceeds of the issuance of the 2007 Senior Notes, as well as an increase in the earnings of affiliates, primarily our investment in Costco Mexico (a 50% owned joint venture). 23 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Provision for Income Taxes 2008 2007 2006 Income tax expense $ 716,249 $ 627,219 $ 648,202 Effective tax rate 35.83 % 36.68 % 37.01 % The effective income tax rate on earnings in 2008, 2007 and 2006 was 35.83%, 36.68% and 37.01%, respectively. The lower tax rate in 2008 was primarily attributable to non recurring benefits recognized during the year. Net Income 2008 2007 2006 Net income $ 1,282,725 $ 1,082,772 $ 1,103,215 Unusual items (net of tax) 119,496 Net income, as adjusted $ 1,282,725 $ 1,202,268 $ 1,103,215 Diluted earnings per share $ 2.89 $ 2.37 $ 2.30 Shares used to calculate diluted net income per common share 444,240 457,641 480,341 Diluted earnings per share increase 22 % 3 % 6 % 2008 vs. 2007 Net income for 2008 was $1.28 billion, or $2.89 per diluted share, compared to $1.08 billion, or $2.37 per diluted share, during 2007. The unusual items previously discussed totaled $119.5 million, net of tax, or $0.26 per diluted share in 2007. Exclusive of these items, earnings in 2007 were $2.63 per diluted share. Net income per diluted share in 2008 represents an increase of 10% over this adjusted amount. During 2008, we repurchased and retired 13.8 million shares of common stock, favorably impacting earnings per diluted share by approximately $0.03. 2007 vs. 2006 Net income for 2007 was $1.08 billion, or $2.37 per diluted share, compared to $1.10 billion, or $2.30 per diluted share during 2006. The unusual items previously discussed totaled $119.5 million, net of tax, or $0.26 per diluted share in 2007. Exclusive of these items, earnings for 2007 were $2.63 per diluted share, a 14% increase over the prior year. During 2007, we repurchased and retired 36.4 million shares of common stock, favorably impacting earnings per diluted share by approximately $0.03. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The following table itemizes our most liquid assets at the end of 2008 and 2007 (dollars in thousands): 2008 2007 Cash and cash equivalents $ 2,619,429 $ 2,779,733 Short term investments 655,584 575,787 Total $ 3,275,013 $ 3,355,520 24 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from warehouse operations and existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances, which were $3.28 billion and $3.36 billion at the end of 2008 and 2007, respectively. Of these balances, approximately $787.5 million and $655.2 million at the end of 2008 and 2007, respectively, represented debit and credit card receivables, primarily related to sales in the week prior to the end of the year. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $2.18 billion in 2008 compared to $2.08 billion in 2007, an increase of $99.8 million. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in net income of $200.0 million, an increase in depreciation and amortization and stock based compensation of $118.2 million, as well as an increase in cash flow from the change in operating assets, liabilities and deferred income taxes of $56.8 million, offset by an increase in net merchandise inventories (merchandise inventory less accounts payable) of $258.0 million. Net cash used in investing activities totaled $1.72 billion in 2008 compared to $655.3 million in 2007, an increase of approximately $1.06 billion. The increase in investing activities relates primarily to a decrease in cash provided by the net investment in short term investments of $534.1 million as a result of less cash needed to fund our decreased common stock repurchase activity. Additions to property and equipment related to warehouse expansion and remodel projects increased $212.9 million in 2008. Additionally, in the second quarter of 2008, $371.1 million formerly classified as cash and cash equivalents was reclassified to short term investments and other non current assets. In December 2007, one of our enhanced money fund investments, Columbia Strategic Cash Portfolio Fund (Columbia), ceased accepting cash redemption requests and changed to a floating net asset value. In light of the restricted liquidity, we elected to receive a pro rata allocation of the underlying securities in a separately managed account. We assessed the fair value of the underlying securities in this account through market quotations and review of current investment ratings, as available, coupled with the evaluation of the liquidation value of each investment and its current performance in meeting scheduled payments of principal and interest. In 2008, we recognized $5.0 million of other than temporary impairment losses related to these securities: $2.8 million, $1.4 million and $0.8 million in the second, third and fourth quarters, respectively. The losses are included in interest income and other in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. The markets relating to these investments remain uncertain, and there may be further declines in the value of these investments that may cause additional losses in future periods. At the end of 2008, the balance of the Columbia fund securities was $103.6 million on the consolidated balance sheet. Additionally, in December 2007, two other enhanced money fund investments, BlackRock Cash Strategies, LLC (BlackRock) and Merrill Lynch Capital Reserve Fund, LLC (Merrill Lynch), ceased accepting redemption requests. These two funds are being liquidated with periodic distributions and the expectation is that the funds will be completely liquidated by 2010. To date, the funds have maintained a $1.00 per unit net asset value. At the end of 2008, the combined balance of the BlackRock and Merrill Lynch funds was $125.1 million on our consolidated balance sheet and we received cash redemptions of $48.2 million from the BlackRock and Merrill Lynch funds subsequent to the end of the year and through October 14, 2008. At the end of 2008, $228.7 million remained in the Columbia, BlackRock and Merrill Lynch funds, with $160.7 million in short term investments and $68.0 million in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet, reflecting the timing of the expected distributions. 25 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) On September 18, 2008, one of our government agency money market funds, The Reserve U.S. Government Fund, announced that the proceeds from a redemption request for this fund would not be transmitted to an investor for a period of up to seven calendar days after the receipt of the redemption request. On September 22, 2008, the SEC granted a temporary order suspending shareholder redemptions as of September 17, 2008 and requiring The Reserve to create a plan to effect an orderly disposition, subject to supervision by the SEC. As of October 14, 2008, the plan to effect an orderly disposition of the U.S. Government Fund has not yet been publicly disclosed. At August 31, 2008 and October 14, 2008, we had $171.4 million and $317.2 million, respectively, invested in the fund. Although market conditions cannot be predicted, we currently do not expect to realize a loss on this fund. The latest per unit net asset value reported for the fund is $1.00. Subsequent to the end of 2008, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (Lehman) filed a petition under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. At August 31, 2008, we held $2.3 million of Lehman securities, within the Columbia portfolio, purchased by the fund manager prior to receipt of our pro rata allocation of the funds investments in December 2007. As of October 14, 2008, we do not have an estimate of the recovery value of the Lehman securities. Additionally, on September 29, 2008, one of Sigma Finance Corporations (Sigma) lenders terminated its repurchase agreements, followed by two additional lenders also terminating agreements. On September 30, 2008 Sigma received a notice of default, which is expected to cause lenders to move to seize Sigmas assets. Sigmas Board of Directors also announced they will cease trading. At August 31, 2008, we held Sigma securities with a market value of $2.2 million and a book value of $1.9 million, within the Columbia portfolio purchased by the fund manager prior to receipt of our pro rata allocation of the funds investments in December 2007. These securities were previously impaired during 2008 and $1.4 million was recorded as an other than temporary impairment. As of October 14, 2008, we do not have an estimate of the recovery value of these securities. Although future market conditions cannot be predicted, we currently do not expect future losses in our investment portfolio to be material to our consolidated financial statements or that we will experience a detriment to our overall liquidity. Net cash used in financing activities totaled $613.0 million in 2008 compared to $164.6 million in 2007. The $448.4 million increase in net cash used in financing activities primarily resulted from a net decrease in cash provided by the issuance of long term debt, net of repayments, of $1.65 billion, largely relating to the issuance of the 2007 Senior Notes. This decrease was partially offset by a reduction in the repurchase of common stock of $1.08 billion, and an increase in the net proceeds from short term borrowings of $76.7 million. Dividends In April 2008, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash dividend from $0.145 to $0.16 per share or $0.64 on an annualized basis. Our quarterly cash dividends paid in 2008 totaled $0.61 per share. In 2007, we paid quarterly cash dividends totaling $0.55 per share. 26 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Contractual Obligations Our commitments at year end to make future payments under contractual obligations were as follows, as of August 31, 2008 (amounts in thousands): Payments Due by Year Contractual obligations 2009 2010 to2011 2012 to2013 2014 andthereafter Total Purchase obligations (merchandise)(1) $ 4,163,530 $ 1,693 $ $ $ 4,165,223 Long term debt(2) 110,735 285,140 1,072,608 1,505,387 2,973,870 Operating leases(3) 139,916 277,885 247,634 1,438,390 2,103,825 Purchase obligations (property, equipment, services and other)(4) 211,311 44,406 1,206 256,923 Construction Commitments 289,730 289,730 Capital lease obligations and other(2) 6,243 6,483 495 5,655 18,876 Other(5) 15,723 4,406 2,405 6,113 28,647 Total $ 4,937,188 $ 620,013 $ 1,324,348 $ 2,955,545 $ 9,837,094 (1) Includes open merchandise purchase orders.

(5) Consists of asset retirement and deferred compensation obligations and includes $13,175 of current unrecognized tax benefits relating to uncertain tax positions, but excludes $39,699 of noncurrent unrecognized tax benefits due to uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash payments. Expansion Plans Our primary requirement for capital is the financing of land, building and equipment costs for new and remodeled warehouses. Capital is also required for initial warehouse operations and working capital. While there can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized and plans are subject to change upon further review, it is our current intention to spend approximately $1.7 billion during fiscal 2009 for real estate, construction, remodeling and equipment for warehouses and related operations. These expenditures are expected to be financed with a combination of cash provided from operations and existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. Plans for the United States and Canada during 2009 are to open approximately 24 to 28 new warehouses, inclusive of one to three relocations of existing warehouses to larger and better located facilities. We expect to continue our review of expansion plans in our international operations, including the United Kingdom and Asia, along with other international markets. 27 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Additional Equity Investments in Subsidiaries and Joint Ventures The Companys investments in the Costco Mexico joint venture and in other unconsolidated joint ventures that are less than majority owned are accounted for under the equity method. In 2006, we contributed an additional $15 million to our investment in Costco Mexico (a 50% owned joint venture), which did not impact our percentage ownership of this entity, as our joint venture partner contributed a like amount. There were no such contributions in 2008 and 2007.

For those entities with multi purpose lines, any increase in either letters of credit (standby and or commercial) issuance and or short term borrowing will result in a corresponding decrease in available credit. Financing Activities On June 16, 2008, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary entered into a ten year term loan in the amount of $27.6 million, with a variable rate of interest of Yen TIBOR (6 month) plus a 0.35% margin (1.24% at August 31, 2008) on the outstanding balance. The net proceeds were used to repay the 1.187% Promissory Notes due in July 2008 and for general corporate purposes. Interest is payable semi annually in December and June, with the first payment due in December 2008 and principal is due in June 2018. 29 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) On October 17, 2007, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued Promissory Notes through a private placement in the amount of $59.8 million, bearing interest at 2.695%. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due in October 2017. The proceeds were used to repay the 2.070% Promissory Notes due in October 2007 and for general corporate purposes. In February 2007, we issued $900 million of 5.3% Senior Notes due March 15, 2012 at a discount of $2.5 million and $1.1 billion of 5.5% Senior Notes due March 15, 2017 at a discount of $5.9 million (together, the 2007 Senior Notes). Interest on the 2007 Senior Notes is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The discount and issuance costs associated with the 2007 Senior Notes are being amortized to interest expense over the terms of those notes. At our option, we may redeem the 2007 Senior Notes at any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount of the 2007 Senior Notes to be redeemed, or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, we will be required to make an offer to purchase the 2007 Senior Notes at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase, upon certain events as defined by the terms of the 2007 Senior Notes. In April 2003, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.92% in the amount of $36.8 million, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due in April 2010. In November 2002, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.88% in the aggregate amount of $27.6 million, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due in November 2009. The U.S. Parent Company, Costco Wholesale Corporation guarantees all of the promissory notes issued by our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary. In August 1997, we sold $900.0 million principal amount at maturity Zero Coupon Notes due in August 2017. The Zero Coupon Notes were priced with a yield to maturity of 3.5%, resulting in gross proceeds to us of $449.6 million. The notes outstanding are convertible into a maximum of 1.5 million shares of Costco Common Stock shares at an initial conversion price of $22.71. Holders of the Zero Coupon Notes may require us to purchase the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of purchase) in August 2012. We may redeem, at our option, the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of redemption) any time after August 2002. As of August 31, 2008, $832.9 million in principal amount of the Zero Coupon Notes had been converted by note holders to shares of Costco Common Stock, of which $0.5 million and $61.2 million in principal were converted in 2008 and 2007, respectively, or $0.4 million and $42.3 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively, after factoring in the related debt discount. Derivatives We follow Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (as amended) (SFAS 133), in accounting for derivative and hedging activities. We use derivative and hedging arrangements only to manage what we believe to be well defined risks. Forward foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on inventory purchases and typically have very short terms. These forward contracts do not qualify for derivative hedge accounting. The aggregate notional amount of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at the end of 2008 and 2007 was $89.8 million and $75.0 million, respectively. The mark to market adjustment related to these contracts resulted in the recording of an asset of $4.6 million and a liability of $0.9 million at the end of 2008 and 2007, respectively, and $5.8 million and $0.4 million were recognized in interest income and other in the consolidated statements of income in 2008 and 2007, respectively. The majority of the forward foreign exchange contracts were entered into by our wholly owned United Kingdom subsidiary, primarily to hedge U.S. dollar merchandise inventory purchases. 30 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) We are exposed to risks in energy costs due to fluctuations in energy prices, particularly electricity, which we partially mitigate through the use of fixed price contracts with counterparties for approximately 19% of our warehouses in the U.S. and Canada, as well as certain depots and other facilities. We have also entered into variable priced contracts for the purchase of natural gas and fuel for our gas stations on an index basis. These contracts qualify for treatment as normal purchase or normal sales under SFAS 133 and require no mark to market adjustment. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements With the exception of our operating leases, we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition or consolidated financial statements. Stock Repurchase Programs In September and November of 2007, our Board of Directors approved $300.0 million and $1.0 billion, respectively, of stock repurchases, both expiring in 2010. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an additional $1.0 billion expiring in 2011, bringing total authorizations by our Board of Directors since inception of the program in 2001 to $6.80 billion. During 2008, we repurchased 13.8 million shares at an average price of $64.22 totaling approximately $886.9 million. During 2007, we repurchased 36.4 million shares of common stock, at an average price of $54.39, totaling approximately $1.98 billion. The remaining amount available to be purchased under our approved plan was approximately $2.06 billion at the end of 2008. Purchases are made from time to time as conditions warrant in the open market or in block purchases, and pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5 1. Repurchased shares are retired, in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments. We continue to review our accounting policies and evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, merchandise inventory valuation, impairment of long lived assets, warehouse closing costs, insurance/self insurance liabilities, investments and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. Revenue Recognition We generally recognize sales, net of estimated returns, at the time the member takes possession of merchandise or receives services. When we collect payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services, the amount received is generally recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed. We provide for estimated sales returns based on historical merchandise returns levels. Amounts collected from members, which under common trade practices are referred to as sales taxes, are recorded on a net basis. We evaluate the criteria of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal Versus Net as an Agent, in determining whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, when we are the primary obligor, subject to inventory risk, 31 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, influence product or service specifications, or have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded on a gross basis. If we are not the primary obligor and do not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above, we record the net amounts as commissions earned, which is reflected in net sales. Membership fee revenue represents annual membership fees paid by substantially all of our members. We account for membership fee revenue on a deferred basis, whereby revenue is recognized ratably over the one year membership period. In 2007, we performed a detailed analysis of the timing of recognition of membership fees based on each members specific renewal date, as this methodology represented an improvement over the historical method, which was based on the period in which the fee was collected. This review resulted in a $56.2 million reduction to membership fee revenue in 2007 and a corresponding increase to deferred membership fees on our consolidated balance sheet. This adjustment included both a change in method of applying an accounting principle to a preferable method and a correction for cumulative timing errors. Our Executive members qualify for a 2% reward (which can be redeemed only at Costco warehouses), up to a maximum of $500 per year, on all qualified purchases made at Costco. We account for this 2% reward as a reduction in sales, with the related liability being classified within other current liabilities. The sales reduction and corresponding liability are computed after giving effect to the estimated impact of non redemptions based on historical data. Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, as determined primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting, and are stated using the last in, first out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all other foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail inventory method of accounting and are stated using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. We believe the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. We record an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the expected annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end. The LIFO inventory adjustment in 2008 reduced ending inventory and gross margin by $32.3 million. At the end of 2007, merchandise inventories valued at LIFO approximated FIFO after considering the lower of cost or market principle. We provide for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts as a percentage of net sales. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect results of the actual physical inventory counts, which generally occur in the second and fourth quarters of the year. Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as we progress toward earning those rebates, provided they are probable and reasonably estimable. Other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of agreement, or other systematic and rational approaches. Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Warehouse Closing costs We periodically evaluate our long lived assets for indicators of impairment, such as a decision to relocate or close a warehouse location. Our judgments are based on existing market and operational conditions. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring a downward adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value. 32 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) We provide estimates for warehouse closing costs for both leased and owned locations to be closed or relocated. A considerable amount of judgment is involved in determining any impairment or our net liability, particularly related to the estimated sales price of owned locations and the potential sublease income at leased locations. These estimates are based on real estate conditions in the markets and our experience in those markets. We make assumptions about the average period of time it would take to sublease the location and the amount of potential sublease income for each leased location. We reassess our liability each quarter and adjust our liability accordingly when our estimates change. Insurance/Self Insurance Liabilities We use a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance pool, to provide for potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property damage, director and officers liability, vehicle liability and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience and evaluations of outside experts, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Investments Investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other than temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and our intent and ability to hold the investment. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the issuer, including industry and sector performance, operational and financing cash flow factors, and rating agency actions. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and or issuer conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments. Income Taxes We adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48), which sets out criteria for the use of judgment in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items, at the beginning of 2008. The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Significant judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions. The benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in our financial statements only after determining a more likely than not probability that the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge, if any, from tax authorities. When facts and circumstances change, we reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the financial statements as appropriate. 33 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Recent Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157), which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements required under other accounting pronouncements. It does not change existing guidance as to whether or not an instrument is carried at fair value. SFAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 157 1 (FSP FAS 157 1), which excludes SFAS No. 13, Accounting for Leases and certain other accounting pronouncements that address fair value measurements under SFAS 13, from the scope of SFAS 157. In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. 157 2 (FSP 157 2), which provides a one year delayed application of SFAS 157 for nonfinancial assets and liabilities, except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). We are required to adopt SFAS 157 as amended by FSP FAS 157 1 and FSP FAS 157 2 on September 1, 2008, the beginning of our fiscal 2009. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In October 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 157 3, Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset in a Market That Is Not Active (FSP 157 3), which clarifies the application of SFAS 157 when the market for a financial asset is inactive. Specifically, FSP 157 3 clarifies how (1) managements internal assumptions should be considered in measuring fair value when observable data are not present, (2) observable market information from an inactive market should be taken into account, and (3) the use of broker quotes or pricing services should be considered in assessing the relevance of observable and unobservable data to measure fair value. The guidance in FSP 157 3 is effective immediately and will apply to us upon adoption of SFAS 157. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, Including an Amendment to FASB No. 115 (SFAS 159). Under SFAS 159, entities may elect to measure specified financial instruments and warranty and insurance contracts at fair value on a contract by contract basis, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings each reporting period. The election, called the fair value option, will enable entities to achieve an offset accounting effect for changes in fair value of certain related assets and liabilities without having to apply more complex hedge accounting provisions. SFAS 159 will be effective for us September 1, 2008, the beginning of our fiscal 2009. We do not intend to elect the fair value option for any of our existing financial assets or financial liabilities; therefore, this statement is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In June 2008, the FASB issued Staff Position EITF 03 06 1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities (FSP EITF 03 06 1). FSP EITF 03 06 1 provides that unvested share based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (whether paid or unpaid) are participating securities and shall be included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two class method in SFAS No. 128, Earnings per Share. Our unvested RSUs are not eligible to receive dividends; therefore EITF 03 06 1 will not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an Amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin No 51 (SFAS 160). SFAS 160 establishes accounting and reporting standards for ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent, changes in a parents ownership of a noncontrolling interest, calculation and disclosure of the consolidated net income attributable to the parent and the noncontrolling interest, 34 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) changes in a parents ownership interest while the parent retains its controlling financial interest and fair value measurement of any retained noncontrolling equity investment. SFAS 160 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is prohibited. We must adopt these new requirements in our first quarter of fiscal 2010. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141R, Business Combinations (SFAS 141R), which establishes principles and requirements for the reporting entity in a business combination, including recognition and measurement in the financial statements of the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree. SFAS 141R applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years. We must adopt these new requirements in our first quarter of fiscal 2010. In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 133 (SFAS 161), which requires enhanced disclosures about derivative and hedging activities. This statement is effective for financial statements issued for periods beginning after November 15, 2008. Early adoption is permitted. We must provide these new disclosures no later than our second quarter of fiscal 2009. We are in the process of evaluating the impact that adoption of SFAS Nos. 141R, 160 and 161 will have on our future consolidated financial statements. Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to financial market risk resulting from changes in interest and foreign currency rates. We do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions, nor hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. Recent developments in the financial markets, however, have rendered risks less predictable, and liquidity concerns and credit risks have increased. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our money market funds, debt securities, corporate notes and bonds and enhanced money funds with effective maturities of generally three months to five years at the date of purchase. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while generating yields without significantly increasing risk. Historically, this was accomplished by investing in high investment grade securities with a minimum overall portfolio average credit rating of AA . A revised investment policy was approved in December 2007 by our Board of Directors, limiting future investments to direct U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations, repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations and U.S. Government and Government Agency Money Market funds. The investment policies of our subsidiaries have been reviewed and are consistent with our primary objective to preserve principal while generating yields without significantly leveraging risk. Our wholly owned insurance subsidiary invests in U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations, corporate notes and bonds and asset and mortgage backed securities with a minimum overall portfolio average credit rating of AA . All of our foreign subsidiaries investments are primarily in money market funds, investment grade securities, bankers acceptances, bank certificates of deposit and term deposits all denominated in their local currencies. Additionally, our Canadian subsidiary may invest a portion of their investments in 35 Table of Contents Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) U.S. dollar investment grade securities and bank term deposits to meet current U.S. dollar obligations. All of the investment policies of the Company and subsidiaries are reviewed at least annually. As the majority of these investments in cash and cash equivalents are of a short term nature, if interest rates were to increase or decrease, there is no material risk of a material valuation adjustment related to these instruments. Based on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances at the end of 2008, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $17.9 million (pre tax) to interest income on an annual basis. For those investments that are classified as available for sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in market volatility and interest rates are reflected within stockholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive income. The nature and amount of our long and short term debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As of the end of 2008, our fixed rate long term debt included: $67.1 million principal amount at maturity of 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes carried at $49.1 million; $900.0 million of 5.3% Senior Notes carried at $898.3 million; and $1.10 billion of 5.5% Senior Notes carried at $1.09 billion and additional notes and capital lease obligations totaling $142.0 million. Additionally, our variable rate long term debt included a 0.35% over Yen Tibor (6 month) Term Loan of $27.6 million. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt and may affect the interest expense related to the variable rate debt. Most transactions of our foreign subsidiaries are conducted in local currencies, limiting our exposure to changes in currency rates. The majority of the forward foreign exchange contracts were entered into by our wholly owned United Kingdom subsidiary, primarily to hedge U.S. dollar merchandise inventory purchases. We periodically enter into short term forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates on inventory purchases. The notional value of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at the end of 2008 was $89.8 million. 
 
Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Most of the comparable sales growth was derived from increased amounts spent by members, with a smaller contribution from increases in shopping frequency. Gasoline sales positively impacted comparable warehouse sales growth by approximately $1.94 billion. Comparable warehouse sales growth excluding gasoline would have been lower by approximately 267 basis points. Significantly stronger foreign currencies, particularly in Canada, positively impacted comparable sales by approximately $1.07 billion, or 170 basis points. Reported comparable sales growth includes the negative impact of cannibalization (established warehouses losing sales to our newly opened locations). While overall sales in 2008 were not materially affected by general economic conditions, we believe that those conditions have constrained and will continue to constrain the growth of spending by our members on hardlines and softlines relative to food and sundries. In addition, risks related to general economic conditions, including those arising from price increases due to rising fuel and commodity costs and other factors, will continue to impact overall consumer spending, although due to the nature of our business model we believe we are better positioned than many retailers to compete in such an environment. 2007 vs. 2006 Net sales increased by $4.13 billion, or 7.0% to $63.09 billion in 2007 (a 52 week year), from $58.96 billion in 2006 (a 53 week year). The $4.13 billion increase in net sales is comprised of $2.10 billion from the increase in comparable warehouse sales and $2.03 billion primarily from sales at new warehouses opened during 2007 and 2006, partially offset by the change in the reserve for estimated sales returns. Changes in prices of merchandise did not materially affect the sales increase. Gasoline sales contributed to the $4.13 billion net sales growth by approximately $356.1 million, with approximately $17.8 million related to the increase in gasoline sales prices. Most of the comparable sales growth was derived from increased amounts spent by members, with a smaller contribution from increases in shopping frequency. Gasoline sales did not have a material impact on comparable warehouse sales growth. Significantly stronger foreign currencies positively impacted comparable sales by approximately $418.4 million, or 72 basis points. Reported comparable sales growth includes the negative impact of cannibalization (established warehouses losing sales to our newly opened locations). In the fourth quarter of 2007, the decrease in our estimated sales returns reserve resulted in an increase to net sales of $57.9 million as compared to the fourth quarter of 2006 where our reserve was increased, resulting in a decrease to net sales of $33.1 million. This improvement is primarily a result of the changes to our consumer electronics returns policy implemented in the spring of 2007. Membership Fees 2008 2007 2006 Membership fees $ 1,505,536 $ 1,312,554 $ 1,188,047 Adjustment to deferred membership balance 56,183 Membership fees, as adjusted $ 1,505,536 $ 1,368,737 $ 1,188,047 Membership fees increase 14.7 % 10.5 % 10.7 % Membership fees increase, as adjusted 10.0 % 15.2 % 10.7 % Membership fees as a percent of net sales 2.12 % 2.08 % 2.02 % Adjusted membership fees, as a percent of adjusted net sales 2.12 % 2.16 % 2.02 % Total cardholders 53,500 50,400 47,700 19 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) 2008 vs. 2007 Membership fees increased 14.7% to $1.51 billion, or 2.12% of net sales in 2008, from $1.31 billion, or 2.08% of net sales in 2007. Excluding the adjustment to deferred membership fees in 2007, adjusted membership fees increased 10.0% from 2007. The increase was primarily due to: new membership sign ups at the 24 new warehouses opened (34 opened and 10 closed due to relocations); increased penetration of the higher fee Executive Membership program; and the five dollar increase in our annual membership fee in the second half of 2006 for non Executive members. Our member renewal rate, currently at 87%, is consistent with recent years. 2007 vs. 2006 Membership fees increased 10.5% to $1.31 billion, or 2.08% of net sales in 2007 from $1.19 billion, or 2.02% of net sales in 2006. Excluding the adjustment to deferred membership fees in 2007, adjusted membership fees increased 15.2% from 2006. This increase was primarily due to: a five dollar increase in our annual membership fee for our U.S. and Canada Gold Star (individual), Business and Business Add on members, which was effective May 1, 2006 for new members and July 1, 2006 for existing members; increased penetration of the higher fee Executive Membership program; and additional membership sign ups at the 30 new warehouses opened in 2007. Gross Margin 2008 2007 2006 Gross margin $ 7,474,734 $ 6,637,899 $ 6,217,683 Unusual items 85,759 Gross margin, as adjusted $ 7,474,734 $ 6,723,658 $ 6,217,683 Gross margin increase 12.6 % 6.8 % 12.4 % Gross margin increase, as adjusted 11.2 % 8.1 % 12.4 % Gross margin as a percent of net sales 10.53 % 10.52 % 10.55 % Adjusted gross margin as a percent of adjusted net sales 10.53 % 10.58 % 10.55 % 2008 vs. 2007 Gross margin was $7.47 billion, or 10.53% of net sales in 2008, compared to $6.64 billion, or 10.52% of net sales in 2007. Excluding the unusual items affecting net sales and gross margin in 2007, adjusted gross margin as a percent of adjusted net sales decreased five basis points in 2008 as compared to 2007. This decrease was largely due to a net 12 basis point decrease in our warehouse ancillary businesses, particularly in one hour photo, tire shop and food services, partially offset by an increase in our gasoline business; a $32.3 million, or five basis point LIFO charge, resulting from price increases in certain food items and gasoline; and a three basis point decrease resulting from the increased penetration of the Executive Membership two percent reward program and increased spending by Executive members. These decreases were partially offset by a net 15 basis point increase from our merchandise departments, particularly fresh foods, food and sundries, Costco Online and our international operations, partially offset by a decrease in softlines. Weve experienced price increases from our suppliers at an increased rate, which may continue. Those increases generally are reflected in our selling prices, but to the extent they are not or are delayed, our gross margins will be adversely affected. 20 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) 2007 vs. 2006 Gross margin was $6.64 billion, or 10.52% of net sales in 2007, compared to $6.22 billion, or 10.55% of net sales in 2006. Excluding the unusual items affecting net sales and gross margin in 2007, adjusted gross margin as a percentage of adjusted net sales was 10.58%, or an increase of three basis points as compared to 2006. This increase was primarily due to a 24 basis point increase in certain merchandise departments, largely food and sundries, as well as smaller increases in certain warehouse ancillary businesses, costco.com and our international operations, offset by a decrease in our hardlines and softlines categories of approximately 15 basis points. In addition, increased penetration of the Executive Membership two percent reward program and increased spending by Executive members negatively affected gross margin by six basis points. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 2008 2007 2006 Selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) $ 6,953,804 $ 6,273,096 $ 5,732,141 Unusual items (46,815 ) SG&A, as adjusted $ 6,953,804 $ 6,226,281 $ 5,732,141 SG&A as a percent of net sales 9.80 % 9.94 % 9.72 % Adjusted SG&A as percent of adjusted net sales 9.80 % 9.80 % 9.72 % 2008 vs. 2007 SG&A totaled $6.95 billion, or 9.80% of net sales in 2008, compared to $6.27 billion, or 9.94% of net sales in 2007. Excluding the unusual items affecting net sales and SG&A expenses in 2007, adjusted SG&A as a percentage of adjusted net sales was 9.80% in 2007. Warehouse operating and central administrative costs positively impacted adjusted SG&A comparisons, on a net basis, by approximately seven basis points, primarily due to decreased payroll and benefits costs as a percent of adjusted net sales. Stock based compensation expense negatively impacted adjusted SG&A comparisons by three basis points, primarily due to a higher closing stock price on the date that our October 2007 RSU grant was valued as compared to previous grants. Additionally, we recorded a $15.9 million reserve in connection with a litigation settlement and accrued approximately $9 million for compensation adjustments we made to employees enrolled in our medical and dental plans related to a decision to share a portion of the health plans savings that we achieved. These two items negatively impacted adjusted SG&A comparisons by four basis points. 2007 vs. 2006 SG&A totaled $6.27 billion, or 9.94% of net sales in 2007, compared to $5.73 billion, or 9.72% of net sales in 2006. Excluding the unusual items affecting net sales and SG&A expenses in 2007, adjusted SG&A as a percentage of adjusted net sales was 9.80%, an increase of eight basis points. Of this increase, three basis points were primarily due to an increase in stock based compensation, and a net five basis points were due to an increase in warehouse payroll and benefits costs. The payroll increase was largely attributed to hourly rate increases that went into effect in March 2007 and a lower overall comparable warehouse sales increase. 21 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Preopening Expenses 2008 2007 2006 Preopening expenses $ 57,383 $ 55,163 $ 42,504 Warehouse openings 34 30 28 Relocations (10 ) (3 ) Warehouse openings, net of relocations 24 30 25 Preopening expenses include costs incurred for startup operations related to new warehouses and the expansion of ancillary operations at existing warehouses. Preopening expenses can vary due to the timing of the opening relative to our year end, whether the warehouse is owned or leased, whether the opening is in an existing, new or international market, as well as the number and magnitude of warehouse remodel projects. Provision for Impaired Assets and Closing Costs, Net 2008 2007 2006 Warehouse closing expenses $ 9,091 $ 15,887 $ 3,762 Impairment of long lived assets 9,972 Net (gains) / losses on the sale of real property (18,815 ) (2,279 ) 1,691 Provision for impaired assets & closing costs, net $ 248 $ 13,608 $ 5,453 The provision primarily includes costs related to impairment of long lived assets, future lease obligations of warehouses that have been relocated to new facilities, accelerated depreciation on buildings to be demolished or sold and that are not otherwise impaired, and gains or losses resulting from the sale of real property, largely comprised of former warehouse locations. 2008 vs. 2007 The net provision for impaired assets and closing costs was $0.2 million in 2008, compared to $13.6 million in 2007. The provision in 2008 included charges of $9.1 million for warehouse closing expenses, and impairment charges of $10.0 million, primarily related to a location in Michigan that was demolished and is being rebuilt. These charges were offset by $18.8 million of net gains on the sale of real property, largely former warehouse locations. 2007 vs. 2006 The net provision for impaired assets and closing costs was $13.6 million in 2007, compared to $5.5 million in 2006. In 2007, approximately $13.0 million of this provision related to the acceleration of depreciation on ten buildings that were relocated in 2008. The reserve for warehouse closing costs, classified within other current liabilities, at the end of 2008 and 2007 included: 2008 2007 Future lease obligations $ 4,505 $ 6,086 Other 24 737 Reserve for warehouse closing costs $ 4,529 $ 6,823 22 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Interest Expense 2008 2007 2006 Interest expense $ 102,636 $ 64,079 $ 12,570 2008 vs. 2007 Interest expense totaled $102.6 million in 2008 compared to $64.1 million in 2007. The increase in interest expense resulted primarily from the issuance of our $900 million of 5.3% and $1.1 billion of 5.5% Senior Notes (2007 Senior Notes) in February 2007, partially offset by lower interest expense resulting from the repayment in March 2007 of the $300 Million 5.5% Senior Notes. 2007 vs. 2006 Interest expense totaled $64.1 million in 2007 compared to $12.6 million in 2006. The increase in interest expense as compared to the prior year resulted primarily from the issuance of our 2007 Senior Notes, partially offset by lower interest expense resulting from the repayment of the $300 Million 5.5% Senior Notes in March 2007. In addition, interest expense decreased on the 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes (Zero Coupon Notes) as note holders converted approximately $61.2 million in principal amount of the Zero Coupon Notes into common stock, or $42.3 million after factoring in the related debt discount. Interest Income and Other 2008 2007 2006 Interest income $ 95,506 $ 128,413 $ 113,712 Earnings of affiliates 42,070 35,622 28,180 Minority interest and other (4,801 ) 1,449 (3,537 ) Interest Income and other $ 132,775 $ 165,484 $ 138,355 2008 vs. 2007 Interest income and other totaled $132.8 million in 2008, compared to $165.5 million in 2007. This decrease was largely due to lower interest rates, year over year, on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances. In addition, we recognized $5.0 million of other than temporary impairment losses on certain securities within our investment portfolio: $2.8 million, $1.4 million and $0.8 million in the second, third and fourth quarter, respectively of 2008. See further discussion in Liquidity and Capital Resources. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in the earnings of affiliates, primarily our investment in Costco Mexico (a 50% owned joint venture). 2007 vs. 2006 Interest income and other totaled $165.5 million in 2007, compared to $138.4 million in 2006. This increase was largely due to the increase in our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments resulting from increased earnings from operations and the proceeds of the issuance of the 2007 Senior Notes, as well as an increase in the earnings of affiliates, primarily our investment in Costco Mexico (a 50% owned joint venture). 23 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Provision for Income Taxes 2008 2007 2006 Income tax expense $ 716,249 $ 627,219 $ 648,202 Effective tax rate 35.83 % 36.68 % 37.01 % The effective income tax rate on earnings in 2008, 2007 and 2006 was 35.83%, 36.68% and 37.01%, respectively. The lower tax rate in 2008 was primarily attributable to non recurring benefits recognized during the year.

The unusual items previously discussed totaled $119.5 million, net of tax, or $0.26 per diluted share in 2007. Exclusive of these items, earnings in 2007 were $2.63 per diluted share. Net income per diluted share in 2008 represents an increase of 10% over this adjusted amount. During 2008, we repurchased and retired 13.8 million shares of common stock, favorably impacting earnings per diluted share by approximately $0.03. 2007 vs. 2006 Net income for 2007 was $1.08 billion, or $2.37 per diluted share, compared to $1.10 billion, or $2.30 per diluted share during 2006. The unusual items previously discussed totaled $119.5 million, net of tax, or $0.26 per diluted share in 2007. Exclusive of these items, earnings for 2007 were $2.63 per diluted share, a 14% increase over the prior year. During 2007, we repurchased and retired 36.4 million shares of common stock, favorably impacting earnings per diluted share by approximately $0.03. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The following table itemizes our most liquid assets at the end of 2008 and 2007 (dollars in thousands): 2008 2007 Cash and cash equivalents $ 2,619,429 $ 2,779,733 Short term investments 655,584 575,787 Total $ 3,275,013 $ 3,355,520 24 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from warehouse operations and existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances, which were $3.28 billion and $3.36 billion at the end of 2008 and 2007, respectively. Of these balances, approximately $787.5 million and $655.2 million at the end of 2008 and 2007, respectively, represented debit and credit card receivables, primarily related to sales in the week prior to the end of the year. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $2.18 billion in 2008 compared to $2.08 billion in 2007, an increase of $99.8 million. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in net income of $200.0 million, an increase in depreciation and amortization and stock based compensation of $118.2 million, as well as an increase in cash flow from the change in operating assets, liabilities and deferred income taxes of $56.8 million, offset by an increase in net merchandise inventories (merchandise inventory less accounts payable) of $258.0 million. Net cash used in investing activities totaled $1.72 billion in 2008 compared to $655.3 million in 2007, an increase of approximately $1.06 billion. The increase in investing activities relates primarily to a decrease in cash provided by the net investment in short term investments of $534.1 million as a result of less cash needed to fund our decreased common stock repurchase activity. Additions to property and equipment related to warehouse expansion and remodel projects increased $212.9 million in 2008. Additionally, in the second quarter of 2008, $371.1 million formerly classified as cash and cash equivalents was reclassified to short term investments and other non current assets. In December 2007, one of our enhanced money fund investments, Columbia Strategic Cash Portfolio Fund (Columbia), ceased accepting cash redemption requests and changed to a floating net asset value. In light of the restricted liquidity, we elected to receive a pro rata allocation of the underlying securities in a separately managed account. We assessed the fair value of the underlying securities in this account through market quotations and review of current investment ratings, as available, coupled with the evaluation of the liquidation value of each investment and its current performance in meeting scheduled payments of principal and interest. In 2008, we recognized $5.0 million of other than temporary impairment losses related to these securities: $2.8 million, $1.4 million and $0.8 million in the second, third and fourth quarters, respectively. The losses are included in interest income and other in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. The markets relating to these investments remain uncertain, and there may be further declines in the value of these investments that may cause additional losses in future periods. At the end of 2008, the balance of the Columbia fund securities was $103.6 million on the consolidated balance sheet. Additionally, in December 2007, two other enhanced money fund investments, BlackRock Cash Strategies, LLC (BlackRock) and Merrill Lynch Capital Reserve Fund, LLC (Merrill Lynch), ceased accepting redemption requests. These two funds are being liquidated with periodic distributions and the expectation is that the funds will be completely liquidated by 2010. To date, the funds have maintained a $1.00 per unit net asset value. At the end of 2008, the combined balance of the BlackRock and Merrill Lynch funds was $125.1 million on our consolidated balance sheet and we received cash redemptions of $48.2 million from the BlackRock and Merrill Lynch funds subsequent to the end of the year and through October 14, 2008. At the end of 2008, $228.7 million remained in the Columbia, BlackRock and Merrill Lynch funds, with $160.7 million in short term investments and $68.0 million in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet, reflecting the timing of the expected distributions. 25 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) On September 18, 2008, one of our government agency money market funds, The Reserve U.S. Government Fund, announced that the proceeds from a redemption request for this fund would not be transmitted to an investor for a period of up to seven calendar days after the receipt of the redemption request. On September 22, 2008, the SEC granted a temporary order suspending shareholder redemptions as of September 17, 2008 and requiring The Reserve to create a plan to effect an orderly disposition, subject to supervision by the SEC. As of October 14, 2008, the plan to effect an orderly disposition of the U.S. Government Fund has not yet been publicly disclosed. At August 31, 2008 and October 14, 2008, we had $171.4 million and $317.2 million, respectively, invested in the fund. Although market conditions cannot be predicted, we currently do not expect to realize a loss on this fund. The latest per unit net asset value reported for the fund is $1.00. Subsequent to the end of 2008, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (Lehman) filed a petition under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. At August 31, 2008, we held $2.3 million of Lehman securities, within the Columbia portfolio, purchased by the fund manager prior to receipt of our pro rata allocation of the funds investments in December 2007. As of October 14, 2008, we do not have an estimate of the recovery value of the Lehman securities. Additionally, on September 29, 2008, one of Sigma Finance Corporations (Sigma) lenders terminated its repurchase agreements, followed by two additional lenders also terminating agreements. On September 30, 2008 Sigma received a notice of default, which is expected to cause lenders to move to seize Sigmas assets. Sigmas Board of Directors also announced they will cease trading. At August 31, 2008, we held Sigma securities with a market value of $2.2 million and a book value of $1.9 million, within the Columbia portfolio purchased by the fund manager prior to receipt of our pro rata allocation of the funds investments in December 2007. These securities were previously impaired during 2008 and $1.4 million was recorded as an other than temporary impairment. As of October 14, 2008, we do not have an estimate of the recovery value of these securities. Although future market conditions cannot be predicted, we currently do not expect future losses in our investment portfolio to be material to our consolidated financial statements or that we will experience a detriment to our overall liquidity. Net cash used in financing activities totaled $613.0 million in 2008 compared to $164.6 million in 2007. The $448.4 million increase in net cash used in financing activities primarily resulted from a net decrease in cash provided by the issuance of long term debt, net of repayments, of $1.65 billion, largely relating to the issuance of the 2007 Senior Notes. This decrease was partially offset by a reduction in the repurchase of common stock of $1.08 billion, and an increase in the net proceeds from short term borrowings of $76.7 million. Dividends In April 2008, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash dividend from $0.145 to $0.16 per share or $0.64 on an annualized basis. Our quarterly cash dividends paid in 2008 totaled $0.61 per share. In 2007, we paid quarterly cash dividends totaling $0.55 per share. 26 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Contractual Obligations Our commitments at year end to make future payments under contractual obligations were as follows, as of August 31, 2008 (amounts in thousands): Payments Due by Year Contractual obligations 2009 2010 to2011 2012 to2013 2014 andthereafter Total Purchase obligations (merchandise)(1) $ 4,163,530 $ 1,693 $ $ $ 4,165,223 Long term debt(2) 110,735 285,140 1,072,608 1,505,387 2,973,870 Operating leases(3) 139,916 277,885 247,634 1,438,390 2,103,825 Purchase obligations (property, equipment, services and other)(4) 211,311 44,406 1,206 256,923 Construction Commitments 289,730 289,730 Capital lease obligations and other(2) 6,243 6,483 495 5,655 18,876 Other(5) 15,723 4,406 2,405 6,113 28,647 Total $ 4,937,188 $ 620,013 $ 1,324,348 $ 2,955,545 $ 9,837,094 (1) Includes open merchandise purchase orders. (2) Includes contractual interest payments. (3) Operating lease obligations exclude amounts commonly referred to as common area maintenance, taxes and insurance and have been reduced by $149,468 to reflect sub lease income. (4) The amounts exclude certain services negotiated at the individual warehouse or regional level that are not significant and generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty. (5) Consists of asset retirement and deferred compensation obligations and includes $13,175 of current unrecognized tax benefits relating to uncertain tax positions, but excludes $39,699 of noncurrent unrecognized tax benefits due to uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash payments. Expansion Plans Our primary requirement for capital is the financing of land, building and equipment costs for new and remodeled warehouses. Capital is also required for initial warehouse operations and working capital. While there can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized and plans are subject to change upon further review, it is our current intention to spend approximately $1.7 billion during fiscal 2009 for real estate, construction, remodeling and equipment for warehouses and related operations. These expenditures are expected to be financed with a combination of cash provided from operations and existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. Plans for the United States and Canada during 2009 are to open approximately 24 to 28 new warehouses, inclusive of one to three relocations of existing warehouses to larger and better located facilities. We expect to continue our review of expansion plans in our international operations, including the United Kingdom and Asia, along with other international markets. 27 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Additional Equity Investments in Subsidiaries and Joint Ventures The Companys investments in the Costco Mexico joint venture and in other unconsolidated joint ventures that are less than majority owned are accounted for under the equity method. In 2006, we contributed an additional $15 million to our investment in Costco Mexico (a 50% owned joint venture), which did not impact our percentage ownership of this entity, as our joint venture partner contributed a like amount. There were no such contributions in 2008 and 2007.

For those entities with multi purpose lines, any increase in either letters of credit (standby and or commercial) issuance and or short term borrowing will result in a corresponding decrease in available credit. Financing Activities On June 16, 2008, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary entered into a ten year term loan in the amount of $27.6 million, with a variable rate of interest of Yen TIBOR (6 month) plus a 0.35% margin (1.24% at August 31, 2008) on the outstanding balance. The net proceeds were used to repay the 1.187% Promissory Notes due in July 2008 and for general corporate purposes. Interest is payable semi annually in December and June, with the first payment due in December 2008 and principal is due in June 2018. 29 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) On October 17, 2007, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued Promissory Notes through a private placement in the amount of $59.8 million, bearing interest at 2.695%. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due in October 2017. The proceeds were used to repay the 2.070% Promissory Notes due in October 2007 and for general corporate purposes. In February 2007, we issued $900 million of 5.3% Senior Notes due March 15, 2012 at a discount of $2.5 million and $1.1 billion of 5.5% Senior Notes due March 15, 2017 at a discount of $5.9 million (together, the 2007 Senior Notes). Interest on the 2007 Senior Notes is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The discount and issuance costs associated with the 2007 Senior Notes are being amortized to interest expense over the terms of those notes. At our option, we may redeem the 2007 Senior Notes at any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount of the 2007 Senior Notes to be redeemed, or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, we will be required to make an offer to purchase the 2007 Senior Notes at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase, upon certain events as defined by the terms of the 2007 Senior Notes. In April 2003, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.92% in the amount of $36.8 million, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due in April 2010. In November 2002, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.88% in the aggregate amount of $27.6 million, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due in November 2009. The U.S. Parent Company, Costco Wholesale Corporation guarantees all of the promissory notes issued by our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary. In August 1997, we sold $900.0 million principal amount at maturity Zero Coupon Notes due in August 2017. The Zero Coupon Notes were priced with a yield to maturity of 3.5%, resulting in gross proceeds to us of $449.6 million. The notes outstanding are convertible into a maximum of 1.5 million shares of Costco Common Stock shares at an initial conversion price of $22.71. Holders of the Zero Coupon Notes may require us to purchase the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of purchase) in August 2012. We may redeem, at our option, the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of redemption) any time after August 2002. As of August 31, 2008, $832.9 million in principal amount of the Zero Coupon Notes had been converted by note holders to shares of Costco Common Stock, of which $0.5 million and $61.2 million in principal were converted in 2008 and 2007, respectively, or $0.4 million and $42.3 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively, after factoring in the related debt discount. Derivatives We follow Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (as amended) (SFAS 133), in accounting for derivative and hedging activities. We use derivative and hedging arrangements only to manage what we believe to be well defined risks. Forward foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on inventory purchases and typically have very short terms. These forward contracts do not qualify for derivative hedge accounting. The aggregate notional amount of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at the end of 2008 and 2007 was $89.8 million and $75.0 million, respectively. The mark to market adjustment related to these contracts resulted in the recording of an asset of $4.6 million and a liability of $0.9 million at the end of 2008 and 2007, respectively, and $5.8 million and $0.4 million were recognized in interest income and other in the consolidated statements of income in 2008 and 2007, respectively. The majority of the forward foreign exchange contracts were entered into by our wholly owned United Kingdom subsidiary, primarily to hedge U.S. dollar merchandise inventory purchases. 30 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) We are exposed to risks in energy costs due to fluctuations in energy prices, particularly electricity, which we partially mitigate through the use of fixed price contracts with counterparties for approximately 19% of our warehouses in the U.S. and Canada, as well as certain depots and other facilities. We have also entered into variable priced contracts for the purchase of natural gas and fuel for our gas stations on an index basis. These contracts qualify for treatment as normal purchase or normal sales under SFAS 133 and require no mark to market adjustment. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements With the exception of our operating leases, we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition or consolidated financial statements. Stock Repurchase Programs In September and November of 2007, our Board of Directors approved $300.0 million and $1.0 billion, respectively, of stock repurchases, both expiring in 2010. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an additional $1.0 billion expiring in 2011, bringing total authorizations by our Board of Directors since inception of the program in 2001 to $6.80 billion. During 2008, we repurchased 13.8 million shares at an average price of $64.22 totaling approximately $886.9 million. During 2007, we repurchased 36.4 million shares of common stock, at an average price of $54.39, totaling approximately $1.98 billion. The remaining amount available to be purchased under our approved plan was approximately $2.06 billion at the end of 2008. Purchases are made from time to time as conditions warrant in the open market or in block purchases, and pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5 1. Repurchased shares are retired, in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments. We continue to review our accounting policies and evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, merchandise inventory valuation, impairment of long lived assets, warehouse closing costs, insurance/self insurance liabilities, investments and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. Revenue Recognition We generally recognize sales, net of estimated returns, at the time the member takes possession of merchandise or receives services. When we collect payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services, the amount received is generally recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed. We provide for estimated sales returns based on historical merchandise returns levels. Amounts collected from members, which under common trade practices are referred to as sales taxes, are recorded on a net basis. We evaluate the criteria of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal Versus Net as an Agent, in determining whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, when we are the primary obligor, subject to inventory risk, 31 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, influence product or service specifications, or have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded on a gross basis. If we are not the primary obligor and do not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above, we record the net amounts as commissions earned, which is reflected in net sales. Membership fee revenue represents annual membership fees paid by substantially all of our members. We account for membership fee revenue on a deferred basis, whereby revenue is recognized ratably over the one year membership period. In 2007, we performed a detailed analysis of the timing of recognition of membership fees based on each members specific renewal date, as this methodology represented an improvement over the historical method, which was based on the period in which the fee was collected. This review resulted in a $56.2 million reduction to membership fee revenue in 2007 and a corresponding increase to deferred membership fees on our consolidated balance sheet. This adjustment included both a change in method of applying an accounting principle to a preferable method and a correction for cumulative timing errors. Our Executive members qualify for a 2% reward (which can be redeemed only at Costco warehouses), up to a maximum of $500 per year, on all qualified purchases made at Costco. We account for this 2% reward as a reduction in sales, with the related liability being classified within other current liabilities. The sales reduction and corresponding liability are computed after giving effect to the estimated impact of non redemptions based on historical data. Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, as determined primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting, and are stated using the last in, first out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all other foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail inventory method of accounting and are stated using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. We believe the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. We record an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the expected annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end. The LIFO inventory adjustment in 2008 reduced ending inventory and gross margin by $32.3 million. At the end of 2007, merchandise inventories valued at LIFO approximated FIFO after considering the lower of cost or market principle. We provide for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts as a percentage of net sales. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect results of the actual physical inventory counts, which generally occur in the second and fourth quarters of the year. Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as we progress toward earning those rebates, provided they are probable and reasonably estimable. Other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of agreement, or other systematic and rational approaches. Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Warehouse Closing costs We periodically evaluate our long lived assets for indicators of impairment, such as a decision to relocate or close a warehouse location. Our judgments are based on existing market and operational conditions. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring a downward adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value. 32 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) We provide estimates for warehouse closing costs for both leased and owned locations to be closed or relocated. A considerable amount of judgment is involved in determining any impairment or our net liability, particularly related to the estimated sales price of owned locations and the potential sublease income at leased locations. These estimates are based on real estate conditions in the markets and our experience in those markets. We make assumptions about the average period of time it would take to sublease the location and the amount of potential sublease income for each leased location. We reassess our liability each quarter and adjust our liability accordingly when our estimates change. Insurance/Self Insurance Liabilities We use a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance pool, to provide for potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property damage, director and officers liability, vehicle liability and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience and evaluations of outside experts, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Investments Investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other than temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and our intent and ability to hold the investment. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the issuer, including industry and sector performance, operational and financing cash flow factors, and rating agency actions. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and or issuer conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments. Income Taxes We adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48), which sets out criteria for the use of judgment in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items, at the beginning of 2008. The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Significant judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions. The benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in our financial statements only after determining a more likely than not probability that the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge, if any, from tax authorities. When facts and circumstances change, we reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the financial statements as appropriate. 33 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Recent Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157), which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements required under other accounting pronouncements. It does not change existing guidance as to whether or not an instrument is carried at fair value. SFAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 157 1 (FSP FAS 157 1), which excludes SFAS No. 13, Accounting for Leases and certain other accounting pronouncements that address fair value measurements under SFAS 13, from the scope of SFAS 157. In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. 157 2 (FSP 157 2), which provides a one year delayed application of SFAS 157 for nonfinancial assets and liabilities, except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). We are required to adopt SFAS 157 as amended by FSP FAS 157 1 and FSP FAS 157 2 on September 1, 2008, the beginning of our fiscal 2009. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In October 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 157 3, Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset in a Market That Is Not Active (FSP 157 3), which clarifies the application of SFAS 157 when the market for a financial asset is inactive. Specifically, FSP 157 3 clarifies how (1) managements internal assumptions should be considered in measuring fair value when observable data are not present, (2) observable market information from an inactive market should be taken into account, and (3) the use of broker quotes or pricing services should be considered in assessing the relevance of observable and unobservable data to measure fair value. The guidance in FSP 157 3 is effective immediately and will apply to us upon adoption of SFAS 157. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, Including an Amendment to FASB No. 115 (SFAS 159). Under SFAS 159, entities may elect to measure specified financial instruments and warranty and insurance contracts at fair value on a contract by contract basis, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings each reporting period. The election, called the fair value option, will enable entities to achieve an offset accounting effect for changes in fair value of certain related assets and liabilities without having to apply more complex hedge accounting provisions. SFAS 159 will be effective for us September 1, 2008, the beginning of our fiscal 2009. We do not intend to elect the fair value option for any of our existing financial assets or financial liabilities; therefore, this statement is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In June 2008, the FASB issued Staff Position EITF 03 06 1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities (FSP EITF 03 06 1). FSP EITF 03 06 1 provides that unvested share based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (whether paid or unpaid) are participating securities and shall be included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two class method in SFAS No. 128, Earnings per Share. Our unvested RSUs are not eligible to receive dividends; therefore EITF 03 06 1 will not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an Amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin No 51 (SFAS 160). SFAS 160 establishes accounting and reporting standards for ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent, changes in a parents ownership of a noncontrolling interest, calculation and disclosure of the consolidated net income attributable to the parent and the noncontrolling interest, 34 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) changes in a parents ownership interest while the parent retains its controlling financial interest and fair value measurement of any retained noncontrolling equity investment. SFAS 160 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is prohibited. We must adopt these new requirements in our first quarter of fiscal 2010. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141R, Business Combinations (SFAS 141R), which establishes principles and requirements for the reporting entity in a business combination, including recognition and measurement in the financial statements of the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree. SFAS 141R applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years. We must adopt these new requirements in our first quarter of fiscal 2010. In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 133 (SFAS 161), which requires enhanced disclosures about derivative and hedging activities. This statement is effective for financial statements issued for periods beginning after November 15, 2008. Early adoption is permitted. We must provide these new disclosures no later than our second quarter of fiscal 2009. We are in the process of evaluating the impact that adoption of SFAS Nos. 141R, 160 and 161 will have on our future consolidated financial statements. Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to financial market risk resulting from changes in interest and foreign currency rates. We do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions, nor hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. Recent developments in the financial markets, however, have rendered risks less predictable, and liquidity concerns and credit risks have increased. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our money market funds, debt securities, corporate notes and bonds and enhanced money funds with effective maturities of generally three months to five years at the date of purchase. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while generating yields without significantly increasing risk. Historically, this was accomplished by investing in high investment grade securities with a minimum overall portfolio average credit rating of AA . A revised investment policy was approved in December 2007 by our Board of Directors, limiting future investments to direct U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations, repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations and U.S. Government and Government Agency Money Market funds. The investment policies of our subsidiaries have been reviewed and are consistent with our primary objective to preserve principal while generating yields without significantly leveraging risk. Our wholly owned insurance subsidiary invests in U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations, corporate notes and bonds and asset and mortgage backed securities with a minimum overall portfolio average credit rating of AA . All of our foreign subsidiaries investments are primarily in money market funds, investment grade securities, bankers acceptances, bank certificates of deposit and term deposits all denominated in their local currencies. Additionally, our Canadian subsidiary may invest a portion of their investments in 35 Table of Contents Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) U.S. dollar investment grade securities and bank term deposits to meet current U.S. dollar obligations. All of the investment policies of the Company and subsidiaries are reviewed at least annually. As the majority of these investments in cash and cash equivalents are of a short term nature, if interest rates were to increase or decrease, there is no material risk of a material valuation adjustment related to these instruments. Based on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances at the end of 2008, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $17.9 million (pre tax) to interest income on an annual basis. For those investments that are classified as available for sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in market volatility and interest rates are reflected within stockholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive income. The nature and amount of our long and short term debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As of the end of 2008, our fixed rate long term debt included: $67.1 million principal amount at maturity of 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes carried at $49.1 million; $900.0 million of 5.3% Senior Notes carried at $898.3 million; and $1.10 billion of 5.5% Senior Notes carried at $1.09 billion and additional notes and capital lease obligations totaling $142.0 million. Additionally, our variable rate long term debt included a 0.35% over Yen Tibor (6 month) Term Loan of $27.6 million. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt and may affect the interest expense related to the variable rate debt. Most transactions of our foreign subsidiaries are conducted in local currencies, limiting our exposure to changes in currency rates. The majority of the forward foreign exchange contracts were entered into by our wholly owned United Kingdom subsidiary, primarily to hedge U.S. dollar merchandise inventory purchases. We periodically enter into short term forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates on inventory purchases. The notional value of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at the end of 2008 was $89.8 million. 
 
Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) 2008 vs. 2007 Membership fees increased 14.7% to $1.51 billion, or 2.12% of net sales in 2008, from $1.31 billion, or 2.08% of net sales in 2007. Excluding the adjustment to deferred membership fees in 2007, adjusted membership fees increased 10.0% from 2007. The increase was primarily due to: new membership sign ups at the 24 new warehouses opened (34 opened and 10 closed due to relocations); increased penetration of the higher fee Executive Membership program; and the five dollar increase in our annual membership fee in the second half of 2006 for non Executive members. Our member renewal rate, currently at 87%, is consistent with recent years. 2007 vs. 2006 Membership fees increased 10.5% to $1.31 billion, or 2.08% of net sales in 2007 from $1.19 billion, or 2.02% of net sales in 2006. Excluding the adjustment to deferred membership fees in 2007, adjusted membership fees increased 15.2% from 2006. This increase was primarily due to: a five dollar increase in our annual membership fee for our U.S. and Canada Gold Star (individual), Business and Business Add on members, which was effective May 1, 2006 for new members and July 1, 2006 for existing members; increased penetration of the higher fee Executive Membership program; and additional membership sign ups at the 30 new warehouses opened in 2007.

Excluding the unusual items affecting net sales and gross margin in 2007, adjusted gross margin as a percent of adjusted net sales decreased five basis points in 2008 as compared to 2007. This decrease was largely due to a net 12 basis point decrease in our warehouse ancillary businesses, particularly in one hour photo, tire shop and food services, partially offset by an increase in our gasoline business; a $32.3 million, or five basis point LIFO charge, resulting from price increases in certain food items and gasoline; and a three basis point decrease resulting from the increased penetration of the Executive Membership two percent reward program and increased spending by Executive members. These decreases were partially offset by a net 15 basis point increase from our merchandise departments, particularly fresh foods, food and sundries, Costco Online and our international operations, partially offset by a decrease in softlines. Weve experienced price increases from our suppliers at an increased rate, which may continue. Those increases generally are reflected in our selling prices, but to the extent they are not or are delayed, our gross margins will be adversely affected. 20 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) 2007 vs. 2006 Gross margin was $6.64 billion, or 10.52% of net sales in 2007, compared to $6.22 billion, or 10.55% of net sales in 2006. Excluding the unusual items affecting net sales and gross margin in 2007, adjusted gross margin as a percentage of adjusted net sales was 10.58%, or an increase of three basis points as compared to 2006. This increase was primarily due to a 24 basis point increase in certain merchandise departments, largely food and sundries, as well as smaller increases in certain warehouse ancillary businesses, costco.com and our international operations, offset by a decrease in our hardlines and softlines categories of approximately 15 basis points. In addition, increased penetration of the Executive Membership two percent reward program and increased spending by Executive members negatively affected gross margin by six basis points. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 2008 2007 2006 Selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) $ 6,953,804 $ 6,273,096 $ 5,732,141 Unusual items (46,815 ) SG&A, as adjusted $ 6,953,804 $ 6,226,281 $ 5,732,141 SG&A as a percent of net sales 9.80 % 9.94 % 9.72 % Adjusted SG&A as percent of adjusted net sales 9.80 % 9.80 % 9.72 % 2008 vs. 2007 SG&A totaled $6.95 billion, or 9.80% of net sales in 2008, compared to $6.27 billion, or 9.94% of net sales in 2007. Excluding the unusual items affecting net sales and SG&A expenses in 2007, adjusted SG&A as a percentage of adjusted net sales was 9.80% in 2007. Warehouse operating and central administrative costs positively impacted adjusted SG&A comparisons, on a net basis, by approximately seven basis points, primarily due to decreased payroll and benefits costs as a percent of adjusted net sales. Stock based compensation expense negatively impacted adjusted SG&A comparisons by three basis points, primarily due to a higher closing stock price on the date that our October 2007 RSU grant was valued as compared to previous grants. Additionally, we recorded a $15.9 million reserve in connection with a litigation settlement and accrued approximately $9 million for compensation adjustments we made to employees enrolled in our medical and dental plans related to a decision to share a portion of the health plans savings that we achieved. These two items negatively impacted adjusted SG&A comparisons by four basis points. 2007 vs. 2006 SG&A totaled $6.27 billion, or 9.94% of net sales in 2007, compared to $5.73 billion, or 9.72% of net sales in 2006. Excluding the unusual items affecting net sales and SG&A expenses in 2007, adjusted SG&A as a percentage of adjusted net sales was 9.80%, an increase of eight basis points. Of this increase, three basis points were primarily due to an increase in stock based compensation, and a net five basis points were due to an increase in warehouse payroll and benefits costs. The payroll increase was largely attributed to hourly rate increases that went into effect in March 2007 and a lower overall comparable warehouse sales increase. 21 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Preopening Expenses 2008 2007 2006 Preopening expenses $ 57,383 $ 55,163 $ 42,504 Warehouse openings 34 30 28 Relocations (10 ) (3 ) Warehouse openings, net of relocations 24 30 25 Preopening expenses include costs incurred for startup operations related to new warehouses and the expansion of ancillary operations at existing warehouses. Preopening expenses can vary due to the timing of the opening relative to our year end, whether the warehouse is owned or leased, whether the opening is in an existing, new or international market, as well as the number and magnitude of warehouse remodel projects. Provision for Impaired Assets and Closing Costs, Net 2008 2007 2006 Warehouse closing expenses $ 9,091 $ 15,887 $ 3,762 Impairment of long lived assets 9,972 Net (gains) / losses on the sale of real property (18,815 ) (2,279 ) 1,691 Provision for impaired assets & closing costs, net $ 248 $ 13,608 $ 5,453 The provision primarily includes costs related to impairment of long lived assets, future lease obligations of warehouses that have been relocated to new facilities, accelerated depreciation on buildings to be demolished or sold and that are not otherwise impaired, and gains or losses resulting from the sale of real property, largely comprised of former warehouse locations. 2008 vs. 2007 The net provision for impaired assets and closing costs was $0.2 million in 2008, compared to $13.6 million in 2007. The provision in 2008 included charges of $9.1 million for warehouse closing expenses, and impairment charges of $10.0 million, primarily related to a location in Michigan that was demolished and is being rebuilt. These charges were offset by $18.8 million of net gains on the sale of real property, largely former warehouse locations. 2007 vs. 2006 The net provision for impaired assets and closing costs was $13.6 million in 2007, compared to $5.5 million in 2006. In 2007, approximately $13.0 million of this provision related to the acceleration of depreciation on ten buildings that were relocated in 2008. The reserve for warehouse closing costs, classified within other current liabilities, at the end of 2008 and 2007 included: 2008 2007 Future lease obligations $ 4,505 $ 6,086 Other 24 737 Reserve for warehouse closing costs $ 4,529 $ 6,823 22 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Interest Expense 2008 2007 2006 Interest expense $ 102,636 $ 64,079 $ 12,570 2008 vs. 2007 Interest expense totaled $102.6 million in 2008 compared to $64.1 million in 2007. The increase in interest expense resulted primarily from the issuance of our $900 million of 5.3% and $1.1 billion of 5.5% Senior Notes (2007 Senior Notes) in February 2007, partially offset by lower interest expense resulting from the repayment in March 2007 of the $300 Million 5.5% Senior Notes. 2007 vs. 2006 Interest expense totaled $64.1 million in 2007 compared to $12.6 million in 2006. The increase in interest expense as compared to the prior year resulted primarily from the issuance of our 2007 Senior Notes, partially offset by lower interest expense resulting from the repayment of the $300 Million 5.5% Senior Notes in March 2007. In addition, interest expense decreased on the 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes (Zero Coupon Notes) as note holders converted approximately $61.2 million in principal amount of the Zero Coupon Notes into common stock, or $42.3 million after factoring in the related debt discount. Interest Income and Other 2008 2007 2006 Interest income $ 95,506 $ 128,413 $ 113,712 Earnings of affiliates 42,070 35,622 28,180 Minority interest and other (4,801 ) 1,449 (3,537 ) Interest Income and other $ 132,775 $ 165,484 $ 138,355 2008 vs. 2007 Interest income and other totaled $132.8 million in 2008, compared to $165.5 million in 2007. This decrease was largely due to lower interest rates, year over year, on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances. In addition, we recognized $5.0 million of other than temporary impairment losses on certain securities within our investment portfolio: $2.8 million, $1.4 million and $0.8 million in the second, third and fourth quarter, respectively of 2008. See further discussion in Liquidity and Capital Resources. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in the earnings of affiliates, primarily our investment in Costco Mexico (a 50% owned joint venture). 2007 vs. 2006 Interest income and other totaled $165.5 million in 2007, compared to $138.4 million in 2006. This increase was largely due to the increase in our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments resulting from increased earnings from operations and the proceeds of the issuance of the 2007 Senior Notes, as well as an increase in the earnings of affiliates, primarily our investment in Costco Mexico (a 50% owned joint venture). 23 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Provision for Income Taxes 2008 2007 2006 Income tax expense $ 716,249 $ 627,219 $ 648,202 Effective tax rate 35.83 % 36.68 % 37.01 % The effective income tax rate on earnings in 2008, 2007 and 2006 was 35.83%, 36.68% and 37.01%, respectively. The lower tax rate in 2008 was primarily attributable to non recurring benefits recognized during the year.

The unusual items previously discussed totaled $119.5 million, net of tax, or $0.26 per diluted share in 2007. Exclusive of these items, earnings in 2007 were $2.63 per diluted share. Net income per diluted share in 2008 represents an increase of 10% over this adjusted amount. During 2008, we repurchased and retired 13.8 million shares of common stock, favorably impacting earnings per diluted share by approximately $0.03. 2007 vs. 2006 Net income for 2007 was $1.08 billion, or $2.37 per diluted share, compared to $1.10 billion, or $2.30 per diluted share during 2006. The unusual items previously discussed totaled $119.5 million, net of tax, or $0.26 per diluted share in 2007. Exclusive of these items, earnings for 2007 were $2.63 per diluted share, a 14% increase over the prior year. During 2007, we repurchased and retired 36.4 million shares of common stock, favorably impacting earnings per diluted share by approximately $0.03. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The following table itemizes our most liquid assets at the end of 2008 and 2007 (dollars in thousands): 2008 2007 Cash and cash equivalents $ 2,619,429 $ 2,779,733 Short term investments 655,584 575,787 Total $ 3,275,013 $ 3,355,520 24 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from warehouse operations and existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances, which were $3.28 billion and $3.36 billion at the end of 2008 and 2007, respectively. Of these balances, approximately $787.5 million and $655.2 million at the end of 2008 and 2007, respectively, represented debit and credit card receivables, primarily related to sales in the week prior to the end of the year. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $2.18 billion in 2008 compared to $2.08 billion in 2007, an increase of $99.8 million. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in net income of $200.0 million, an increase in depreciation and amortization and stock based compensation of $118.2 million, as well as an increase in cash flow from the change in operating assets, liabilities and deferred income taxes of $56.8 million, offset by an increase in net merchandise inventories (merchandise inventory less accounts payable) of $258.0 million. Net cash used in investing activities totaled $1.72 billion in 2008 compared to $655.3 million in 2007, an increase of approximately $1.06 billion. The increase in investing activities relates primarily to a decrease in cash provided by the net investment in short term investments of $534.1 million as a result of less cash needed to fund our decreased common stock repurchase activity. Additions to property and equipment related to warehouse expansion and remodel projects increased $212.9 million in 2008. Additionally, in the second quarter of 2008, $371.1 million formerly classified as cash and cash equivalents was reclassified to short term investments and other non current assets. In December 2007, one of our enhanced money fund investments, Columbia Strategic Cash Portfolio Fund (Columbia), ceased accepting cash redemption requests and changed to a floating net asset value. In light of the restricted liquidity, we elected to receive a pro rata allocation of the underlying securities in a separately managed account. We assessed the fair value of the underlying securities in this account through market quotations and review of current investment ratings, as available, coupled with the evaluation of the liquidation value of each investment and its current performance in meeting scheduled payments of principal and interest. In 2008, we recognized $5.0 million of other than temporary impairment losses related to these securities: $2.8 million, $1.4 million and $0.8 million in the second, third and fourth quarters, respectively. The losses are included in interest income and other in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. The markets relating to these investments remain uncertain, and there may be further declines in the value of these investments that may cause additional losses in future periods. At the end of 2008, the balance of the Columbia fund securities was $103.6 million on the consolidated balance sheet. Additionally, in December 2007, two other enhanced money fund investments, BlackRock Cash Strategies, LLC (BlackRock) and Merrill Lynch Capital Reserve Fund, LLC (Merrill Lynch), ceased accepting redemption requests. These two funds are being liquidated with periodic distributions and the expectation is that the funds will be completely liquidated by 2010. To date, the funds have maintained a $1.00 per unit net asset value. At the end of 2008, the combined balance of the BlackRock and Merrill Lynch funds was $125.1 million on our consolidated balance sheet and we received cash redemptions of $48.2 million from the BlackRock and Merrill Lynch funds subsequent to the end of the year and through October 14, 2008. At the end of 2008, $228.7 million remained in the Columbia, BlackRock and Merrill Lynch funds, with $160.7 million in short term investments and $68.0 million in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet, reflecting the timing of the expected distributions. 25 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) On September 18, 2008, one of our government agency money market funds, The Reserve U.S. Government Fund, announced that the proceeds from a redemption request for this fund would not be transmitted to an investor for a period of up to seven calendar days after the receipt of the redemption request. On September 22, 2008, the SEC granted a temporary order suspending shareholder redemptions as of September 17, 2008 and requiring The Reserve to create a plan to effect an orderly disposition, subject to supervision by the SEC. As of October 14, 2008, the plan to effect an orderly disposition of the U.S. Government Fund has not yet been publicly disclosed. At August 31, 2008 and October 14, 2008, we had $171.4 million and $317.2 million, respectively, invested in the fund. Although market conditions cannot be predicted, we currently do not expect to realize a loss on this fund. The latest per unit net asset value reported for the fund is $1.00. Subsequent to the end of 2008, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (Lehman) filed a petition under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. At August 31, 2008, we held $2.3 million of Lehman securities, within the Columbia portfolio, purchased by the fund manager prior to receipt of our pro rata allocation of the funds investments in December 2007. As of October 14, 2008, we do not have an estimate of the recovery value of the Lehman securities. Additionally, on September 29, 2008, one of Sigma Finance Corporations (Sigma) lenders terminated its repurchase agreements, followed by two additional lenders also terminating agreements. On September 30, 2008 Sigma received a notice of default, which is expected to cause lenders to move to seize Sigmas assets. Sigmas Board of Directors also announced they will cease trading. At August 31, 2008, we held Sigma securities with a market value of $2.2 million and a book value of $1.9 million, within the Columbia portfolio purchased by the fund manager prior to receipt of our pro rata allocation of the funds investments in December 2007. These securities were previously impaired during 2008 and $1.4 million was recorded as an other than temporary impairment. As of October 14, 2008, we do not have an estimate of the recovery value of these securities. Although future market conditions cannot be predicted, we currently do not expect future losses in our investment portfolio to be material to our consolidated financial statements or that we will experience a detriment to our overall liquidity. Net cash used in financing activities totaled $613.0 million in 2008 compared to $164.6 million in 2007. The $448.4 million increase in net cash used in financing activities primarily resulted from a net decrease in cash provided by the issuance of long term debt, net of repayments, of $1.65 billion, largely relating to the issuance of the 2007 Senior Notes. This decrease was partially offset by a reduction in the repurchase of common stock of $1.08 billion, and an increase in the net proceeds from short term borrowings of $76.7 million. Dividends In April 2008, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash dividend from $0.145 to $0.16 per share or $0.64 on an annualized basis. Our quarterly cash dividends paid in 2008 totaled $0.61 per share. In 2007, we paid quarterly cash dividends totaling $0.55 per share. 26 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Contractual Obligations Our commitments at year end to make future payments under contractual obligations were as follows, as of August 31, 2008 (amounts in thousands): Payments Due by Year Contractual obligations 2009 2010 to2011 2012 to2013 2014 andthereafter Total Purchase obligations (merchandise)(1) $ 4,163,530 $ 1,693 $ $ $ 4,165,223 Long term debt(2) 110,735 285,140 1,072,608 1,505,387 2,973,870 Operating leases(3) 139,916 277,885 247,634 1,438,390 2,103,825 Purchase obligations (property, equipment, services and other)(4) 211,311 44,406 1,206 256,923 Construction Commitments 289,730 289,730 Capital lease obligations and other(2) 6,243 6,483 495 5,655 18,876 Other(5) 15,723 4,406 2,405 6,113 28,647 Total $ 4,937,188 $ 620,013 $ 1,324,348 $ 2,955,545 $ 9,837,094 (1) Includes open merchandise purchase orders.

(3) Operating lease obligations exclude amounts commonly referred to as common area maintenance, taxes and insurance and have been reduced by $149,468 to reflect sub lease income. (4) The amounts exclude certain services negotiated at the individual warehouse or regional level that are not significant and generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty. (5) Consists of asset retirement and deferred compensation obligations and includes $13,175 of current unrecognized tax benefits relating to uncertain tax positions, but excludes $39,699 of noncurrent unrecognized tax benefits due to uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash payments. Expansion Plans Our primary requirement for capital is the financing of land, building and equipment costs for new and remodeled warehouses. Capital is also required for initial warehouse operations and working capital. While there can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized and plans are subject to change upon further review, it is our current intention to spend approximately $1.7 billion during fiscal 2009 for real estate, construction, remodeling and equipment for warehouses and related operations. These expenditures are expected to be financed with a combination of cash provided from operations and existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. Plans for the United States and Canada during 2009 are to open approximately 24 to 28 new warehouses, inclusive of one to three relocations of existing warehouses to larger and better located facilities. We expect to continue our review of expansion plans in our international operations, including the United Kingdom and Asia, along with other international markets. 27 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Additional Equity Investments in Subsidiaries and Joint Ventures The Companys investments in the Costco Mexico joint venture and in other unconsolidated joint ventures that are less than majority owned are accounted for under the equity method. In 2006, we contributed an additional $15 million to our investment in Costco Mexico (a 50% owned joint venture), which did not impact our percentage ownership of this entity, as our joint venture partner contributed a like amount. There were no such contributions in 2008 and 2007.

The net proceeds were used to repay the 1.187% Promissory Notes due in July 2008 and for general corporate purposes. Interest is payable semi annually in December and June, with the first payment due in December 2008 and principal is due in June 2018. 29 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) On October 17, 2007, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued Promissory Notes through a private placement in the amount of $59.8 million, bearing interest at 2.695%. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due in October 2017. The proceeds were used to repay the 2.070% Promissory Notes due in October 2007 and for general corporate purposes. In February 2007, we issued $900 million of 5.3% Senior Notes due March 15, 2012 at a discount of $2.5 million and $1.1 billion of 5.5% Senior Notes due March 15, 2017 at a discount of $5.9 million (together, the 2007 Senior Notes). Interest on the 2007 Senior Notes is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The discount and issuance costs associated with the 2007 Senior Notes are being amortized to interest expense over the terms of those notes. At our option, we may redeem the 2007 Senior Notes at any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount of the 2007 Senior Notes to be redeemed, or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, we will be required to make an offer to purchase the 2007 Senior Notes at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase, upon certain events as defined by the terms of the 2007 Senior Notes. In April 2003, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.92% in the amount of $36.8 million, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due in April 2010. In November 2002, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.88% in the aggregate amount of $27.6 million, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due in November 2009. The U.S. Parent Company, Costco Wholesale Corporation guarantees all of the promissory notes issued by our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary. In August 1997, we sold $900.0 million principal amount at maturity Zero Coupon Notes due in August 2017. The Zero Coupon Notes were priced with a yield to maturity of 3.5%, resulting in gross proceeds to us of $449.6 million. The notes outstanding are convertible into a maximum of 1.5 million shares of Costco Common Stock shares at an initial conversion price of $22.71. Holders of the Zero Coupon Notes may require us to purchase the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of purchase) in August 2012. We may redeem, at our option, the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of redemption) any time after August 2002. As of August 31, 2008, $832.9 million in principal amount of the Zero Coupon Notes had been converted by note holders to shares of Costco Common Stock, of which $0.5 million and $61.2 million in principal were converted in 2008 and 2007, respectively, or $0.4 million and $42.3 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively, after factoring in the related debt discount. Derivatives We follow Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (as amended) (SFAS 133), in accounting for derivative and hedging activities. We use derivative and hedging arrangements only to manage what we believe to be well defined risks. Forward foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on inventory purchases and typically have very short terms. These forward contracts do not qualify for derivative hedge accounting. The aggregate notional amount of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at the end of 2008 and 2007 was $89.8 million and $75.0 million, respectively. The mark to market adjustment related to these contracts resulted in the recording of an asset of $4.6 million and a liability of $0.9 million at the end of 2008 and 2007, respectively, and $5.8 million and $0.4 million were recognized in interest income and other in the consolidated statements of income in 2008 and 2007, respectively. The majority of the forward foreign exchange contracts were entered into by our wholly owned United Kingdom subsidiary, primarily to hedge U.S. dollar merchandise inventory purchases. 30 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) We are exposed to risks in energy costs due to fluctuations in energy prices, particularly electricity, which we partially mitigate through the use of fixed price contracts with counterparties for approximately 19% of our warehouses in the U.S. and Canada, as well as certain depots and other facilities. We have also entered into variable priced contracts for the purchase of natural gas and fuel for our gas stations on an index basis. These contracts qualify for treatment as normal purchase or normal sales under SFAS 133 and require no mark to market adjustment. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements With the exception of our operating leases, we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition or consolidated financial statements. Stock Repurchase Programs In September and November of 2007, our Board of Directors approved $300.0 million and $1.0 billion, respectively, of stock repurchases, both expiring in 2010. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an additional $1.0 billion expiring in 2011, bringing total authorizations by our Board of Directors since inception of the program in 2001 to $6.80 billion. During 2008, we repurchased 13.8 million shares at an average price of $64.22 totaling approximately $886.9 million. During 2007, we repurchased 36.4 million shares of common stock, at an average price of $54.39, totaling approximately $1.98 billion. The remaining amount available to be purchased under our approved plan was approximately $2.06 billion at the end of 2008. Purchases are made from time to time as conditions warrant in the open market or in block purchases, and pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5 1. Repurchased shares are retired, in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments. We continue to review our accounting policies and evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, merchandise inventory valuation, impairment of long lived assets, warehouse closing costs, insurance/self insurance liabilities, investments and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. Revenue Recognition We generally recognize sales, net of estimated returns, at the time the member takes possession of merchandise or receives services. When we collect payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services, the amount received is generally recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed. We provide for estimated sales returns based on historical merchandise returns levels. Amounts collected from members, which under common trade practices are referred to as sales taxes, are recorded on a net basis. We evaluate the criteria of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal Versus Net as an Agent, in determining whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, when we are the primary obligor, subject to inventory risk, 31 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, influence product or service specifications, or have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded on a gross basis. If we are not the primary obligor and do not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above, we record the net amounts as commissions earned, which is reflected in net sales. Membership fee revenue represents annual membership fees paid by substantially all of our members. We account for membership fee revenue on a deferred basis, whereby revenue is recognized ratably over the one year membership period. In 2007, we performed a detailed analysis of the timing of recognition of membership fees based on each members specific renewal date, as this methodology represented an improvement over the historical method, which was based on the period in which the fee was collected. This review resulted in a $56.2 million reduction to membership fee revenue in 2007 and a corresponding increase to deferred membership fees on our consolidated balance sheet. This adjustment included both a change in method of applying an accounting principle to a preferable method and a correction for cumulative timing errors. Our Executive members qualify for a 2% reward (which can be redeemed only at Costco warehouses), up to a maximum of $500 per year, on all qualified purchases made at Costco. We account for this 2% reward as a reduction in sales, with the related liability being classified within other current liabilities. The sales reduction and corresponding liability are computed after giving effect to the estimated impact of non redemptions based on historical data. Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, as determined primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting, and are stated using the last in, first out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all other foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail inventory method of accounting and are stated using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. We believe the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. We record an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the expected annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end. The LIFO inventory adjustment in 2008 reduced ending inventory and gross margin by $32.3 million. At the end of 2007, merchandise inventories valued at LIFO approximated FIFO after considering the lower of cost or market principle. We provide for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts as a percentage of net sales. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect results of the actual physical inventory counts, which generally occur in the second and fourth quarters of the year. Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as we progress toward earning those rebates, provided they are probable and reasonably estimable. Other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of agreement, or other systematic and rational approaches. Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Warehouse Closing costs We periodically evaluate our long lived assets for indicators of impairment, such as a decision to relocate or close a warehouse location. Our judgments are based on existing market and operational conditions. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring a downward adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value. 32 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) We provide estimates for warehouse closing costs for both leased and owned locations to be closed or relocated. A considerable amount of judgment is involved in determining any impairment or our net liability, particularly related to the estimated sales price of owned locations and the potential sublease income at leased locations. These estimates are based on real estate conditions in the markets and our experience in those markets. We make assumptions about the average period of time it would take to sublease the location and the amount of potential sublease income for each leased location. We reassess our liability each quarter and adjust our liability accordingly when our estimates change. Insurance/Self Insurance Liabilities We use a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance pool, to provide for potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property damage, director and officers liability, vehicle liability and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience and evaluations of outside experts, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Investments Investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other than temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and our intent and ability to hold the investment. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the issuer, including industry and sector performance, operational and financing cash flow factors, and rating agency actions. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and or issuer conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments. Income Taxes We adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48), which sets out criteria for the use of judgment in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items, at the beginning of 2008. The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Significant judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions. The benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in our financial statements only after determining a more likely than not probability that the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge, if any, from tax authorities. When facts and circumstances change, we reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the financial statements as appropriate. 33 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Recent Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157), which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements required under other accounting pronouncements. It does not change existing guidance as to whether or not an instrument is carried at fair value. SFAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 157 1 (FSP FAS 157 1), which excludes SFAS No. 13, Accounting for Leases and certain other accounting pronouncements that address fair value measurements under SFAS 13, from the scope of SFAS 157. In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. 157 2 (FSP 157 2), which provides a one year delayed application of SFAS 157 for nonfinancial assets and liabilities, except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). We are required to adopt SFAS 157 as amended by FSP FAS 157 1 and FSP FAS 157 2 on September 1, 2008, the beginning of our fiscal 2009. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In October 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 157 3, Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset in a Market That Is Not Active (FSP 157 3), which clarifies the application of SFAS 157 when the market for a financial asset is inactive. Specifically, FSP 157 3 clarifies how (1) managements internal assumptions should be considered in measuring fair value when observable data are not present, (2) observable market information from an inactive market should be taken into account, and (3) the use of broker quotes or pricing services should be considered in assessing the relevance of observable and unobservable data to measure fair value. The guidance in FSP 157 3 is effective immediately and will apply to us upon adoption of SFAS 157. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, Including an Amendment to FASB No. 115 (SFAS 159). Under SFAS 159, entities may elect to measure specified financial instruments and warranty and insurance contracts at fair value on a contract by contract basis, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings each reporting period. The election, called the fair value option, will enable entities to achieve an offset accounting effect for changes in fair value of certain related assets and liabilities without having to apply more complex hedge accounting provisions. SFAS 159 will be effective for us September 1, 2008, the beginning of our fiscal 2009. We do not intend to elect the fair value option for any of our existing financial assets or financial liabilities; therefore, this statement is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In June 2008, the FASB issued Staff Position EITF 03 06 1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities (FSP EITF 03 06 1). FSP EITF 03 06 1 provides that unvested share based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (whether paid or unpaid) are participating securities and shall be included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two class method in SFAS No. 128, Earnings per Share. Our unvested RSUs are not eligible to receive dividends; therefore EITF 03 06 1 will not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an Amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin No 51 (SFAS 160). SFAS 160 establishes accounting and reporting standards for ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent, changes in a parents ownership of a noncontrolling interest, calculation and disclosure of the consolidated net income attributable to the parent and the noncontrolling interest, 34 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) changes in a parents ownership interest while the parent retains its controlling financial interest and fair value measurement of any retained noncontrolling equity investment. SFAS 160 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is prohibited. We must adopt these new requirements in our first quarter of fiscal 2010. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141R, Business Combinations (SFAS 141R), which establishes principles and requirements for the reporting entity in a business combination, including recognition and measurement in the financial statements of the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree. SFAS 141R applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years. We must adopt these new requirements in our first quarter of fiscal 2010. In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 133 (SFAS 161), which requires enhanced disclosures about derivative and hedging activities. This statement is effective for financial statements issued for periods beginning after November 15, 2008. Early adoption is permitted. We must provide these new disclosures no later than our second quarter of fiscal 2009. We are in the process of evaluating the impact that adoption of SFAS Nos. 141R, 160 and 161 will have on our future consolidated financial statements. Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to financial market risk resulting from changes in interest and foreign currency rates. We do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions, nor hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. Recent developments in the financial markets, however, have rendered risks less predictable, and liquidity concerns and credit risks have increased. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our money market funds, debt securities, corporate notes and bonds and enhanced money funds with effective maturities of generally three months to five years at the date of purchase. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while generating yields without significantly increasing risk. Historically, this was accomplished by investing in high investment grade securities with a minimum overall portfolio average credit rating of AA . A revised investment policy was approved in December 2007 by our Board of Directors, limiting future investments to direct U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations, repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations and U.S. Government and Government Agency Money Market funds. The investment policies of our subsidiaries have been reviewed and are consistent with our primary objective to preserve principal while generating yields without significantly leveraging risk. Our wholly owned insurance subsidiary invests in U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations, corporate notes and bonds and asset and mortgage backed securities with a minimum overall portfolio average credit rating of AA . All of our foreign subsidiaries investments are primarily in money market funds, investment grade securities, bankers acceptances, bank certificates of deposit and term deposits all denominated in their local currencies. Additionally, our Canadian subsidiary may invest a portion of their investments in 35 Table of Contents Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) U.S. dollar investment grade securities and bank term deposits to meet current U.S. dollar obligations. All of the investment policies of the Company and subsidiaries are reviewed at least annually. As the majority of these investments in cash and cash equivalents are of a short term nature, if interest rates were to increase or decrease, there is no material risk of a material valuation adjustment related to these instruments. Based on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances at the end of 2008, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $17.9 million (pre tax) to interest income on an annual basis. For those investments that are classified as available for sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in market volatility and interest rates are reflected within stockholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive income. The nature and amount of our long and short term debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As of the end of 2008, our fixed rate long term debt included: $67.1 million principal amount at maturity of 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes carried at $49.1 million; $900.0 million of 5.3% Senior Notes carried at $898.3 million; and $1.10 billion of 5.5% Senior Notes carried at $1.09 billion and additional notes and capital lease obligations totaling $142.0 million. Additionally, our variable rate long term debt included a 0.35% over Yen Tibor (6 month) Term Loan of $27.6 million. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt and may affect the interest expense related to the variable rate debt. Most transactions of our foreign subsidiaries are conducted in local currencies, limiting our exposure to changes in currency rates. The majority of the forward foreign exchange contracts were entered into by our wholly owned United Kingdom subsidiary, primarily to hedge U.S. dollar merchandise inventory purchases. We periodically enter into short term forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates on inventory purchases. The notional value of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at the end of 2008 was $89.8 million. 
 
Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) 2007 vs. 2006 Gross margin was $6.64 billion, or 10.52% of net sales in 2007, compared to $6.22 billion, or 10.55% of net sales in 2006. Excluding the unusual items affecting net sales and gross margin in 2007, adjusted gross margin as a percentage of adjusted net sales was 10.58%, or an increase of three basis points as compared to 2006. This increase was primarily due to a 24 basis point increase in certain merchandise departments, largely food and sundries, as well as smaller increases in certain warehouse ancillary businesses, costco.com and our international operations, offset by a decrease in our hardlines and softlines categories of approximately 15 basis points. In addition, increased penetration of the Executive Membership two percent reward program and increased spending by Executive members negatively affected gross margin by six basis points. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 2008 2007 2006 Selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) $ 6,953,804 $ 6,273,096 $ 5,732,141 Unusual items (46,815 ) SG&A, as adjusted $ 6,953,804 $ 6,226,281 $ 5,732,141 SG&A as a percent of net sales 9.80 % 9.94 % 9.72 % Adjusted SG&A as percent of adjusted net sales 9.80 % 9.80 % 9.72 % 2008 vs. 2007 SG&A totaled $6.95 billion, or 9.80% of net sales in 2008, compared to $6.27 billion, or 9.94% of net sales in 2007. Excluding the unusual items affecting net sales and SG&A expenses in 2007, adjusted SG&A as a percentage of adjusted net sales was 9.80% in 2007. Warehouse operating and central administrative costs positively impacted adjusted SG&A comparisons, on a net basis, by approximately seven basis points, primarily due to decreased payroll and benefits costs as a percent of adjusted net sales. Stock based compensation expense negatively impacted adjusted SG&A comparisons by three basis points, primarily due to a higher closing stock price on the date that our October 2007 RSU grant was valued as compared to previous grants. Additionally, we recorded a $15.9 million reserve in connection with a litigation settlement and accrued approximately $9 million for compensation adjustments we made to employees enrolled in our medical and dental plans related to a decision to share a portion of the health plans savings that we achieved. These two items negatively impacted adjusted SG&A comparisons by four basis points. 2007 vs. 2006 SG&A totaled $6.27 billion, or 9.94% of net sales in 2007, compared to $5.73 billion, or 9.72% of net sales in 2006. Excluding the unusual items affecting net sales and SG&A expenses in 2007, adjusted SG&A as a percentage of adjusted net sales was 9.80%, an increase of eight basis points. Of this increase, three basis points were primarily due to an increase in stock based compensation, and a net five basis points were due to an increase in warehouse payroll and benefits costs. The payroll increase was largely attributed to hourly rate increases that went into effect in March 2007 and a lower overall comparable warehouse sales increase. 21 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Preopening Expenses 2008 2007 2006 Preopening expenses $ 57,383 $ 55,163 $ 42,504 Warehouse openings 34 30 28 Relocations (10 ) (3 ) Warehouse openings, net of relocations 24 30 25 Preopening expenses include costs incurred for startup operations related to new warehouses and the expansion of ancillary operations at existing warehouses. Preopening expenses can vary due to the timing of the opening relative to our year end, whether the warehouse is owned or leased, whether the opening is in an existing, new or international market, as well as the number and magnitude of warehouse remodel projects. Provision for Impaired Assets and Closing Costs, Net 2008 2007 2006 Warehouse closing expenses $ 9,091 $ 15,887 $ 3,762 Impairment of long lived assets 9,972 Net (gains) / losses on the sale of real property (18,815 ) (2,279 ) 1,691 Provision for impaired assets & closing costs, net $ 248 $ 13,608 $ 5,453 The provision primarily includes costs related to impairment of long lived assets, future lease obligations of warehouses that have been relocated to new facilities, accelerated depreciation on buildings to be demolished or sold and that are not otherwise impaired, and gains or losses resulting from the sale of real property, largely comprised of former warehouse locations. 2008 vs. 2007 The net provision for impaired assets and closing costs was $0.2 million in 2008, compared to $13.6 million in 2007. The provision in 2008 included charges of $9.1 million for warehouse closing expenses, and impairment charges of $10.0 million, primarily related to a location in Michigan that was demolished and is being rebuilt. These charges were offset by $18.8 million of net gains on the sale of real property, largely former warehouse locations. 2007 vs. 2006 The net provision for impaired assets and closing costs was $13.6 million in 2007, compared to $5.5 million in 2006. In 2007, approximately $13.0 million of this provision related to the acceleration of depreciation on ten buildings that were relocated in 2008. The reserve for warehouse closing costs, classified within other current liabilities, at the end of 2008 and 2007 included: 2008 2007 Future lease obligations $ 4,505 $ 6,086 Other 24 737 Reserve for warehouse closing costs $ 4,529 $ 6,823 22 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Interest Expense 2008 2007 2006 Interest expense $ 102,636 $ 64,079 $ 12,570 2008 vs. 2007 Interest expense totaled $102.6 million in 2008 compared to $64.1 million in 2007. The increase in interest expense resulted primarily from the issuance of our $900 million of 5.3% and $1.1 billion of 5.5% Senior Notes (2007 Senior Notes) in February 2007, partially offset by lower interest expense resulting from the repayment in March 2007 of the $300 Million 5.5% Senior Notes. 2007 vs. 2006 Interest expense totaled $64.1 million in 2007 compared to $12.6 million in 2006. The increase in interest expense as compared to the prior year resulted primarily from the issuance of our 2007 Senior Notes, partially offset by lower interest expense resulting from the repayment of the $300 Million 5.5% Senior Notes in March 2007. In addition, interest expense decreased on the 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes (Zero Coupon Notes) as note holders converted approximately $61.2 million in principal amount of the Zero Coupon Notes into common stock, or $42.3 million after factoring in the related debt discount. Interest Income and Other 2008 2007 2006 Interest income $ 95,506 $ 128,413 $ 113,712 Earnings of affiliates 42,070 35,622 28,180 Minority interest and other (4,801 ) 1,449 (3,537 ) Interest Income and other $ 132,775 $ 165,484 $ 138,355 2008 vs. 2007 Interest income and other totaled $132.8 million in 2008, compared to $165.5 million in 2007. This decrease was largely due to lower interest rates, year over year, on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances. In addition, we recognized $5.0 million of other than temporary impairment losses on certain securities within our investment portfolio: $2.8 million, $1.4 million and $0.8 million in the second, third and fourth quarter, respectively of 2008. See further discussion in Liquidity and Capital Resources. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in the earnings of affiliates, primarily our investment in Costco Mexico (a 50% owned joint venture). 2007 vs. 2006 Interest income and other totaled $165.5 million in 2007, compared to $138.4 million in 2006. This increase was largely due to the increase in our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments resulting from increased earnings from operations and the proceeds of the issuance of the 2007 Senior Notes, as well as an increase in the earnings of affiliates, primarily our investment in Costco Mexico (a 50% owned joint venture). 23 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Provision for Income Taxes 2008 2007 2006 Income tax expense $ 716,249 $ 627,219 $ 648,202 Effective tax rate 35.83 % 36.68 % 37.01 % The effective income tax rate on earnings in 2008, 2007 and 2006 was 35.83%, 36.68% and 37.01%, respectively. The lower tax rate in 2008 was primarily attributable to non recurring benefits recognized during the year. Net Income 2008 2007 2006 Net income $ 1,282,725 $ 1,082,772 $ 1,103,215 Unusual items (net of tax) 119,496 Net income, as adjusted $ 1,282,725 $ 1,202,268 $ 1,103,215 Diluted earnings per share $ 2.89 $ 2.37 $ 2.30 Shares used to calculate diluted net income per common share 444,240 457,641 480,341 Diluted earnings per share increase 22 % 3 % 6 % 2008 vs. 2007 Net income for 2008 was $1.28 billion, or $2.89 per diluted share, compared to $1.08 billion, or $2.37 per diluted share, during 2007. The unusual items previously discussed totaled $119.5 million, net of tax, or $0.26 per diluted share in 2007. Exclusive of these items, earnings in 2007 were $2.63 per diluted share. Net income per diluted share in 2008 represents an increase of 10% over this adjusted amount. During 2008, we repurchased and retired 13.8 million shares of common stock, favorably impacting earnings per diluted share by approximately $0.03. 2007 vs. 2006 Net income for 2007 was $1.08 billion, or $2.37 per diluted share, compared to $1.10 billion, or $2.30 per diluted share during 2006. The unusual items previously discussed totaled $119.5 million, net of tax, or $0.26 per diluted share in 2007. Exclusive of these items, earnings for 2007 were $2.63 per diluted share, a 14% increase over the prior year. During 2007, we repurchased and retired 36.4 million shares of common stock, favorably impacting earnings per diluted share by approximately $0.03. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The following table itemizes our most liquid assets at the end of 2008 and 2007 (dollars in thousands): 2008 2007 Cash and cash equivalents $ 2,619,429 $ 2,779,733 Short term investments 655,584 575,787 Total $ 3,275,013 $ 3,355,520 24 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from warehouse operations and existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances, which were $3.28 billion and $3.36 billion at the end of 2008 and 2007, respectively. Of these balances, approximately $787.5 million and $655.2 million at the end of 2008 and 2007, respectively, represented debit and credit card receivables, primarily related to sales in the week prior to the end of the year. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $2.18 billion in 2008 compared to $2.08 billion in 2007, an increase of $99.8 million. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in net income of $200.0 million, an increase in depreciation and amortization and stock based compensation of $118.2 million, as well as an increase in cash flow from the change in operating assets, liabilities and deferred income taxes of $56.8 million, offset by an increase in net merchandise inventories (merchandise inventory less accounts payable) of $258.0 million. Net cash used in investing activities totaled $1.72 billion in 2008 compared to $655.3 million in 2007, an increase of approximately $1.06 billion. The increase in investing activities relates primarily to a decrease in cash provided by the net investment in short term investments of $534.1 million as a result of less cash needed to fund our decreased common stock repurchase activity. Additions to property and equipment related to warehouse expansion and remodel projects increased $212.9 million in 2008. Additionally, in the second quarter of 2008, $371.1 million formerly classified as cash and cash equivalents was reclassified to short term investments and other non current assets. In December 2007, one of our enhanced money fund investments, Columbia Strategic Cash Portfolio Fund (Columbia), ceased accepting cash redemption requests and changed to a floating net asset value. In light of the restricted liquidity, we elected to receive a pro rata allocation of the underlying securities in a separately managed account. We assessed the fair value of the underlying securities in this account through market quotations and review of current investment ratings, as available, coupled with the evaluation of the liquidation value of each investment and its current performance in meeting scheduled payments of principal and interest. In 2008, we recognized $5.0 million of other than temporary impairment losses related to these securities: $2.8 million, $1.4 million and $0.8 million in the second, third and fourth quarters, respectively. The losses are included in interest income and other in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. The markets relating to these investments remain uncertain, and there may be further declines in the value of these investments that may cause additional losses in future periods. At the end of 2008, the balance of the Columbia fund securities was $103.6 million on the consolidated balance sheet. Additionally, in December 2007, two other enhanced money fund investments, BlackRock Cash Strategies, LLC (BlackRock) and Merrill Lynch Capital Reserve Fund, LLC (Merrill Lynch), ceased accepting redemption requests. These two funds are being liquidated with periodic distributions and the expectation is that the funds will be completely liquidated by 2010. To date, the funds have maintained a $1.00 per unit net asset value. At the end of 2008, the combined balance of the BlackRock and Merrill Lynch funds was $125.1 million on our consolidated balance sheet and we received cash redemptions of $48.2 million from the BlackRock and Merrill Lynch funds subsequent to the end of the year and through October 14, 2008. At the end of 2008, $228.7 million remained in the Columbia, BlackRock and Merrill Lynch funds, with $160.7 million in short term investments and $68.0 million in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet, reflecting the timing of the expected distributions. 25 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) On September 18, 2008, one of our government agency money market funds, The Reserve U.S. Government Fund, announced that the proceeds from a redemption request for this fund would not be transmitted to an investor for a period of up to seven calendar days after the receipt of the redemption request. On September 22, 2008, the SEC granted a temporary order suspending shareholder redemptions as of September 17, 2008 and requiring The Reserve to create a plan to effect an orderly disposition, subject to supervision by the SEC. As of October 14, 2008, the plan to effect an orderly disposition of the U.S. Government Fund has not yet been publicly disclosed. At August 31, 2008 and October 14, 2008, we had $171.4 million and $317.2 million, respectively, invested in the fund. Although market conditions cannot be predicted, we currently do not expect to realize a loss on this fund. The latest per unit net asset value reported for the fund is $1.00. Subsequent to the end of 2008, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (Lehman) filed a petition under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. At August 31, 2008, we held $2.3 million of Lehman securities, within the Columbia portfolio, purchased by the fund manager prior to receipt of our pro rata allocation of the funds investments in December 2007. As of October 14, 2008, we do not have an estimate of the recovery value of the Lehman securities. Additionally, on September 29, 2008, one of Sigma Finance Corporations (Sigma) lenders terminated its repurchase agreements, followed by two additional lenders also terminating agreements. On September 30, 2008 Sigma received a notice of default, which is expected to cause lenders to move to seize Sigmas assets. Sigmas Board of Directors also announced they will cease trading. At August 31, 2008, we held Sigma securities with a market value of $2.2 million and a book value of $1.9 million, within the Columbia portfolio purchased by the fund manager prior to receipt of our pro rata allocation of the funds investments in December 2007. These securities were previously impaired during 2008 and $1.4 million was recorded as an other than temporary impairment. As of October 14, 2008, we do not have an estimate of the recovery value of these securities. Although future market conditions cannot be predicted, we currently do not expect future losses in our investment portfolio to be material to our consolidated financial statements or that we will experience a detriment to our overall liquidity. Net cash used in financing activities totaled $613.0 million in 2008 compared to $164.6 million in 2007. The $448.4 million increase in net cash used in financing activities primarily resulted from a net decrease in cash provided by the issuance of long term debt, net of repayments, of $1.65 billion, largely relating to the issuance of the 2007 Senior Notes. This decrease was partially offset by a reduction in the repurchase of common stock of $1.08 billion, and an increase in the net proceeds from short term borrowings of $76.7 million. Dividends In April 2008, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash dividend from $0.145 to $0.16 per share or $0.64 on an annualized basis. Our quarterly cash dividends paid in 2008 totaled $0.61 per share. In 2007, we paid quarterly cash dividends totaling $0.55 per share. 26 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Contractual Obligations Our commitments at year end to make future payments under contractual obligations were as follows, as of August 31, 2008 (amounts in thousands): Payments Due by Year Contractual obligations 2009 2010 to2011 2012 to2013 2014 andthereafter Total Purchase obligations (merchandise)(1) $ 4,163,530 $ 1,693 $ $ $ 4,165,223 Long term debt(2) 110,735 285,140 1,072,608 1,505,387 2,973,870 Operating leases(3) 139,916 277,885 247,634 1,438,390 2,103,825 Purchase obligations (property, equipment, services and other)(4) 211,311 44,406 1,206 256,923 Construction Commitments 289,730 289,730 Capital lease obligations and other(2) 6,243 6,483 495 5,655 18,876 Other(5) 15,723 4,406 2,405 6,113 28,647 Total $ 4,937,188 $ 620,013 $ 1,324,348 $ 2,955,545 $ 9,837,094 (1) Includes open merchandise purchase orders.

(4) The amounts exclude certain services negotiated at the individual warehouse or regional level that are not significant and generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty. (5) Consists of asset retirement and deferred compensation obligations and includes $13,175 of current unrecognized tax benefits relating to uncertain tax positions, but excludes $39,699 of noncurrent unrecognized tax benefits due to uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash payments. Expansion Plans Our primary requirement for capital is the financing of land, building and equipment costs for new and remodeled warehouses. Capital is also required for initial warehouse operations and working capital. While there can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized and plans are subject to change upon further review, it is our current intention to spend approximately $1.7 billion during fiscal 2009 for real estate, construction, remodeling and equipment for warehouses and related operations. These expenditures are expected to be financed with a combination of cash provided from operations and existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. Plans for the United States and Canada during 2009 are to open approximately 24 to 28 new warehouses, inclusive of one to three relocations of existing warehouses to larger and better located facilities. We expect to continue our review of expansion plans in our international operations, including the United Kingdom and Asia, along with other international markets. 27 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Additional Equity Investments in Subsidiaries and Joint Ventures The Companys investments in the Costco Mexico joint venture and in other unconsolidated joint ventures that are less than majority owned are accounted for under the equity method. In 2006, we contributed an additional $15 million to our investment in Costco Mexico (a 50% owned joint venture), which did not impact our percentage ownership of this entity, as our joint venture partner contributed a like amount. There were no such contributions in 2008 and 2007.

For those entities with multi purpose lines, any increase in either letters of credit (standby and or commercial) issuance and or short term borrowing will result in a corresponding decrease in available credit. Financing Activities On June 16, 2008, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary entered into a ten year term loan in the amount of $27.6 million, with a variable rate of interest of Yen TIBOR (6 month) plus a 0.35% margin (1.24% at August 31, 2008) on the outstanding balance. The net proceeds were used to repay the 1.187% Promissory Notes due in July 2008 and for general corporate purposes. Interest is payable semi annually in December and June, with the first payment due in December 2008 and principal is due in June 2018. 29 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) On October 17, 2007, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued Promissory Notes through a private placement in the amount of $59.8 million, bearing interest at 2.695%. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due in October 2017. The proceeds were used to repay the 2.070% Promissory Notes due in October 2007 and for general corporate purposes. In February 2007, we issued $900 million of 5.3% Senior Notes due March 15, 2012 at a discount of $2.5 million and $1.1 billion of 5.5% Senior Notes due March 15, 2017 at a discount of $5.9 million (together, the 2007 Senior Notes). Interest on the 2007 Senior Notes is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The discount and issuance costs associated with the 2007 Senior Notes are being amortized to interest expense over the terms of those notes. At our option, we may redeem the 2007 Senior Notes at any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount of the 2007 Senior Notes to be redeemed, or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, we will be required to make an offer to purchase the 2007 Senior Notes at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase, upon certain events as defined by the terms of the 2007 Senior Notes. In April 2003, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.92% in the amount of $36.8 million, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due in April 2010. In November 2002, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.88% in the aggregate amount of $27.6 million, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due in November 2009. The U.S. Parent Company, Costco Wholesale Corporation guarantees all of the promissory notes issued by our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary. In August 1997, we sold $900.0 million principal amount at maturity Zero Coupon Notes due in August 2017. The Zero Coupon Notes were priced with a yield to maturity of 3.5%, resulting in gross proceeds to us of $449.6 million. The notes outstanding are convertible into a maximum of 1.5 million shares of Costco Common Stock shares at an initial conversion price of $22.71. Holders of the Zero Coupon Notes may require us to purchase the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of purchase) in August 2012. We may redeem, at our option, the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of redemption) any time after August 2002. As of August 31, 2008, $832.9 million in principal amount of the Zero Coupon Notes had been converted by note holders to shares of Costco Common Stock, of which $0.5 million and $61.2 million in principal were converted in 2008 and 2007, respectively, or $0.4 million and $42.3 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively, after factoring in the related debt discount. Derivatives We follow Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (as amended) (SFAS 133), in accounting for derivative and hedging activities. We use derivative and hedging arrangements only to manage what we believe to be well defined risks. Forward foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on inventory purchases and typically have very short terms. These forward contracts do not qualify for derivative hedge accounting. The aggregate notional amount of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at the end of 2008 and 2007 was $89.8 million and $75.0 million, respectively. The mark to market adjustment related to these contracts resulted in the recording of an asset of $4.6 million and a liability of $0.9 million at the end of 2008 and 2007, respectively, and $5.8 million and $0.4 million were recognized in interest income and other in the consolidated statements of income in 2008 and 2007, respectively. The majority of the forward foreign exchange contracts were entered into by our wholly owned United Kingdom subsidiary, primarily to hedge U.S. dollar merchandise inventory purchases. 30 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) We are exposed to risks in energy costs due to fluctuations in energy prices, particularly electricity, which we partially mitigate through the use of fixed price contracts with counterparties for approximately 19% of our warehouses in the U.S. and Canada, as well as certain depots and other facilities. We have also entered into variable priced contracts for the purchase of natural gas and fuel for our gas stations on an index basis. These contracts qualify for treatment as normal purchase or normal sales under SFAS 133 and require no mark to market adjustment. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements With the exception of our operating leases, we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition or consolidated financial statements. Stock Repurchase Programs In September and November of 2007, our Board of Directors approved $300.0 million and $1.0 billion, respectively, of stock repurchases, both expiring in 2010. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an additional $1.0 billion expiring in 2011, bringing total authorizations by our Board of Directors since inception of the program in 2001 to $6.80 billion. During 2008, we repurchased 13.8 million shares at an average price of $64.22 totaling approximately $886.9 million. During 2007, we repurchased 36.4 million shares of common stock, at an average price of $54.39, totaling approximately $1.98 billion. The remaining amount available to be purchased under our approved plan was approximately $2.06 billion at the end of 2008. Purchases are made from time to time as conditions warrant in the open market or in block purchases, and pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5 1. Repurchased shares are retired, in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments. We continue to review our accounting policies and evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, merchandise inventory valuation, impairment of long lived assets, warehouse closing costs, insurance/self insurance liabilities, investments and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. Revenue Recognition We generally recognize sales, net of estimated returns, at the time the member takes possession of merchandise or receives services. When we collect payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services, the amount received is generally recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed. We provide for estimated sales returns based on historical merchandise returns levels. Amounts collected from members, which under common trade practices are referred to as sales taxes, are recorded on a net basis. We evaluate the criteria of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal Versus Net as an Agent, in determining whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, when we are the primary obligor, subject to inventory risk, 31 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, influence product or service specifications, or have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded on a gross basis. If we are not the primary obligor and do not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above, we record the net amounts as commissions earned, which is reflected in net sales. Membership fee revenue represents annual membership fees paid by substantially all of our members. We account for membership fee revenue on a deferred basis, whereby revenue is recognized ratably over the one year membership period. In 2007, we performed a detailed analysis of the timing of recognition of membership fees based on each members specific renewal date, as this methodology represented an improvement over the historical method, which was based on the period in which the fee was collected. This review resulted in a $56.2 million reduction to membership fee revenue in 2007 and a corresponding increase to deferred membership fees on our consolidated balance sheet. This adjustment included both a change in method of applying an accounting principle to a preferable method and a correction for cumulative timing errors. Our Executive members qualify for a 2% reward (which can be redeemed only at Costco warehouses), up to a maximum of $500 per year, on all qualified purchases made at Costco. We account for this 2% reward as a reduction in sales, with the related liability being classified within other current liabilities. The sales reduction and corresponding liability are computed after giving effect to the estimated impact of non redemptions based on historical data. Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, as determined primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting, and are stated using the last in, first out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all other foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail inventory method of accounting and are stated using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. We believe the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. We record an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the expected annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end. The LIFO inventory adjustment in 2008 reduced ending inventory and gross margin by $32.3 million. At the end of 2007, merchandise inventories valued at LIFO approximated FIFO after considering the lower of cost or market principle. We provide for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts as a percentage of net sales. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect results of the actual physical inventory counts, which generally occur in the second and fourth quarters of the year. Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as we progress toward earning those rebates, provided they are probable and reasonably estimable. Other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of agreement, or other systematic and rational approaches. Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Warehouse Closing costs We periodically evaluate our long lived assets for indicators of impairment, such as a decision to relocate or close a warehouse location. Our judgments are based on existing market and operational conditions. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring a downward adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value. 32 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) We provide estimates for warehouse closing costs for both leased and owned locations to be closed or relocated. A considerable amount of judgment is involved in determining any impairment or our net liability, particularly related to the estimated sales price of owned locations and the potential sublease income at leased locations. These estimates are based on real estate conditions in the markets and our experience in those markets. We make assumptions about the average period of time it would take to sublease the location and the amount of potential sublease income for each leased location. We reassess our liability each quarter and adjust our liability accordingly when our estimates change. Insurance/Self Insurance Liabilities We use a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance pool, to provide for potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property damage, director and officers liability, vehicle liability and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience and evaluations of outside experts, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Investments Investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other than temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and our intent and ability to hold the investment. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the issuer, including industry and sector performance, operational and financing cash flow factors, and rating agency actions. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and or issuer conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments. Income Taxes We adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48), which sets out criteria for the use of judgment in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items, at the beginning of 2008. The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Significant judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions. The benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in our financial statements only after determining a more likely than not probability that the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge, if any, from tax authorities. When facts and circumstances change, we reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the financial statements as appropriate. 33 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Recent Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157), which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements required under other accounting pronouncements. It does not change existing guidance as to whether or not an instrument is carried at fair value. SFAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 157 1 (FSP FAS 157 1), which excludes SFAS No. 13, Accounting for Leases and certain other accounting pronouncements that address fair value measurements under SFAS 13, from the scope of SFAS 157. In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. 157 2 (FSP 157 2), which provides a one year delayed application of SFAS 157 for nonfinancial assets and liabilities, except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). We are required to adopt SFAS 157 as amended by FSP FAS 157 1 and FSP FAS 157 2 on September 1, 2008, the beginning of our fiscal 2009. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In October 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 157 3, Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset in a Market That Is Not Active (FSP 157 3), which clarifies the application of SFAS 157 when the market for a financial asset is inactive. Specifically, FSP 157 3 clarifies how (1) managements internal assumptions should be considered in measuring fair value when observable data are not present, (2) observable market information from an inactive market should be taken into account, and (3) the use of broker quotes or pricing services should be considered in assessing the relevance of observable and unobservable data to measure fair value. The guidance in FSP 157 3 is effective immediately and will apply to us upon adoption of SFAS 157. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, Including an Amendment to FASB No. 115 (SFAS 159). Under SFAS 159, entities may elect to measure specified financial instruments and warranty and insurance contracts at fair value on a contract by contract basis, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings each reporting period. The election, called the fair value option, will enable entities to achieve an offset accounting effect for changes in fair value of certain related assets and liabilities without having to apply more complex hedge accounting provisions. SFAS 159 will be effective for us September 1, 2008, the beginning of our fiscal 2009. We do not intend to elect the fair value option for any of our existing financial assets or financial liabilities; therefore, this statement is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In June 2008, the FASB issued Staff Position EITF 03 06 1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities (FSP EITF 03 06 1). FSP EITF 03 06 1 provides that unvested share based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (whether paid or unpaid) are participating securities and shall be included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two class method in SFAS No. 128, Earnings per Share. Our unvested RSUs are not eligible to receive dividends; therefore EITF 03 06 1 will not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an Amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin No 51 (SFAS 160). SFAS 160 establishes accounting and reporting standards for ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent, changes in a parents ownership of a noncontrolling interest, calculation and disclosure of the consolidated net income attributable to the parent and the noncontrolling interest, 34 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) changes in a parents ownership interest while the parent retains its controlling financial interest and fair value measurement of any retained noncontrolling equity investment. SFAS 160 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is prohibited. We must adopt these new requirements in our first quarter of fiscal 2010. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141R, Business Combinations (SFAS 141R), which establishes principles and requirements for the reporting entity in a business combination, including recognition and measurement in the financial statements of the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree. SFAS 141R applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years. We must adopt these new requirements in our first quarter of fiscal 2010. In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 133 (SFAS 161), which requires enhanced disclosures about derivative and hedging activities. This statement is effective for financial statements issued for periods beginning after November 15, 2008. Early adoption is permitted. We must provide these new disclosures no later than our second quarter of fiscal 2009. We are in the process of evaluating the impact that adoption of SFAS Nos. 141R, 160 and 161 will have on our future consolidated financial statements. Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to financial market risk resulting from changes in interest and foreign currency rates. We do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions, nor hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. Recent developments in the financial markets, however, have rendered risks less predictable, and liquidity concerns and credit risks have increased. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our money market funds, debt securities, corporate notes and bonds and enhanced money funds with effective maturities of generally three months to five years at the date of purchase. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while generating yields without significantly increasing risk. Historically, this was accomplished by investing in high investment grade securities with a minimum overall portfolio average credit rating of AA . A revised investment policy was approved in December 2007 by our Board of Directors, limiting future investments to direct U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations, repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations and U.S. Government and Government Agency Money Market funds. The investment policies of our subsidiaries have been reviewed and are consistent with our primary objective to preserve principal while generating yields without significantly leveraging risk. Our wholly owned insurance subsidiary invests in U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations, corporate notes and bonds and asset and mortgage backed securities with a minimum overall portfolio average credit rating of AA . All of our foreign subsidiaries investments are primarily in money market funds, investment grade securities, bankers acceptances, bank certificates of deposit and term deposits all denominated in their local currencies. Additionally, our Canadian subsidiary may invest a portion of their investments in 35 Table of Contents Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) U.S. dollar investment grade securities and bank term deposits to meet current U.S. dollar obligations. All of the investment policies of the Company and subsidiaries are reviewed at least annually. As the majority of these investments in cash and cash equivalents are of a short term nature, if interest rates were to increase or decrease, there is no material risk of a material valuation adjustment related to these instruments. Based on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances at the end of 2008, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $17.9 million (pre tax) to interest income on an annual basis. For those investments that are classified as available for sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in market volatility and interest rates are reflected within stockholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive income. The nature and amount of our long and short term debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As of the end of 2008, our fixed rate long term debt included: $67.1 million principal amount at maturity of 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes carried at $49.1 million; $900.0 million of 5.3% Senior Notes carried at $898.3 million; and $1.10 billion of 5.5% Senior Notes carried at $1.09 billion and additional notes and capital lease obligations totaling $142.0 million. Additionally, our variable rate long term debt included a 0.35% over Yen Tibor (6 month) Term Loan of $27.6 million. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt and may affect the interest expense related to the variable rate debt. Most transactions of our foreign subsidiaries are conducted in local currencies, limiting our exposure to changes in currency rates. The majority of the forward foreign exchange contracts were entered into by our wholly owned United Kingdom subsidiary, primarily to hedge U.S. dollar merchandise inventory purchases. We periodically enter into short term forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates on inventory purchases. The notional value of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at the end of 2008 was $89.8 million. 
 
Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Preopening Expenses 2008 2007 2006 Preopening expenses $ 57,383 $ 55,163 $ 42,504 Warehouse openings 34 30 28 Relocations (10 ) (3 ) Warehouse openings, net of relocations 24 30 25 Preopening expenses include costs incurred for startup operations related to new warehouses and the expansion of ancillary operations at existing warehouses. Preopening expenses can vary due to the timing of the opening relative to our year end, whether the warehouse is owned or leased, whether the opening is in an existing, new or international market, as well as the number and magnitude of warehouse remodel projects. Provision for Impaired Assets and Closing Costs, Net 2008 2007 2006 Warehouse closing expenses $ 9,091 $ 15,887 $ 3,762 Impairment of long lived assets 9,972 Net (gains) / losses on the sale of real property (18,815 ) (2,279 ) 1,691 Provision for impaired assets & closing costs, net $ 248 $ 13,608 $ 5,453 The provision primarily includes costs related to impairment of long lived assets, future lease obligations of warehouses that have been relocated to new facilities, accelerated depreciation on buildings to be demolished or sold and that are not otherwise impaired, and gains or losses resulting from the sale of real property, largely comprised of former warehouse locations. 2008 vs. 2007 The net provision for impaired assets and closing costs was $0.2 million in 2008, compared to $13.6 million in 2007. The provision in 2008 included charges of $9.1 million for warehouse closing expenses, and impairment charges of $10.0 million, primarily related to a location in Michigan that was demolished and is being rebuilt. These charges were offset by $18.8 million of net gains on the sale of real property, largely former warehouse locations. 2007 vs. 2006 The net provision for impaired assets and closing costs was $13.6 million in 2007, compared to $5.5 million in 2006. In 2007, approximately $13.0 million of this provision related to the acceleration of depreciation on ten buildings that were relocated in 2008. The reserve for warehouse closing costs, classified within other current liabilities, at the end of 2008 and 2007 included: 2008 2007 Future lease obligations $ 4,505 $ 6,086 Other 24 737 Reserve for warehouse closing costs $ 4,529 $ 6,823 22 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Interest Expense 2008 2007 2006 Interest expense $ 102,636 $ 64,079 $ 12,570 2008 vs. 2007 Interest expense totaled $102.6 million in 2008 compared to $64.1 million in 2007. The increase in interest expense resulted primarily from the issuance of our $900 million of 5.3% and $1.1 billion of 5.5% Senior Notes (2007 Senior Notes) in February 2007, partially offset by lower interest expense resulting from the repayment in March 2007 of the $300 Million 5.5% Senior Notes. 2007 vs. 2006 Interest expense totaled $64.1 million in 2007 compared to $12.6 million in 2006. The increase in interest expense as compared to the prior year resulted primarily from the issuance of our 2007 Senior Notes, partially offset by lower interest expense resulting from the repayment of the $300 Million 5.5% Senior Notes in March 2007. In addition, interest expense decreased on the 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes (Zero Coupon Notes) as note holders converted approximately $61.2 million in principal amount of the Zero Coupon Notes into common stock, or $42.3 million after factoring in the related debt discount. Interest Income and Other 2008 2007 2006 Interest income $ 95,506 $ 128,413 $ 113,712 Earnings of affiliates 42,070 35,622 28,180 Minority interest and other (4,801 ) 1,449 (3,537 ) Interest Income and other $ 132,775 $ 165,484 $ 138,355 2008 vs. 2007 Interest income and other totaled $132.8 million in 2008, compared to $165.5 million in 2007. This decrease was largely due to lower interest rates, year over year, on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances. In addition, we recognized $5.0 million of other than temporary impairment losses on certain securities within our investment portfolio: $2.8 million, $1.4 million and $0.8 million in the second, third and fourth quarter, respectively of 2008. See further discussion in Liquidity and Capital Resources. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in the earnings of affiliates, primarily our investment in Costco Mexico (a 50% owned joint venture). 2007 vs. 2006 Interest income and other totaled $165.5 million in 2007, compared to $138.4 million in 2006. This increase was largely due to the increase in our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments resulting from increased earnings from operations and the proceeds of the issuance of the 2007 Senior Notes, as well as an increase in the earnings of affiliates, primarily our investment in Costco Mexico (a 50% owned joint venture). 23 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Provision for Income Taxes 2008 2007 2006 Income tax expense $ 716,249 $ 627,219 $ 648,202 Effective tax rate 35.83 % 36.68 % 37.01 % The effective income tax rate on earnings in 2008, 2007 and 2006 was 35.83%, 36.68% and 37.01%, respectively. The lower tax rate in 2008 was primarily attributable to non recurring benefits recognized during the year. Net Income 2008 2007 2006 Net income $ 1,282,725 $ 1,082,772 $ 1,103,215 Unusual items (net of tax) 119,496 Net income, as adjusted $ 1,282,725 $ 1,202,268 $ 1,103,215 Diluted earnings per share $ 2.89 $ 2.37 $ 2.30 Shares used to calculate diluted net income per common share 444,240 457,641 480,341 Diluted earnings per share increase 22 % 3 % 6 % 2008 vs. 2007 Net income for 2008 was $1.28 billion, or $2.89 per diluted share, compared to $1.08 billion, or $2.37 per diluted share, during 2007. The unusual items previously discussed totaled $119.5 million, net of tax, or $0.26 per diluted share in 2007. Exclusive of these items, earnings in 2007 were $2.63 per diluted share. Net income per diluted share in 2008 represents an increase of 10% over this adjusted amount. During 2008, we repurchased and retired 13.8 million shares of common stock, favorably impacting earnings per diluted share by approximately $0.03. 2007 vs. 2006 Net income for 2007 was $1.08 billion, or $2.37 per diluted share, compared to $1.10 billion, or $2.30 per diluted share during 2006. The unusual items previously discussed totaled $119.5 million, net of tax, or $0.26 per diluted share in 2007. Exclusive of these items, earnings for 2007 were $2.63 per diluted share, a 14% increase over the prior year. During 2007, we repurchased and retired 36.4 million shares of common stock, favorably impacting earnings per diluted share by approximately $0.03. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The following table itemizes our most liquid assets at the end of 2008 and 2007 (dollars in thousands): 2008 2007 Cash and cash equivalents $ 2,619,429 $ 2,779,733 Short term investments 655,584 575,787 Total $ 3,275,013 $ 3,355,520 24 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from warehouse operations and existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances, which were $3.28 billion and $3.36 billion at the end of 2008 and 2007, respectively. Of these balances, approximately $787.5 million and $655.2 million at the end of 2008 and 2007, respectively, represented debit and credit card receivables, primarily related to sales in the week prior to the end of the year. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $2.18 billion in 2008 compared to $2.08 billion in 2007, an increase of $99.8 million. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in net income of $200.0 million, an increase in depreciation and amortization and stock based compensation of $118.2 million, as well as an increase in cash flow from the change in operating assets, liabilities and deferred income taxes of $56.8 million, offset by an increase in net merchandise inventories (merchandise inventory less accounts payable) of $258.0 million. Net cash used in investing activities totaled $1.72 billion in 2008 compared to $655.3 million in 2007, an increase of approximately $1.06 billion. The increase in investing activities relates primarily to a decrease in cash provided by the net investment in short term investments of $534.1 million as a result of less cash needed to fund our decreased common stock repurchase activity. Additions to property and equipment related to warehouse expansion and remodel projects increased $212.9 million in 2008. Additionally, in the second quarter of 2008, $371.1 million formerly classified as cash and cash equivalents was reclassified to short term investments and other non current assets. In December 2007, one of our enhanced money fund investments, Columbia Strategic Cash Portfolio Fund (Columbia), ceased accepting cash redemption requests and changed to a floating net asset value. In light of the restricted liquidity, we elected to receive a pro rata allocation of the underlying securities in a separately managed account. We assessed the fair value of the underlying securities in this account through market quotations and review of current investment ratings, as available, coupled with the evaluation of the liquidation value of each investment and its current performance in meeting scheduled payments of principal and interest. In 2008, we recognized $5.0 million of other than temporary impairment losses related to these securities: $2.8 million, $1.4 million and $0.8 million in the second, third and fourth quarters, respectively. The losses are included in interest income and other in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. The markets relating to these investments remain uncertain, and there may be further declines in the value of these investments that may cause additional losses in future periods. At the end of 2008, the balance of the Columbia fund securities was $103.6 million on the consolidated balance sheet. Additionally, in December 2007, two other enhanced money fund investments, BlackRock Cash Strategies, LLC (BlackRock) and Merrill Lynch Capital Reserve Fund, LLC (Merrill Lynch), ceased accepting redemption requests. These two funds are being liquidated with periodic distributions and the expectation is that the funds will be completely liquidated by 2010. To date, the funds have maintained a $1.00 per unit net asset value. At the end of 2008, the combined balance of the BlackRock and Merrill Lynch funds was $125.1 million on our consolidated balance sheet and we received cash redemptions of $48.2 million from the BlackRock and Merrill Lynch funds subsequent to the end of the year and through October 14, 2008. At the end of 2008, $228.7 million remained in the Columbia, BlackRock and Merrill Lynch funds, with $160.7 million in short term investments and $68.0 million in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet, reflecting the timing of the expected distributions. 25 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) On September 18, 2008, one of our government agency money market funds, The Reserve U.S. Government Fund, announced that the proceeds from a redemption request for this fund would not be transmitted to an investor for a period of up to seven calendar days after the receipt of the redemption request. On September 22, 2008, the SEC granted a temporary order suspending shareholder redemptions as of September 17, 2008 and requiring The Reserve to create a plan to effect an orderly disposition, subject to supervision by the SEC. As of October 14, 2008, the plan to effect an orderly disposition of the U.S. Government Fund has not yet been publicly disclosed. At August 31, 2008 and October 14, 2008, we had $171.4 million and $317.2 million, respectively, invested in the fund. Although market conditions cannot be predicted, we currently do not expect to realize a loss on this fund. The latest per unit net asset value reported for the fund is $1.00. Subsequent to the end of 2008, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (Lehman) filed a petition under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. At August 31, 2008, we held $2.3 million of Lehman securities, within the Columbia portfolio, purchased by the fund manager prior to receipt of our pro rata allocation of the funds investments in December 2007. As of October 14, 2008, we do not have an estimate of the recovery value of the Lehman securities. Additionally, on September 29, 2008, one of Sigma Finance Corporations (Sigma) lenders terminated its repurchase agreements, followed by two additional lenders also terminating agreements. On September 30, 2008 Sigma received a notice of default, which is expected to cause lenders to move to seize Sigmas assets. Sigmas Board of Directors also announced they will cease trading. At August 31, 2008, we held Sigma securities with a market value of $2.2 million and a book value of $1.9 million, within the Columbia portfolio purchased by the fund manager prior to receipt of our pro rata allocation of the funds investments in December 2007. These securities were previously impaired during 2008 and $1.4 million was recorded as an other than temporary impairment. As of October 14, 2008, we do not have an estimate of the recovery value of these securities. Although future market conditions cannot be predicted, we currently do not expect future losses in our investment portfolio to be material to our consolidated financial statements or that we will experience a detriment to our overall liquidity. Net cash used in financing activities totaled $613.0 million in 2008 compared to $164.6 million in 2007. The $448.4 million increase in net cash used in financing activities primarily resulted from a net decrease in cash provided by the issuance of long term debt, net of repayments, of $1.65 billion, largely relating to the issuance of the 2007 Senior Notes. This decrease was partially offset by a reduction in the repurchase of common stock of $1.08 billion, and an increase in the net proceeds from short term borrowings of $76.7 million. Dividends In April 2008, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash dividend from $0.145 to $0.16 per share or $0.64 on an annualized basis. Our quarterly cash dividends paid in 2008 totaled $0.61 per share. In 2007, we paid quarterly cash dividends totaling $0.55 per share. 26 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Contractual Obligations Our commitments at year end to make future payments under contractual obligations were as follows, as of August 31, 2008 (amounts in thousands): Payments Due by Year Contractual obligations 2009 2010 to2011 2012 to2013 2014 andthereafter Total Purchase obligations (merchandise)(1) $ 4,163,530 $ 1,693 $ $ $ 4,165,223 Long term debt(2) 110,735 285,140 1,072,608 1,505,387 2,973,870 Operating leases(3) 139,916 277,885 247,634 1,438,390 2,103,825 Purchase obligations (property, equipment, services and other)(4) 211,311 44,406 1,206 256,923 Construction Commitments 289,730 289,730 Capital lease obligations and other(2) 6,243 6,483 495 5,655 18,876 Other(5) 15,723 4,406 2,405 6,113 28,647 Total $ 4,937,188 $ 620,013 $ 1,324,348 $ 2,955,545 $ 9,837,094 (1) Includes open merchandise purchase orders. (2) Includes contractual interest payments. (3) Operating lease obligations exclude amounts commonly referred to as common area maintenance, taxes and insurance and have been reduced by $149,468 to reflect sub lease income. (4) The amounts exclude certain services negotiated at the individual warehouse or regional level that are not significant and generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty. (5) Consists of asset retirement and deferred compensation obligations and includes $13,175 of current unrecognized tax benefits relating to uncertain tax positions, but excludes $39,699 of noncurrent unrecognized tax benefits due to uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash payments. Expansion Plans Our primary requirement for capital is the financing of land, building and equipment costs for new and remodeled warehouses. Capital is also required for initial warehouse operations and working capital. While there can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized and plans are subject to change upon further review, it is our current intention to spend approximately $1.7 billion during fiscal 2009 for real estate, construction, remodeling and equipment for warehouses and related operations. These expenditures are expected to be financed with a combination of cash provided from operations and existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. Plans for the United States and Canada during 2009 are to open approximately 24 to 28 new warehouses, inclusive of one to three relocations of existing warehouses to larger and better located facilities. We expect to continue our review of expansion plans in our international operations, including the United Kingdom and Asia, along with other international markets. 27 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Additional Equity Investments in Subsidiaries and Joint Ventures The Companys investments in the Costco Mexico joint venture and in other unconsolidated joint ventures that are less than majority owned are accounted for under the equity method. In 2006, we contributed an additional $15 million to our investment in Costco Mexico (a 50% owned joint venture), which did not impact our percentage ownership of this entity, as our joint venture partner contributed a like amount. There were no such contributions in 2008 and 2007.

For those entities with multi purpose lines, any increase in either letters of credit (standby and or commercial) issuance and or short term borrowing will result in a corresponding decrease in available credit. Financing Activities On June 16, 2008, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary entered into a ten year term loan in the amount of $27.6 million, with a variable rate of interest of Yen TIBOR (6 month) plus a 0.35% margin (1.24% at August 31, 2008) on the outstanding balance. The net proceeds were used to repay the 1.187% Promissory Notes due in July 2008 and for general corporate purposes. Interest is payable semi annually in December and June, with the first payment due in December 2008 and principal is due in June 2018. 29 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) On October 17, 2007, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued Promissory Notes through a private placement in the amount of $59.8 million, bearing interest at 2.695%. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due in October 2017. The proceeds were used to repay the 2.070% Promissory Notes due in October 2007 and for general corporate purposes. In February 2007, we issued $900 million of 5.3% Senior Notes due March 15, 2012 at a discount of $2.5 million and $1.1 billion of 5.5% Senior Notes due March 15, 2017 at a discount of $5.9 million (together, the 2007 Senior Notes). Interest on the 2007 Senior Notes is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The discount and issuance costs associated with the 2007 Senior Notes are being amortized to interest expense over the terms of those notes. At our option, we may redeem the 2007 Senior Notes at any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount of the 2007 Senior Notes to be redeemed, or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, we will be required to make an offer to purchase the 2007 Senior Notes at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase, upon certain events as defined by the terms of the 2007 Senior Notes. In April 2003, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.92% in the amount of $36.8 million, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due in April 2010. In November 2002, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.88% in the aggregate amount of $27.6 million, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due in November 2009. The U.S. Parent Company, Costco Wholesale Corporation guarantees all of the promissory notes issued by our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary. In August 1997, we sold $900.0 million principal amount at maturity Zero Coupon Notes due in August 2017. The Zero Coupon Notes were priced with a yield to maturity of 3.5%, resulting in gross proceeds to us of $449.6 million. The notes outstanding are convertible into a maximum of 1.5 million shares of Costco Common Stock shares at an initial conversion price of $22.71. Holders of the Zero Coupon Notes may require us to purchase the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of purchase) in August 2012. We may redeem, at our option, the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of redemption) any time after August 2002. As of August 31, 2008, $832.9 million in principal amount of the Zero Coupon Notes had been converted by note holders to shares of Costco Common Stock, of which $0.5 million and $61.2 million in principal were converted in 2008 and 2007, respectively, or $0.4 million and $42.3 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively, after factoring in the related debt discount. Derivatives We follow Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (as amended) (SFAS 133), in accounting for derivative and hedging activities. We use derivative and hedging arrangements only to manage what we believe to be well defined risks. Forward foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on inventory purchases and typically have very short terms. These forward contracts do not qualify for derivative hedge accounting. The aggregate notional amount of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at the end of 2008 and 2007 was $89.8 million and $75.0 million, respectively. The mark to market adjustment related to these contracts resulted in the recording of an asset of $4.6 million and a liability of $0.9 million at the end of 2008 and 2007, respectively, and $5.8 million and $0.4 million were recognized in interest income and other in the consolidated statements of income in 2008 and 2007, respectively. The majority of the forward foreign exchange contracts were entered into by our wholly owned United Kingdom subsidiary, primarily to hedge U.S. dollar merchandise inventory purchases. 30 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) We are exposed to risks in energy costs due to fluctuations in energy prices, particularly electricity, which we partially mitigate through the use of fixed price contracts with counterparties for approximately 19% of our warehouses in the U.S. and Canada, as well as certain depots and other facilities. We have also entered into variable priced contracts for the purchase of natural gas and fuel for our gas stations on an index basis. These contracts qualify for treatment as normal purchase or normal sales under SFAS 133 and require no mark to market adjustment. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements With the exception of our operating leases, we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition or consolidated financial statements. Stock Repurchase Programs In September and November of 2007, our Board of Directors approved $300.0 million and $1.0 billion, respectively, of stock repurchases, both expiring in 2010. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an additional $1.0 billion expiring in 2011, bringing total authorizations by our Board of Directors since inception of the program in 2001 to $6.80 billion. During 2008, we repurchased 13.8 million shares at an average price of $64.22 totaling approximately $886.9 million. During 2007, we repurchased 36.4 million shares of common stock, at an average price of $54.39, totaling approximately $1.98 billion. The remaining amount available to be purchased under our approved plan was approximately $2.06 billion at the end of 2008. Purchases are made from time to time as conditions warrant in the open market or in block purchases, and pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5 1. Repurchased shares are retired, in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments. We continue to review our accounting policies and evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, merchandise inventory valuation, impairment of long lived assets, warehouse closing costs, insurance/self insurance liabilities, investments and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. Revenue Recognition We generally recognize sales, net of estimated returns, at the time the member takes possession of merchandise or receives services. When we collect payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services, the amount received is generally recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed. We provide for estimated sales returns based on historical merchandise returns levels. Amounts collected from members, which under common trade practices are referred to as sales taxes, are recorded on a net basis. We evaluate the criteria of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal Versus Net as an Agent, in determining whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, when we are the primary obligor, subject to inventory risk, 31 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, influence product or service specifications, or have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded on a gross basis. If we are not the primary obligor and do not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above, we record the net amounts as commissions earned, which is reflected in net sales. Membership fee revenue represents annual membership fees paid by substantially all of our members. We account for membership fee revenue on a deferred basis, whereby revenue is recognized ratably over the one year membership period. In 2007, we performed a detailed analysis of the timing of recognition of membership fees based on each members specific renewal date, as this methodology represented an improvement over the historical method, which was based on the period in which the fee was collected. This review resulted in a $56.2 million reduction to membership fee revenue in 2007 and a corresponding increase to deferred membership fees on our consolidated balance sheet. This adjustment included both a change in method of applying an accounting principle to a preferable method and a correction for cumulative timing errors. Our Executive members qualify for a 2% reward (which can be redeemed only at Costco warehouses), up to a maximum of $500 per year, on all qualified purchases made at Costco. We account for this 2% reward as a reduction in sales, with the related liability being classified within other current liabilities. The sales reduction and corresponding liability are computed after giving effect to the estimated impact of non redemptions based on historical data. Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, as determined primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting, and are stated using the last in, first out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all other foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail inventory method of accounting and are stated using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. We believe the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. We record an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the expected annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end. The LIFO inventory adjustment in 2008 reduced ending inventory and gross margin by $32.3 million. At the end of 2007, merchandise inventories valued at LIFO approximated FIFO after considering the lower of cost or market principle. We provide for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts as a percentage of net sales. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect results of the actual physical inventory counts, which generally occur in the second and fourth quarters of the year. Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as we progress toward earning those rebates, provided they are probable and reasonably estimable. Other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of agreement, or other systematic and rational approaches. Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Warehouse Closing costs We periodically evaluate our long lived assets for indicators of impairment, such as a decision to relocate or close a warehouse location. Our judgments are based on existing market and operational conditions. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring a downward adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value. 32 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) We provide estimates for warehouse closing costs for both leased and owned locations to be closed or relocated. A considerable amount of judgment is involved in determining any impairment or our net liability, particularly related to the estimated sales price of owned locations and the potential sublease income at leased locations. These estimates are based on real estate conditions in the markets and our experience in those markets. We make assumptions about the average period of time it would take to sublease the location and the amount of potential sublease income for each leased location. We reassess our liability each quarter and adjust our liability accordingly when our estimates change. Insurance/Self Insurance Liabilities We use a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance pool, to provide for potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property damage, director and officers liability, vehicle liability and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience and evaluations of outside experts, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Investments Investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other than temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and our intent and ability to hold the investment. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the issuer, including industry and sector performance, operational and financing cash flow factors, and rating agency actions. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and or issuer conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments. Income Taxes We adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48), which sets out criteria for the use of judgment in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items, at the beginning of 2008. The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Significant judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions. The benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in our financial statements only after determining a more likely than not probability that the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge, if any, from tax authorities. When facts and circumstances change, we reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the financial statements as appropriate. 33 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Recent Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157), which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements required under other accounting pronouncements. It does not change existing guidance as to whether or not an instrument is carried at fair value. SFAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 157 1 (FSP FAS 157 1), which excludes SFAS No. 13, Accounting for Leases and certain other accounting pronouncements that address fair value measurements under SFAS 13, from the scope of SFAS 157. In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. 157 2 (FSP 157 2), which provides a one year delayed application of SFAS 157 for nonfinancial assets and liabilities, except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). We are required to adopt SFAS 157 as amended by FSP FAS 157 1 and FSP FAS 157 2 on September 1, 2008, the beginning of our fiscal 2009. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In October 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 157 3, Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset in a Market That Is Not Active (FSP 157 3), which clarifies the application of SFAS 157 when the market for a financial asset is inactive. Specifically, FSP 157 3 clarifies how (1) managements internal assumptions should be considered in measuring fair value when observable data are not present, (2) observable market information from an inactive market should be taken into account, and (3) the use of broker quotes or pricing services should be considered in assessing the relevance of observable and unobservable data to measure fair value. The guidance in FSP 157 3 is effective immediately and will apply to us upon adoption of SFAS 157. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, Including an Amendment to FASB No. 115 (SFAS 159). Under SFAS 159, entities may elect to measure specified financial instruments and warranty and insurance contracts at fair value on a contract by contract basis, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings each reporting period. The election, called the fair value option, will enable entities to achieve an offset accounting effect for changes in fair value of certain related assets and liabilities without having to apply more complex hedge accounting provisions. SFAS 159 will be effective for us September 1, 2008, the beginning of our fiscal 2009. We do not intend to elect the fair value option for any of our existing financial assets or financial liabilities; therefore, this statement is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In June 2008, the FASB issued Staff Position EITF 03 06 1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities (FSP EITF 03 06 1). FSP EITF 03 06 1 provides that unvested share based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (whether paid or unpaid) are participating securities and shall be included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two class method in SFAS No. 128, Earnings per Share. Our unvested RSUs are not eligible to receive dividends; therefore EITF 03 06 1 will not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an Amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin No 51 (SFAS 160). SFAS 160 establishes accounting and reporting standards for ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent, changes in a parents ownership of a noncontrolling interest, calculation and disclosure of the consolidated net income attributable to the parent and the noncontrolling interest, 34 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) changes in a parents ownership interest while the parent retains its controlling financial interest and fair value measurement of any retained noncontrolling equity investment. SFAS 160 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is prohibited. We must adopt these new requirements in our first quarter of fiscal 2010. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141R, Business Combinations (SFAS 141R), which establishes principles and requirements for the reporting entity in a business combination, including recognition and measurement in the financial statements of the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree. SFAS 141R applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years. We must adopt these new requirements in our first quarter of fiscal 2010. In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 133 (SFAS 161), which requires enhanced disclosures about derivative and hedging activities. This statement is effective for financial statements issued for periods beginning after November 15, 2008. Early adoption is permitted. We must provide these new disclosures no later than our second quarter of fiscal 2009. We are in the process of evaluating the impact that adoption of SFAS Nos. 141R, 160 and 161 will have on our future consolidated financial statements. Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to financial market risk resulting from changes in interest and foreign currency rates. We do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions, nor hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. Recent developments in the financial markets, however, have rendered risks less predictable, and liquidity concerns and credit risks have increased. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our money market funds, debt securities, corporate notes and bonds and enhanced money funds with effective maturities of generally three months to five years at the date of purchase. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while generating yields without significantly increasing risk. Historically, this was accomplished by investing in high investment grade securities with a minimum overall portfolio average credit rating of AA . A revised investment policy was approved in December 2007 by our Board of Directors, limiting future investments to direct U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations, repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations and U.S. Government and Government Agency Money Market funds. The investment policies of our subsidiaries have been reviewed and are consistent with our primary objective to preserve principal while generating yields without significantly leveraging risk. Our wholly owned insurance subsidiary invests in U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations, corporate notes and bonds and asset and mortgage backed securities with a minimum overall portfolio average credit rating of AA . All of our foreign subsidiaries investments are primarily in money market funds, investment grade securities, bankers acceptances, bank certificates of deposit and term deposits all denominated in their local currencies. Additionally, our Canadian subsidiary may invest a portion of their investments in 35 Table of Contents Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) U.S. dollar investment grade securities and bank term deposits to meet current U.S. dollar obligations. All of the investment policies of the Company and subsidiaries are reviewed at least annually. As the majority of these investments in cash and cash equivalents are of a short term nature, if interest rates were to increase or decrease, there is no material risk of a material valuation adjustment related to these instruments. Based on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances at the end of 2008, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $17.9 million (pre tax) to interest income on an annual basis. For those investments that are classified as available for sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in market volatility and interest rates are reflected within stockholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive income. The nature and amount of our long and short term debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As of the end of 2008, our fixed rate long term debt included: $67.1 million principal amount at maturity of 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes carried at $49.1 million; $900.0 million of 5.3% Senior Notes carried at $898.3 million; and $1.10 billion of 5.5% Senior Notes carried at $1.09 billion and additional notes and capital lease obligations totaling $142.0 million. Additionally, our variable rate long term debt included a 0.35% over Yen Tibor (6 month) Term Loan of $27.6 million. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt and may affect the interest expense related to the variable rate debt. Most transactions of our foreign subsidiaries are conducted in local currencies, limiting our exposure to changes in currency rates. The majority of the forward foreign exchange contracts were entered into by our wholly owned United Kingdom subsidiary, primarily to hedge U.S. dollar merchandise inventory purchases. We periodically enter into short term forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates on inventory purchases. The notional value of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at the end of 2008 was $89.8 million. 
 
Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Interest Expense 2008 2007 2006 Interest expense $ 102,636 $ 64,079 $ 12,570 2008 vs. 2007 Interest expense totaled $102.6 million in 2008 compared to $64.1 million in 2007. The increase in interest expense resulted primarily from the issuance of our $900 million of 5.3% and $1.1 billion of 5.5% Senior Notes (2007 Senior Notes) in February 2007, partially offset by lower interest expense resulting from the repayment in March 2007 of the $300 Million 5.5% Senior Notes. 2007 vs. 2006 Interest expense totaled $64.1 million in 2007 compared to $12.6 million in 2006. The increase in interest expense as compared to the prior year resulted primarily from the issuance of our 2007 Senior Notes, partially offset by lower interest expense resulting from the repayment of the $300 Million 5.5% Senior Notes in March 2007. In addition, interest expense decreased on the 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes (Zero Coupon Notes) as note holders converted approximately $61.2 million in principal amount of the Zero Coupon Notes into common stock, or $42.3 million after factoring in the related debt discount. Interest Income and Other 2008 2007 2006 Interest income $ 95,506 $ 128,413 $ 113,712 Earnings of affiliates 42,070 35,622 28,180 Minority interest and other (4,801 ) 1,449 (3,537 ) Interest Income and other $ 132,775 $ 165,484 $ 138,355 2008 vs. 2007 Interest income and other totaled $132.8 million in 2008, compared to $165.5 million in 2007. This decrease was largely due to lower interest rates, year over year, on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances. In addition, we recognized $5.0 million of other than temporary impairment losses on certain securities within our investment portfolio: $2.8 million, $1.4 million and $0.8 million in the second, third and fourth quarter, respectively of 2008. See further discussion in Liquidity and Capital Resources. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in the earnings of affiliates, primarily our investment in Costco Mexico (a 50% owned joint venture). 2007 vs. 2006 Interest income and other totaled $165.5 million in 2007, compared to $138.4 million in 2006. This increase was largely due to the increase in our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments resulting from increased earnings from operations and the proceeds of the issuance of the 2007 Senior Notes, as well as an increase in the earnings of affiliates, primarily our investment in Costco Mexico (a 50% owned joint venture). 23 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Provision for Income Taxes 2008 2007 2006 Income tax expense $ 716,249 $ 627,219 $ 648,202 Effective tax rate 35.83 % 36.68 % 37.01 % The effective income tax rate on earnings in 2008, 2007 and 2006 was 35.83%, 36.68% and 37.01%, respectively. The lower tax rate in 2008 was primarily attributable to non recurring benefits recognized during the year. Net Income 2008 2007 2006 Net income $ 1,282,725 $ 1,082,772 $ 1,103,215 Unusual items (net of tax) 119,496 Net income, as adjusted $ 1,282,725 $ 1,202,268 $ 1,103,215 Diluted earnings per share $ 2.89 $ 2.37 $ 2.30 Shares used to calculate diluted net income per common share 444,240 457,641 480,341 Diluted earnings per share increase 22 % 3 % 6 % 2008 vs. 2007 Net income for 2008 was $1.28 billion, or $2.89 per diluted share, compared to $1.08 billion, or $2.37 per diluted share, during 2007. The unusual items previously discussed totaled $119.5 million, net of tax, or $0.26 per diluted share in 2007. Exclusive of these items, earnings in 2007 were $2.63 per diluted share. Net income per diluted share in 2008 represents an increase of 10% over this adjusted amount. During 2008, we repurchased and retired 13.8 million shares of common stock, favorably impacting earnings per diluted share by approximately $0.03. 2007 vs. 2006 Net income for 2007 was $1.08 billion, or $2.37 per diluted share, compared to $1.10 billion, or $2.30 per diluted share during 2006. The unusual items previously discussed totaled $119.5 million, net of tax, or $0.26 per diluted share in 2007. Exclusive of these items, earnings for 2007 were $2.63 per diluted share, a 14% increase over the prior year. During 2007, we repurchased and retired 36.4 million shares of common stock, favorably impacting earnings per diluted share by approximately $0.03. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The following table itemizes our most liquid assets at the end of 2008 and 2007 (dollars in thousands): 2008 2007 Cash and cash equivalents $ 2,619,429 $ 2,779,733 Short term investments 655,584 575,787 Total $ 3,275,013 $ 3,355,520 24 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from warehouse operations and existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances, which were $3.28 billion and $3.36 billion at the end of 2008 and 2007, respectively. Of these balances, approximately $787.5 million and $655.2 million at the end of 2008 and 2007, respectively, represented debit and credit card receivables, primarily related to sales in the week prior to the end of the year. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $2.18 billion in 2008 compared to $2.08 billion in 2007, an increase of $99.8 million. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in net income of $200.0 million, an increase in depreciation and amortization and stock based compensation of $118.2 million, as well as an increase in cash flow from the change in operating assets, liabilities and deferred income taxes of $56.8 million, offset by an increase in net merchandise inventories (merchandise inventory less accounts payable) of $258.0 million. Net cash used in investing activities totaled $1.72 billion in 2008 compared to $655.3 million in 2007, an increase of approximately $1.06 billion. The increase in investing activities relates primarily to a decrease in cash provided by the net investment in short term investments of $534.1 million as a result of less cash needed to fund our decreased common stock repurchase activity. Additions to property and equipment related to warehouse expansion and remodel projects increased $212.9 million in 2008. Additionally, in the second quarter of 2008, $371.1 million formerly classified as cash and cash equivalents was reclassified to short term investments and other non current assets. In December 2007, one of our enhanced money fund investments, Columbia Strategic Cash Portfolio Fund (Columbia), ceased accepting cash redemption requests and changed to a floating net asset value. In light of the restricted liquidity, we elected to receive a pro rata allocation of the underlying securities in a separately managed account. We assessed the fair value of the underlying securities in this account through market quotations and review of current investment ratings, as available, coupled with the evaluation of the liquidation value of each investment and its current performance in meeting scheduled payments of principal and interest. In 2008, we recognized $5.0 million of other than temporary impairment losses related to these securities: $2.8 million, $1.4 million and $0.8 million in the second, third and fourth quarters, respectively. The losses are included in interest income and other in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. The markets relating to these investments remain uncertain, and there may be further declines in the value of these investments that may cause additional losses in future periods. At the end of 2008, the balance of the Columbia fund securities was $103.6 million on the consolidated balance sheet. Additionally, in December 2007, two other enhanced money fund investments, BlackRock Cash Strategies, LLC (BlackRock) and Merrill Lynch Capital Reserve Fund, LLC (Merrill Lynch), ceased accepting redemption requests. These two funds are being liquidated with periodic distributions and the expectation is that the funds will be completely liquidated by 2010. To date, the funds have maintained a $1.00 per unit net asset value. At the end of 2008, the combined balance of the BlackRock and Merrill Lynch funds was $125.1 million on our consolidated balance sheet and we received cash redemptions of $48.2 million from the BlackRock and Merrill Lynch funds subsequent to the end of the year and through October 14, 2008. At the end of 2008, $228.7 million remained in the Columbia, BlackRock and Merrill Lynch funds, with $160.7 million in short term investments and $68.0 million in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet, reflecting the timing of the expected distributions. 25 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) On September 18, 2008, one of our government agency money market funds, The Reserve U.S. Government Fund, announced that the proceeds from a redemption request for this fund would not be transmitted to an investor for a period of up to seven calendar days after the receipt of the redemption request. On September 22, 2008, the SEC granted a temporary order suspending shareholder redemptions as of September 17, 2008 and requiring The Reserve to create a plan to effect an orderly disposition, subject to supervision by the SEC. As of October 14, 2008, the plan to effect an orderly disposition of the U.S. Government Fund has not yet been publicly disclosed. At August 31, 2008 and October 14, 2008, we had $171.4 million and $317.2 million, respectively, invested in the fund. Although market conditions cannot be predicted, we currently do not expect to realize a loss on this fund. The latest per unit net asset value reported for the fund is $1.00. Subsequent to the end of 2008, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (Lehman) filed a petition under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. At August 31, 2008, we held $2.3 million of Lehman securities, within the Columbia portfolio, purchased by the fund manager prior to receipt of our pro rata allocation of the funds investments in December 2007. As of October 14, 2008, we do not have an estimate of the recovery value of the Lehman securities. Additionally, on September 29, 2008, one of Sigma Finance Corporations (Sigma) lenders terminated its repurchase agreements, followed by two additional lenders also terminating agreements. On September 30, 2008 Sigma received a notice of default, which is expected to cause lenders to move to seize Sigmas assets. Sigmas Board of Directors also announced they will cease trading. At August 31, 2008, we held Sigma securities with a market value of $2.2 million and a book value of $1.9 million, within the Columbia portfolio purchased by the fund manager prior to receipt of our pro rata allocation of the funds investments in December 2007. These securities were previously impaired during 2008 and $1.4 million was recorded as an other than temporary impairment. As of October 14, 2008, we do not have an estimate of the recovery value of these securities. Although future market conditions cannot be predicted, we currently do not expect future losses in our investment portfolio to be material to our consolidated financial statements or that we will experience a detriment to our overall liquidity. Net cash used in financing activities totaled $613.0 million in 2008 compared to $164.6 million in 2007. The $448.4 million increase in net cash used in financing activities primarily resulted from a net decrease in cash provided by the issuance of long term debt, net of repayments, of $1.65 billion, largely relating to the issuance of the 2007 Senior Notes. This decrease was partially offset by a reduction in the repurchase of common stock of $1.08 billion, and an increase in the net proceeds from short term borrowings of $76.7 million. Dividends In April 2008, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash dividend from $0.145 to $0.16 per share or $0.64 on an annualized basis. Our quarterly cash dividends paid in 2008 totaled $0.61 per share. In 2007, we paid quarterly cash dividends totaling $0.55 per share. 26 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Contractual Obligations Our commitments at year end to make future payments under contractual obligations were as follows, as of August 31, 2008 (amounts in thousands): Payments Due by Year Contractual obligations 2009 2010 to2011 2012 to2013 2014 andthereafter Total Purchase obligations (merchandise)(1) $ 4,163,530 $ 1,693 $ $ $ 4,165,223 Long term debt(2) 110,735 285,140 1,072,608 1,505,387 2,973,870 Operating leases(3) 139,916 277,885 247,634 1,438,390 2,103,825 Purchase obligations (property, equipment, services and other)(4) 211,311 44,406 1,206 256,923 Construction Commitments 289,730 289,730 Capital lease obligations and other(2) 6,243 6,483 495 5,655 18,876 Other(5) 15,723 4,406 2,405 6,113 28,647 Total $ 4,937,188 $ 620,013 $ 1,324,348 $ 2,955,545 $ 9,837,094 (1) Includes open merchandise purchase orders.

(4) The amounts exclude certain services negotiated at the individual warehouse or regional level that are not significant and generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty. (5) Consists of asset retirement and deferred compensation obligations and includes $13,175 of current unrecognized tax benefits relating to uncertain tax positions, but excludes $39,699 of noncurrent unrecognized tax benefits due to uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash payments. Expansion Plans Our primary requirement for capital is the financing of land, building and equipment costs for new and remodeled warehouses. Capital is also required for initial warehouse operations and working capital. While there can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized and plans are subject to change upon further review, it is our current intention to spend approximately $1.7 billion during fiscal 2009 for real estate, construction, remodeling and equipment for warehouses and related operations. These expenditures are expected to be financed with a combination of cash provided from operations and existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. Plans for the United States and Canada during 2009 are to open approximately 24 to 28 new warehouses, inclusive of one to three relocations of existing warehouses to larger and better located facilities. We expect to continue our review of expansion plans in our international operations, including the United Kingdom and Asia, along with other international markets. 27 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Additional Equity Investments in Subsidiaries and Joint Ventures The Companys investments in the Costco Mexico joint venture and in other unconsolidated joint ventures that are less than majority owned are accounted for under the equity method. In 2006, we contributed an additional $15 million to our investment in Costco Mexico (a 50% owned joint venture), which did not impact our percentage ownership of this entity, as our joint venture partner contributed a like amount. There were no such contributions in 2008 and 2007.

For those entities with multi purpose lines, any increase in either letters of credit (standby and or commercial) issuance and or short term borrowing will result in a corresponding decrease in available credit. Financing Activities On June 16, 2008, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary entered into a ten year term loan in the amount of $27.6 million, with a variable rate of interest of Yen TIBOR (6 month) plus a 0.35% margin (1.24% at August 31, 2008) on the outstanding balance. The net proceeds were used to repay the 1.187% Promissory Notes due in July 2008 and for general corporate purposes. Interest is payable semi annually in December and June, with the first payment due in December 2008 and principal is due in June 2018. 29 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) On October 17, 2007, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued Promissory Notes through a private placement in the amount of $59.8 million, bearing interest at 2.695%. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due in October 2017. The proceeds were used to repay the 2.070% Promissory Notes due in October 2007 and for general corporate purposes. In February 2007, we issued $900 million of 5.3% Senior Notes due March 15, 2012 at a discount of $2.5 million and $1.1 billion of 5.5% Senior Notes due March 15, 2017 at a discount of $5.9 million (together, the 2007 Senior Notes). Interest on the 2007 Senior Notes is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The discount and issuance costs associated with the 2007 Senior Notes are being amortized to interest expense over the terms of those notes. At our option, we may redeem the 2007 Senior Notes at any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount of the 2007 Senior Notes to be redeemed, or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, we will be required to make an offer to purchase the 2007 Senior Notes at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase, upon certain events as defined by the terms of the 2007 Senior Notes. In April 2003, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.92% in the amount of $36.8 million, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due in April 2010. In November 2002, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.88% in the aggregate amount of $27.6 million, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due in November 2009. The U.S. Parent Company, Costco Wholesale Corporation guarantees all of the promissory notes issued by our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary. In August 1997, we sold $900.0 million principal amount at maturity Zero Coupon Notes due in August 2017. The Zero Coupon Notes were priced with a yield to maturity of 3.5%, resulting in gross proceeds to us of $449.6 million. The notes outstanding are convertible into a maximum of 1.5 million shares of Costco Common Stock shares at an initial conversion price of $22.71. Holders of the Zero Coupon Notes may require us to purchase the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of purchase) in August 2012. We may redeem, at our option, the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of redemption) any time after August 2002. As of August 31, 2008, $832.9 million in principal amount of the Zero Coupon Notes had been converted by note holders to shares of Costco Common Stock, of which $0.5 million and $61.2 million in principal were converted in 2008 and 2007, respectively, or $0.4 million and $42.3 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively, after factoring in the related debt discount. Derivatives We follow Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (as amended) (SFAS 133), in accounting for derivative and hedging activities. We use derivative and hedging arrangements only to manage what we believe to be well defined risks. Forward foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on inventory purchases and typically have very short terms. These forward contracts do not qualify for derivative hedge accounting. The aggregate notional amount of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at the end of 2008 and 2007 was $89.8 million and $75.0 million, respectively. The mark to market adjustment related to these contracts resulted in the recording of an asset of $4.6 million and a liability of $0.9 million at the end of 2008 and 2007, respectively, and $5.8 million and $0.4 million were recognized in interest income and other in the consolidated statements of income in 2008 and 2007, respectively. The majority of the forward foreign exchange contracts were entered into by our wholly owned United Kingdom subsidiary, primarily to hedge U.S. dollar merchandise inventory purchases. 30 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) We are exposed to risks in energy costs due to fluctuations in energy prices, particularly electricity, which we partially mitigate through the use of fixed price contracts with counterparties for approximately 19% of our warehouses in the U.S. and Canada, as well as certain depots and other facilities. We have also entered into variable priced contracts for the purchase of natural gas and fuel for our gas stations on an index basis. These contracts qualify for treatment as normal purchase or normal sales under SFAS 133 and require no mark to market adjustment. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements With the exception of our operating leases, we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition or consolidated financial statements. Stock Repurchase Programs In September and November of 2007, our Board of Directors approved $300.0 million and $1.0 billion, respectively, of stock repurchases, both expiring in 2010. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an additional $1.0 billion expiring in 2011, bringing total authorizations by our Board of Directors since inception of the program in 2001 to $6.80 billion. During 2008, we repurchased 13.8 million shares at an average price of $64.22 totaling approximately $886.9 million. During 2007, we repurchased 36.4 million shares of common stock, at an average price of $54.39, totaling approximately $1.98 billion. The remaining amount available to be purchased under our approved plan was approximately $2.06 billion at the end of 2008. Purchases are made from time to time as conditions warrant in the open market or in block purchases, and pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5 1. Repurchased shares are retired, in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments. We continue to review our accounting policies and evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, merchandise inventory valuation, impairment of long lived assets, warehouse closing costs, insurance/self insurance liabilities, investments and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. Revenue Recognition We generally recognize sales, net of estimated returns, at the time the member takes possession of merchandise or receives services. When we collect payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services, the amount received is generally recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed. We provide for estimated sales returns based on historical merchandise returns levels. Amounts collected from members, which under common trade practices are referred to as sales taxes, are recorded on a net basis. We evaluate the criteria of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal Versus Net as an Agent, in determining whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, when we are the primary obligor, subject to inventory risk, 31 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, influence product or service specifications, or have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded on a gross basis. If we are not the primary obligor and do not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above, we record the net amounts as commissions earned, which is reflected in net sales. Membership fee revenue represents annual membership fees paid by substantially all of our members. We account for membership fee revenue on a deferred basis, whereby revenue is recognized ratably over the one year membership period. In 2007, we performed a detailed analysis of the timing of recognition of membership fees based on each members specific renewal date, as this methodology represented an improvement over the historical method, which was based on the period in which the fee was collected. This review resulted in a $56.2 million reduction to membership fee revenue in 2007 and a corresponding increase to deferred membership fees on our consolidated balance sheet. This adjustment included both a change in method of applying an accounting principle to a preferable method and a correction for cumulative timing errors. Our Executive members qualify for a 2% reward (which can be redeemed only at Costco warehouses), up to a maximum of $500 per year, on all qualified purchases made at Costco. We account for this 2% reward as a reduction in sales, with the related liability being classified within other current liabilities. The sales reduction and corresponding liability are computed after giving effect to the estimated impact of non redemptions based on historical data. Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, as determined primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting, and are stated using the last in, first out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all other foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail inventory method of accounting and are stated using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. We believe the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. We record an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the expected annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end. The LIFO inventory adjustment in 2008 reduced ending inventory and gross margin by $32.3 million. At the end of 2007, merchandise inventories valued at LIFO approximated FIFO after considering the lower of cost or market principle. We provide for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts as a percentage of net sales. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect results of the actual physical inventory counts, which generally occur in the second and fourth quarters of the year. Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as we progress toward earning those rebates, provided they are probable and reasonably estimable. Other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of agreement, or other systematic and rational approaches. Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Warehouse Closing costs We periodically evaluate our long lived assets for indicators of impairment, such as a decision to relocate or close a warehouse location. Our judgments are based on existing market and operational conditions. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring a downward adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value. 32 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) We provide estimates for warehouse closing costs for both leased and owned locations to be closed or relocated. A considerable amount of judgment is involved in determining any impairment or our net liability, particularly related to the estimated sales price of owned locations and the potential sublease income at leased locations. These estimates are based on real estate conditions in the markets and our experience in those markets. We make assumptions about the average period of time it would take to sublease the location and the amount of potential sublease income for each leased location. We reassess our liability each quarter and adjust our liability accordingly when our estimates change. Insurance/Self Insurance Liabilities We use a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance pool, to provide for potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property damage, director and officers liability, vehicle liability and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience and evaluations of outside experts, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Investments Investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other than temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and our intent and ability to hold the investment. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the issuer, including industry and sector performance, operational and financing cash flow factors, and rating agency actions. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and or issuer conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments. Income Taxes We adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48), which sets out criteria for the use of judgment in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items, at the beginning of 2008. The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Significant judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions. The benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in our financial statements only after determining a more likely than not probability that the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge, if any, from tax authorities. When facts and circumstances change, we reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the financial statements as appropriate. 33 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Recent Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157), which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements required under other accounting pronouncements. It does not change existing guidance as to whether or not an instrument is carried at fair value. SFAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 157 1 (FSP FAS 157 1), which excludes SFAS No. 13, Accounting for Leases and certain other accounting pronouncements that address fair value measurements under SFAS 13, from the scope of SFAS 157. In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. 157 2 (FSP 157 2), which provides a one year delayed application of SFAS 157 for nonfinancial assets and liabilities, except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). We are required to adopt SFAS 157 as amended by FSP FAS 157 1 and FSP FAS 157 2 on September 1, 2008, the beginning of our fiscal 2009. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In October 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 157 3, Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset in a Market That Is Not Active (FSP 157 3), which clarifies the application of SFAS 157 when the market for a financial asset is inactive. Specifically, FSP 157 3 clarifies how (1) managements internal assumptions should be considered in measuring fair value when observable data are not present, (2) observable market information from an inactive market should be taken into account, and (3) the use of broker quotes or pricing services should be considered in assessing the relevance of observable and unobservable data to measure fair value. The guidance in FSP 157 3 is effective immediately and will apply to us upon adoption of SFAS 157. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, Including an Amendment to FASB No. 115 (SFAS 159). Under SFAS 159, entities may elect to measure specified financial instruments and warranty and insurance contracts at fair value on a contract by contract basis, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings each reporting period. The election, called the fair value option, will enable entities to achieve an offset accounting effect for changes in fair value of certain related assets and liabilities without having to apply more complex hedge accounting provisions. SFAS 159 will be effective for us September 1, 2008, the beginning of our fiscal 2009. We do not intend to elect the fair value option for any of our existing financial assets or financial liabilities; therefore, this statement is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In June 2008, the FASB issued Staff Position EITF 03 06 1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities (FSP EITF 03 06 1). FSP EITF 03 06 1 provides that unvested share based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (whether paid or unpaid) are participating securities and shall be included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two class method in SFAS No. 128, Earnings per Share. Our unvested RSUs are not eligible to receive dividends; therefore EITF 03 06 1 will not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an Amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin No 51 (SFAS 160). SFAS 160 establishes accounting and reporting standards for ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent, changes in a parents ownership of a noncontrolling interest, calculation and disclosure of the consolidated net income attributable to the parent and the noncontrolling interest, 34 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) changes in a parents ownership interest while the parent retains its controlling financial interest and fair value measurement of any retained noncontrolling equity investment. SFAS 160 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is prohibited. We must adopt these new requirements in our first quarter of fiscal 2010. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141R, Business Combinations (SFAS 141R), which establishes principles and requirements for the reporting entity in a business combination, including recognition and measurement in the financial statements of the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree. SFAS 141R applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years. We must adopt these new requirements in our first quarter of fiscal 2010. In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 133 (SFAS 161), which requires enhanced disclosures about derivative and hedging activities. This statement is effective for financial statements issued for periods beginning after November 15, 2008. Early adoption is permitted. We must provide these new disclosures no later than our second quarter of fiscal 2009. We are in the process of evaluating the impact that adoption of SFAS Nos. 141R, 160 and 161 will have on our future consolidated financial statements. Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to financial market risk resulting from changes in interest and foreign currency rates. We do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions, nor hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. Recent developments in the financial markets, however, have rendered risks less predictable, and liquidity concerns and credit risks have increased. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our money market funds, debt securities, corporate notes and bonds and enhanced money funds with effective maturities of generally three months to five years at the date of purchase. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while generating yields without significantly increasing risk. Historically, this was accomplished by investing in high investment grade securities with a minimum overall portfolio average credit rating of AA . A revised investment policy was approved in December 2007 by our Board of Directors, limiting future investments to direct U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations, repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations and U.S. Government and Government Agency Money Market funds. The investment policies of our subsidiaries have been reviewed and are consistent with our primary objective to preserve principal while generating yields without significantly leveraging risk. Our wholly owned insurance subsidiary invests in U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations, corporate notes and bonds and asset and mortgage backed securities with a minimum overall portfolio average credit rating of AA . All of our foreign subsidiaries investments are primarily in money market funds, investment grade securities, bankers acceptances, bank certificates of deposit and term deposits all denominated in their local currencies. Additionally, our Canadian subsidiary may invest a portion of their investments in 35 Table of Contents Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) U.S. dollar investment grade securities and bank term deposits to meet current U.S. dollar obligations. All of the investment policies of the Company and subsidiaries are reviewed at least annually. As the majority of these investments in cash and cash equivalents are of a short term nature, if interest rates were to increase or decrease, there is no material risk of a material valuation adjustment related to these instruments. Based on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances at the end of 2008, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $17.9 million (pre tax) to interest income on an annual basis. For those investments that are classified as available for sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in market volatility and interest rates are reflected within stockholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive income. The nature and amount of our long and short term debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As of the end of 2008, our fixed rate long term debt included: $67.1 million principal amount at maturity of 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes carried at $49.1 million; $900.0 million of 5.3% Senior Notes carried at $898.3 million; and $1.10 billion of 5.5% Senior Notes carried at $1.09 billion and additional notes and capital lease obligations totaling $142.0 million. Additionally, our variable rate long term debt included a 0.35% over Yen Tibor (6 month) Term Loan of $27.6 million. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt and may affect the interest expense related to the variable rate debt. Most transactions of our foreign subsidiaries are conducted in local currencies, limiting our exposure to changes in currency rates. The majority of the forward foreign exchange contracts were entered into by our wholly owned United Kingdom subsidiary, primarily to hedge U.S. dollar merchandise inventory purchases. We periodically enter into short term forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates on inventory purchases. The notional value of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at the end of 2008 was $89.8 million. 
 
Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Provision for Income Taxes 2008 2007 2006 Income tax expense $ 716,249 $ 627,219 $ 648,202 Effective tax rate 35.83 % 36.68 % 37.01 % The effective income tax rate on earnings in 2008, 2007 and 2006 was 35.83%, 36.68% and 37.01%, respectively. The lower tax rate in 2008 was primarily attributable to non recurring benefits recognized during the year. Net Income 2008 2007 2006 Net income $ 1,282,725 $ 1,082,772 $ 1,103,215 Unusual items (net of tax) 119,496 Net income, as adjusted $ 1,282,725 $ 1,202,268 $ 1,103,215 Diluted earnings per share $ 2.89 $ 2.37 $ 2.30 Shares used to calculate diluted net income per common share 444,240 457,641 480,341 Diluted earnings per share increase 22 % 3 % 6 % 2008 vs. 2007 Net income for 2008 was $1.28 billion, or $2.89 per diluted share, compared to $1.08 billion, or $2.37 per diluted share, during 2007. The unusual items previously discussed totaled $119.5 million, net of tax, or $0.26 per diluted share in 2007. Exclusive of these items, earnings in 2007 were $2.63 per diluted share. Net income per diluted share in 2008 represents an increase of 10% over this adjusted amount. During 2008, we repurchased and retired 13.8 million shares of common stock, favorably impacting earnings per diluted share by approximately $0.03. 2007 vs. 2006 Net income for 2007 was $1.08 billion, or $2.37 per diluted share, compared to $1.10 billion, or $2.30 per diluted share during 2006. The unusual items previously discussed totaled $119.5 million, net of tax, or $0.26 per diluted share in 2007. Exclusive of these items, earnings for 2007 were $2.63 per diluted share, a 14% increase over the prior year. During 2007, we repurchased and retired 36.4 million shares of common stock, favorably impacting earnings per diluted share by approximately $0.03. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The following table itemizes our most liquid assets at the end of 2008 and 2007 (dollars in thousands): 2008 2007 Cash and cash equivalents $ 2,619,429 $ 2,779,733 Short term investments 655,584 575,787 Total $ 3,275,013 $ 3,355,520 24 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from warehouse operations and existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances, which were $3.28 billion and $3.36 billion at the end of 2008 and 2007, respectively. Of these balances, approximately $787.5 million and $655.2 million at the end of 2008 and 2007, respectively, represented debit and credit card receivables, primarily related to sales in the week prior to the end of the year. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $2.18 billion in 2008 compared to $2.08 billion in 2007, an increase of $99.8 million. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in net income of $200.0 million, an increase in depreciation and amortization and stock based compensation of $118.2 million, as well as an increase in cash flow from the change in operating assets, liabilities and deferred income taxes of $56.8 million, offset by an increase in net merchandise inventories (merchandise inventory less accounts payable) of $258.0 million. Net cash used in investing activities totaled $1.72 billion in 2008 compared to $655.3 million in 2007, an increase of approximately $1.06 billion. The increase in investing activities relates primarily to a decrease in cash provided by the net investment in short term investments of $534.1 million as a result of less cash needed to fund our decreased common stock repurchase activity. Additions to property and equipment related to warehouse expansion and remodel projects increased $212.9 million in 2008. Additionally, in the second quarter of 2008, $371.1 million formerly classified as cash and cash equivalents was reclassified to short term investments and other non current assets. In December 2007, one of our enhanced money fund investments, Columbia Strategic Cash Portfolio Fund (Columbia), ceased accepting cash redemption requests and changed to a floating net asset value. In light of the restricted liquidity, we elected to receive a pro rata allocation of the underlying securities in a separately managed account. We assessed the fair value of the underlying securities in this account through market quotations and review of current investment ratings, as available, coupled with the evaluation of the liquidation value of each investment and its current performance in meeting scheduled payments of principal and interest. In 2008, we recognized $5.0 million of other than temporary impairment losses related to these securities: $2.8 million, $1.4 million and $0.8 million in the second, third and fourth quarters, respectively. The losses are included in interest income and other in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. The markets relating to these investments remain uncertain, and there may be further declines in the value of these investments that may cause additional losses in future periods. At the end of 2008, the balance of the Columbia fund securities was $103.6 million on the consolidated balance sheet. Additionally, in December 2007, two other enhanced money fund investments, BlackRock Cash Strategies, LLC (BlackRock) and Merrill Lynch Capital Reserve Fund, LLC (Merrill Lynch), ceased accepting redemption requests. These two funds are being liquidated with periodic distributions and the expectation is that the funds will be completely liquidated by 2010. To date, the funds have maintained a $1.00 per unit net asset value. At the end of 2008, the combined balance of the BlackRock and Merrill Lynch funds was $125.1 million on our consolidated balance sheet and we received cash redemptions of $48.2 million from the BlackRock and Merrill Lynch funds subsequent to the end of the year and through October 14, 2008. At the end of 2008, $228.7 million remained in the Columbia, BlackRock and Merrill Lynch funds, with $160.7 million in short term investments and $68.0 million in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet, reflecting the timing of the expected distributions. 25 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) On September 18, 2008, one of our government agency money market funds, The Reserve U.S. Government Fund, announced that the proceeds from a redemption request for this fund would not be transmitted to an investor for a period of up to seven calendar days after the receipt of the redemption request. On September 22, 2008, the SEC granted a temporary order suspending shareholder redemptions as of September 17, 2008 and requiring The Reserve to create a plan to effect an orderly disposition, subject to supervision by the SEC. As of October 14, 2008, the plan to effect an orderly disposition of the U.S. Government Fund has not yet been publicly disclosed. At August 31, 2008 and October 14, 2008, we had $171.4 million and $317.2 million, respectively, invested in the fund. Although market conditions cannot be predicted, we currently do not expect to realize a loss on this fund. The latest per unit net asset value reported for the fund is $1.00. Subsequent to the end of 2008, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (Lehman) filed a petition under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. At August 31, 2008, we held $2.3 million of Lehman securities, within the Columbia portfolio, purchased by the fund manager prior to receipt of our pro rata allocation of the funds investments in December 2007. As of October 14, 2008, we do not have an estimate of the recovery value of the Lehman securities. Additionally, on September 29, 2008, one of Sigma Finance Corporations (Sigma) lenders terminated its repurchase agreements, followed by two additional lenders also terminating agreements. On September 30, 2008 Sigma received a notice of default, which is expected to cause lenders to move to seize Sigmas assets. Sigmas Board of Directors also announced they will cease trading. At August 31, 2008, we held Sigma securities with a market value of $2.2 million and a book value of $1.9 million, within the Columbia portfolio purchased by the fund manager prior to receipt of our pro rata allocation of the funds investments in December 2007. These securities were previously impaired during 2008 and $1.4 million was recorded as an other than temporary impairment. As of October 14, 2008, we do not have an estimate of the recovery value of these securities. Although future market conditions cannot be predicted, we currently do not expect future losses in our investment portfolio to be material to our consolidated financial statements or that we will experience a detriment to our overall liquidity. Net cash used in financing activities totaled $613.0 million in 2008 compared to $164.6 million in 2007. The $448.4 million increase in net cash used in financing activities primarily resulted from a net decrease in cash provided by the issuance of long term debt, net of repayments, of $1.65 billion, largely relating to the issuance of the 2007 Senior Notes. This decrease was partially offset by a reduction in the repurchase of common stock of $1.08 billion, and an increase in the net proceeds from short term borrowings of $76.7 million. Dividends In April 2008, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash dividend from $0.145 to $0.16 per share or $0.64 on an annualized basis. Our quarterly cash dividends paid in 2008 totaled $0.61 per share. In 2007, we paid quarterly cash dividends totaling $0.55 per share. 26 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Contractual Obligations Our commitments at year end to make future payments under contractual obligations were as follows, as of August 31, 2008 (amounts in thousands): Payments Due by Year Contractual obligations 2009 2010 to2011 2012 to2013 2014 andthereafter Total Purchase obligations (merchandise)(1) $ 4,163,530 $ 1,693 $ $ $ 4,165,223 Long term debt(2) 110,735 285,140 1,072,608 1,505,387 2,973,870 Operating leases(3) 139,916 277,885 247,634 1,438,390 2,103,825 Purchase obligations (property, equipment, services and other)(4) 211,311 44,406 1,206 256,923 Construction Commitments 289,730 289,730 Capital lease obligations and other(2) 6,243 6,483 495 5,655 18,876 Other(5) 15,723 4,406 2,405 6,113 28,647 Total $ 4,937,188 $ 620,013 $ 1,324,348 $ 2,955,545 $ 9,837,094 (1) Includes open merchandise purchase orders.

(3) Operating lease obligations exclude amounts commonly referred to as common area maintenance, taxes and insurance and have been reduced by $149,468 to reflect sub lease income. (4) The amounts exclude certain services negotiated at the individual warehouse or regional level that are not significant and generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty. (5) Consists of asset retirement and deferred compensation obligations and includes $13,175 of current unrecognized tax benefits relating to uncertain tax positions, but excludes $39,699 of noncurrent unrecognized tax benefits due to uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash payments. Expansion Plans Our primary requirement for capital is the financing of land, building and equipment costs for new and remodeled warehouses. Capital is also required for initial warehouse operations and working capital. While there can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized and plans are subject to change upon further review, it is our current intention to spend approximately $1.7 billion during fiscal 2009 for real estate, construction, remodeling and equipment for warehouses and related operations. These expenditures are expected to be financed with a combination of cash provided from operations and existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. Plans for the United States and Canada during 2009 are to open approximately 24 to 28 new warehouses, inclusive of one to three relocations of existing warehouses to larger and better located facilities. We expect to continue our review of expansion plans in our international operations, including the United Kingdom and Asia, along with other international markets. 27 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Additional Equity Investments in Subsidiaries and Joint Ventures The Companys investments in the Costco Mexico joint venture and in other unconsolidated joint ventures that are less than majority owned are accounted for under the equity method. In 2006, we contributed an additional $15 million to our investment in Costco Mexico (a 50% owned joint venture), which did not impact our percentage ownership of this entity, as our joint venture partner contributed a like amount. There were no such contributions in 2008 and 2007.

For those entities with multi purpose lines, any increase in either letters of credit (standby and or commercial) issuance and or short term borrowing will result in a corresponding decrease in available credit. Financing Activities On June 16, 2008, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary entered into a ten year term loan in the amount of $27.6 million, with a variable rate of interest of Yen TIBOR (6 month) plus a 0.35% margin (1.24% at August 31, 2008) on the outstanding balance. The net proceeds were used to repay the 1.187% Promissory Notes due in July 2008 and for general corporate purposes. Interest is payable semi annually in December and June, with the first payment due in December 2008 and principal is due in June 2018. 29 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) On October 17, 2007, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued Promissory Notes through a private placement in the amount of $59.8 million, bearing interest at 2.695%. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due in October 2017. The proceeds were used to repay the 2.070% Promissory Notes due in October 2007 and for general corporate purposes. In February 2007, we issued $900 million of 5.3% Senior Notes due March 15, 2012 at a discount of $2.5 million and $1.1 billion of 5.5% Senior Notes due March 15, 2017 at a discount of $5.9 million (together, the 2007 Senior Notes). Interest on the 2007 Senior Notes is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The discount and issuance costs associated with the 2007 Senior Notes are being amortized to interest expense over the terms of those notes. At our option, we may redeem the 2007 Senior Notes at any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount of the 2007 Senior Notes to be redeemed, or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, we will be required to make an offer to purchase the 2007 Senior Notes at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase, upon certain events as defined by the terms of the 2007 Senior Notes. In April 2003, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.92% in the amount of $36.8 million, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due in April 2010. In November 2002, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.88% in the aggregate amount of $27.6 million, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due in November 2009. The U.S. Parent Company, Costco Wholesale Corporation guarantees all of the promissory notes issued by our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary. In August 1997, we sold $900.0 million principal amount at maturity Zero Coupon Notes due in August 2017. The Zero Coupon Notes were priced with a yield to maturity of 3.5%, resulting in gross proceeds to us of $449.6 million. The notes outstanding are convertible into a maximum of 1.5 million shares of Costco Common Stock shares at an initial conversion price of $22.71. Holders of the Zero Coupon Notes may require us to purchase the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of purchase) in August 2012. We may redeem, at our option, the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of redemption) any time after August 2002. As of August 31, 2008, $832.9 million in principal amount of the Zero Coupon Notes had been converted by note holders to shares of Costco Common Stock, of which $0.5 million and $61.2 million in principal were converted in 2008 and 2007, respectively, or $0.4 million and $42.3 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively, after factoring in the related debt discount. Derivatives We follow Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (as amended) (SFAS 133), in accounting for derivative and hedging activities. We use derivative and hedging arrangements only to manage what we believe to be well defined risks. Forward foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on inventory purchases and typically have very short terms. These forward contracts do not qualify for derivative hedge accounting. The aggregate notional amount of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at the end of 2008 and 2007 was $89.8 million and $75.0 million, respectively. The mark to market adjustment related to these contracts resulted in the recording of an asset of $4.6 million and a liability of $0.9 million at the end of 2008 and 2007, respectively, and $5.8 million and $0.4 million were recognized in interest income and other in the consolidated statements of income in 2008 and 2007, respectively. The majority of the forward foreign exchange contracts were entered into by our wholly owned United Kingdom subsidiary, primarily to hedge U.S. dollar merchandise inventory purchases. 30 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) We are exposed to risks in energy costs due to fluctuations in energy prices, particularly electricity, which we partially mitigate through the use of fixed price contracts with counterparties for approximately 19% of our warehouses in the U.S. and Canada, as well as certain depots and other facilities. We have also entered into variable priced contracts for the purchase of natural gas and fuel for our gas stations on an index basis. These contracts qualify for treatment as normal purchase or normal sales under SFAS 133 and require no mark to market adjustment. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements With the exception of our operating leases, we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition or consolidated financial statements. Stock Repurchase Programs In September and November of 2007, our Board of Directors approved $300.0 million and $1.0 billion, respectively, of stock repurchases, both expiring in 2010. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an additional $1.0 billion expiring in 2011, bringing total authorizations by our Board of Directors since inception of the program in 2001 to $6.80 billion. During 2008, we repurchased 13.8 million shares at an average price of $64.22 totaling approximately $886.9 million. During 2007, we repurchased 36.4 million shares of common stock, at an average price of $54.39, totaling approximately $1.98 billion. The remaining amount available to be purchased under our approved plan was approximately $2.06 billion at the end of 2008. Purchases are made from time to time as conditions warrant in the open market or in block purchases, and pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5 1. Repurchased shares are retired, in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments. We continue to review our accounting policies and evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, merchandise inventory valuation, impairment of long lived assets, warehouse closing costs, insurance/self insurance liabilities, investments and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. Revenue Recognition We generally recognize sales, net of estimated returns, at the time the member takes possession of merchandise or receives services. When we collect payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services, the amount received is generally recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed. We provide for estimated sales returns based on historical merchandise returns levels. Amounts collected from members, which under common trade practices are referred to as sales taxes, are recorded on a net basis. We evaluate the criteria of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal Versus Net as an Agent, in determining whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, when we are the primary obligor, subject to inventory risk, 31 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, influence product or service specifications, or have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded on a gross basis. If we are not the primary obligor and do not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above, we record the net amounts as commissions earned, which is reflected in net sales. Membership fee revenue represents annual membership fees paid by substantially all of our members. We account for membership fee revenue on a deferred basis, whereby revenue is recognized ratably over the one year membership period. In 2007, we performed a detailed analysis of the timing of recognition of membership fees based on each members specific renewal date, as this methodology represented an improvement over the historical method, which was based on the period in which the fee was collected. This review resulted in a $56.2 million reduction to membership fee revenue in 2007 and a corresponding increase to deferred membership fees on our consolidated balance sheet. This adjustment included both a change in method of applying an accounting principle to a preferable method and a correction for cumulative timing errors. Our Executive members qualify for a 2% reward (which can be redeemed only at Costco warehouses), up to a maximum of $500 per year, on all qualified purchases made at Costco. We account for this 2% reward as a reduction in sales, with the related liability being classified within other current liabilities. The sales reduction and corresponding liability are computed after giving effect to the estimated impact of non redemptions based on historical data. Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, as determined primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting, and are stated using the last in, first out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all other foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail inventory method of accounting and are stated using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. We believe the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. We record an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the expected annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end. The LIFO inventory adjustment in 2008 reduced ending inventory and gross margin by $32.3 million. At the end of 2007, merchandise inventories valued at LIFO approximated FIFO after considering the lower of cost or market principle. We provide for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts as a percentage of net sales. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect results of the actual physical inventory counts, which generally occur in the second and fourth quarters of the year. Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as we progress toward earning those rebates, provided they are probable and reasonably estimable. Other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of agreement, or other systematic and rational approaches. Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Warehouse Closing costs We periodically evaluate our long lived assets for indicators of impairment, such as a decision to relocate or close a warehouse location. Our judgments are based on existing market and operational conditions. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring a downward adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value. 32 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) We provide estimates for warehouse closing costs for both leased and owned locations to be closed or relocated. A considerable amount of judgment is involved in determining any impairment or our net liability, particularly related to the estimated sales price of owned locations and the potential sublease income at leased locations. These estimates are based on real estate conditions in the markets and our experience in those markets. We make assumptions about the average period of time it would take to sublease the location and the amount of potential sublease income for each leased location. We reassess our liability each quarter and adjust our liability accordingly when our estimates change. Insurance/Self Insurance Liabilities We use a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance pool, to provide for potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property damage, director and officers liability, vehicle liability and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience and evaluations of outside experts, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Investments Investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other than temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and our intent and ability to hold the investment. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the issuer, including industry and sector performance, operational and financing cash flow factors, and rating agency actions. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and or issuer conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments. Income Taxes We adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48), which sets out criteria for the use of judgment in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items, at the beginning of 2008. The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Significant judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions. The benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in our financial statements only after determining a more likely than not probability that the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge, if any, from tax authorities. When facts and circumstances change, we reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the financial statements as appropriate. 33 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Recent Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157), which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements required under other accounting pronouncements. It does not change existing guidance as to whether or not an instrument is carried at fair value. SFAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 157 1 (FSP FAS 157 1), which excludes SFAS No. 13, Accounting for Leases and certain other accounting pronouncements that address fair value measurements under SFAS 13, from the scope of SFAS 157. In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. 157 2 (FSP 157 2), which provides a one year delayed application of SFAS 157 for nonfinancial assets and liabilities, except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). We are required to adopt SFAS 157 as amended by FSP FAS 157 1 and FSP FAS 157 2 on September 1, 2008, the beginning of our fiscal 2009. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In October 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 157 3, Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset in a Market That Is Not Active (FSP 157 3), which clarifies the application of SFAS 157 when the market for a financial asset is inactive. Specifically, FSP 157 3 clarifies how (1) managements internal assumptions should be considered in measuring fair value when observable data are not present, (2) observable market information from an inactive market should be taken into account, and (3) the use of broker quotes or pricing services should be considered in assessing the relevance of observable and unobservable data to measure fair value. The guidance in FSP 157 3 is effective immediately and will apply to us upon adoption of SFAS 157. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, Including an Amendment to FASB No. 115 (SFAS 159). Under SFAS 159, entities may elect to measure specified financial instruments and warranty and insurance contracts at fair value on a contract by contract basis, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings each reporting period. The election, called the fair value option, will enable entities to achieve an offset accounting effect for changes in fair value of certain related assets and liabilities without having to apply more complex hedge accounting provisions. SFAS 159 will be effective for us September 1, 2008, the beginning of our fiscal 2009. We do not intend to elect the fair value option for any of our existing financial assets or financial liabilities; therefore, this statement is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In June 2008, the FASB issued Staff Position EITF 03 06 1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities (FSP EITF 03 06 1). FSP EITF 03 06 1 provides that unvested share based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (whether paid or unpaid) are participating securities and shall be included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two class method in SFAS No. 128, Earnings per Share. Our unvested RSUs are not eligible to receive dividends; therefore EITF 03 06 1 will not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an Amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin No 51 (SFAS 160). SFAS 160 establishes accounting and reporting standards for ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent, changes in a parents ownership of a noncontrolling interest, calculation and disclosure of the consolidated net income attributable to the parent and the noncontrolling interest, 34 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) changes in a parents ownership interest while the parent retains its controlling financial interest and fair value measurement of any retained noncontrolling equity investment. SFAS 160 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is prohibited. We must adopt these new requirements in our first quarter of fiscal 2010. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141R, Business Combinations (SFAS 141R), which establishes principles and requirements for the reporting entity in a business combination, including recognition and measurement in the financial statements of the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree. SFAS 141R applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years. We must adopt these new requirements in our first quarter of fiscal 2010. In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 133 (SFAS 161), which requires enhanced disclosures about derivative and hedging activities. This statement is effective for financial statements issued for periods beginning after November 15, 2008. Early adoption is permitted. We must provide these new disclosures no later than our second quarter of fiscal 2009. We are in the process of evaluating the impact that adoption of SFAS Nos. 141R, 160 and 161 will have on our future consolidated financial statements. Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to financial market risk resulting from changes in interest and foreign currency rates. We do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions, nor hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. Recent developments in the financial markets, however, have rendered risks less predictable, and liquidity concerns and credit risks have increased. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our money market funds, debt securities, corporate notes and bonds and enhanced money funds with effective maturities of generally three months to five years at the date of purchase. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while generating yields without significantly increasing risk. Historically, this was accomplished by investing in high investment grade securities with a minimum overall portfolio average credit rating of AA . A revised investment policy was approved in December 2007 by our Board of Directors, limiting future investments to direct U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations, repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations and U.S. Government and Government Agency Money Market funds. The investment policies of our subsidiaries have been reviewed and are consistent with our primary objective to preserve principal while generating yields without significantly leveraging risk. Our wholly owned insurance subsidiary invests in U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations, corporate notes and bonds and asset and mortgage backed securities with a minimum overall portfolio average credit rating of AA . All of our foreign subsidiaries investments are primarily in money market funds, investment grade securities, bankers acceptances, bank certificates of deposit and term deposits all denominated in their local currencies. Additionally, our Canadian subsidiary may invest a portion of their investments in 35 Table of Contents Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) U.S. dollar investment grade securities and bank term deposits to meet current U.S. dollar obligations. All of the investment policies of the Company and subsidiaries are reviewed at least annually. As the majority of these investments in cash and cash equivalents are of a short term nature, if interest rates were to increase or decrease, there is no material risk of a material valuation adjustment related to these instruments. Based on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances at the end of 2008, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $17.9 million (pre tax) to interest income on an annual basis. For those investments that are classified as available for sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in market volatility and interest rates are reflected within stockholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive income. The nature and amount of our long and short term debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As of the end of 2008, our fixed rate long term debt included: $67.1 million principal amount at maturity of 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes carried at $49.1 million; $900.0 million of 5.3% Senior Notes carried at $898.3 million; and $1.10 billion of 5.5% Senior Notes carried at $1.09 billion and additional notes and capital lease obligations totaling $142.0 million. Additionally, our variable rate long term debt included a 0.35% over Yen Tibor (6 month) Term Loan of $27.6 million. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt and may affect the interest expense related to the variable rate debt. Most transactions of our foreign subsidiaries are conducted in local currencies, limiting our exposure to changes in currency rates. The majority of the forward foreign exchange contracts were entered into by our wholly owned United Kingdom subsidiary, primarily to hedge U.S. dollar merchandise inventory purchases. We periodically enter into short term forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates on inventory purchases. The notional value of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at the end of 2008 was $89.8 million. 
 
Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from warehouse operations and existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances, which were $3.28 billion and $3.36 billion at the end of 2008 and 2007, respectively. Of these balances, approximately $787.5 million and $655.2 million at the end of 2008 and 2007, respectively, represented debit and credit card receivables, primarily related to sales in the week prior to the end of the year. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $2.18 billion in 2008 compared to $2.08 billion in 2007, an increase of $99.8 million. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in net income of $200.0 million, an increase in depreciation and amortization and stock based compensation of $118.2 million, as well as an increase in cash flow from the change in operating assets, liabilities and deferred income taxes of $56.8 million, offset by an increase in net merchandise inventories (merchandise inventory less accounts payable) of $258.0 million. Net cash used in investing activities totaled $1.72 billion in 2008 compared to $655.3 million in 2007, an increase of approximately $1.06 billion. The increase in investing activities relates primarily to a decrease in cash provided by the net investment in short term investments of $534.1 million as a result of less cash needed to fund our decreased common stock repurchase activity. Additions to property and equipment related to warehouse expansion and remodel projects increased $212.9 million in 2008. Additionally, in the second quarter of 2008, $371.1 million formerly classified as cash and cash equivalents was reclassified to short term investments and other non current assets. In December 2007, one of our enhanced money fund investments, Columbia Strategic Cash Portfolio Fund (Columbia), ceased accepting cash redemption requests and changed to a floating net asset value. In light of the restricted liquidity, we elected to receive a pro rata allocation of the underlying securities in a separately managed account. We assessed the fair value of the underlying securities in this account through market quotations and review of current investment ratings, as available, coupled with the evaluation of the liquidation value of each investment and its current performance in meeting scheduled payments of principal and interest. In 2008, we recognized $5.0 million of other than temporary impairment losses related to these securities: $2.8 million, $1.4 million and $0.8 million in the second, third and fourth quarters, respectively. The losses are included in interest income and other in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. The markets relating to these investments remain uncertain, and there may be further declines in the value of these investments that may cause additional losses in future periods. At the end of 2008, the balance of the Columbia fund securities was $103.6 million on the consolidated balance sheet. Additionally, in December 2007, two other enhanced money fund investments, BlackRock Cash Strategies, LLC (BlackRock) and Merrill Lynch Capital Reserve Fund, LLC (Merrill Lynch), ceased accepting redemption requests. These two funds are being liquidated with periodic distributions and the expectation is that the funds will be completely liquidated by 2010. To date, the funds have maintained a $1.00 per unit net asset value. At the end of 2008, the combined balance of the BlackRock and Merrill Lynch funds was $125.1 million on our consolidated balance sheet and we received cash redemptions of $48.2 million from the BlackRock and Merrill Lynch funds subsequent to the end of the year and through October 14, 2008. At the end of 2008, $228.7 million remained in the Columbia, BlackRock and Merrill Lynch funds, with $160.7 million in short term investments and $68.0 million in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet, reflecting the timing of the expected distributions. 25 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) On September 18, 2008, one of our government agency money market funds, The Reserve U.S. Government Fund, announced that the proceeds from a redemption request for this fund would not be transmitted to an investor for a period of up to seven calendar days after the receipt of the redemption request. On September 22, 2008, the SEC granted a temporary order suspending shareholder redemptions as of September 17, 2008 and requiring The Reserve to create a plan to effect an orderly disposition, subject to supervision by the SEC. As of October 14, 2008, the plan to effect an orderly disposition of the U.S. Government Fund has not yet been publicly disclosed. At August 31, 2008 and October 14, 2008, we had $171.4 million and $317.2 million, respectively, invested in the fund. Although market conditions cannot be predicted, we currently do not expect to realize a loss on this fund. The latest per unit net asset value reported for the fund is $1.00. Subsequent to the end of 2008, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (Lehman) filed a petition under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. At August 31, 2008, we held $2.3 million of Lehman securities, within the Columbia portfolio, purchased by the fund manager prior to receipt of our pro rata allocation of the funds investments in December 2007. As of October 14, 2008, we do not have an estimate of the recovery value of the Lehman securities. Additionally, on September 29, 2008, one of Sigma Finance Corporations (Sigma) lenders terminated its repurchase agreements, followed by two additional lenders also terminating agreements. On September 30, 2008 Sigma received a notice of default, which is expected to cause lenders to move to seize Sigmas assets. Sigmas Board of Directors also announced they will cease trading. At August 31, 2008, we held Sigma securities with a market value of $2.2 million and a book value of $1.9 million, within the Columbia portfolio purchased by the fund manager prior to receipt of our pro rata allocation of the funds investments in December 2007. These securities were previously impaired during 2008 and $1.4 million was recorded as an other than temporary impairment. As of October 14, 2008, we do not have an estimate of the recovery value of these securities. Although future market conditions cannot be predicted, we currently do not expect future losses in our investment portfolio to be material to our consolidated financial statements or that we will experience a detriment to our overall liquidity. Net cash used in financing activities totaled $613.0 million in 2008 compared to $164.6 million in 2007. The $448.4 million increase in net cash used in financing activities primarily resulted from a net decrease in cash provided by the issuance of long term debt, net of repayments, of $1.65 billion, largely relating to the issuance of the 2007 Senior Notes. This decrease was partially offset by a reduction in the repurchase of common stock of $1.08 billion, and an increase in the net proceeds from short term borrowings of $76.7 million. Dividends In April 2008, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash dividend from $0.145 to $0.16 per share or $0.64 on an annualized basis. Our quarterly cash dividends paid in 2008 totaled $0.61 per share. In 2007, we paid quarterly cash dividends totaling $0.55 per share. 26 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Contractual Obligations Our commitments at year end to make future payments under contractual obligations were as follows, as of August 31, 2008 (amounts in thousands): Payments Due by Year Contractual obligations 2009 2010 to2011 2012 to2013 2014 andthereafter Total Purchase obligations (merchandise)(1) $ 4,163,530 $ 1,693 $ $ $ 4,165,223 Long term debt(2) 110,735 285,140 1,072,608 1,505,387 2,973,870 Operating leases(3) 139,916 277,885 247,634 1,438,390 2,103,825 Purchase obligations (property, equipment, services and other)(4) 211,311 44,406 1,206 256,923 Construction Commitments 289,730 289,730 Capital lease obligations and other(2) 6,243 6,483 495 5,655 18,876 Other(5) 15,723 4,406 2,405 6,113 28,647 Total $ 4,937,188 $ 620,013 $ 1,324,348 $ 2,955,545 $ 9,837,094 (1) Includes open merchandise purchase orders.

(5) Consists of asset retirement and deferred compensation obligations and includes $13,175 of current unrecognized tax benefits relating to uncertain tax positions, but excludes $39,699 of noncurrent unrecognized tax benefits due to uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash payments. Expansion Plans Our primary requirement for capital is the financing of land, building and equipment costs for new and remodeled warehouses. Capital is also required for initial warehouse operations and working capital. While there can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized and plans are subject to change upon further review, it is our current intention to spend approximately $1.7 billion during fiscal 2009 for real estate, construction, remodeling and equipment for warehouses and related operations. These expenditures are expected to be financed with a combination of cash provided from operations and existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. Plans for the United States and Canada during 2009 are to open approximately 24 to 28 new warehouses, inclusive of one to three relocations of existing warehouses to larger and better located facilities. We expect to continue our review of expansion plans in our international operations, including the United Kingdom and Asia, along with other international markets. 27 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Additional Equity Investments in Subsidiaries and Joint Ventures The Companys investments in the Costco Mexico joint venture and in other unconsolidated joint ventures that are less than majority owned are accounted for under the equity method. In 2006, we contributed an additional $15 million to our investment in Costco Mexico (a 50% owned joint venture), which did not impact our percentage ownership of this entity, as our joint venture partner contributed a like amount. There were no such contributions in 2008 and 2007.

For those entities with multi purpose lines, any increase in either letters of credit (standby and or commercial) issuance and or short term borrowing will result in a corresponding decrease in available credit. Financing Activities On June 16, 2008, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary entered into a ten year term loan in the amount of $27.6 million, with a variable rate of interest of Yen TIBOR (6 month) plus a 0.35% margin (1.24% at August 31, 2008) on the outstanding balance. The net proceeds were used to repay the 1.187% Promissory Notes due in July 2008 and for general corporate purposes. Interest is payable semi annually in December and June, with the first payment due in December 2008 and principal is due in June 2018. 29 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) On October 17, 2007, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued Promissory Notes through a private placement in the amount of $59.8 million, bearing interest at 2.695%. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due in October 2017. The proceeds were used to repay the 2.070% Promissory Notes due in October 2007 and for general corporate purposes. In February 2007, we issued $900 million of 5.3% Senior Notes due March 15, 2012 at a discount of $2.5 million and $1.1 billion of 5.5% Senior Notes due March 15, 2017 at a discount of $5.9 million (together, the 2007 Senior Notes). Interest on the 2007 Senior Notes is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The discount and issuance costs associated with the 2007 Senior Notes are being amortized to interest expense over the terms of those notes. At our option, we may redeem the 2007 Senior Notes at any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount of the 2007 Senior Notes to be redeemed, or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, we will be required to make an offer to purchase the 2007 Senior Notes at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase, upon certain events as defined by the terms of the 2007 Senior Notes. In April 2003, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.92% in the amount of $36.8 million, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due in April 2010. In November 2002, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.88% in the aggregate amount of $27.6 million, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due in November 2009. The U.S. Parent Company, Costco Wholesale Corporation guarantees all of the promissory notes issued by our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary. In August 1997, we sold $900.0 million principal amount at maturity Zero Coupon Notes due in August 2017. The Zero Coupon Notes were priced with a yield to maturity of 3.5%, resulting in gross proceeds to us of $449.6 million. The notes outstanding are convertible into a maximum of 1.5 million shares of Costco Common Stock shares at an initial conversion price of $22.71. Holders of the Zero Coupon Notes may require us to purchase the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of purchase) in August 2012. We may redeem, at our option, the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of redemption) any time after August 2002. As of August 31, 2008, $832.9 million in principal amount of the Zero Coupon Notes had been converted by note holders to shares of Costco Common Stock, of which $0.5 million and $61.2 million in principal were converted in 2008 and 2007, respectively, or $0.4 million and $42.3 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively, after factoring in the related debt discount. Derivatives We follow Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (as amended) (SFAS 133), in accounting for derivative and hedging activities. We use derivative and hedging arrangements only to manage what we believe to be well defined risks. Forward foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on inventory purchases and typically have very short terms. These forward contracts do not qualify for derivative hedge accounting. The aggregate notional amount of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at the end of 2008 and 2007 was $89.8 million and $75.0 million, respectively. The mark to market adjustment related to these contracts resulted in the recording of an asset of $4.6 million and a liability of $0.9 million at the end of 2008 and 2007, respectively, and $5.8 million and $0.4 million were recognized in interest income and other in the consolidated statements of income in 2008 and 2007, respectively. The majority of the forward foreign exchange contracts were entered into by our wholly owned United Kingdom subsidiary, primarily to hedge U.S. dollar merchandise inventory purchases. 30 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) We are exposed to risks in energy costs due to fluctuations in energy prices, particularly electricity, which we partially mitigate through the use of fixed price contracts with counterparties for approximately 19% of our warehouses in the U.S. and Canada, as well as certain depots and other facilities. We have also entered into variable priced contracts for the purchase of natural gas and fuel for our gas stations on an index basis. These contracts qualify for treatment as normal purchase or normal sales under SFAS 133 and require no mark to market adjustment. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements With the exception of our operating leases, we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition or consolidated financial statements. Stock Repurchase Programs In September and November of 2007, our Board of Directors approved $300.0 million and $1.0 billion, respectively, of stock repurchases, both expiring in 2010. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an additional $1.0 billion expiring in 2011, bringing total authorizations by our Board of Directors since inception of the program in 2001 to $6.80 billion. During 2008, we repurchased 13.8 million shares at an average price of $64.22 totaling approximately $886.9 million. During 2007, we repurchased 36.4 million shares of common stock, at an average price of $54.39, totaling approximately $1.98 billion. The remaining amount available to be purchased under our approved plan was approximately $2.06 billion at the end of 2008. Purchases are made from time to time as conditions warrant in the open market or in block purchases, and pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5 1. Repurchased shares are retired, in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments. We continue to review our accounting policies and evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, merchandise inventory valuation, impairment of long lived assets, warehouse closing costs, insurance/self insurance liabilities, investments and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. Revenue Recognition We generally recognize sales, net of estimated returns, at the time the member takes possession of merchandise or receives services. When we collect payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services, the amount received is generally recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed. We provide for estimated sales returns based on historical merchandise returns levels. Amounts collected from members, which under common trade practices are referred to as sales taxes, are recorded on a net basis. We evaluate the criteria of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal Versus Net as an Agent, in determining whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, when we are the primary obligor, subject to inventory risk, 31 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, influence product or service specifications, or have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded on a gross basis. If we are not the primary obligor and do not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above, we record the net amounts as commissions earned, which is reflected in net sales. Membership fee revenue represents annual membership fees paid by substantially all of our members. We account for membership fee revenue on a deferred basis, whereby revenue is recognized ratably over the one year membership period. In 2007, we performed a detailed analysis of the timing of recognition of membership fees based on each members specific renewal date, as this methodology represented an improvement over the historical method, which was based on the period in which the fee was collected. This review resulted in a $56.2 million reduction to membership fee revenue in 2007 and a corresponding increase to deferred membership fees on our consolidated balance sheet. This adjustment included both a change in method of applying an accounting principle to a preferable method and a correction for cumulative timing errors. Our Executive members qualify for a 2% reward (which can be redeemed only at Costco warehouses), up to a maximum of $500 per year, on all qualified purchases made at Costco. We account for this 2% reward as a reduction in sales, with the related liability being classified within other current liabilities. The sales reduction and corresponding liability are computed after giving effect to the estimated impact of non redemptions based on historical data. Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, as determined primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting, and are stated using the last in, first out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all other foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail inventory method of accounting and are stated using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. We believe the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. We record an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the expected annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end. The LIFO inventory adjustment in 2008 reduced ending inventory and gross margin by $32.3 million. At the end of 2007, merchandise inventories valued at LIFO approximated FIFO after considering the lower of cost or market principle. We provide for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts as a percentage of net sales. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect results of the actual physical inventory counts, which generally occur in the second and fourth quarters of the year. Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as we progress toward earning those rebates, provided they are probable and reasonably estimable. Other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of agreement, or other systematic and rational approaches. Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Warehouse Closing costs We periodically evaluate our long lived assets for indicators of impairment, such as a decision to relocate or close a warehouse location. Our judgments are based on existing market and operational conditions. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring a downward adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value. 32 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) We provide estimates for warehouse closing costs for both leased and owned locations to be closed or relocated. A considerable amount of judgment is involved in determining any impairment or our net liability, particularly related to the estimated sales price of owned locations and the potential sublease income at leased locations. These estimates are based on real estate conditions in the markets and our experience in those markets. We make assumptions about the average period of time it would take to sublease the location and the amount of potential sublease income for each leased location. We reassess our liability each quarter and adjust our liability accordingly when our estimates change. Insurance/Self Insurance Liabilities We use a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance pool, to provide for potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property damage, director and officers liability, vehicle liability and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience and evaluations of outside experts, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Investments Investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other than temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and our intent and ability to hold the investment. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the issuer, including industry and sector performance, operational and financing cash flow factors, and rating agency actions. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and or issuer conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments. Income Taxes We adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48), which sets out criteria for the use of judgment in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items, at the beginning of 2008. The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Significant judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions. The benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in our financial statements only after determining a more likely than not probability that the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge, if any, from tax authorities. When facts and circumstances change, we reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the financial statements as appropriate. 33 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Recent Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157), which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements required under other accounting pronouncements. It does not change existing guidance as to whether or not an instrument is carried at fair value. SFAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 157 1 (FSP FAS 157 1), which excludes SFAS No. 13, Accounting for Leases and certain other accounting pronouncements that address fair value measurements under SFAS 13, from the scope of SFAS 157. In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. 157 2 (FSP 157 2), which provides a one year delayed application of SFAS 157 for nonfinancial assets and liabilities, except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). We are required to adopt SFAS 157 as amended by FSP FAS 157 1 and FSP FAS 157 2 on September 1, 2008, the beginning of our fiscal 2009. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In October 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 157 3, Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset in a Market That Is Not Active (FSP 157 3), which clarifies the application of SFAS 157 when the market for a financial asset is inactive. Specifically, FSP 157 3 clarifies how (1) managements internal assumptions should be considered in measuring fair value when observable data are not present, (2) observable market information from an inactive market should be taken into account, and (3) the use of broker quotes or pricing services should be considered in assessing the relevance of observable and unobservable data to measure fair value. The guidance in FSP 157 3 is effective immediately and will apply to us upon adoption of SFAS 157. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, Including an Amendment to FASB No. 115 (SFAS 159). Under SFAS 159, entities may elect to measure specified financial instruments and warranty and insurance contracts at fair value on a contract by contract basis, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings each reporting period. The election, called the fair value option, will enable entities to achieve an offset accounting effect for changes in fair value of certain related assets and liabilities without having to apply more complex hedge accounting provisions. SFAS 159 will be effective for us September 1, 2008, the beginning of our fiscal 2009. We do not intend to elect the fair value option for any of our existing financial assets or financial liabilities; therefore, this statement is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In June 2008, the FASB issued Staff Position EITF 03 06 1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities (FSP EITF 03 06 1). FSP EITF 03 06 1 provides that unvested share based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (whether paid or unpaid) are participating securities and shall be included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two class method in SFAS No. 128, Earnings per Share. Our unvested RSUs are not eligible to receive dividends; therefore EITF 03 06 1 will not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an Amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin No 51 (SFAS 160). SFAS 160 establishes accounting and reporting standards for ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent, changes in a parents ownership of a noncontrolling interest, calculation and disclosure of the consolidated net income attributable to the parent and the noncontrolling interest, 34 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) changes in a parents ownership interest while the parent retains its controlling financial interest and fair value measurement of any retained noncontrolling equity investment. SFAS 160 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is prohibited. We must adopt these new requirements in our first quarter of fiscal 2010. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141R, Business Combinations (SFAS 141R), which establishes principles and requirements for the reporting entity in a business combination, including recognition and measurement in the financial statements of the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree. SFAS 141R applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years. We must adopt these new requirements in our first quarter of fiscal 2010. In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 133 (SFAS 161), which requires enhanced disclosures about derivative and hedging activities. This statement is effective for financial statements issued for periods beginning after November 15, 2008. Early adoption is permitted. We must provide these new disclosures no later than our second quarter of fiscal 2009. We are in the process of evaluating the impact that adoption of SFAS Nos. 141R, 160 and 161 will have on our future consolidated financial statements. Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to financial market risk resulting from changes in interest and foreign currency rates. We do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions, nor hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. Recent developments in the financial markets, however, have rendered risks less predictable, and liquidity concerns and credit risks have increased. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our money market funds, debt securities, corporate notes and bonds and enhanced money funds with effective maturities of generally three months to five years at the date of purchase. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while generating yields without significantly increasing risk. Historically, this was accomplished by investing in high investment grade securities with a minimum overall portfolio average credit rating of AA . A revised investment policy was approved in December 2007 by our Board of Directors, limiting future investments to direct U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations, repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations and U.S. Government and Government Agency Money Market funds. The investment policies of our subsidiaries have been reviewed and are consistent with our primary objective to preserve principal while generating yields without significantly leveraging risk. Our wholly owned insurance subsidiary invests in U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations, corporate notes and bonds and asset and mortgage backed securities with a minimum overall portfolio average credit rating of AA . All of our foreign subsidiaries investments are primarily in money market funds, investment grade securities, bankers acceptances, bank certificates of deposit and term deposits all denominated in their local currencies. Additionally, our Canadian subsidiary may invest a portion of their investments in 35 Table of Contents Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) U.S. dollar investment grade securities and bank term deposits to meet current U.S. dollar obligations. All of the investment policies of the Company and subsidiaries are reviewed at least annually. As the majority of these investments in cash and cash equivalents are of a short term nature, if interest rates were to increase or decrease, there is no material risk of a material valuation adjustment related to these instruments. Based on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances at the end of 2008, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $17.9 million (pre tax) to interest income on an annual basis. For those investments that are classified as available for sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in market volatility and interest rates are reflected within stockholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive income. The nature and amount of our long and short term debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As of the end of 2008, our fixed rate long term debt included: $67.1 million principal amount at maturity of 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes carried at $49.1 million; $900.0 million of 5.3% Senior Notes carried at $898.3 million; and $1.10 billion of 5.5% Senior Notes carried at $1.09 billion and additional notes and capital lease obligations totaling $142.0 million. Additionally, our variable rate long term debt included a 0.35% over Yen Tibor (6 month) Term Loan of $27.6 million. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt and may affect the interest expense related to the variable rate debt. Most transactions of our foreign subsidiaries are conducted in local currencies, limiting our exposure to changes in currency rates. The majority of the forward foreign exchange contracts were entered into by our wholly owned United Kingdom subsidiary, primarily to hedge U.S. dollar merchandise inventory purchases. We periodically enter into short term forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates on inventory purchases. The notional value of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at the end of 2008 was $89.8 million. 
 
Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) On September 18, 2008, one of our government agency money market funds, The Reserve U.S. Government Fund, announced that the proceeds from a redemption request for this fund would not be transmitted to an investor for a period of up to seven calendar days after the receipt of the redemption request. On September 22, 2008, the SEC granted a temporary order suspending shareholder redemptions as of September 17, 2008 and requiring The Reserve to create a plan to effect an orderly disposition, subject to supervision by the SEC. As of October 14, 2008, the plan to effect an orderly disposition of the U.S. Government Fund has not yet been publicly disclosed. At August 31, 2008 and October 14, 2008, we had $171.4 million and $317.2 million, respectively, invested in the fund. Although market conditions cannot be predicted, we currently do not expect to realize a loss on this fund. The latest per unit net asset value reported for the fund is $1.00. Subsequent to the end of 2008, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (Lehman) filed a petition under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. At August 31, 2008, we held $2.3 million of Lehman securities, within the Columbia portfolio, purchased by the fund manager prior to receipt of our pro rata allocation of the funds investments in December 2007. As of October 14, 2008, we do not have an estimate of the recovery value of the Lehman securities. Additionally, on September 29, 2008, one of Sigma Finance Corporations (Sigma) lenders terminated its repurchase agreements, followed by two additional lenders also terminating agreements. On September 30, 2008 Sigma received a notice of default, which is expected to cause lenders to move to seize Sigmas assets. Sigmas Board of Directors also announced they will cease trading. At August 31, 2008, we held Sigma securities with a market value of $2.2 million and a book value of $1.9 million, within the Columbia portfolio purchased by the fund manager prior to receipt of our pro rata allocation of the funds investments in December 2007. These securities were previously impaired during 2008 and $1.4 million was recorded as an other than temporary impairment. As of October 14, 2008, we do not have an estimate of the recovery value of these securities. Although future market conditions cannot be predicted, we currently do not expect future losses in our investment portfolio to be material to our consolidated financial statements or that we will experience a detriment to our overall liquidity. Net cash used in financing activities totaled $613.0 million in 2008 compared to $164.6 million in 2007. The $448.4 million increase in net cash used in financing activities primarily resulted from a net decrease in cash provided by the issuance of long term debt, net of repayments, of $1.65 billion, largely relating to the issuance of the 2007 Senior Notes. This decrease was partially offset by a reduction in the repurchase of common stock of $1.08 billion, and an increase in the net proceeds from short term borrowings of $76.7 million. Dividends In April 2008, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash dividend from $0.145 to $0.16 per share or $0.64 on an annualized basis. Our quarterly cash dividends paid in 2008 totaled $0.61 per share. In 2007, we paid quarterly cash dividends totaling $0.55 per share. 26 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Contractual Obligations Our commitments at year end to make future payments under contractual obligations were as follows, as of August 31, 2008 (amounts in thousands): Payments Due by Year Contractual obligations 2009 2010 to2011 2012 to2013 2014 andthereafter Total Purchase obligations (merchandise)(1) $ 4,163,530 $ 1,693 $ $ $ 4,165,223 Long term debt(2) 110,735 285,140 1,072,608 1,505,387 2,973,870 Operating leases(3) 139,916 277,885 247,634 1,438,390 2,103,825 Purchase obligations (property, equipment, services and other)(4) 211,311 44,406 1,206 256,923 Construction Commitments 289,730 289,730 Capital lease obligations and other(2) 6,243 6,483 495 5,655 18,876 Other(5) 15,723 4,406 2,405 6,113 28,647 Total $ 4,937,188 $ 620,013 $ 1,324,348 $ 2,955,545 $ 9,837,094 (1) Includes open merchandise purchase orders.

(4) The amounts exclude certain services negotiated at the individual warehouse or regional level that are not significant and generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty. (5) Consists of asset retirement and deferred compensation obligations and includes $13,175 of current unrecognized tax benefits relating to uncertain tax positions, but excludes $39,699 of noncurrent unrecognized tax benefits due to uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash payments. Expansion Plans Our primary requirement for capital is the financing of land, building and equipment costs for new and remodeled warehouses. Capital is also required for initial warehouse operations and working capital. While there can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized and plans are subject to change upon further review, it is our current intention to spend approximately $1.7 billion during fiscal 2009 for real estate, construction, remodeling and equipment for warehouses and related operations. These expenditures are expected to be financed with a combination of cash provided from operations and existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. Plans for the United States and Canada during 2009 are to open approximately 24 to 28 new warehouses, inclusive of one to three relocations of existing warehouses to larger and better located facilities. We expect to continue our review of expansion plans in our international operations, including the United Kingdom and Asia, along with other international markets. 27 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Additional Equity Investments in Subsidiaries and Joint Ventures The Companys investments in the Costco Mexico joint venture and in other unconsolidated joint ventures that are less than majority owned are accounted for under the equity method. In 2006, we contributed an additional $15 million to our investment in Costco Mexico (a 50% owned joint venture), which did not impact our percentage ownership of this entity, as our joint venture partner contributed a like amount. There were no such contributions in 2008 and 2007.

For those entities with multi purpose lines, any increase in either letters of credit (standby and or commercial) issuance and or short term borrowing will result in a corresponding decrease in available credit. Financing Activities On June 16, 2008, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary entered into a ten year term loan in the amount of $27.6 million, with a variable rate of interest of Yen TIBOR (6 month) plus a 0.35% margin (1.24% at August 31, 2008) on the outstanding balance. The net proceeds were used to repay the 1.187% Promissory Notes due in July 2008 and for general corporate purposes. Interest is payable semi annually in December and June, with the first payment due in December 2008 and principal is due in June 2018. 29 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) On October 17, 2007, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued Promissory Notes through a private placement in the amount of $59.8 million, bearing interest at 2.695%. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due in October 2017. The proceeds were used to repay the 2.070% Promissory Notes due in October 2007 and for general corporate purposes. In February 2007, we issued $900 million of 5.3% Senior Notes due March 15, 2012 at a discount of $2.5 million and $1.1 billion of 5.5% Senior Notes due March 15, 2017 at a discount of $5.9 million (together, the 2007 Senior Notes). Interest on the 2007 Senior Notes is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The discount and issuance costs associated with the 2007 Senior Notes are being amortized to interest expense over the terms of those notes. At our option, we may redeem the 2007 Senior Notes at any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount of the 2007 Senior Notes to be redeemed, or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, we will be required to make an offer to purchase the 2007 Senior Notes at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase, upon certain events as defined by the terms of the 2007 Senior Notes. In April 2003, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.92% in the amount of $36.8 million, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due in April 2010. In November 2002, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.88% in the aggregate amount of $27.6 million, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due in November 2009. The U.S. Parent Company, Costco Wholesale Corporation guarantees all of the promissory notes issued by our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary. In August 1997, we sold $900.0 million principal amount at maturity Zero Coupon Notes due in August 2017. The Zero Coupon Notes were priced with a yield to maturity of 3.5%, resulting in gross proceeds to us of $449.6 million. The notes outstanding are convertible into a maximum of 1.5 million shares of Costco Common Stock shares at an initial conversion price of $22.71. Holders of the Zero Coupon Notes may require us to purchase the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of purchase) in August 2012. We may redeem, at our option, the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of redemption) any time after August 2002. As of August 31, 2008, $832.9 million in principal amount of the Zero Coupon Notes had been converted by note holders to shares of Costco Common Stock, of which $0.5 million and $61.2 million in principal were converted in 2008 and 2007, respectively, or $0.4 million and $42.3 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively, after factoring in the related debt discount. Derivatives We follow Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (as amended) (SFAS 133), in accounting for derivative and hedging activities. We use derivative and hedging arrangements only to manage what we believe to be well defined risks. Forward foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on inventory purchases and typically have very short terms. These forward contracts do not qualify for derivative hedge accounting. The aggregate notional amount of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at the end of 2008 and 2007 was $89.8 million and $75.0 million, respectively. The mark to market adjustment related to these contracts resulted in the recording of an asset of $4.6 million and a liability of $0.9 million at the end of 2008 and 2007, respectively, and $5.8 million and $0.4 million were recognized in interest income and other in the consolidated statements of income in 2008 and 2007, respectively. The majority of the forward foreign exchange contracts were entered into by our wholly owned United Kingdom subsidiary, primarily to hedge U.S. dollar merchandise inventory purchases. 30 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) We are exposed to risks in energy costs due to fluctuations in energy prices, particularly electricity, which we partially mitigate through the use of fixed price contracts with counterparties for approximately 19% of our warehouses in the U.S. and Canada, as well as certain depots and other facilities. We have also entered into variable priced contracts for the purchase of natural gas and fuel for our gas stations on an index basis. These contracts qualify for treatment as normal purchase or normal sales under SFAS 133 and require no mark to market adjustment. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements With the exception of our operating leases, we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition or consolidated financial statements. Stock Repurchase Programs In September and November of 2007, our Board of Directors approved $300.0 million and $1.0 billion, respectively, of stock repurchases, both expiring in 2010. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an additional $1.0 billion expiring in 2011, bringing total authorizations by our Board of Directors since inception of the program in 2001 to $6.80 billion. During 2008, we repurchased 13.8 million shares at an average price of $64.22 totaling approximately $886.9 million. During 2007, we repurchased 36.4 million shares of common stock, at an average price of $54.39, totaling approximately $1.98 billion. The remaining amount available to be purchased under our approved plan was approximately $2.06 billion at the end of 2008. Purchases are made from time to time as conditions warrant in the open market or in block purchases, and pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5 1. Repurchased shares are retired, in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments. We continue to review our accounting policies and evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, merchandise inventory valuation, impairment of long lived assets, warehouse closing costs, insurance/self insurance liabilities, investments and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. Revenue Recognition We generally recognize sales, net of estimated returns, at the time the member takes possession of merchandise or receives services. When we collect payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services, the amount received is generally recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed. We provide for estimated sales returns based on historical merchandise returns levels. Amounts collected from members, which under common trade practices are referred to as sales taxes, are recorded on a net basis. We evaluate the criteria of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal Versus Net as an Agent, in determining whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, when we are the primary obligor, subject to inventory risk, 31 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, influence product or service specifications, or have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded on a gross basis. If we are not the primary obligor and do not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above, we record the net amounts as commissions earned, which is reflected in net sales. Membership fee revenue represents annual membership fees paid by substantially all of our members. We account for membership fee revenue on a deferred basis, whereby revenue is recognized ratably over the one year membership period. In 2007, we performed a detailed analysis of the timing of recognition of membership fees based on each members specific renewal date, as this methodology represented an improvement over the historical method, which was based on the period in which the fee was collected. This review resulted in a $56.2 million reduction to membership fee revenue in 2007 and a corresponding increase to deferred membership fees on our consolidated balance sheet. This adjustment included both a change in method of applying an accounting principle to a preferable method and a correction for cumulative timing errors. Our Executive members qualify for a 2% reward (which can be redeemed only at Costco warehouses), up to a maximum of $500 per year, on all qualified purchases made at Costco. We account for this 2% reward as a reduction in sales, with the related liability being classified within other current liabilities. The sales reduction and corresponding liability are computed after giving effect to the estimated impact of non redemptions based on historical data. Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, as determined primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting, and are stated using the last in, first out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all other foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail inventory method of accounting and are stated using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. We believe the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. We record an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the expected annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end. The LIFO inventory adjustment in 2008 reduced ending inventory and gross margin by $32.3 million. At the end of 2007, merchandise inventories valued at LIFO approximated FIFO after considering the lower of cost or market principle. We provide for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts as a percentage of net sales. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect results of the actual physical inventory counts, which generally occur in the second and fourth quarters of the year. Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as we progress toward earning those rebates, provided they are probable and reasonably estimable. Other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of agreement, or other systematic and rational approaches. Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Warehouse Closing costs We periodically evaluate our long lived assets for indicators of impairment, such as a decision to relocate or close a warehouse location. Our judgments are based on existing market and operational conditions. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring a downward adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value. 32 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) We provide estimates for warehouse closing costs for both leased and owned locations to be closed or relocated. A considerable amount of judgment is involved in determining any impairment or our net liability, particularly related to the estimated sales price of owned locations and the potential sublease income at leased locations. These estimates are based on real estate conditions in the markets and our experience in those markets. We make assumptions about the average period of time it would take to sublease the location and the amount of potential sublease income for each leased location. We reassess our liability each quarter and adjust our liability accordingly when our estimates change. Insurance/Self Insurance Liabilities We use a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance pool, to provide for potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property damage, director and officers liability, vehicle liability and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience and evaluations of outside experts, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Investments Investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other than temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and our intent and ability to hold the investment. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the issuer, including industry and sector performance, operational and financing cash flow factors, and rating agency actions. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and or issuer conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments. Income Taxes We adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48), which sets out criteria for the use of judgment in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items, at the beginning of 2008. The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Significant judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions. The benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in our financial statements only after determining a more likely than not probability that the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge, if any, from tax authorities. When facts and circumstances change, we reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the financial statements as appropriate. 33 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Recent Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157), which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements required under other accounting pronouncements. It does not change existing guidance as to whether or not an instrument is carried at fair value. SFAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 157 1 (FSP FAS 157 1), which excludes SFAS No. 13, Accounting for Leases and certain other accounting pronouncements that address fair value measurements under SFAS 13, from the scope of SFAS 157. In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. 157 2 (FSP 157 2), which provides a one year delayed application of SFAS 157 for nonfinancial assets and liabilities, except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). We are required to adopt SFAS 157 as amended by FSP FAS 157 1 and FSP FAS 157 2 on September 1, 2008, the beginning of our fiscal 2009. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In October 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 157 3, Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset in a Market That Is Not Active (FSP 157 3), which clarifies the application of SFAS 157 when the market for a financial asset is inactive. Specifically, FSP 157 3 clarifies how (1) managements internal assumptions should be considered in measuring fair value when observable data are not present, (2) observable market information from an inactive market should be taken into account, and (3) the use of broker quotes or pricing services should be considered in assessing the relevance of observable and unobservable data to measure fair value. The guidance in FSP 157 3 is effective immediately and will apply to us upon adoption of SFAS 157. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, Including an Amendment to FASB No. 115 (SFAS 159). Under SFAS 159, entities may elect to measure specified financial instruments and warranty and insurance contracts at fair value on a contract by contract basis, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings each reporting period. The election, called the fair value option, will enable entities to achieve an offset accounting effect for changes in fair value of certain related assets and liabilities without having to apply more complex hedge accounting provisions. SFAS 159 will be effective for us September 1, 2008, the beginning of our fiscal 2009. We do not intend to elect the fair value option for any of our existing financial assets or financial liabilities; therefore, this statement is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In June 2008, the FASB issued Staff Position EITF 03 06 1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities (FSP EITF 03 06 1). FSP EITF 03 06 1 provides that unvested share based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (whether paid or unpaid) are participating securities and shall be included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two class method in SFAS No. 128, Earnings per Share. Our unvested RSUs are not eligible to receive dividends; therefore EITF 03 06 1 will not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an Amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin No 51 (SFAS 160). SFAS 160 establishes accounting and reporting standards for ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent, changes in a parents ownership of a noncontrolling interest, calculation and disclosure of the consolidated net income attributable to the parent and the noncontrolling interest, 34 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) changes in a parents ownership interest while the parent retains its controlling financial interest and fair value measurement of any retained noncontrolling equity investment. SFAS 160 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is prohibited. We must adopt these new requirements in our first quarter of fiscal 2010. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141R, Business Combinations (SFAS 141R), which establishes principles and requirements for the reporting entity in a business combination, including recognition and measurement in the financial statements of the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree. SFAS 141R applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years. We must adopt these new requirements in our first quarter of fiscal 2010. In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 133 (SFAS 161), which requires enhanced disclosures about derivative and hedging activities. This statement is effective for financial statements issued for periods beginning after November 15, 2008. Early adoption is permitted. We must provide these new disclosures no later than our second quarter of fiscal 2009. We are in the process of evaluating the impact that adoption of SFAS Nos. 141R, 160 and 161 will have on our future consolidated financial statements. Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to financial market risk resulting from changes in interest and foreign currency rates. We do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions, nor hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. Recent developments in the financial markets, however, have rendered risks less predictable, and liquidity concerns and credit risks have increased. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our money market funds, debt securities, corporate notes and bonds and enhanced money funds with effective maturities of generally three months to five years at the date of purchase. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while generating yields without significantly increasing risk. Historically, this was accomplished by investing in high investment grade securities with a minimum overall portfolio average credit rating of AA . A revised investment policy was approved in December 2007 by our Board of Directors, limiting future investments to direct U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations, repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations and U.S. Government and Government Agency Money Market funds. The investment policies of our subsidiaries have been reviewed and are consistent with our primary objective to preserve principal while generating yields without significantly leveraging risk. Our wholly owned insurance subsidiary invests in U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations, corporate notes and bonds and asset and mortgage backed securities with a minimum overall portfolio average credit rating of AA . All of our foreign subsidiaries investments are primarily in money market funds, investment grade securities, bankers acceptances, bank certificates of deposit and term deposits all denominated in their local currencies. Additionally, our Canadian subsidiary may invest a portion of their investments in 35 Table of Contents Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) U.S. dollar investment grade securities and bank term deposits to meet current U.S. dollar obligations. All of the investment policies of the Company and subsidiaries are reviewed at least annually. As the majority of these investments in cash and cash equivalents are of a short term nature, if interest rates were to increase or decrease, there is no material risk of a material valuation adjustment related to these instruments. Based on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances at the end of 2008, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $17.9 million (pre tax) to interest income on an annual basis. For those investments that are classified as available for sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in market volatility and interest rates are reflected within stockholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive income. The nature and amount of our long and short term debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As of the end of 2008, our fixed rate long term debt included: $67.1 million principal amount at maturity of 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes carried at $49.1 million; $900.0 million of 5.3% Senior Notes carried at $898.3 million; and $1.10 billion of 5.5% Senior Notes carried at $1.09 billion and additional notes and capital lease obligations totaling $142.0 million. Additionally, our variable rate long term debt included a 0.35% over Yen Tibor (6 month) Term Loan of $27.6 million. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt and may affect the interest expense related to the variable rate debt. Most transactions of our foreign subsidiaries are conducted in local currencies, limiting our exposure to changes in currency rates. The majority of the forward foreign exchange contracts were entered into by our wholly owned United Kingdom subsidiary, primarily to hedge U.S. dollar merchandise inventory purchases. We periodically enter into short term forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates on inventory purchases. The notional value of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at the end of 2008 was $89.8 million.

(4) The amounts exclude certain services negotiated at the individual warehouse or regional level that are not significant and generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty. (5) Consists of asset retirement and deferred compensation obligations and includes $13,175 of current unrecognized tax benefits relating to uncertain tax positions, but excludes $39,699 of noncurrent unrecognized tax benefits due to uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash payments. Expansion Plans Our primary requirement for capital is the financing of land, building and equipment costs for new and remodeled warehouses. Capital is also required for initial warehouse operations and working capital. While there can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized and plans are subject to change upon further review, it is our current intention to spend approximately $1.7 billion during fiscal 2009 for real estate, construction, remodeling and equipment for warehouses and related operations. These expenditures are expected to be financed with a combination of cash provided from operations and existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. Plans for the United States and Canada during 2009 are to open approximately 24 to 28 new warehouses, inclusive of one to three relocations of existing warehouses to larger and better located facilities. We expect to continue our review of expansion plans in our international operations, including the United Kingdom and Asia, along with other international markets. 27 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Additional Equity Investments in Subsidiaries and Joint Ventures The Companys investments in the Costco Mexico joint venture and in other unconsolidated joint ventures that are less than majority owned are accounted for under the equity method. In 2006, we contributed an additional $15 million to our investment in Costco Mexico (a 50% owned joint venture), which did not impact our percentage ownership of this entity, as our joint venture partner contributed a like amount. There were no such contributions in 2008 and 2007.

For those entities with multi purpose lines, any increase in either letters of credit (standby and or commercial) issuance and or short term borrowing will result in a corresponding decrease in available credit. Financing Activities On June 16, 2008, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary entered into a ten year term loan in the amount of $27.6 million, with a variable rate of interest of Yen TIBOR (6 month) plus a 0.35% margin (1.24% at August 31, 2008) on the outstanding balance. The net proceeds were used to repay the 1.187% Promissory Notes due in July 2008 and for general corporate purposes. Interest is payable semi annually in December and June, with the first payment due in December 2008 and principal is due in June 2018. 29 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) On October 17, 2007, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued Promissory Notes through a private placement in the amount of $59.8 million, bearing interest at 2.695%. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due in October 2017. The proceeds were used to repay the 2.070% Promissory Notes due in October 2007 and for general corporate purposes. In February 2007, we issued $900 million of 5.3% Senior Notes due March 15, 2012 at a discount of $2.5 million and $1.1 billion of 5.5% Senior Notes due March 15, 2017 at a discount of $5.9 million (together, the 2007 Senior Notes). Interest on the 2007 Senior Notes is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The discount and issuance costs associated with the 2007 Senior Notes are being amortized to interest expense over the terms of those notes. At our option, we may redeem the 2007 Senior Notes at any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount of the 2007 Senior Notes to be redeemed, or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, we will be required to make an offer to purchase the 2007 Senior Notes at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase, upon certain events as defined by the terms of the 2007 Senior Notes. In April 2003, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.92% in the amount of $36.8 million, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due in April 2010. In November 2002, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.88% in the aggregate amount of $27.6 million, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due in November 2009. The U.S. Parent Company, Costco Wholesale Corporation guarantees all of the promissory notes issued by our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary. In August 1997, we sold $900.0 million principal amount at maturity Zero Coupon Notes due in August 2017. The Zero Coupon Notes were priced with a yield to maturity of 3.5%, resulting in gross proceeds to us of $449.6 million. The notes outstanding are convertible into a maximum of 1.5 million shares of Costco Common Stock shares at an initial conversion price of $22.71. Holders of the Zero Coupon Notes may require us to purchase the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of purchase) in August 2012. We may redeem, at our option, the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of redemption) any time after August 2002. As of August 31, 2008, $832.9 million in principal amount of the Zero Coupon Notes had been converted by note holders to shares of Costco Common Stock, of which $0.5 million and $61.2 million in principal were converted in 2008 and 2007, respectively, or $0.4 million and $42.3 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively, after factoring in the related debt discount. Derivatives We follow Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (as amended) (SFAS 133), in accounting for derivative and hedging activities. We use derivative and hedging arrangements only to manage what we believe to be well defined risks. Forward foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on inventory purchases and typically have very short terms. These forward contracts do not qualify for derivative hedge accounting. The aggregate notional amount of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at the end of 2008 and 2007 was $89.8 million and $75.0 million, respectively. The mark to market adjustment related to these contracts resulted in the recording of an asset of $4.6 million and a liability of $0.9 million at the end of 2008 and 2007, respectively, and $5.8 million and $0.4 million were recognized in interest income and other in the consolidated statements of income in 2008 and 2007, respectively. The majority of the forward foreign exchange contracts were entered into by our wholly owned United Kingdom subsidiary, primarily to hedge U.S. dollar merchandise inventory purchases. 30 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) We are exposed to risks in energy costs due to fluctuations in energy prices, particularly electricity, which we partially mitigate through the use of fixed price contracts with counterparties for approximately 19% of our warehouses in the U.S. and Canada, as well as certain depots and other facilities. We have also entered into variable priced contracts for the purchase of natural gas and fuel for our gas stations on an index basis. These contracts qualify for treatment as normal purchase or normal sales under SFAS 133 and require no mark to market adjustment. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements With the exception of our operating leases, we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition or consolidated financial statements. Stock Repurchase Programs In September and November of 2007, our Board of Directors approved $300.0 million and $1.0 billion, respectively, of stock repurchases, both expiring in 2010. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an additional $1.0 billion expiring in 2011, bringing total authorizations by our Board of Directors since inception of the program in 2001 to $6.80 billion. During 2008, we repurchased 13.8 million shares at an average price of $64.22 totaling approximately $886.9 million. During 2007, we repurchased 36.4 million shares of common stock, at an average price of $54.39, totaling approximately $1.98 billion. The remaining amount available to be purchased under our approved plan was approximately $2.06 billion at the end of 2008. Purchases are made from time to time as conditions warrant in the open market or in block purchases, and pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5 1. Repurchased shares are retired, in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments. We continue to review our accounting policies and evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, merchandise inventory valuation, impairment of long lived assets, warehouse closing costs, insurance/self insurance liabilities, investments and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. Revenue Recognition We generally recognize sales, net of estimated returns, at the time the member takes possession of merchandise or receives services. When we collect payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services, the amount received is generally recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed. We provide for estimated sales returns based on historical merchandise returns levels. Amounts collected from members, which under common trade practices are referred to as sales taxes, are recorded on a net basis. We evaluate the criteria of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal Versus Net as an Agent, in determining whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, when we are the primary obligor, subject to inventory risk, 31 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, influence product or service specifications, or have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded on a gross basis. If we are not the primary obligor and do not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above, we record the net amounts as commissions earned, which is reflected in net sales. Membership fee revenue represents annual membership fees paid by substantially all of our members. We account for membership fee revenue on a deferred basis, whereby revenue is recognized ratably over the one year membership period. In 2007, we performed a detailed analysis of the timing of recognition of membership fees based on each members specific renewal date, as this methodology represented an improvement over the historical method, which was based on the period in which the fee was collected. This review resulted in a $56.2 million reduction to membership fee revenue in 2007 and a corresponding increase to deferred membership fees on our consolidated balance sheet. This adjustment included both a change in method of applying an accounting principle to a preferable method and a correction for cumulative timing errors. Our Executive members qualify for a 2% reward (which can be redeemed only at Costco warehouses), up to a maximum of $500 per year, on all qualified purchases made at Costco. We account for this 2% reward as a reduction in sales, with the related liability being classified within other current liabilities. The sales reduction and corresponding liability are computed after giving effect to the estimated impact of non redemptions based on historical data. Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, as determined primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting, and are stated using the last in, first out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all other foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail inventory method of accounting and are stated using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. We believe the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. We record an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the expected annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end. The LIFO inventory adjustment in 2008 reduced ending inventory and gross margin by $32.3 million. At the end of 2007, merchandise inventories valued at LIFO approximated FIFO after considering the lower of cost or market principle. We provide for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts as a percentage of net sales. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect results of the actual physical inventory counts, which generally occur in the second and fourth quarters of the year. Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as we progress toward earning those rebates, provided they are probable and reasonably estimable. Other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of agreement, or other systematic and rational approaches. Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Warehouse Closing costs We periodically evaluate our long lived assets for indicators of impairment, such as a decision to relocate or close a warehouse location. Our judgments are based on existing market and operational conditions. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring a downward adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value. 32 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) We provide estimates for warehouse closing costs for both leased and owned locations to be closed or relocated. A considerable amount of judgment is involved in determining any impairment or our net liability, particularly related to the estimated sales price of owned locations and the potential sublease income at leased locations. These estimates are based on real estate conditions in the markets and our experience in those markets. We make assumptions about the average period of time it would take to sublease the location and the amount of potential sublease income for each leased location. We reassess our liability each quarter and adjust our liability accordingly when our estimates change. Insurance/Self Insurance Liabilities We use a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance pool, to provide for potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property damage, director and officers liability, vehicle liability and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience and evaluations of outside experts, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Investments Investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other than temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and our intent and ability to hold the investment. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the issuer, including industry and sector performance, operational and financing cash flow factors, and rating agency actions. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and or issuer conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments. Income Taxes We adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48), which sets out criteria for the use of judgment in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items, at the beginning of 2008. The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Significant judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions. The benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in our financial statements only after determining a more likely than not probability that the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge, if any, from tax authorities. When facts and circumstances change, we reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the financial statements as appropriate. 33 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Recent Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157), which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements required under other accounting pronouncements. It does not change existing guidance as to whether or not an instrument is carried at fair value. SFAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 157 1 (FSP FAS 157 1), which excludes SFAS No. 13, Accounting for Leases and certain other accounting pronouncements that address fair value measurements under SFAS 13, from the scope of SFAS 157. In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. 157 2 (FSP 157 2), which provides a one year delayed application of SFAS 157 for nonfinancial assets and liabilities, except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). We are required to adopt SFAS 157 as amended by FSP FAS 157 1 and FSP FAS 157 2 on September 1, 2008, the beginning of our fiscal 2009. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In October 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 157 3, Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset in a Market That Is Not Active (FSP 157 3), which clarifies the application of SFAS 157 when the market for a financial asset is inactive. Specifically, FSP 157 3 clarifies how (1) managements internal assumptions should be considered in measuring fair value when observable data are not present, (2) observable market information from an inactive market should be taken into account, and (3) the use of broker quotes or pricing services should be considered in assessing the relevance of observable and unobservable data to measure fair value. The guidance in FSP 157 3 is effective immediately and will apply to us upon adoption of SFAS 157. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, Including an Amendment to FASB No. 115 (SFAS 159). Under SFAS 159, entities may elect to measure specified financial instruments and warranty and insurance contracts at fair value on a contract by contract basis, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings each reporting period. The election, called the fair value option, will enable entities to achieve an offset accounting effect for changes in fair value of certain related assets and liabilities without having to apply more complex hedge accounting provisions. SFAS 159 will be effective for us September 1, 2008, the beginning of our fiscal 2009. We do not intend to elect the fair value option for any of our existing financial assets or financial liabilities; therefore, this statement is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In June 2008, the FASB issued Staff Position EITF 03 06 1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities (FSP EITF 03 06 1). FSP EITF 03 06 1 provides that unvested share based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (whether paid or unpaid) are participating securities and shall be included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two class method in SFAS No. 128, Earnings per Share. Our unvested RSUs are not eligible to receive dividends; therefore EITF 03 06 1 will not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an Amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin No 51 (SFAS 160). SFAS 160 establishes accounting and reporting standards for ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent, changes in a parents ownership of a noncontrolling interest, calculation and disclosure of the consolidated net income attributable to the parent and the noncontrolling interest, 34 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) changes in a parents ownership interest while the parent retains its controlling financial interest and fair value measurement of any retained noncontrolling equity investment. SFAS 160 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is prohibited. We must adopt these new requirements in our first quarter of fiscal 2010. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141R, Business Combinations (SFAS 141R), which establishes principles and requirements for the reporting entity in a business combination, including recognition and measurement in the financial statements of the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree. SFAS 141R applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years. We must adopt these new requirements in our first quarter of fiscal 2010. In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 133 (SFAS 161), which requires enhanced disclosures about derivative and hedging activities. This statement is effective for financial statements issued for periods beginning after November 15, 2008. Early adoption is permitted. We must provide these new disclosures no later than our second quarter of fiscal 2009. We are in the process of evaluating the impact that adoption of SFAS Nos. 141R, 160 and 161 will have on our future consolidated financial statements. Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to financial market risk resulting from changes in interest and foreign currency rates. We do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions, nor hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. Recent developments in the financial markets, however, have rendered risks less predictable, and liquidity concerns and credit risks have increased. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our money market funds, debt securities, corporate notes and bonds and enhanced money funds with effective maturities of generally three months to five years at the date of purchase. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while generating yields without significantly increasing risk. Historically, this was accomplished by investing in high investment grade securities with a minimum overall portfolio average credit rating of AA . A revised investment policy was approved in December 2007 by our Board of Directors, limiting future investments to direct U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations, repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations and U.S. Government and Government Agency Money Market funds. The investment policies of our subsidiaries have been reviewed and are consistent with our primary objective to preserve principal while generating yields without significantly leveraging risk. Our wholly owned insurance subsidiary invests in U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations, corporate notes and bonds and asset and mortgage backed securities with a minimum overall portfolio average credit rating of AA . All of our foreign subsidiaries investments are primarily in money market funds, investment grade securities, bankers acceptances, bank certificates of deposit and term deposits all denominated in their local currencies. Additionally, our Canadian subsidiary may invest a portion of their investments in 35 Table of Contents Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) U.S. dollar investment grade securities and bank term deposits to meet current U.S. dollar obligations. All of the investment policies of the Company and subsidiaries are reviewed at least annually. As the majority of these investments in cash and cash equivalents are of a short term nature, if interest rates were to increase or decrease, there is no material risk of a material valuation adjustment related to these instruments. Based on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances at the end of 2008, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $17.9 million (pre tax) to interest income on an annual basis. For those investments that are classified as available for sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in market volatility and interest rates are reflected within stockholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive income. The nature and amount of our long and short term debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As of the end of 2008, our fixed rate long term debt included: $67.1 million principal amount at maturity of 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes carried at $49.1 million; $900.0 million of 5.3% Senior Notes carried at $898.3 million; and $1.10 billion of 5.5% Senior Notes carried at $1.09 billion and additional notes and capital lease obligations totaling $142.0 million. Additionally, our variable rate long term debt included a 0.35% over Yen Tibor (6 month) Term Loan of $27.6 million. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt and may affect the interest expense related to the variable rate debt. Most transactions of our foreign subsidiaries are conducted in local currencies, limiting our exposure to changes in currency rates. The majority of the forward foreign exchange contracts were entered into by our wholly owned United Kingdom subsidiary, primarily to hedge U.S. dollar merchandise inventory purchases. We periodically enter into short term forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates on inventory purchases. The notional value of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at the end of 2008 was $89.8 million. 
 
Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Additional Equity Investments in Subsidiaries and Joint Ventures The Companys investments in the Costco Mexico joint venture and in other unconsolidated joint ventures that are less than majority owned are accounted for under the equity method. In 2006, we contributed an additional $15 million to our investment in Costco Mexico (a 50% owned joint venture), which did not impact our percentage ownership of this entity, as our joint venture partner contributed a like amount. There were no such contributions in 2008 and 2007.

For those entities with multi purpose lines, any increase in either letters of credit (standby and or commercial) issuance and or short term borrowing will result in a corresponding decrease in available credit. Financing Activities On June 16, 2008, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary entered into a ten year term loan in the amount of $27.6 million, with a variable rate of interest of Yen TIBOR (6 month) plus a 0.35% margin (1.24% at August 31, 2008) on the outstanding balance. The net proceeds were used to repay the 1.187% Promissory Notes due in July 2008 and for general corporate purposes. Interest is payable semi annually in December and June, with the first payment due in December 2008 and principal is due in June 2018. 29 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) On October 17, 2007, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued Promissory Notes through a private placement in the amount of $59.8 million, bearing interest at 2.695%. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due in October 2017. The proceeds were used to repay the 2.070% Promissory Notes due in October 2007 and for general corporate purposes. In February 2007, we issued $900 million of 5.3% Senior Notes due March 15, 2012 at a discount of $2.5 million and $1.1 billion of 5.5% Senior Notes due March 15, 2017 at a discount of $5.9 million (together, the 2007 Senior Notes). Interest on the 2007 Senior Notes is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The discount and issuance costs associated with the 2007 Senior Notes are being amortized to interest expense over the terms of those notes. At our option, we may redeem the 2007 Senior Notes at any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount of the 2007 Senior Notes to be redeemed, or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, we will be required to make an offer to purchase the 2007 Senior Notes at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase, upon certain events as defined by the terms of the 2007 Senior Notes. In April 2003, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.92% in the amount of $36.8 million, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due in April 2010. In November 2002, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.88% in the aggregate amount of $27.6 million, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due in November 2009. The U.S. Parent Company, Costco Wholesale Corporation guarantees all of the promissory notes issued by our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary. In August 1997, we sold $900.0 million principal amount at maturity Zero Coupon Notes due in August 2017. The Zero Coupon Notes were priced with a yield to maturity of 3.5%, resulting in gross proceeds to us of $449.6 million. The notes outstanding are convertible into a maximum of 1.5 million shares of Costco Common Stock shares at an initial conversion price of $22.71. Holders of the Zero Coupon Notes may require us to purchase the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of purchase) in August 2012. We may redeem, at our option, the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of redemption) any time after August 2002. As of August 31, 2008, $832.9 million in principal amount of the Zero Coupon Notes had been converted by note holders to shares of Costco Common Stock, of which $0.5 million and $61.2 million in principal were converted in 2008 and 2007, respectively, or $0.4 million and $42.3 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively, after factoring in the related debt discount. Derivatives We follow Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (as amended) (SFAS 133), in accounting for derivative and hedging activities. We use derivative and hedging arrangements only to manage what we believe to be well defined risks. Forward foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on inventory purchases and typically have very short terms. These forward contracts do not qualify for derivative hedge accounting. The aggregate notional amount of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at the end of 2008 and 2007 was $89.8 million and $75.0 million, respectively. The mark to market adjustment related to these contracts resulted in the recording of an asset of $4.6 million and a liability of $0.9 million at the end of 2008 and 2007, respectively, and $5.8 million and $0.4 million were recognized in interest income and other in the consolidated statements of income in 2008 and 2007, respectively. The majority of the forward foreign exchange contracts were entered into by our wholly owned United Kingdom subsidiary, primarily to hedge U.S. dollar merchandise inventory purchases. 30 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) We are exposed to risks in energy costs due to fluctuations in energy prices, particularly electricity, which we partially mitigate through the use of fixed price contracts with counterparties for approximately 19% of our warehouses in the U.S. and Canada, as well as certain depots and other facilities. We have also entered into variable priced contracts for the purchase of natural gas and fuel for our gas stations on an index basis. These contracts qualify for treatment as normal purchase or normal sales under SFAS 133 and require no mark to market adjustment. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements With the exception of our operating leases, we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition or consolidated financial statements. Stock Repurchase Programs In September and November of 2007, our Board of Directors approved $300.0 million and $1.0 billion, respectively, of stock repurchases, both expiring in 2010. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an additional $1.0 billion expiring in 2011, bringing total authorizations by our Board of Directors since inception of the program in 2001 to $6.80 billion. During 2008, we repurchased 13.8 million shares at an average price of $64.22 totaling approximately $886.9 million. During 2007, we repurchased 36.4 million shares of common stock, at an average price of $54.39, totaling approximately $1.98 billion. The remaining amount available to be purchased under our approved plan was approximately $2.06 billion at the end of 2008. Purchases are made from time to time as conditions warrant in the open market or in block purchases, and pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5 1. Repurchased shares are retired, in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments. We continue to review our accounting policies and evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, merchandise inventory valuation, impairment of long lived assets, warehouse closing costs, insurance/self insurance liabilities, investments and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. Revenue Recognition We generally recognize sales, net of estimated returns, at the time the member takes possession of merchandise or receives services. When we collect payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services, the amount received is generally recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed. We provide for estimated sales returns based on historical merchandise returns levels. Amounts collected from members, which under common trade practices are referred to as sales taxes, are recorded on a net basis. We evaluate the criteria of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal Versus Net as an Agent, in determining whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, when we are the primary obligor, subject to inventory risk, 31 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, influence product or service specifications, or have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded on a gross basis. If we are not the primary obligor and do not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above, we record the net amounts as commissions earned, which is reflected in net sales. Membership fee revenue represents annual membership fees paid by substantially all of our members. We account for membership fee revenue on a deferred basis, whereby revenue is recognized ratably over the one year membership period. In 2007, we performed a detailed analysis of the timing of recognition of membership fees based on each members specific renewal date, as this methodology represented an improvement over the historical method, which was based on the period in which the fee was collected. This review resulted in a $56.2 million reduction to membership fee revenue in 2007 and a corresponding increase to deferred membership fees on our consolidated balance sheet. This adjustment included both a change in method of applying an accounting principle to a preferable method and a correction for cumulative timing errors. Our Executive members qualify for a 2% reward (which can be redeemed only at Costco warehouses), up to a maximum of $500 per year, on all qualified purchases made at Costco. We account for this 2% reward as a reduction in sales, with the related liability being classified within other current liabilities. The sales reduction and corresponding liability are computed after giving effect to the estimated impact of non redemptions based on historical data. Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, as determined primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting, and are stated using the last in, first out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all other foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail inventory method of accounting and are stated using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. We believe the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. We record an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the expected annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end. The LIFO inventory adjustment in 2008 reduced ending inventory and gross margin by $32.3 million. At the end of 2007, merchandise inventories valued at LIFO approximated FIFO after considering the lower of cost or market principle. We provide for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts as a percentage of net sales. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect results of the actual physical inventory counts, which generally occur in the second and fourth quarters of the year. Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as we progress toward earning those rebates, provided they are probable and reasonably estimable. Other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of agreement, or other systematic and rational approaches. Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Warehouse Closing costs We periodically evaluate our long lived assets for indicators of impairment, such as a decision to relocate or close a warehouse location. Our judgments are based on existing market and operational conditions. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring a downward adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value. 32 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) We provide estimates for warehouse closing costs for both leased and owned locations to be closed or relocated. A considerable amount of judgment is involved in determining any impairment or our net liability, particularly related to the estimated sales price of owned locations and the potential sublease income at leased locations. These estimates are based on real estate conditions in the markets and our experience in those markets. We make assumptions about the average period of time it would take to sublease the location and the amount of potential sublease income for each leased location. We reassess our liability each quarter and adjust our liability accordingly when our estimates change. Insurance/Self Insurance Liabilities We use a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance pool, to provide for potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property damage, director and officers liability, vehicle liability and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience and evaluations of outside experts, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Investments Investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other than temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and our intent and ability to hold the investment. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the issuer, including industry and sector performance, operational and financing cash flow factors, and rating agency actions. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and or issuer conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments. Income Taxes We adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48), which sets out criteria for the use of judgment in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items, at the beginning of 2008. The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Significant judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions. The benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in our financial statements only after determining a more likely than not probability that the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge, if any, from tax authorities. When facts and circumstances change, we reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the financial statements as appropriate. 33 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Recent Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157), which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements required under other accounting pronouncements. It does not change existing guidance as to whether or not an instrument is carried at fair value. SFAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 157 1 (FSP FAS 157 1), which excludes SFAS No. 13, Accounting for Leases and certain other accounting pronouncements that address fair value measurements under SFAS 13, from the scope of SFAS 157. In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. 157 2 (FSP 157 2), which provides a one year delayed application of SFAS 157 for nonfinancial assets and liabilities, except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). We are required to adopt SFAS 157 as amended by FSP FAS 157 1 and FSP FAS 157 2 on September 1, 2008, the beginning of our fiscal 2009. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In October 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 157 3, Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset in a Market That Is Not Active (FSP 157 3), which clarifies the application of SFAS 157 when the market for a financial asset is inactive. Specifically, FSP 157 3 clarifies how (1) managements internal assumptions should be considered in measuring fair value when observable data are not present, (2) observable market information from an inactive market should be taken into account, and (3) the use of broker quotes or pricing services should be considered in assessing the relevance of observable and unobservable data to measure fair value. The guidance in FSP 157 3 is effective immediately and will apply to us upon adoption of SFAS 157. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, Including an Amendment to FASB No. 115 (SFAS 159). Under SFAS 159, entities may elect to measure specified financial instruments and warranty and insurance contracts at fair value on a contract by contract basis, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings each reporting period. The election, called the fair value option, will enable entities to achieve an offset accounting effect for changes in fair value of certain related assets and liabilities without having to apply more complex hedge accounting provisions. SFAS 159 will be effective for us September 1, 2008, the beginning of our fiscal 2009. We do not intend to elect the fair value option for any of our existing financial assets or financial liabilities; therefore, this statement is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In June 2008, the FASB issued Staff Position EITF 03 06 1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities (FSP EITF 03 06 1). FSP EITF 03 06 1 provides that unvested share based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (whether paid or unpaid) are participating securities and shall be included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two class method in SFAS No. 128, Earnings per Share. Our unvested RSUs are not eligible to receive dividends; therefore EITF 03 06 1 will not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an Amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin No 51 (SFAS 160). SFAS 160 establishes accounting and reporting standards for ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent, changes in a parents ownership of a noncontrolling interest, calculation and disclosure of the consolidated net income attributable to the parent and the noncontrolling interest, 34 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) changes in a parents ownership interest while the parent retains its controlling financial interest and fair value measurement of any retained noncontrolling equity investment. SFAS 160 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is prohibited. We must adopt these new requirements in our first quarter of fiscal 2010. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141R, Business Combinations (SFAS 141R), which establishes principles and requirements for the reporting entity in a business combination, including recognition and measurement in the financial statements of the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree. SFAS 141R applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years. We must adopt these new requirements in our first quarter of fiscal 2010. In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 133 (SFAS 161), which requires enhanced disclosures about derivative and hedging activities. This statement is effective for financial statements issued for periods beginning after November 15, 2008. Early adoption is permitted. We must provide these new disclosures no later than our second quarter of fiscal 2009. We are in the process of evaluating the impact that adoption of SFAS Nos. 141R, 160 and 161 will have on our future consolidated financial statements. Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to financial market risk resulting from changes in interest and foreign currency rates. We do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions, nor hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. Recent developments in the financial markets, however, have rendered risks less predictable, and liquidity concerns and credit risks have increased. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our money market funds, debt securities, corporate notes and bonds and enhanced money funds with effective maturities of generally three months to five years at the date of purchase. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while generating yields without significantly increasing risk. Historically, this was accomplished by investing in high investment grade securities with a minimum overall portfolio average credit rating of AA . A revised investment policy was approved in December 2007 by our Board of Directors, limiting future investments to direct U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations, repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations and U.S. Government and Government Agency Money Market funds. The investment policies of our subsidiaries have been reviewed and are consistent with our primary objective to preserve principal while generating yields without significantly leveraging risk. Our wholly owned insurance subsidiary invests in U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations, corporate notes and bonds and asset and mortgage backed securities with a minimum overall portfolio average credit rating of AA . All of our foreign subsidiaries investments are primarily in money market funds, investment grade securities, bankers acceptances, bank certificates of deposit and term deposits all denominated in their local currencies. Additionally, our Canadian subsidiary may invest a portion of their investments in 35 Table of Contents Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) U.S. dollar investment grade securities and bank term deposits to meet current U.S. dollar obligations. All of the investment policies of the Company and subsidiaries are reviewed at least annually. As the majority of these investments in cash and cash equivalents are of a short term nature, if interest rates were to increase or decrease, there is no material risk of a material valuation adjustment related to these instruments. Based on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances at the end of 2008, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $17.9 million (pre tax) to interest income on an annual basis. For those investments that are classified as available for sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in market volatility and interest rates are reflected within stockholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive income. The nature and amount of our long and short term debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As of the end of 2008, our fixed rate long term debt included: $67.1 million principal amount at maturity of 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes carried at $49.1 million; $900.0 million of 5.3% Senior Notes carried at $898.3 million; and $1.10 billion of 5.5% Senior Notes carried at $1.09 billion and additional notes and capital lease obligations totaling $142.0 million. Additionally, our variable rate long term debt included a 0.35% over Yen Tibor (6 month) Term Loan of $27.6 million. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt and may affect the interest expense related to the variable rate debt. Most transactions of our foreign subsidiaries are conducted in local currencies, limiting our exposure to changes in currency rates. The majority of the forward foreign exchange contracts were entered into by our wholly owned United Kingdom subsidiary, primarily to hedge U.S. dollar merchandise inventory purchases. We periodically enter into short term forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates on inventory purchases. The notional value of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at the end of 2008 was $89.8 million.

(2) The letter of guarantee is fully cash collateralized by the United Kingdom subsidiary. Note: We have letter of credit facilities (for commercial and standby letters of credit) totaling $286.6 million. The outstanding commitments under these facilities at September 2, 2007 totaled $119.1 million, including $71.7 million in standby letters of credit. For those entities with multi purpose lines, any increase in either letters of credit (standby and or commercial) issuance and or short term borrowing will result in a corresponding decrease in available credit. Financing Activities On June 16, 2008, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary entered into a ten year term loan in the amount of $27.6 million, with a variable rate of interest of Yen TIBOR (6 month) plus a 0.35% margin (1.24% at August 31, 2008) on the outstanding balance. The net proceeds were used to repay the 1.187% Promissory Notes due in July 2008 and for general corporate purposes. Interest is payable semi annually in December and June, with the first payment due in December 2008 and principal is due in June 2018. 29 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) On October 17, 2007, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued Promissory Notes through a private placement in the amount of $59.8 million, bearing interest at 2.695%. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due in October 2017. The proceeds were used to repay the 2.070% Promissory Notes due in October 2007 and for general corporate purposes. In February 2007, we issued $900 million of 5.3% Senior Notes due March 15, 2012 at a discount of $2.5 million and $1.1 billion of 5.5% Senior Notes due March 15, 2017 at a discount of $5.9 million (together, the 2007 Senior Notes). Interest on the 2007 Senior Notes is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The discount and issuance costs associated with the 2007 Senior Notes are being amortized to interest expense over the terms of those notes. At our option, we may redeem the 2007 Senior Notes at any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount of the 2007 Senior Notes to be redeemed, or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, we will be required to make an offer to purchase the 2007 Senior Notes at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase, upon certain events as defined by the terms of the 2007 Senior Notes. In April 2003, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.92% in the amount of $36.8 million, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due in April 2010. In November 2002, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.88% in the aggregate amount of $27.6 million, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due in November 2009. The U.S. Parent Company, Costco Wholesale Corporation guarantees all of the promissory notes issued by our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary. In August 1997, we sold $900.0 million principal amount at maturity Zero Coupon Notes due in August 2017. The Zero Coupon Notes were priced with a yield to maturity of 3.5%, resulting in gross proceeds to us of $449.6 million. The notes outstanding are convertible into a maximum of 1.5 million shares of Costco Common Stock shares at an initial conversion price of $22.71. Holders of the Zero Coupon Notes may require us to purchase the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of purchase) in August 2012. We may redeem, at our option, the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of redemption) any time after August 2002. As of August 31, 2008, $832.9 million in principal amount of the Zero Coupon Notes had been converted by note holders to shares of Costco Common Stock, of which $0.5 million and $61.2 million in principal were converted in 2008 and 2007, respectively, or $0.4 million and $42.3 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively, after factoring in the related debt discount. Derivatives We follow Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (as amended) (SFAS 133), in accounting for derivative and hedging activities. We use derivative and hedging arrangements only to manage what we believe to be well defined risks. Forward foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on inventory purchases and typically have very short terms. These forward contracts do not qualify for derivative hedge accounting. The aggregate notional amount of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at the end of 2008 and 2007 was $89.8 million and $75.0 million, respectively. The mark to market adjustment related to these contracts resulted in the recording of an asset of $4.6 million and a liability of $0.9 million at the end of 2008 and 2007, respectively, and $5.8 million and $0.4 million were recognized in interest income and other in the consolidated statements of income in 2008 and 2007, respectively. The majority of the forward foreign exchange contracts were entered into by our wholly owned United Kingdom subsidiary, primarily to hedge U.S. dollar merchandise inventory purchases. 30 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) We are exposed to risks in energy costs due to fluctuations in energy prices, particularly electricity, which we partially mitigate through the use of fixed price contracts with counterparties for approximately 19% of our warehouses in the U.S. and Canada, as well as certain depots and other facilities. We have also entered into variable priced contracts for the purchase of natural gas and fuel for our gas stations on an index basis. These contracts qualify for treatment as normal purchase or normal sales under SFAS 133 and require no mark to market adjustment. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements With the exception of our operating leases, we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition or consolidated financial statements. Stock Repurchase Programs In September and November of 2007, our Board of Directors approved $300.0 million and $1.0 billion, respectively, of stock repurchases, both expiring in 2010. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an additional $1.0 billion expiring in 2011, bringing total authorizations by our Board of Directors since inception of the program in 2001 to $6.80 billion. During 2008, we repurchased 13.8 million shares at an average price of $64.22 totaling approximately $886.9 million. During 2007, we repurchased 36.4 million shares of common stock, at an average price of $54.39, totaling approximately $1.98 billion. The remaining amount available to be purchased under our approved plan was approximately $2.06 billion at the end of 2008. Purchases are made from time to time as conditions warrant in the open market or in block purchases, and pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5 1. Repurchased shares are retired, in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments. We continue to review our accounting policies and evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, merchandise inventory valuation, impairment of long lived assets, warehouse closing costs, insurance/self insurance liabilities, investments and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. Revenue Recognition We generally recognize sales, net of estimated returns, at the time the member takes possession of merchandise or receives services. When we collect payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services, the amount received is generally recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed. We provide for estimated sales returns based on historical merchandise returns levels. Amounts collected from members, which under common trade practices are referred to as sales taxes, are recorded on a net basis. We evaluate the criteria of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal Versus Net as an Agent, in determining whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, when we are the primary obligor, subject to inventory risk, 31 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, influence product or service specifications, or have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded on a gross basis. If we are not the primary obligor and do not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above, we record the net amounts as commissions earned, which is reflected in net sales. Membership fee revenue represents annual membership fees paid by substantially all of our members. We account for membership fee revenue on a deferred basis, whereby revenue is recognized ratably over the one year membership period. In 2007, we performed a detailed analysis of the timing of recognition of membership fees based on each members specific renewal date, as this methodology represented an improvement over the historical method, which was based on the period in which the fee was collected. This review resulted in a $56.2 million reduction to membership fee revenue in 2007 and a corresponding increase to deferred membership fees on our consolidated balance sheet. This adjustment included both a change in method of applying an accounting principle to a preferable method and a correction for cumulative timing errors. Our Executive members qualify for a 2% reward (which can be redeemed only at Costco warehouses), up to a maximum of $500 per year, on all qualified purchases made at Costco. We account for this 2% reward as a reduction in sales, with the related liability being classified within other current liabilities. The sales reduction and corresponding liability are computed after giving effect to the estimated impact of non redemptions based on historical data. Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, as determined primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting, and are stated using the last in, first out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all other foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail inventory method of accounting and are stated using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. We believe the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. We record an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the expected annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end. The LIFO inventory adjustment in 2008 reduced ending inventory and gross margin by $32.3 million. At the end of 2007, merchandise inventories valued at LIFO approximated FIFO after considering the lower of cost or market principle. We provide for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts as a percentage of net sales. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect results of the actual physical inventory counts, which generally occur in the second and fourth quarters of the year. Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as we progress toward earning those rebates, provided they are probable and reasonably estimable. Other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of agreement, or other systematic and rational approaches. Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Warehouse Closing costs We periodically evaluate our long lived assets for indicators of impairment, such as a decision to relocate or close a warehouse location. Our judgments are based on existing market and operational conditions. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring a downward adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value. 32 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) We provide estimates for warehouse closing costs for both leased and owned locations to be closed or relocated. A considerable amount of judgment is involved in determining any impairment or our net liability, particularly related to the estimated sales price of owned locations and the potential sublease income at leased locations. These estimates are based on real estate conditions in the markets and our experience in those markets. We make assumptions about the average period of time it would take to sublease the location and the amount of potential sublease income for each leased location. We reassess our liability each quarter and adjust our liability accordingly when our estimates change. Insurance/Self Insurance Liabilities We use a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance pool, to provide for potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property damage, director and officers liability, vehicle liability and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience and evaluations of outside experts, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Investments Investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other than temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and our intent and ability to hold the investment. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the issuer, including industry and sector performance, operational and financing cash flow factors, and rating agency actions. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and or issuer conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments. Income Taxes We adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48), which sets out criteria for the use of judgment in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items, at the beginning of 2008. The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Significant judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions. The benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in our financial statements only after determining a more likely than not probability that the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge, if any, from tax authorities. When facts and circumstances change, we reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the financial statements as appropriate. 33 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Recent Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157), which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements required under other accounting pronouncements. It does not change existing guidance as to whether or not an instrument is carried at fair value. SFAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 157 1 (FSP FAS 157 1), which excludes SFAS No. 13, Accounting for Leases and certain other accounting pronouncements that address fair value measurements under SFAS 13, from the scope of SFAS 157. In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. 157 2 (FSP 157 2), which provides a one year delayed application of SFAS 157 for nonfinancial assets and liabilities, except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). We are required to adopt SFAS 157 as amended by FSP FAS 157 1 and FSP FAS 157 2 on September 1, 2008, the beginning of our fiscal 2009. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In October 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 157 3, Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset in a Market That Is Not Active (FSP 157 3), which clarifies the application of SFAS 157 when the market for a financial asset is inactive. Specifically, FSP 157 3 clarifies how (1) managements internal assumptions should be considered in measuring fair value when observable data are not present, (2) observable market information from an inactive market should be taken into account, and (3) the use of broker quotes or pricing services should be considered in assessing the relevance of observable and unobservable data to measure fair value. The guidance in FSP 157 3 is effective immediately and will apply to us upon adoption of SFAS 157. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, Including an Amendment to FASB No. 115 (SFAS 159). Under SFAS 159, entities may elect to measure specified financial instruments and warranty and insurance contracts at fair value on a contract by contract basis, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings each reporting period. The election, called the fair value option, will enable entities to achieve an offset accounting effect for changes in fair value of certain related assets and liabilities without having to apply more complex hedge accounting provisions. SFAS 159 will be effective for us September 1, 2008, the beginning of our fiscal 2009. We do not intend to elect the fair value option for any of our existing financial assets or financial liabilities; therefore, this statement is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In June 2008, the FASB issued Staff Position EITF 03 06 1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities (FSP EITF 03 06 1). FSP EITF 03 06 1 provides that unvested share based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (whether paid or unpaid) are participating securities and shall be included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two class method in SFAS No. 128, Earnings per Share. Our unvested RSUs are not eligible to receive dividends; therefore EITF 03 06 1 will not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an Amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin No 51 (SFAS 160). SFAS 160 establishes accounting and reporting standards for ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent, changes in a parents ownership of a noncontrolling interest, calculation and disclosure of the consolidated net income attributable to the parent and the noncontrolling interest, 34 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) changes in a parents ownership interest while the parent retains its controlling financial interest and fair value measurement of any retained noncontrolling equity investment. SFAS 160 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is prohibited. We must adopt these new requirements in our first quarter of fiscal 2010. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141R, Business Combinations (SFAS 141R), which establishes principles and requirements for the reporting entity in a business combination, including recognition and measurement in the financial statements of the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree. SFAS 141R applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years. We must adopt these new requirements in our first quarter of fiscal 2010. In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 133 (SFAS 161), which requires enhanced disclosures about derivative and hedging activities. This statement is effective for financial statements issued for periods beginning after November 15, 2008. Early adoption is permitted. We must provide these new disclosures no later than our second quarter of fiscal 2009. We are in the process of evaluating the impact that adoption of SFAS Nos. 141R, 160 and 161 will have on our future consolidated financial statements. Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to financial market risk resulting from changes in interest and foreign currency rates. We do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions, nor hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. Recent developments in the financial markets, however, have rendered risks less predictable, and liquidity concerns and credit risks have increased. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our money market funds, debt securities, corporate notes and bonds and enhanced money funds with effective maturities of generally three months to five years at the date of purchase. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while generating yields without significantly increasing risk. Historically, this was accomplished by investing in high investment grade securities with a minimum overall portfolio average credit rating of AA . A revised investment policy was approved in December 2007 by our Board of Directors, limiting future investments to direct U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations, repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations and U.S. Government and Government Agency Money Market funds. The investment policies of our subsidiaries have been reviewed and are consistent with our primary objective to preserve principal while generating yields without significantly leveraging risk. Our wholly owned insurance subsidiary invests in U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations, corporate notes and bonds and asset and mortgage backed securities with a minimum overall portfolio average credit rating of AA . All of our foreign subsidiaries investments are primarily in money market funds, investment grade securities, bankers acceptances, bank certificates of deposit and term deposits all denominated in their local currencies. Additionally, our Canadian subsidiary may invest a portion of their investments in 35 Table of Contents Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) U.S. dollar investment grade securities and bank term deposits to meet current U.S. dollar obligations. All of the investment policies of the Company and subsidiaries are reviewed at least annually. As the majority of these investments in cash and cash equivalents are of a short term nature, if interest rates were to increase or decrease, there is no material risk of a material valuation adjustment related to these instruments. Based on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances at the end of 2008, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $17.9 million (pre tax) to interest income on an annual basis. For those investments that are classified as available for sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in market volatility and interest rates are reflected within stockholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive income. The nature and amount of our long and short term debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As of the end of 2008, our fixed rate long term debt included: $67.1 million principal amount at maturity of 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes carried at $49.1 million; $900.0 million of 5.3% Senior Notes carried at $898.3 million; and $1.10 billion of 5.5% Senior Notes carried at $1.09 billion and additional notes and capital lease obligations totaling $142.0 million. Additionally, our variable rate long term debt included a 0.35% over Yen Tibor (6 month) Term Loan of $27.6 million. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt and may affect the interest expense related to the variable rate debt. Most transactions of our foreign subsidiaries are conducted in local currencies, limiting our exposure to changes in currency rates. The majority of the forward foreign exchange contracts were entered into by our wholly owned United Kingdom subsidiary, primarily to hedge U.S. dollar merchandise inventory purchases. We periodically enter into short term forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates on inventory purchases. The notional value of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at the end of 2008 was $89.8 million. 
 
Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) On October 17, 2007, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued Promissory Notes through a private placement in the amount of $59.8 million, bearing interest at 2.695%. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due in October 2017. The proceeds were used to repay the 2.070% Promissory Notes due in October 2007 and for general corporate purposes. In February 2007, we issued $900 million of 5.3% Senior Notes due March 15, 2012 at a discount of $2.5 million and $1.1 billion of 5.5% Senior Notes due March 15, 2017 at a discount of $5.9 million (together, the 2007 Senior Notes). Interest on the 2007 Senior Notes is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The discount and issuance costs associated with the 2007 Senior Notes are being amortized to interest expense over the terms of those notes. At our option, we may redeem the 2007 Senior Notes at any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount of the 2007 Senior Notes to be redeemed, or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, we will be required to make an offer to purchase the 2007 Senior Notes at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase, upon certain events as defined by the terms of the 2007 Senior Notes. In April 2003, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.92% in the amount of $36.8 million, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due in April 2010. In November 2002, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.88% in the aggregate amount of $27.6 million, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due in November 2009. The U.S. Parent Company, Costco Wholesale Corporation guarantees all of the promissory notes issued by our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary. In August 1997, we sold $900.0 million principal amount at maturity Zero Coupon Notes due in August 2017. The Zero Coupon Notes were priced with a yield to maturity of 3.5%, resulting in gross proceeds to us of $449.6 million. The notes outstanding are convertible into a maximum of 1.5 million shares of Costco Common Stock shares at an initial conversion price of $22.71. Holders of the Zero Coupon Notes may require us to purchase the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of purchase) in August 2012. We may redeem, at our option, the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of redemption) any time after August 2002. As of August 31, 2008, $832.9 million in principal amount of the Zero Coupon Notes had been converted by note holders to shares of Costco Common Stock, of which $0.5 million and $61.2 million in principal were converted in 2008 and 2007, respectively, or $0.4 million and $42.3 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively, after factoring in the related debt discount. Derivatives We follow Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (as amended) (SFAS 133), in accounting for derivative and hedging activities. We use derivative and hedging arrangements only to manage what we believe to be well defined risks. Forward foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on inventory purchases and typically have very short terms. These forward contracts do not qualify for derivative hedge accounting. The aggregate notional amount of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at the end of 2008 and 2007 was $89.8 million and $75.0 million, respectively. The mark to market adjustment related to these contracts resulted in the recording of an asset of $4.6 million and a liability of $0.9 million at the end of 2008 and 2007, respectively, and $5.8 million and $0.4 million were recognized in interest income and other in the consolidated statements of income in 2008 and 2007, respectively. The majority of the forward foreign exchange contracts were entered into by our wholly owned United Kingdom subsidiary, primarily to hedge U.S. dollar merchandise inventory purchases. 30 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) We are exposed to risks in energy costs due to fluctuations in energy prices, particularly electricity, which we partially mitigate through the use of fixed price contracts with counterparties for approximately 19% of our warehouses in the U.S. and Canada, as well as certain depots and other facilities. We have also entered into variable priced contracts for the purchase of natural gas and fuel for our gas stations on an index basis. These contracts qualify for treatment as normal purchase or normal sales under SFAS 133 and require no mark to market adjustment. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements With the exception of our operating leases, we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition or consolidated financial statements. Stock Repurchase Programs In September and November of 2007, our Board of Directors approved $300.0 million and $1.0 billion, respectively, of stock repurchases, both expiring in 2010. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an additional $1.0 billion expiring in 2011, bringing total authorizations by our Board of Directors since inception of the program in 2001 to $6.80 billion. During 2008, we repurchased 13.8 million shares at an average price of $64.22 totaling approximately $886.9 million. During 2007, we repurchased 36.4 million shares of common stock, at an average price of $54.39, totaling approximately $1.98 billion. The remaining amount available to be purchased under our approved plan was approximately $2.06 billion at the end of 2008. Purchases are made from time to time as conditions warrant in the open market or in block purchases, and pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5 1. Repurchased shares are retired, in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments. We continue to review our accounting policies and evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, merchandise inventory valuation, impairment of long lived assets, warehouse closing costs, insurance/self insurance liabilities, investments and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. Revenue Recognition We generally recognize sales, net of estimated returns, at the time the member takes possession of merchandise or receives services. When we collect payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services, the amount received is generally recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed. We provide for estimated sales returns based on historical merchandise returns levels. Amounts collected from members, which under common trade practices are referred to as sales taxes, are recorded on a net basis. We evaluate the criteria of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal Versus Net as an Agent, in determining whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, when we are the primary obligor, subject to inventory risk, 31 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, influence product or service specifications, or have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded on a gross basis. If we are not the primary obligor and do not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above, we record the net amounts as commissions earned, which is reflected in net sales. Membership fee revenue represents annual membership fees paid by substantially all of our members. We account for membership fee revenue on a deferred basis, whereby revenue is recognized ratably over the one year membership period. In 2007, we performed a detailed analysis of the timing of recognition of membership fees based on each members specific renewal date, as this methodology represented an improvement over the historical method, which was based on the period in which the fee was collected. This review resulted in a $56.2 million reduction to membership fee revenue in 2007 and a corresponding increase to deferred membership fees on our consolidated balance sheet. This adjustment included both a change in method of applying an accounting principle to a preferable method and a correction for cumulative timing errors. Our Executive members qualify for a 2% reward (which can be redeemed only at Costco warehouses), up to a maximum of $500 per year, on all qualified purchases made at Costco. We account for this 2% reward as a reduction in sales, with the related liability being classified within other current liabilities. The sales reduction and corresponding liability are computed after giving effect to the estimated impact of non redemptions based on historical data. Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, as determined primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting, and are stated using the last in, first out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all other foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail inventory method of accounting and are stated using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. We believe the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. We record an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the expected annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end. The LIFO inventory adjustment in 2008 reduced ending inventory and gross margin by $32.3 million. At the end of 2007, merchandise inventories valued at LIFO approximated FIFO after considering the lower of cost or market principle. We provide for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts as a percentage of net sales. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect results of the actual physical inventory counts, which generally occur in the second and fourth quarters of the year. Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as we progress toward earning those rebates, provided they are probable and reasonably estimable. Other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of agreement, or other systematic and rational approaches. Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Warehouse Closing costs We periodically evaluate our long lived assets for indicators of impairment, such as a decision to relocate or close a warehouse location. Our judgments are based on existing market and operational conditions. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring a downward adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value. 32 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) We provide estimates for warehouse closing costs for both leased and owned locations to be closed or relocated. A considerable amount of judgment is involved in determining any impairment or our net liability, particularly related to the estimated sales price of owned locations and the potential sublease income at leased locations. These estimates are based on real estate conditions in the markets and our experience in those markets. We make assumptions about the average period of time it would take to sublease the location and the amount of potential sublease income for each leased location. We reassess our liability each quarter and adjust our liability accordingly when our estimates change. Insurance/Self Insurance Liabilities We use a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance pool, to provide for potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property damage, director and officers liability, vehicle liability and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience and evaluations of outside experts, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Investments Investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other than temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and our intent and ability to hold the investment. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the issuer, including industry and sector performance, operational and financing cash flow factors, and rating agency actions. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and or issuer conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments. Income Taxes We adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48), which sets out criteria for the use of judgment in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items, at the beginning of 2008. The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Significant judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions. The benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in our financial statements only after determining a more likely than not probability that the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge, if any, from tax authorities. When facts and circumstances change, we reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the financial statements as appropriate. 33 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Recent Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157), which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements required under other accounting pronouncements. It does not change existing guidance as to whether or not an instrument is carried at fair value. SFAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 157 1 (FSP FAS 157 1), which excludes SFAS No. 13, Accounting for Leases and certain other accounting pronouncements that address fair value measurements under SFAS 13, from the scope of SFAS 157. In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. 157 2 (FSP 157 2), which provides a one year delayed application of SFAS 157 for nonfinancial assets and liabilities, except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). We are required to adopt SFAS 157 as amended by FSP FAS 157 1 and FSP FAS 157 2 on September 1, 2008, the beginning of our fiscal 2009. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In October 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 157 3, Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset in a Market That Is Not Active (FSP 157 3), which clarifies the application of SFAS 157 when the market for a financial asset is inactive. Specifically, FSP 157 3 clarifies how (1) managements internal assumptions should be considered in measuring fair value when observable data are not present, (2) observable market information from an inactive market should be taken into account, and (3) the use of broker quotes or pricing services should be considered in assessing the relevance of observable and unobservable data to measure fair value. The guidance in FSP 157 3 is effective immediately and will apply to us upon adoption of SFAS 157. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, Including an Amendment to FASB No. 115 (SFAS 159). Under SFAS 159, entities may elect to measure specified financial instruments and warranty and insurance contracts at fair value on a contract by contract basis, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings each reporting period. The election, called the fair value option, will enable entities to achieve an offset accounting effect for changes in fair value of certain related assets and liabilities without having to apply more complex hedge accounting provisions. SFAS 159 will be effective for us September 1, 2008, the beginning of our fiscal 2009. We do not intend to elect the fair value option for any of our existing financial assets or financial liabilities; therefore, this statement is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In June 2008, the FASB issued Staff Position EITF 03 06 1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities (FSP EITF 03 06 1). FSP EITF 03 06 1 provides that unvested share based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (whether paid or unpaid) are participating securities and shall be included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two class method in SFAS No. 128, Earnings per Share. Our unvested RSUs are not eligible to receive dividends; therefore EITF 03 06 1 will not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an Amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin No 51 (SFAS 160). SFAS 160 establishes accounting and reporting standards for ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent, changes in a parents ownership of a noncontrolling interest, calculation and disclosure of the consolidated net income attributable to the parent and the noncontrolling interest, 34 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) changes in a parents ownership interest while the parent retains its controlling financial interest and fair value measurement of any retained noncontrolling equity investment. SFAS 160 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is prohibited. We must adopt these new requirements in our first quarter of fiscal 2010. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141R, Business Combinations (SFAS 141R), which establishes principles and requirements for the reporting entity in a business combination, including recognition and measurement in the financial statements of the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree. SFAS 141R applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years. We must adopt these new requirements in our first quarter of fiscal 2010. In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 133 (SFAS 161), which requires enhanced disclosures about derivative and hedging activities. This statement is effective for financial statements issued for periods beginning after November 15, 2008. Early adoption is permitted. We must provide these new disclosures no later than our second quarter of fiscal 2009. We are in the process of evaluating the impact that adoption of SFAS Nos. 141R, 160 and 161 will have on our future consolidated financial statements. Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to financial market risk resulting from changes in interest and foreign currency rates. We do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions, nor hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. Recent developments in the financial markets, however, have rendered risks less predictable, and liquidity concerns and credit risks have increased. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our money market funds, debt securities, corporate notes and bonds and enhanced money funds with effective maturities of generally three months to five years at the date of purchase. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while generating yields without significantly increasing risk. Historically, this was accomplished by investing in high investment grade securities with a minimum overall portfolio average credit rating of AA . A revised investment policy was approved in December 2007 by our Board of Directors, limiting future investments to direct U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations, repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations and U.S. Government and Government Agency Money Market funds. The investment policies of our subsidiaries have been reviewed and are consistent with our primary objective to preserve principal while generating yields without significantly leveraging risk. Our wholly owned insurance subsidiary invests in U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations, corporate notes and bonds and asset and mortgage backed securities with a minimum overall portfolio average credit rating of AA . All of our foreign subsidiaries investments are primarily in money market funds, investment grade securities, bankers acceptances, bank certificates of deposit and term deposits all denominated in their local currencies. Additionally, our Canadian subsidiary may invest a portion of their investments in 35 Table of Contents Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) U.S. dollar investment grade securities and bank term deposits to meet current U.S. dollar obligations. All of the investment policies of the Company and subsidiaries are reviewed at least annually. As the majority of these investments in cash and cash equivalents are of a short term nature, if interest rates were to increase or decrease, there is no material risk of a material valuation adjustment related to these instruments. Based on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances at the end of 2008, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $17.9 million (pre tax) to interest income on an annual basis. For those investments that are classified as available for sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in market volatility and interest rates are reflected within stockholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive income. The nature and amount of our long and short term debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As of the end of 2008, our fixed rate long term debt included: $67.1 million principal amount at maturity of 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes carried at $49.1 million; $900.0 million of 5.3% Senior Notes carried at $898.3 million; and $1.10 billion of 5.5% Senior Notes carried at $1.09 billion and additional notes and capital lease obligations totaling $142.0 million. Additionally, our variable rate long term debt included a 0.35% over Yen Tibor (6 month) Term Loan of $27.6 million. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt and may affect the interest expense related to the variable rate debt. Most transactions of our foreign subsidiaries are conducted in local currencies, limiting our exposure to changes in currency rates. The majority of the forward foreign exchange contracts were entered into by our wholly owned United Kingdom subsidiary, primarily to hedge U.S. dollar merchandise inventory purchases. We periodically enter into short term forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates on inventory purchases. The notional value of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at the end of 2008 was $89.8 million. 
 
Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) We are exposed to risks in energy costs due to fluctuations in energy prices, particularly electricity, which we partially mitigate through the use of fixed price contracts with counterparties for approximately 19% of our warehouses in the U.S. and Canada, as well as certain depots and other facilities. We have also entered into variable priced contracts for the purchase of natural gas and fuel for our gas stations on an index basis. These contracts qualify for treatment as normal purchase or normal sales under SFAS 133 and require no mark to market adjustment. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements With the exception of our operating leases, we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition or consolidated financial statements. Stock Repurchase Programs In September and November of 2007, our Board of Directors approved $300.0 million and $1.0 billion, respectively, of stock repurchases, both expiring in 2010. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an additional $1.0 billion expiring in 2011, bringing total authorizations by our Board of Directors since inception of the program in 2001 to $6.80 billion. During 2008, we repurchased 13.8 million shares at an average price of $64.22 totaling approximately $886.9 million. During 2007, we repurchased 36.4 million shares of common stock, at an average price of $54.39, totaling approximately $1.98 billion. The remaining amount available to be purchased under our approved plan was approximately $2.06 billion at the end of 2008. Purchases are made from time to time as conditions warrant in the open market or in block purchases, and pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5 1. Repurchased shares are retired, in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments. We continue to review our accounting policies and evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, merchandise inventory valuation, impairment of long lived assets, warehouse closing costs, insurance/self insurance liabilities, investments and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. Revenue Recognition We generally recognize sales, net of estimated returns, at the time the member takes possession of merchandise or receives services.

Generally, when we are the primary obligor, subject to inventory risk, 31 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, influence product or service specifications, or have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded on a gross basis. If we are not the primary obligor and do not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above, we record the net amounts as commissions earned, which is reflected in net sales. Membership fee revenue represents annual membership fees paid by substantially all of our members.

This review resulted in a $56.2 million reduction to membership fee revenue in 2007 and a corresponding increase to deferred membership fees on our consolidated balance sheet. This adjustment included both a change in method of applying an accounting principle to a preferable method and a correction for cumulative timing errors. Our Executive members qualify for a 2% reward (which can be redeemed only at Costco warehouses), up to a maximum of $500 per year, on all qualified purchases made at Costco. We account for this 2% reward as a reduction in sales, with the related liability being classified within other current liabilities. The sales reduction and corresponding liability are computed after giving effect to the estimated impact of non redemptions based on historical data. Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, as determined primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting, and are stated using the last in, first out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all other foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail inventory method of accounting and are stated using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. We believe the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. We record an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the expected annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end. The LIFO inventory adjustment in 2008 reduced ending inventory and gross margin by $32.3 million. At the end of 2007, merchandise inventories valued at LIFO approximated FIFO after considering the lower of cost or market principle. We provide for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts as a percentage of net sales. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect results of the actual physical inventory counts, which generally occur in the second and fourth quarters of the year. Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as we progress toward earning those rebates, provided they are probable and reasonably estimable. Other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of agreement, or other systematic and rational approaches. Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Warehouse Closing costs We periodically evaluate our long lived assets for indicators of impairment, such as a decision to relocate or close a warehouse location. Our judgments are based on existing market and operational conditions. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring a downward adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value. 32 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) We provide estimates for warehouse closing costs for both leased and owned locations to be closed or relocated. A considerable amount of judgment is involved in determining any impairment or our net liability, particularly related to the estimated sales price of owned locations and the potential sublease income at leased locations. These estimates are based on real estate conditions in the markets and our experience in those markets. We make assumptions about the average period of time it would take to sublease the location and the amount of potential sublease income for each leased location. We reassess our liability each quarter and adjust our liability accordingly when our estimates change. Insurance/Self Insurance Liabilities We use a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance pool, to provide for potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property damage, director and officers liability, vehicle liability and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience and evaluations of outside experts, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Investments Investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other than temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment.

Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and or issuer conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments. Income Taxes We adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48), which sets out criteria for the use of judgment in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items, at the beginning of 2008. The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Significant judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions. The benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in our financial statements only after determining a more likely than not probability that the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge, if any, from tax authorities. When facts and circumstances change, we reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the financial statements as appropriate. 33 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Recent Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157), which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements required under other accounting pronouncements.

We are required to adopt SFAS 157 as amended by FSP FAS 157 1 and FSP FAS 157 2 on September 1, 2008, the beginning of our fiscal 2009. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In October 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 157 3, Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset in a Market That Is Not Active (FSP 157 3), which clarifies the application of SFAS 157 when the market for a financial asset is inactive. Specifically, FSP 157 3 clarifies how (1) managements internal assumptions should be considered in measuring fair value when observable data are not present, (2) observable market information from an inactive market should be taken into account, and (3) the use of broker quotes or pricing services should be considered in assessing the relevance of observable and unobservable data to measure fair value. The guidance in FSP 157 3 is effective immediately and will apply to us upon adoption of SFAS 157. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, Including an Amendment to FASB No. 115 (SFAS 159). Under SFAS 159, entities may elect to measure specified financial instruments and warranty and insurance contracts at fair value on a contract by contract basis, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings each reporting period. The election, called the fair value option, will enable entities to achieve an offset accounting effect for changes in fair value of certain related assets and liabilities without having to apply more complex hedge accounting provisions. SFAS 159 will be effective for us September 1, 2008, the beginning of our fiscal 2009. We do not intend to elect the fair value option for any of our existing financial assets or financial liabilities; therefore, this statement is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In June 2008, the FASB issued Staff Position EITF 03 06 1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities (FSP EITF 03 06 1). FSP EITF 03 06 1 provides that unvested share based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (whether paid or unpaid) are participating securities and shall be included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two class method in SFAS No. 128, Earnings per Share. Our unvested RSUs are not eligible to receive dividends; therefore EITF 03 06 1 will not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an Amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin No 51 (SFAS 160). SFAS 160 establishes accounting and reporting standards for ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent, changes in a parents ownership of a noncontrolling interest, calculation and disclosure of the consolidated net income attributable to the parent and the noncontrolling interest, 34 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) changes in a parents ownership interest while the parent retains its controlling financial interest and fair value measurement of any retained noncontrolling equity investment. SFAS 160 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is prohibited. We must adopt these new requirements in our first quarter of fiscal 2010. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141R, Business Combinations (SFAS 141R), which establishes principles and requirements for the reporting entity in a business combination, including recognition and measurement in the financial statements of the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree. SFAS 141R applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years. We must adopt these new requirements in our first quarter of fiscal 2010. In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 133 (SFAS 161), which requires enhanced disclosures about derivative and hedging activities. This statement is effective for financial statements issued for periods beginning after November 15, 2008. Early adoption is permitted. We must provide these new disclosures no later than our second quarter of fiscal 2009. We are in the process of evaluating the impact that adoption of SFAS Nos. 141R, 160 and 161 will have on our future consolidated financial statements. Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to financial market risk resulting from changes in interest and foreign currency rates. We do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions, nor hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. Recent developments in the financial markets, however, have rendered risks less predictable, and liquidity concerns and credit risks have increased. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our money market funds, debt securities, corporate notes and bonds and enhanced money funds with effective maturities of generally three months to five years at the date of purchase. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while generating yields without significantly increasing risk. Historically, this was accomplished by investing in high investment grade securities with a minimum overall portfolio average credit rating of AA . A revised investment policy was approved in December 2007 by our Board of Directors, limiting future investments to direct U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations, repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations and U.S. Government and Government Agency Money Market funds. The investment policies of our subsidiaries have been reviewed and are consistent with our primary objective to preserve principal while generating yields without significantly leveraging risk. Our wholly owned insurance subsidiary invests in U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations, corporate notes and bonds and asset and mortgage backed securities with a minimum overall portfolio average credit rating of AA . All of our foreign subsidiaries investments are primarily in money market funds, investment grade securities, bankers acceptances, bank certificates of deposit and term deposits all denominated in their local currencies. Additionally, our Canadian subsidiary may invest a portion of their investments in 35 Table of Contents Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) U.S. dollar investment grade securities and bank term deposits to meet current U.S. dollar obligations. All of the investment policies of the Company and subsidiaries are reviewed at least annually. As the majority of these investments in cash and cash equivalents are of a short term nature, if interest rates were to increase or decrease, there is no material risk of a material valuation adjustment related to these instruments. Based on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances at the end of 2008, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $17.9 million (pre tax) to interest income on an annual basis. For those investments that are classified as available for sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in market volatility and interest rates are reflected within stockholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive income. The nature and amount of our long and short term debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As of the end of 2008, our fixed rate long term debt included: $67.1 million principal amount at maturity of 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes carried at $49.1 million; $900.0 million of 5.3% Senior Notes carried at $898.3 million; and $1.10 billion of 5.5% Senior Notes carried at $1.09 billion and additional notes and capital lease obligations totaling $142.0 million. Additionally, our variable rate long term debt included a 0.35% over Yen Tibor (6 month) Term Loan of $27.6 million. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt and may affect the interest expense related to the variable rate debt. Most transactions of our foreign subsidiaries are conducted in local currencies, limiting our exposure to changes in currency rates. The majority of the forward foreign exchange contracts were entered into by our wholly owned United Kingdom subsidiary, primarily to hedge U.S. dollar merchandise inventory purchases. We periodically enter into short term forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates on inventory purchases. The notional value of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at the end of 2008 was $89.8 million. 
 
Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, influence product or service specifications, or have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded on a gross basis. If we are not the primary obligor and do not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above, we record the net amounts as commissions earned, which is reflected in net sales. Membership fee revenue represents annual membership fees paid by substantially all of our members. We account for membership fee revenue on a deferred basis, whereby revenue is recognized ratably over the one year membership period. In 2007, we performed a detailed analysis of the timing of recognition of membership fees based on each members specific renewal date, as this methodology represented an improvement over the historical method, which was based on the period in which the fee was collected. This review resulted in a $56.2 million reduction to membership fee revenue in 2007 and a corresponding increase to deferred membership fees on our consolidated balance sheet. This adjustment included both a change in method of applying an accounting principle to a preferable method and a correction for cumulative timing errors. Our Executive members qualify for a 2% reward (which can be redeemed only at Costco warehouses), up to a maximum of $500 per year, on all qualified purchases made at Costco. We account for this 2% reward as a reduction in sales, with the related liability being classified within other current liabilities. The sales reduction and corresponding liability are computed after giving effect to the estimated impact of non redemptions based on historical data. Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, as determined primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting, and are stated using the last in, first out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all other foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail inventory method of accounting and are stated using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. We believe the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. We record an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the expected annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end. The LIFO inventory adjustment in 2008 reduced ending inventory and gross margin by $32.3 million. At the end of 2007, merchandise inventories valued at LIFO approximated FIFO after considering the lower of cost or market principle. We provide for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts as a percentage of net sales. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect results of the actual physical inventory counts, which generally occur in the second and fourth quarters of the year. Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as we progress toward earning those rebates, provided they are probable and reasonably estimable. Other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of agreement, or other systematic and rational approaches. Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Warehouse Closing costs We periodically evaluate our long lived assets for indicators of impairment, such as a decision to relocate or close a warehouse location. Our judgments are based on existing market and operational conditions. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring a downward adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value. 32 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) We provide estimates for warehouse closing costs for both leased and owned locations to be closed or relocated. A considerable amount of judgment is involved in determining any impairment or our net liability, particularly related to the estimated sales price of owned locations and the potential sublease income at leased locations. These estimates are based on real estate conditions in the markets and our experience in those markets. We make assumptions about the average period of time it would take to sublease the location and the amount of potential sublease income for each leased location. We reassess our liability each quarter and adjust our liability accordingly when our estimates change. Insurance/Self Insurance Liabilities We use a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance pool, to provide for potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property damage, director and officers liability, vehicle liability and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience and evaluations of outside experts, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Investments Investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other than temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and our intent and ability to hold the investment. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the issuer, including industry and sector performance, operational and financing cash flow factors, and rating agency actions. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and or issuer conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments. Income Taxes We adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48), which sets out criteria for the use of judgment in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items, at the beginning of 2008. The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Significant judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions. The benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in our financial statements only after determining a more likely than not probability that the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge, if any, from tax authorities. When facts and circumstances change, we reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the financial statements as appropriate. 33 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Recent Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157), which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements required under other accounting pronouncements. It does not change existing guidance as to whether or not an instrument is carried at fair value. SFAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 157 1 (FSP FAS 157 1), which excludes SFAS No. 13, Accounting for Leases and certain other accounting pronouncements that address fair value measurements under SFAS 13, from the scope of SFAS 157. In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. 157 2 (FSP 157 2), which provides a one year delayed application of SFAS 157 for nonfinancial assets and liabilities, except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). We are required to adopt SFAS 157 as amended by FSP FAS 157 1 and FSP FAS 157 2 on September 1, 2008, the beginning of our fiscal 2009. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In October 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 157 3, Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset in a Market That Is Not Active (FSP 157 3), which clarifies the application of SFAS 157 when the market for a financial asset is inactive. Specifically, FSP 157 3 clarifies how (1) managements internal assumptions should be considered in measuring fair value when observable data are not present, (2) observable market information from an inactive market should be taken into account, and (3) the use of broker quotes or pricing services should be considered in assessing the relevance of observable and unobservable data to measure fair value. The guidance in FSP 157 3 is effective immediately and will apply to us upon adoption of SFAS 157. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, Including an Amendment to FASB No. 115 (SFAS 159). Under SFAS 159, entities may elect to measure specified financial instruments and warranty and insurance contracts at fair value on a contract by contract basis, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings each reporting period. The election, called the fair value option, will enable entities to achieve an offset accounting effect for changes in fair value of certain related assets and liabilities without having to apply more complex hedge accounting provisions. SFAS 159 will be effective for us September 1, 2008, the beginning of our fiscal 2009. We do not intend to elect the fair value option for any of our existing financial assets or financial liabilities; therefore, this statement is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

As of the end of 2008, our fixed rate long term debt included: $67.1 million principal amount at maturity of 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes carried at $49.1 million; $900.0 million of 5.3% Senior Notes carried at $898.3 million; and $1.10 billion of 5.5% Senior Notes carried at $1.09 billion and additional notes and capital lease obligations totaling $142.0 million. Additionally, our variable rate long term debt included a 0.35% over Yen Tibor (6 month) Term Loan of $27.6 million. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt and may affect the interest expense related to the variable rate debt. Most transactions of our foreign subsidiaries are conducted in local currencies, limiting our exposure to changes in currency rates. The majority of the forward foreign exchange contracts were entered into by our wholly owned United Kingdom subsidiary, primarily to hedge U.S. dollar merchandise inventory purchases. We periodically enter into short term forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates on inventory purchases. The notional value of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at the end of 2008 was $89.8 million. 
 
Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Recent Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157), which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements required under other accounting pronouncements. It does not change existing guidance as to whether or not an instrument is carried at fair value. SFAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 157 1 (FSP FAS 157 1), which excludes SFAS No. 13, Accounting for Leases and certain other accounting pronouncements that address fair value measurements under SFAS 13, from the scope of SFAS 157. In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. 157 2 (FSP 157 2), which provides a one year delayed application of SFAS 157 for nonfinancial assets and liabilities, except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). We are required to adopt SFAS 157 as amended by FSP FAS 157 1 and FSP FAS 157 2 on September 1, 2008, the beginning of our fiscal 2009. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In October 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 157 3, Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset in a Market That Is Not Active (FSP 157 3), which clarifies the application of SFAS 157 when the market for a financial asset is inactive. Specifically, FSP 157 3 clarifies how (1) managements internal assumptions should be considered in measuring fair value when observable data are not present, (2) observable market information from an inactive market should be taken into account, and (3) the use of broker quotes or pricing services should be considered in assessing the relevance of observable and unobservable data to measure fair value. The guidance in FSP 157 3 is effective immediately and will apply to us upon adoption of SFAS 157. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, Including an Amendment to FASB No. 115 (SFAS 159). Under SFAS 159, entities may elect to measure specified financial instruments and warranty and insurance contracts at fair value on a contract by contract basis, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings each reporting period. The election, called the fair value option, will enable entities to achieve an offset accounting effect for changes in fair value of certain related assets and liabilities without having to apply more complex hedge accounting provisions. SFAS 159 will be effective for us September 1, 2008, the beginning of our fiscal 2009. We do not intend to elect the fair value option for any of our existing financial assets or financial liabilities; therefore, this statement is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In June 2008, the FASB issued Staff Position EITF 03 06 1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities (FSP EITF 03 06 1). FSP EITF 03 06 1 provides that unvested share based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (whether paid or unpaid) are participating securities and shall be included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two class method in SFAS No. 128, Earnings per Share. Our unvested RSUs are not eligible to receive dividends; therefore EITF 03 06 1 will not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an Amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin No 51 (SFAS 160). SFAS 160 establishes accounting and reporting standards for ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent, changes in a parents ownership of a noncontrolling interest, calculation and disclosure of the consolidated net income attributable to the parent and the noncontrolling interest, 34 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) changes in a parents ownership interest while the parent retains its controlling financial interest and fair value measurement of any retained noncontrolling equity investment. SFAS 160 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is prohibited. We must adopt these new requirements in our first quarter of fiscal 2010. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141R, Business Combinations (SFAS 141R), which establishes principles and requirements for the reporting entity in a business combination, including recognition and measurement in the financial statements of the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree. SFAS 141R applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years. We must adopt these new requirements in our first quarter of fiscal 2010. In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 133 (SFAS 161), which requires enhanced disclosures about derivative and hedging activities. This statement is effective for financial statements issued for periods beginning after November 15, 2008. Early adoption is permitted. We must provide these new disclosures no later than our second quarter of fiscal 2009. We are in the process of evaluating the impact that adoption of SFAS Nos. 141R, 160 and 161 will have on our future consolidated financial statements. Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to financial market risk resulting from changes in interest and foreign currency rates. We do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions, nor hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. Recent developments in the financial markets, however, have rendered risks less predictable, and liquidity concerns and credit risks have increased. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our money market funds, debt securities, corporate notes and bonds and enhanced money funds with effective maturities of generally three months to five years at the date of purchase. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while generating yields without significantly increasing risk. Historically, this was accomplished by investing in high investment grade securities with a minimum overall portfolio average credit rating of AA . A revised investment policy was approved in December 2007 by our Board of Directors, limiting future investments to direct U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations, repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations and U.S. Government and Government Agency Money Market funds. The investment policies of our subsidiaries have been reviewed and are consistent with our primary objective to preserve principal while generating yields without significantly leveraging risk. Our wholly owned insurance subsidiary invests in U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations, corporate notes and bonds and asset and mortgage backed securities with a minimum overall portfolio average credit rating of AA . All of our foreign subsidiaries investments are primarily in money market funds, investment grade securities, bankers acceptances, bank certificates of deposit and term deposits all denominated in their local currencies. Additionally, our Canadian subsidiary may invest a portion of their investments in 35 Table of Contents Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) U.S. dollar investment grade securities and bank term deposits to meet current U.S. dollar obligations. All of the investment policies of the Company and subsidiaries are reviewed at least annually. As the majority of these investments in cash and cash equivalents are of a short term nature, if interest rates were to increase or decrease, there is no material risk of a material valuation adjustment related to these instruments. Based on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances at the end of 2008, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $17.9 million (pre tax) to interest income on an annual basis. For those investments that are classified as available for sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in market volatility and interest rates are reflected within stockholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive income. The nature and amount of our long and short term debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As of the end of 2008, our fixed rate long term debt included: $67.1 million principal amount at maturity of 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes carried at $49.1 million; $900.0 million of 5.3% Senior Notes carried at $898.3 million; and $1.10 billion of 5.5% Senior Notes carried at $1.09 billion and additional notes and capital lease obligations totaling $142.0 million. Additionally, our variable rate long term debt included a 0.35% over Yen Tibor (6 month) Term Loan of $27.6 million.
