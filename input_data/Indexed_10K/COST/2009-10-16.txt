Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) OVERVIEW Our fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to August 31. References to 2009, 2008, and 2007 relate to the 52 week years ended August 30, 2009, August 31, 2008, and September 2, 2007 respectively. Key items for 2009 included: Net sales decreased 1.5% from the prior year to $69,889, attributable to a 4% decrease in comparable sales (sales in warehouses open for at least one year, including relocated warehouses), partially offset by the opening of 15 new warehouses (19 opened, two closed due to relocation, and the closure of our two Costco Home locations) in 2009. Net sales were significantly impacted by the year over year decrease in the price of gasoline and by certain foreign exchange rates; Membership fees increased 1.8%, to $1,533, primarily due to new membership sign ups at warehouses opened in 2009, the continued benefit of membership sign ups at warehouses opened in 2008, and increased penetration of our higher fee Executive Membership program. Membership fees were negatively impacted by a $27 charge related to a proposed litigation settlement concerning our membership renewal policy; Gross margin (net sales less merchandise costs) as a percentage of net sales increased 28 basis points over the prior year, Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 58 basis points over the prior year; Net income decreased 15% to $1,086, or $2.47 per diluted share, in 2009 compared to $1,283, or $2.89 per diluted share, in 2008; The Board of Directors approved an increase in the quarterly cash dividend from $0.16 to $0.18 per share; and We repurchased 895,000 shares of our common stock, at an average cost of $63.84 per share, totaling approximately $57. As previously reported, 2007 was impacted by the following unusual items, the effects of which are reflected in the table below: Sales returns reserve: We revised our estimate of our sales returns reserve to include a longer timeframe for returns, as well as a lower realization rate on certain returned items. Employee tax consequences on stock options: We made payments to employees in connection with changes in exercise prices designed to avoid adverse tax consequences for employees and recorded a charge for the estimated amount to remedy adverse tax consequences related to stock options held and previously exercised by employees outside the United States. Excise tax refund: We received a refund related to 2002 through 2006, as a result of a settlement with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service relating to excise taxes previously paid. Deferred membership: We analyzed the timing of recognition of membership fees, resulting in a reduction to membership fee revenue and a corresponding increase to deferred membership fees on our consolidated balance sheet. 20 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) We believe disclosing the effects of these items helps provide a meaningful comparison of our current year results to prior years. The impact of each of these items noted above is presented below: 2007 Sales returnreserve Employee taxconsequences onstock options Deferredmembership Excise taxrefund Total Net sales $ (452 ) $ $ $ $ (452 ) Membership fees (56 ) (56 ) Total revenue (452 ) (56 ) (508 ) Merchandise costs 358 9 367 Gross margin(1) (94 ) 9 (85 ) SG&A (47 ) (47 ) Operating income (94 ) (47 ) (56 ) 9 (188 ) Interest expense Interest income and other (1 ) 1 Income before income taxes (95 ) (47 ) (56 ) 10 (188 ) Provision for income taxes 35 17 21 (4 ) 69 Net Income $ (60 ) $ (30 ) $ (35 ) $ 6 $ (119 ) (1) Net sales less merchandise costs. Results of Operations Net Sales 2009 2008 2007 Net sales $ 69,889 $ 70,977 $ 63,088 Effect of change in estimated sales returns reserve 452 Net sales, as adjusted $ 69,889 $ 70,977 $ 63,540 Net sales (decrease) increase (1.5 )% 12.5 % 7.0 % Net sales (decrease) increase, as adjusted (1.5 )% 11.7 % 7.8 % Increase (decrease) in comparable warehouse sales (4 )% 8 % 6 % Warehouse openings, net 15 24 30 2009 vs. 2008 Net Sales Our 2009 sales results, particularly in hardlines and softlines, were negatively impacted by general economic conditions, and we believe that those conditions may continue to have a significant adverse impact on spending by our members. We believe, however, that due to the nature of our business model, we are better positioned than many retailers to compete in such an environment. Net sales decreased 1.5% during 2009 compared to 2008. The $1,088 decrease was comprised of a $2,590 decrease in comparable sales, partially offset by an increase of $1,502 primarily from sales at new warehouses opened during 2009 and 2008. Our sales were also impacted by a lower number of warehouse openings year over year. 21 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Foreign currencies, particularly in Canada, the United Kingdom, and Korea, weakened against the U.S. dollar, which negatively impacted net sales during 2009 by approximately $2,421 (341 basis points). Net sales were also negatively impacted by gasoline price deflation during 2009 by approximately $2,164 (305 basis points), which resulted from a 30% decline in the average sales price per gallon. Comparable Sales Comparable sales decreased 4% in 2009. Weakening foreign currencies negatively impacted comparable sales by approximately $2,339 (333 basis points) in 2009. Gasoline price deflation negatively impacted comparable sales results by approximately $2,113 (298 basis points) during 2009. Comparable sales were negatively impacted by a decline in the average amount spent (after adjustment for gasoline price deflation and measured in local currencies), partially offset by an increase in shopping frequency. Reported comparable sales growth includes the negative impact of cannibalization (established warehouses losing sales to our newly opened locations). We believe the decline is a function of adverse economic conditions generally rather that a fundamental change in our members relationship to the company. 2008 vs. 2007 Net sales increased 12.5% to $70,977 in 2008, from $63,088 in 2007. Excluding the impact of the change in the estimated sales returns reserve in 2007, net sales, as adjusted, increased $7,437, or 11.7% in 2008 as compared to the previous year. The $7,437 increase in adjusted net sales is comprised of $5,153 from the increase in comparable warehouse sales and $2,284 primarily from sales at new warehouses opened during 2008 and 2007. In the third quarter of 2007, we introduced a 90 day return policy in the United States on certain electronic items. Significantly stronger foreign currencies, particularly in Canada, positively impacted adjusted net sales by approximately $1,134, or 180 basis points. Gasoline sales also contributed to the $7,437 adjusted net sales growth by approximately $2,236, with approximately $1,489 related to the increase in gasoline sales prices. Additionally, we experienced price increases in certain foods and fresh foods items that positively impacted net sales, which were partially offset by price decreases in certain items within our hardlines category. Most of the comparable sales growth was derived from increased amounts spent by members, with a smaller contribution from increases in shopping frequency. Gasoline sales positively impacted comparable warehouse sales growth by approximately $1,938. Comparable warehouse sales growth excluding gasoline would have been lower by approximately 267 basis points. Significantly stronger foreign currencies, particularly in Canada, positively impacted comparable sales by approximately $1,070, or 170 basis points. Reported comparable sales growth includes the negative impact of cannibalization (established warehouses losing sales to our newly opened locations). Membership Fees 2009 2008 2007 Membership fees $ 1,533 $ 1,506 $ 1,313 Adjustment to deferred membership balance 56 Membership fees, as adjusted $ 1,533 $ 1,506 $ 1,369 Membership fees increase 1.8 % 14.7 % 10.5 % Membership fees increase, as adjusted 1.8 % 10.0 % 15.2 % Membership fees as a percent of net sales 2.19 % 2.12 % 2.08 % Adjusted membership fees, as a percent of adjusted net sales 2.19 % 2.12 % 2.16 % Total cardholders 56,000 53,500 50,400 22 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) 2009 vs. 2008 Membership fees increased 1.8% in 2009 compared to 2008, primarily due to membership sign ups at the 15 new warehouses opened in 2009 (19 opened, two closed due to relocations, and two closed Costco Home locations), the continued benefit of membership sign ups at warehouses opened in 2008, and increased penetration of our higher fee Executive Membership program. This increase was negatively impacted by a charge of $27 related to a proposed litigation settlement concerning our membership renewal policy and the weakening of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar, particularly in Canada, the United Kingdom, and Korea, which negatively impacted membership fees during 2009 by approximately $50. Membership fees were also impacted by a lower number of warehouse openings year over year. Our member renewal rate, currently at 87% is consistent with recent years. As previously disclosed, effective with renewals occurring on and after March 1, 2009, we changed an element of our membership renewal policy. Memberships renewed within two months after expiration of the current membership year are extended for twelve months from the expiration date. (Under the previous policy, renewals within six months of the expiration date were extended for twelve months from the expiration date.) Memberships renewed more than two months after such expiration date are extended for twelve months from the renewal date. Although this change will have the effect of deferring recognition of certain membership fees paid by late renewing members, the effect is not expected to be material. 2008 vs. 2007 Membership fees increased 14.7% to $1,506, or 2.12% of net sales in 2008, from $1,313, or 2.08% of net sales in 2007. Excluding the adjustment to deferred membership fees in 2007, adjusted membership fees increased 10.0% from 2007. The increase was primarily due to: new membership sign ups at the 24 new warehouses opened (34 opened and 10 closed due to relocations); increased penetration of the higher fee Executive Membership program; and the five dollar increase in our annual membership fee in the second half of 2006 for non Executive members. Our member renewal rate at the end of 2008 was 87%. Gross Margin 2009 2008 2007 Gross margin $ 7,554 $ 7,474 $ 6,638 Unusual items 85 Gross margin, as adjusted $ 7,554 $ 7,474 $ 6,723 Gross margin increase 1.1 % 12.6 % 6.8 % Gross margin increase, as adjusted 1.1 % 11.2 % 8.1 % Gross margin as a percent of net sales 10.81 % 10.53 % 10.52 % Adjusted gross margin as a percent of adjusted net sales 10.81 % 10.53 % 10.58 % 2009 vs. 2008 Gross margin, as a percent of net sales, increased 28 basis points compared to 2008. This increase was primarily related to a net 18 basis point increase in our core merchandise departments, primarily in food and sundries, partially offset by a decrease in softlines, and a net seven basis point increase from our warehouse ancillary businesses, primarily our gasoline and pharmacy departments. The majority of this gross margin improvement was due to our lower margin gas business having lower sales penetration, due to the decline in the average selling price per gallon. Increased sales penetration of the Executive Membership two percent reward program negatively affected gross margin by six basis 23 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) points. In addition, gross margin was favorably impacted by nine basis points due to reversing the $32 LIFO reserve established in the prior year as we experienced net deflation, year over year, in the cost of our merchandise inventories. Foreign currencies, particularly in Canada, the United Kingdom and Korea, weakened against the U.S. dollar, which negatively impacted gross margin for 2009 by approximately $258. 2008 vs. 2007 Gross margin, as a percent of net sales, increased one basis point compared to 2007. Excluding the unusual items affecting net sales and gross margin in 2007, adjusted gross margin as a percent of adjusted net sales decreased five basis points in 2008 as compared to 2007. This decrease was largely due to a net 12 basis point decrease in our warehouse ancillary businesses, particularly in one hour photo, tire shop and food services, partially offset by an increase in our gasoline business; a $32, or five basis point LIFO charge, resulting from price increases in certain food items and gasoline; and a three basis point decrease resulting from the increased penetration of the Executive Membership two percent reward program and increased spending by Executive members. These decreases were partially offset by a net 15 basis point increase from our merchandise departments, particularly fresh foods, food and sundries, Costco Online and our international operations, partially offset by a decrease in softlines. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 2009 2008 2007 Selling, general and administrative expenses $ 7,252 $ 6,954 $ 6,273 Unusual items (47 ) SG&A, as adjusted $ 7,252 $ 6,954 $ 6,226 SG&A as a percent of net sales 10.38 % 9.80 % 9.94 % Adjusted SG&A as percent of adjusted net sales 10.38 % 9.80 % 9.80 % 2009 vs. 2008 SG&A expenses, as a percent of net sales, increased 58 basis points compared to 2008. Increased warehouse operating and central administrative costs, as a percent of net sales, negatively impacted SG&A by approximately 56 basis points, resulting primarily from lower sales levels and higher employee health care costs. Higher stock based compensation expense had a negative impact of one basis point. In addition, we recorded an adjustment to the net realizable value of the cash surrender value of employee life insurance contracts, which negatively impacted SG&A, as a percent of net sales, by two basis points. The net realizable value of the insurance contracts is largely based on changes in investment assets underlying the policies and is subject to conditions generally affecting equity and debt markets. In 2008, we recorded a $16 reserve in connection with a legal settlement, which positively impacted the comparison to current years SG&A expense, as a percent of net sales, by two basis points. SG&A expenses, as a percent of net sales, for 2009 were adversely impacted by the decrease in the price of gasoline, as it produced a decline in sales dollars without a comparative reduction in labor or other administrative costs. Foreign currencies, particularly in Canada, the United Kingdom, and Korea, weakened against the U.S. dollar, which positively impacted SG&A for 2009 by approximately $217. 24 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) 2008 vs. 2007 SG&A expenses, as a percent of net sales, decreased 14 basis points compared to 2007. Excluding the unusual items affecting net sales and SG&A expenses in 2007, adjusted SG&A as a percentage of adjusted net sales was comparable to 2007. Warehouse operating and central administrative costs positively impacted adjusted SG&A comparisons, on a net basis, by approximately seven basis points, primarily due to decreased payroll and benefits costs as a percent of adjusted net sales. Stock based compensation expense negatively impacted adjusted SG&A comparisons by three basis points, primarily due to a higher closing stock price on the date that our October 2007 RSU grant was valued as compared to previous grants. Additionally, in 2008, we recorded a $16 reserve in connection with a litigation settlement and accrued approximately $9 for compensation adjustments we made to employees enrolled in our medical and dental plans related to a decision to share a portion of the health plans savings that we achieved. These two items negatively impacted adjusted SG&A comparisons by four basis points. Preopening Expenses 2009 2008 2007 Preopening expenses $ 41 $ 57 $ 55 Warehouse openings 19 34 30 Preopening expenses include costs incurred for startup operations related to new warehouses and the expansion of ancillary operations at existing warehouses. Preopening expenses can vary due to the timing of the opening relative to our year end, whether the warehouse is owned or leased, whether the opening is in an existing, new, or international market. The decline in 2009 is primarily attributable to fewer warehouse openings. Provision for Impaired Assets and Closing Costs, Net 2009 2008 2007 Warehouse closing expenses $ 9 $ 9 $ 16 Impairment of long lived assets 8 10 Net gains on the sale of real property (19 ) (2 ) Provision for impaired assets & closing costs, net $ 17 $ $ 14 This provision primarily includes costs related to impairment of long lived assets; future lease obligations of warehouses that have been closed or relocated to new facilities; accelerated depreciation, based on the shortened useful life through the expected closing date, on buildings to be demolished or sold and that are not otherwise impaired; and losses or gains resulting from the sale of real property, largely comprised of former warehouse locations. 2009 vs. 2008 The net provision for impaired assets and closing costs was a $17 in 2009, compared to a nominal amount in 2008. The provision in 2009 included charges of $9 for warehouse closing expenses, and impairment charges of $8, primarily related to the closing of our two Costco Home locations in July 2009. 25 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) 2008 vs. 2007 The net provision for impaired assets and closing costs was a nominal amount in 2008, compared to $14 in 2007. The provision in 2008 included charges of $9 for warehouse closing expenses, and impairment charges of $10, primarily related to a location in Michigan that was demolished and rebuilt. These charges were offset by $19 of net gain on the sale of real property, largely former warehouse locations. At the end of both 2009 and 2008, the reserve for warehouse closing costs was $5 and primarily related to future lease obligations. Interest Expense 2009 2008 2007 Interest expense $ 108 $ 103 $ 64 2009 vs. 2008 Interest expense primarily relates to our $900 of 5.3% and $1,100 of 5.5% Senior Notes (2007 Senior Notes) issued in 2007. The increase in interest expense is primarily due to a decrease in capitalized interest related to reduced new warehouse and remodel construction activity year over year. 2008 vs. 2007 The increase in interest expense resulted primarily from the issuance of our 2007 Senior Notes in February 2007, partially offset by lower interest expense resulting from the repayment in March 2007 of the $300 5.5% Senior Notes. Interest Income and Other 2009 2008 2007 Interest income $ 27 $ 96 $ 128 Earnings of affiliates 33 42 36 Minority interest and other (15 ) (5 ) 1 Interest Income and other $ 45 $ 133 $ 165 2009 vs. 2008 The decrease in interest income was largely due to lower interest rates, year over year, on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances resulting from a change in policy to invest primarily in U.S. government and agency securities, which earn a lower interest rate. In addition, we recognized $12 of other than temporary impairment losses on certain securities within our investment portfolio in 2009 compared to an impairment loss of $5 in 2008. See further discussion in Liquidity and Capital Resources. The decrease in the earnings of affiliates is primarily attributable to our investment in Costco Mexico (a 50% owned joint venture). Costco Mexicos earnings were lower in 2009, primarily due to the peso weakening against the U.S. dollar. The decrease in minority interest and other is primarily due to a negative $5 mark to market charge in 2009, compared to a $6 gain in 2008, related to our forward foreign exchange contracts. See the Derivatives section for more information. 26 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) 2008 vs. 2007 The decrease in interest income was largely due to lower interest rates, year over year, on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances. In addition, we recognized $5 of other than temporary impairment losses on certain securities within our investment portfolio. The increase in the earnings of affiliates is primarily attributable to our investment in Costco Mexico (a 50% owned joint venture). Provision for Income Taxes 2009 2008 2007 Income tax expense $ 628 $ 716 $ 627 Effective tax rate 36.7 % 35.8 % 36.7 % The lower tax rate in 2008 was primarily attributable to discrete benefits recognized during the year. Net Income 2009 2008 2007 Net income $ 1,086 $ 1,283 $ 1,083 Unusual items (net of tax) 119 Net income, as adjusted $ 1,086 $ 1,283 $ 1,202 Diluted earnings per share $ 2.47 $ 2.89 $ 2.37 Shares used to calculate diluted net income per common share (000s) 440,454 444,240 457,641 Diluted earnings per share (decrease) / increase (15 )% 22 % 3 % 2009 vs. 2008 Net income for 2009 decreased to $1,086, or $2.47 per diluted share, from $1,283, or $2.89 per diluted share, during 2008, representing a 15% decrease in diluted net income per share. As previously discussed, foreign currencies, particularly in Canada, the United Kingdom and Korea, weakened against the U.S. dollar, which negatively impacted net income for 2009 by approximately $83 after tax, or $0.19 per diluted share. Additionally, net income for 2009 was negatively impacted by a $34 pre tax charge, or approximately $0.05 per diluted share, related to a proposed litigation settlement concerning our membership renewal policy, as well as a $23 pre tax charge, or approximately $0.03 per diluted share, for an adjustment to the net realizable value of the cash surrender value of employee life insurance contracts. Net income for 2009 was positively impacted by a $32 pre tax, or $0.05 per diluted share, benefit due to the reversal of the LIFO reserve established in 2008. 2008 vs. 2007 Net income for 2008 increased to $1,283, or $2.89 per diluted share, from $1,083, or $2.37 per diluted share, during 2007. The unusual items previously discussed totaled $119, net of tax, or $0.26 per diluted share in 2007. Exclusive of these items, earnings in 2007 were $2.63 per diluted share. Net income per diluted share in 2008 represents an increase of 10% over this adjusted amount. During 2008, we repurchased and retired 13,812,000 shares of common stock, favorably impacting earnings per diluted share by approximately $0.03. 27 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The following table itemizes components of our most liquid assets at the end of 2009 and 2008 (dollars in millions, except per share data): 2009 2008 Cash and cash equivalents $ 3,157 $ 2,619 Short term investments 570 656 Total $ 3,727 $ 3,275 Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from warehouse operations and existing cash, cash equivalents, and short term investment balances, which were $3,727 and $3,275 at the end of 2009 and 2008, respectively. Of these balances, approximately $758 and $788 at the end of 2009 and 2008, respectively, represented debit and credit card receivables, primarily related to sales in the week prior to the end of the fiscal year. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $2,092 in 2009 compared to $2,206 in 2008, a decrease of approximately $114. This decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in net income of $197, partially offset by an increase in depreciation and amortization and stock based compensation of $90. Net cash used in investing activities totaled $1,101 in 2009 compared to $1,717 in 2008, a decrease of approximately $616. The decrease in investing activities relates primarily to a $349 decrease in cash used for additions to property and equipment related to warehouse expansion and remodel projects and a prior year reclassification of $371 of cash and cash equivalents to short term investments and other assets on our consolidated balance sheets, explained further below. These activities were partially offset by a decrease in cash provided by the net investment in short term investments of $62 as a result of less cash needed to fund our common stock repurchase activity as well as a decrease in cash proceeds from the sale of property and equipment of $41. In 2008, one of our enhanced money fund investments, Columbia Strategic Cash Portfolio Fund (Columbia), ceased accepting cash redemption requests and changed to a floating net asset value. In light of the restricted liquidity, we elected to receive a pro rata allocation of the underlying securities in a separately managed account. We assessed the fair value of these securities through market quotations and review of current investment ratings, as available, coupled with an evaluation of the liquidation value of each investment and its current performance in meeting scheduled payments of principal and interest. During 2009 and 2008, we recognized $12 and $5, respectively, of other than temporary impairment losses related to these securities. The losses are included in interest income and other in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. At August 30, 2009 and August 31, 2008, the balance of the Columbia fund was $27 and $104, respectively, on the consolidated balance sheets. In 2008, two other enhanced money fund investments, BlackRock Cash Strategies, LLC (BlackRock) and Merrill Lynch Capital Reserve Fund, LLC (Merrill Lynch), ceased accepting redemption requests and commenced liquidation. As of August 31, 2008, the balance of the BlackRock and Merrill Lynch funds was $82 and $43, respectively, on the consolidated balance sheets. During 2009, the remaining balances of these funds were liquidated. During 2008, we reclassified $371 of these three funds from cash and cash equivalents to short term investments and other assets. At August 30, 2009, $24 remained in short term investments and $3 28 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) remained in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets, reflecting the timing of the expected distributions. At August 31, 2008, $161 was in short term investments and $68 in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. The markets relating to these investments remain uncertain, and there may be further declines in the value of these investments that may cause additional losses in future periods. Net cash used in financing activities totaled $439 in 2009 compared to $643 in 2008. The $204 decrease in net cash used in financing activities primarily resulted from a reduction in the cash used to repurchase common stock of $826, partially offset by a decrease in the net proceeds from stock based awards and the excess tax benefit on share based awards of $276, a decrease in the net proceeds from short term borrowings of $195 as well as a decrease in the cash provided by the issuance of long term debt of $103. The effect of exchange rate changes, reflected in the consolidated statement of cash flows, decreased cash by $14 in 2009, compared to a decrease of $7 in 2008. This increase was due primarily to the significant weakening of the Canadian, Korean, and the United Kingdom currencies as compared to the U.S. dollar, during 2009. Dividends In April 2009, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash dividend from $0.16 to $0.18 per share or $0.72 on an annualized basis. Our quarterly cash dividends paid in 2009 totaled $0.68 per share. In 2008, we paid quarterly cash dividends totaling $0.61 per share. Contractual Obligations Our commitments at year end to make future payments under contractual obligations were as follows, as of August 30, 2009: Payments Due by Year Contractual obligations 2010 2011 to2012 2013 to2014 2015 andthereafter Total Purchase obligations (merchandise)(1) $ 3,539 $ 3,539 Long term debt(2) 186 1,120 126 1,432 2,864 Operating leases(3) 145 266 247 1,351 2,009 Purchase obligations (property, equipment, services and other)(4) 151 14 165 Construction Commitments 137 137 Capital lease obligations and other(2) 9 11 11 131 162 Other(5) 17 4 2 24 47 Total $ 4,184 $ 1,415 $ 386 $ 2,938 $ 8,923 (1) Includes open merchandise purchase orders. (2) Includes contractual interest payments. (3) Operating lease obligations exclude amounts commonly referred to as common area maintenance, taxes, and insurance and have been reduced by $163 to reflect sub lease income. (4) The amounts exclude certain services negotiated at the individual warehouse or regional level that are not significant and generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty. 29 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) (5) Consists of $24 in asset retirement obligations, $9 in deferred compensation obligations and includes $14 of current unrecognized tax benefits relating to uncertain tax positions. Amount excludes $16 of noncurrent unrecognized tax benefits due to uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash payments. Expansion Plans Our primary requirement for capital is the financing of land, building, and equipment costs for new and remodeled warehouses. Capital is also required for initial warehouse operations and working capital. While there can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized and plans are subject to change upon further review, it is our current intention to spend approximately $1,300 during fiscal 2010 for real estate, construction, remodeling, and equipment for warehouses and related operations. These expenditures are expected to be financed with a combination of cash provided from operations and existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. We plan to open approximately 16 to 18 new warehouses in 2010, including one to two relocations of existing warehouses to larger and better located facilities. Additional Equity Investments in Subsidiaries and Joint Ventures Our investments in the Costco Mexico joint venture and in other unconsolidated joint ventures that are less than majority owned are accounted for under the equity method. We did not make any capital contributions to our investment in Costco Mexico (a 50% owned joint venture) in 2009, 2008, or 2007. 30 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Bank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs (all amounts stated in millions, in U.S. dollars) Entity Credit FacilityDescription ExpirationDate Total ofall CreditFacilities Credit Line Usage atAugust 30, 2009 AvailableCredit ApplicableInterestRate Stand byLC &Letter ofGuaranty CommercialLetter ofCredit Short TermBorrowing U.S. Uncommitted Stand By Letter of Credit N/A $ 22 $ 22 $ $ $ N/A U.S. Uncommitted Commercial Letter of Credit N/A 50 20 30 N/A Australia(1) Guarantee Line N/A 8 8 N/A Canada(1) Multi Purpose Line March 10 28 18 10 1.76 % Japan(1) Revolving Credit February 10 37 8 29 0.64 % Japan(1) Bank Guaranty March 10 11 11 N/A Japan(1) Revolving Credit February 10 37 8 29 0.70 % Japan(2) Commercial Letter of Credit N/A 1 1 N/A Korea(1) Multi Purpose Line March 10 10 1 9 3.75 % Taiwan Multi Purpose Line January 10 15 4 11 2.50 % Taiwan Multi Purpose Line July 10 15 3 12 2.59 % United Kingdom Revolving Credit February 10 66 66 0.82 % United Kingdom Uncommitted Money Market Line N/A 33 33 3.05 % United Kingdom Uncommitted Overdraft Line N/A 49 49 1.50 % United Kingdom(2) Letter of Guarantee N/A 3 3 N/A United Kingdom Commercial Letter of Credit N/A 3 1 2 N/A TOTAL $ 388 $ 62 $ 21 $ 16 $ 289 (1) The U.S. parent company, Costco Wholesale Corporation, guarantees this entitys credit facility.

Note: We have credit facilities (for commercial and standby letters of credit) totaling $116 and $239 as of August 30, 2009 and August 31, 2008, respectively. The outstanding commitments under these facilities at August 30, 2009 and August 31, 2008, totaled $83 and $116, respectively, including $62 and $69, respectively, in standby letters of credit. For those entities with multi purpose lines, any issuance of either letters of credit (standby and or commercial) or short term borrowings will result in a corresponding decrease in available credit. 32 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Financing Activities In July 2009, we entered into a capital lease for a new warehouse building location and recorded a liability in the amount of $72, representing the net present value of $150 in aggregate future minimum lease payments at an imputed interest rate of 5.4%. This lease expires and becomes subject to a renewal clause in 2040. As of August 30, 2009, $71 is included in long term debt and $1 in the current portion of long term debt in our consolidated balance sheets. We have other minor capital lease obligations that amounted to $5 at the end of 2009 and 2008. In June 2008, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary entered into a ten year term loan in the amount of $32, with a variable rate of interest of Yen TIBOR (6 month) plus a 0.35% margin (0.95% and 1.24% at August 30, 2009 and August 31, 2008, respectively) on the outstanding balance. The net proceeds were used to repay the 1.187% Promissory Notes due in July 2008 and for general corporate purposes. Interest is payable semi annually in December and June and principal is due in June 2018. In October 2007, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes through a private placement in the amount of $69, bearing interest at 2.695%. Interest is payable semi annually, and principal is due in October 2017. The proceeds were used to repay the 2.07% Promissory Notes in October 2007 and for general corporate purposes. In February 2007, we issued $900 of 5.3% Senior Notes due March 15, 2012 at a discount of $2 and $1,100 of 5.5% Senior Notes due March 15, 2017 at a discount of $6 (together, the 2007 Senior Notes). Interest on the 2007 Senior Notes is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The discount and issuance costs associated with the 2007 Senior Notes are being amortized to interest expense over the terms of those notes. At our option, we may redeem the 2007 Senior Notes at any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount of the 2007 Senior Notes to be redeemed, or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, we will be required to make an offer to purchase the 2007 Senior Notes at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase, upon certain events as defined by the terms of the 2007 Senior Notes. In April 2003, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.92% in the amount of $43, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due in April 2010. In November 2002, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.88% in the aggregate amount of $32, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due in November 2009. The U.S. parent company, Costco Wholesale Corporation guarantees all of the promissory notes issued by our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary. In August 1997, we sold $900 principal amount at maturity 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes (Zero Coupon Notes) due in August 2017. The Zero Coupon Notes were priced with a yield to maturity of 3.5%, resulting in gross proceeds of $450. The current Zero Coupon Notes outstanding are convertible into a maximum of 961,000 shares of Costco Common Stock shares at an initial conversion price of $22.71. Holders of the Zero Coupon Notes may require us to purchase the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of purchase) in August 2012. At our option, we may redeem the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of redemption) any time after August 2002. As of August 30, 2009, $858 in principal amount of the Zero Coupon Notes had been converted by note holders to shares of Costco Common Stock, of which $25, $1, and $61 in principal were converted in 2009, 2008, and 2007 respectively, or 33 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) $19 and $42 in 2009 and 2007, respectively, after factoring in the related debt discount. In 2008, the conversion of principle for Zero Coupon Notes after factoring the related debt discount was not significant. Derivatives Effective November 24, 2008, we adopted the disclosure requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities an Amendment of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 133 (SFAS 161). We follow SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (as amended) (SFAS 133), in accounting for derivative and hedging activities. We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in the normal course of our business, which we manage in part through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts, seeking to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on known future expenditures denominated in a foreign currency. The forward foreign exchange contracts are entered into primarily to hedge U.S. dollar merchandise inventory expenditures. Currently, these instruments do not qualify for derivative hedge accounting. We use these instruments to mitigate risk and do not intend to engage in speculative transactions. These contracts do not contain any credit risk related contingent features. We seek to manage the counterparty risk associated with these forward foreign exchange contracts by limiting transactions to counterparties with which we have established banking relationships. There can be no assurance, however, that this effectively mitigates counterparty risk. In addition, the contracts are limited to a time period of less than one year. See Note 1 and Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report, for additional information related to these contracts. We are exposed to risks due to fluctuations in energy prices, particularly electricity and natural gas, which we seek to partially mitigate through the use of fixed price contracts with counterparties for approximately 24% of our warehouses and other facilities in the U.S. and Canada. We also enter into variable priced contracts for some purchases of natural gas and fuel for our gas stations on an index basis. These contracts qualify for treatment as normal purchase or normal sales under SFAS 133 and require no mark to market adjustment. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements With the exception of our operating leases, we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition or consolidated financial statements. Stock Repurchase Programs In September and November of 2007, our Board of Directors approved $300 and $1,000, respectively, of stock repurchases, which expire in August 2010 and November 2010, respectively. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an additional $1,000, which expires in July 2011, bringing total authorizations by our Board of Directors since inception of the program in 2001 to $6,800. During 2009, we repurchased 895,000 shares at an average price of $63.84 per share totaling approximately $57. During 2008, we repurchased 13,812,000 shares of common stock, at an average price of $64.22 per share, totaling approximately $887. The remaining amount available to be purchased under 34 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) our approved plan was $2,002 at the end of 2009. Purchases are made from time to time as conditions warrant in the open market or in block purchases, and pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5 1. Repurchased shares are retired, in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments. We continue to review our accounting policies and evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, investments, merchandise inventory valuation, impairment of long lived assets, warehouse closing costs, insurance/self insurance liabilities, and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. Revenue Recognition We generally recognize sales, net of estimated returns, at the time the member takes possession of merchandise or receives services. When we collect payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services, the amount received is generally recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed. We provide for estimated sales returns based on historical trends in merchandise returns. Amounts collected from members, which under common trade practices are referred to as sales taxes, are recorded on a net basis. We evaluate the criteria of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal Versus Net as an Agent, in determining whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, when we are the primary obligor, subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, influence product or service specifications, or have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded on a gross basis. If we are not the primary obligor and do not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above, we record the net amounts as commissions earned, which is reflected in net sales. Membership fee revenue represents annual membership fees paid by substantially all of our members. We account for membership fee revenue on a deferred basis, whereby revenue is recognized ratably over the one year membership period. Our Executive members qualify for a 2% reward (which can be redeemed only at Costco warehouses), up to a maximum of $500 per year, on all qualified purchases made at Costco. We account for this 2% reward as a reduction in sales, with the related liability being classified within other current liabilities. The sales reduction and corresponding liability are computed after giving effect to the estimated impact of non redemptions based on historical data. Investments Investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other than temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and our intent and ability to hold the investment. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the issuer, including industry and sector performance, 35 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) operational and financing cash flow factors, and rating agency actions. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and or issuer conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments. Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, as determined primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting, and are stated using the last in, first out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all other foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail inventory method of accounting and are stated using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. We believe the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. We record an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the expected annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end. At the end of 2008, due to overall net inflationary trends, merchandise inventories valued at LIFO were lower than the FIFO value, resulting in a $32 charge to merchandise costs. During 2009, due to overall deflationary trends, we recorded a $32 benefit to merchandise costs to adjust inventories valued at LIFO. At the end of 2009 and 2007, merchandise inventories valued at LIFO approximated FIFO after considering the lower of cost or market principle. We provide for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts as a percentage of net sales. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect results of the actual physical inventory counts, which generally occur in the second and fourth quarters of the year. Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as we progress toward earning those rebates, provided they are probable and reasonably estimable. Other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of agreement, or other systematic and rational approaches. Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Warehouse Closing costs We periodically evaluate our long lived assets for indicators of impairment, such as a decision to relocate or close a warehouse location. Our judgments are based on existing market and operational conditions. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring a downward adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value. We provide estimates for warehouse closing costs for both leased and owned locations to be closed or relocated. A considerable amount of judgment is involved in determining any impairment or our net liability, particularly related to the estimated sales price of owned locations and the potential sublease income at leased locations. These estimates are based on real estate conditions in the markets and our experience in those markets. We make assumptions about the average period of time it would take to sublease the location and the amount of potential sublease income for each leased location. We reassess our liability each quarter and adjust our liability accordingly when our estimates change. Insurance/Self Insurance Liabilities We use a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance pool, to provide for potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property damage, director and officers liability, vehicle liability, and 36 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Income Taxes We adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48), which sets out criteria for the use of judgment in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items, at the beginning of 2008. The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Significant judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions. The benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in our consolidated financial statements only after determining a more likely than not probability that the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge, if any, from tax authorities. When facts and circumstances change, we reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the consolidated financial statements as appropriate. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See discussion of Recent Accounting Pronouncements in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report. Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to financial market risk resulting from fluctuations in interest and foreign currency exchange rates. We do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions, nor hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. The current condition of the financial markets, however, has rendered identifiable risks less predictable, and liquidity concerns and credit risks have increased. Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment holdings that are diversified amongst money market funds, debt securities, corporate notes and bonds, and enhanced money funds with effective maturities of generally three months to five years at the date of purchase. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while continuing to generate yields. A revised investment policy was approved in December 2007 by our Board of Directors, limiting future investments to direct U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations, repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations, and U.S. Government and Government Agency Money Market funds. The investment policies of our subsidiaries are consistent with our primary objective to preserve principal while continuing to generate yields. Our wholly owned insurance subsidiary invests in U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations, corporate notes and bonds, and asset and mortgage backed securities with a minimum overall portfolio average credit rating of AA. All of our foreign subsidiaries investments are primarily in money market funds, investment grade securities, bankers acceptances, bank certificates of deposit and term deposits, all denominated in their local currencies. Additionally, our Canadian subsidiary may invest a portion of its investments in U.S. dollar investment grade securities and bank term deposits to meet current U.S. dollar obligations. 37 Table of Contents Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) All of the investment policies of the Company and subsidiaries are reviewed at least annually. Because most of our investments in cash and cash equivalents are of a short term nature, if interest rates were to increase or decrease, the impact would likely be immaterial to our financial statements. Based on our overnight investments and bank balances within cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2009 and 2008, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $24 and $18 (pre tax), respectively, to interest income on an annual basis. For those investments that are classified as available for sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in market volatility and interest rates are reflected within stockholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive income. The nature and amount of our long and short term debt may vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As of the end of 2009, our fixed rate long term debt included: $42 principal amount at maturity of 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes carried at $32; $900 of 5.3% Senior Notes carried at $899; and $1,100 of 5.5% Senior Notes carried at $1,096, and additional notes and capital lease obligations totaling $228. Additionally, our variable rate long term debt included a 0.35% over Yen Tibor (6 month) Term Loan of $32. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt and may affect the interest expense related to the variable rate debt. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report for more information on our long and short term debt. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Our foreign subsidiaries conduct limited transactions in their non functional currencies, which exposes us to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We manage these fluctuations, in part, through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts, seeking to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on known future expenditures denominated in a foreign currency. As of August 30, 2009, and August 31, 2008, we held forward foreign exchange contracts with a notional amount of $183 and $90, respectively, and a fair value liability of $2 and a fair value asset of $5, respectively, on the consolidated balance sheets. A hypothetical 10% strengthening of the functional currency compared to the non functional currency exchange rates at August 30, 2009 and August 31, 2008 would have decreased the fair value of the contracts by $18 and $10, respectively. 
 
Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) We believe disclosing the effects of these items helps provide a meaningful comparison of our current year results to prior years. The impact of each of these items noted above is presented below: 2007 Sales returnreserve Employee taxconsequences onstock options Deferredmembership Excise taxrefund Total Net sales $ (452 ) $ $ $ $ (452 ) Membership fees (56 ) (56 ) Total revenue (452 ) (56 ) (508 ) Merchandise costs 358 9 367 Gross margin(1) (94 ) 9 (85 ) SG&A (47 ) (47 ) Operating income (94 ) (47 ) (56 ) 9 (188 ) Interest expense Interest income and other (1 ) 1 Income before income taxes (95 ) (47 ) (56 ) 10 (188 ) Provision for income taxes 35 17 21 (4 ) 69 Net Income $ (60 ) $ (30 ) $ (35 ) $ 6 $ (119 ) (1) Net sales less merchandise costs.

We believe, however, that due to the nature of our business model, we are better positioned than many retailers to compete in such an environment. Net sales decreased 1.5% during 2009 compared to 2008. The $1,088 decrease was comprised of a $2,590 decrease in comparable sales, partially offset by an increase of $1,502 primarily from sales at new warehouses opened during 2009 and 2008. Our sales were also impacted by a lower number of warehouse openings year over year. 21 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Foreign currencies, particularly in Canada, the United Kingdom, and Korea, weakened against the U.S. dollar, which negatively impacted net sales during 2009 by approximately $2,421 (341 basis points). Net sales were also negatively impacted by gasoline price deflation during 2009 by approximately $2,164 (305 basis points), which resulted from a 30% decline in the average sales price per gallon. Comparable Sales Comparable sales decreased 4% in 2009. Weakening foreign currencies negatively impacted comparable sales by approximately $2,339 (333 basis points) in 2009. Gasoline price deflation negatively impacted comparable sales results by approximately $2,113 (298 basis points) during 2009. Comparable sales were negatively impacted by a decline in the average amount spent (after adjustment for gasoline price deflation and measured in local currencies), partially offset by an increase in shopping frequency. Reported comparable sales growth includes the negative impact of cannibalization (established warehouses losing sales to our newly opened locations). We believe the decline is a function of adverse economic conditions generally rather that a fundamental change in our members relationship to the company. 2008 vs. 2007 Net sales increased 12.5% to $70,977 in 2008, from $63,088 in 2007. Excluding the impact of the change in the estimated sales returns reserve in 2007, net sales, as adjusted, increased $7,437, or 11.7% in 2008 as compared to the previous year. The $7,437 increase in adjusted net sales is comprised of $5,153 from the increase in comparable warehouse sales and $2,284 primarily from sales at new warehouses opened during 2008 and 2007. In the third quarter of 2007, we introduced a 90 day return policy in the United States on certain electronic items. Significantly stronger foreign currencies, particularly in Canada, positively impacted adjusted net sales by approximately $1,134, or 180 basis points. Gasoline sales also contributed to the $7,437 adjusted net sales growth by approximately $2,236, with approximately $1,489 related to the increase in gasoline sales prices. Additionally, we experienced price increases in certain foods and fresh foods items that positively impacted net sales, which were partially offset by price decreases in certain items within our hardlines category. Most of the comparable sales growth was derived from increased amounts spent by members, with a smaller contribution from increases in shopping frequency. Gasoline sales positively impacted comparable warehouse sales growth by approximately $1,938. Comparable warehouse sales growth excluding gasoline would have been lower by approximately 267 basis points. Significantly stronger foreign currencies, particularly in Canada, positively impacted comparable sales by approximately $1,070, or 170 basis points. Reported comparable sales growth includes the negative impact of cannibalization (established warehouses losing sales to our newly opened locations). Membership Fees 2009 2008 2007 Membership fees $ 1,533 $ 1,506 $ 1,313 Adjustment to deferred membership balance 56 Membership fees, as adjusted $ 1,533 $ 1,506 $ 1,369 Membership fees increase 1.8 % 14.7 % 10.5 % Membership fees increase, as adjusted 1.8 % 10.0 % 15.2 % Membership fees as a percent of net sales 2.19 % 2.12 % 2.08 % Adjusted membership fees, as a percent of adjusted net sales 2.19 % 2.12 % 2.16 % Total cardholders 56,000 53,500 50,400 22 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) 2009 vs. 2008 Membership fees increased 1.8% in 2009 compared to 2008, primarily due to membership sign ups at the 15 new warehouses opened in 2009 (19 opened, two closed due to relocations, and two closed Costco Home locations), the continued benefit of membership sign ups at warehouses opened in 2008, and increased penetration of our higher fee Executive Membership program. This increase was negatively impacted by a charge of $27 related to a proposed litigation settlement concerning our membership renewal policy and the weakening of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar, particularly in Canada, the United Kingdom, and Korea, which negatively impacted membership fees during 2009 by approximately $50. Membership fees were also impacted by a lower number of warehouse openings year over year. Our member renewal rate, currently at 87% is consistent with recent years. As previously disclosed, effective with renewals occurring on and after March 1, 2009, we changed an element of our membership renewal policy. Memberships renewed within two months after expiration of the current membership year are extended for twelve months from the expiration date. (Under the previous policy, renewals within six months of the expiration date were extended for twelve months from the expiration date.) Memberships renewed more than two months after such expiration date are extended for twelve months from the renewal date. Although this change will have the effect of deferring recognition of certain membership fees paid by late renewing members, the effect is not expected to be material. 2008 vs. 2007 Membership fees increased 14.7% to $1,506, or 2.12% of net sales in 2008, from $1,313, or 2.08% of net sales in 2007. Excluding the adjustment to deferred membership fees in 2007, adjusted membership fees increased 10.0% from 2007. The increase was primarily due to: new membership sign ups at the 24 new warehouses opened (34 opened and 10 closed due to relocations); increased penetration of the higher fee Executive Membership program; and the five dollar increase in our annual membership fee in the second half of 2006 for non Executive members. Our member renewal rate at the end of 2008 was 87%. Gross Margin 2009 2008 2007 Gross margin $ 7,554 $ 7,474 $ 6,638 Unusual items 85 Gross margin, as adjusted $ 7,554 $ 7,474 $ 6,723 Gross margin increase 1.1 % 12.6 % 6.8 % Gross margin increase, as adjusted 1.1 % 11.2 % 8.1 % Gross margin as a percent of net sales 10.81 % 10.53 % 10.52 % Adjusted gross margin as a percent of adjusted net sales 10.81 % 10.53 % 10.58 % 2009 vs. 2008 Gross margin, as a percent of net sales, increased 28 basis points compared to 2008. This increase was primarily related to a net 18 basis point increase in our core merchandise departments, primarily in food and sundries, partially offset by a decrease in softlines, and a net seven basis point increase from our warehouse ancillary businesses, primarily our gasoline and pharmacy departments. The majority of this gross margin improvement was due to our lower margin gas business having lower sales penetration, due to the decline in the average selling price per gallon. Increased sales penetration of the Executive Membership two percent reward program negatively affected gross margin by six basis 23 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) points. In addition, gross margin was favorably impacted by nine basis points due to reversing the $32 LIFO reserve established in the prior year as we experienced net deflation, year over year, in the cost of our merchandise inventories. Foreign currencies, particularly in Canada, the United Kingdom and Korea, weakened against the U.S. dollar, which negatively impacted gross margin for 2009 by approximately $258. 2008 vs. 2007 Gross margin, as a percent of net sales, increased one basis point compared to 2007. Excluding the unusual items affecting net sales and gross margin in 2007, adjusted gross margin as a percent of adjusted net sales decreased five basis points in 2008 as compared to 2007. This decrease was largely due to a net 12 basis point decrease in our warehouse ancillary businesses, particularly in one hour photo, tire shop and food services, partially offset by an increase in our gasoline business; a $32, or five basis point LIFO charge, resulting from price increases in certain food items and gasoline; and a three basis point decrease resulting from the increased penetration of the Executive Membership two percent reward program and increased spending by Executive members. These decreases were partially offset by a net 15 basis point increase from our merchandise departments, particularly fresh foods, food and sundries, Costco Online and our international operations, partially offset by a decrease in softlines. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 2009 2008 2007 Selling, general and administrative expenses $ 7,252 $ 6,954 $ 6,273 Unusual items (47 ) SG&A, as adjusted $ 7,252 $ 6,954 $ 6,226 SG&A as a percent of net sales 10.38 % 9.80 % 9.94 % Adjusted SG&A as percent of adjusted net sales 10.38 % 9.80 % 9.80 % 2009 vs. 2008 SG&A expenses, as a percent of net sales, increased 58 basis points compared to 2008. Increased warehouse operating and central administrative costs, as a percent of net sales, negatively impacted SG&A by approximately 56 basis points, resulting primarily from lower sales levels and higher employee health care costs. Higher stock based compensation expense had a negative impact of one basis point. In addition, we recorded an adjustment to the net realizable value of the cash surrender value of employee life insurance contracts, which negatively impacted SG&A, as a percent of net sales, by two basis points. The net realizable value of the insurance contracts is largely based on changes in investment assets underlying the policies and is subject to conditions generally affecting equity and debt markets. In 2008, we recorded a $16 reserve in connection with a legal settlement, which positively impacted the comparison to current years SG&A expense, as a percent of net sales, by two basis points. SG&A expenses, as a percent of net sales, for 2009 were adversely impacted by the decrease in the price of gasoline, as it produced a decline in sales dollars without a comparative reduction in labor or other administrative costs. Foreign currencies, particularly in Canada, the United Kingdom, and Korea, weakened against the U.S. dollar, which positively impacted SG&A for 2009 by approximately $217. 24 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) 2008 vs. 2007 SG&A expenses, as a percent of net sales, decreased 14 basis points compared to 2007. Excluding the unusual items affecting net sales and SG&A expenses in 2007, adjusted SG&A as a percentage of adjusted net sales was comparable to 2007. Warehouse operating and central administrative costs positively impacted adjusted SG&A comparisons, on a net basis, by approximately seven basis points, primarily due to decreased payroll and benefits costs as a percent of adjusted net sales. Stock based compensation expense negatively impacted adjusted SG&A comparisons by three basis points, primarily due to a higher closing stock price on the date that our October 2007 RSU grant was valued as compared to previous grants. Additionally, in 2008, we recorded a $16 reserve in connection with a litigation settlement and accrued approximately $9 for compensation adjustments we made to employees enrolled in our medical and dental plans related to a decision to share a portion of the health plans savings that we achieved. These two items negatively impacted adjusted SG&A comparisons by four basis points. Preopening Expenses 2009 2008 2007 Preopening expenses $ 41 $ 57 $ 55 Warehouse openings 19 34 30 Preopening expenses include costs incurred for startup operations related to new warehouses and the expansion of ancillary operations at existing warehouses. Preopening expenses can vary due to the timing of the opening relative to our year end, whether the warehouse is owned or leased, whether the opening is in an existing, new, or international market. The decline in 2009 is primarily attributable to fewer warehouse openings. Provision for Impaired Assets and Closing Costs, Net 2009 2008 2007 Warehouse closing expenses $ 9 $ 9 $ 16 Impairment of long lived assets 8 10 Net gains on the sale of real property (19 ) (2 ) Provision for impaired assets & closing costs, net $ 17 $ $ 14 This provision primarily includes costs related to impairment of long lived assets; future lease obligations of warehouses that have been closed or relocated to new facilities; accelerated depreciation, based on the shortened useful life through the expected closing date, on buildings to be demolished or sold and that are not otherwise impaired; and losses or gains resulting from the sale of real property, largely comprised of former warehouse locations. 2009 vs. 2008 The net provision for impaired assets and closing costs was a $17 in 2009, compared to a nominal amount in 2008. The provision in 2009 included charges of $9 for warehouse closing expenses, and impairment charges of $8, primarily related to the closing of our two Costco Home locations in July 2009. 25 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) 2008 vs. 2007 The net provision for impaired assets and closing costs was a nominal amount in 2008, compared to $14 in 2007. The provision in 2008 included charges of $9 for warehouse closing expenses, and impairment charges of $10, primarily related to a location in Michigan that was demolished and rebuilt. These charges were offset by $19 of net gain on the sale of real property, largely former warehouse locations. At the end of both 2009 and 2008, the reserve for warehouse closing costs was $5 and primarily related to future lease obligations. Interest Expense 2009 2008 2007 Interest expense $ 108 $ 103 $ 64 2009 vs. 2008 Interest expense primarily relates to our $900 of 5.3% and $1,100 of 5.5% Senior Notes (2007 Senior Notes) issued in 2007. The increase in interest expense is primarily due to a decrease in capitalized interest related to reduced new warehouse and remodel construction activity year over year. 2008 vs. 2007 The increase in interest expense resulted primarily from the issuance of our 2007 Senior Notes in February 2007, partially offset by lower interest expense resulting from the repayment in March 2007 of the $300 5.5% Senior Notes. Interest Income and Other 2009 2008 2007 Interest income $ 27 $ 96 $ 128 Earnings of affiliates 33 42 36 Minority interest and other (15 ) (5 ) 1 Interest Income and other $ 45 $ 133 $ 165 2009 vs. 2008 The decrease in interest income was largely due to lower interest rates, year over year, on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances resulting from a change in policy to invest primarily in U.S. government and agency securities, which earn a lower interest rate. In addition, we recognized $12 of other than temporary impairment losses on certain securities within our investment portfolio in 2009 compared to an impairment loss of $5 in 2008. See further discussion in Liquidity and Capital Resources. The decrease in the earnings of affiliates is primarily attributable to our investment in Costco Mexico (a 50% owned joint venture). Costco Mexicos earnings were lower in 2009, primarily due to the peso weakening against the U.S. dollar. The decrease in minority interest and other is primarily due to a negative $5 mark to market charge in 2009, compared to a $6 gain in 2008, related to our forward foreign exchange contracts. See the Derivatives section for more information. 26 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) 2008 vs. 2007 The decrease in interest income was largely due to lower interest rates, year over year, on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances. In addition, we recognized $5 of other than temporary impairment losses on certain securities within our investment portfolio. The increase in the earnings of affiliates is primarily attributable to our investment in Costco Mexico (a 50% owned joint venture). Provision for Income Taxes 2009 2008 2007 Income tax expense $ 628 $ 716 $ 627 Effective tax rate 36.7 % 35.8 % 36.7 % The lower tax rate in 2008 was primarily attributable to discrete benefits recognized during the year. Net Income 2009 2008 2007 Net income $ 1,086 $ 1,283 $ 1,083 Unusual items (net of tax) 119 Net income, as adjusted $ 1,086 $ 1,283 $ 1,202 Diluted earnings per share $ 2.47 $ 2.89 $ 2.37 Shares used to calculate diluted net income per common share (000s) 440,454 444,240 457,641 Diluted earnings per share (decrease) / increase (15 )% 22 % 3 % 2009 vs. 2008 Net income for 2009 decreased to $1,086, or $2.47 per diluted share, from $1,283, or $2.89 per diluted share, during 2008, representing a 15% decrease in diluted net income per share. As previously discussed, foreign currencies, particularly in Canada, the United Kingdom and Korea, weakened against the U.S. dollar, which negatively impacted net income for 2009 by approximately $83 after tax, or $0.19 per diluted share. Additionally, net income for 2009 was negatively impacted by a $34 pre tax charge, or approximately $0.05 per diluted share, related to a proposed litigation settlement concerning our membership renewal policy, as well as a $23 pre tax charge, or approximately $0.03 per diluted share, for an adjustment to the net realizable value of the cash surrender value of employee life insurance contracts. Net income for 2009 was positively impacted by a $32 pre tax, or $0.05 per diluted share, benefit due to the reversal of the LIFO reserve established in 2008. 2008 vs. 2007 Net income for 2008 increased to $1,283, or $2.89 per diluted share, from $1,083, or $2.37 per diluted share, during 2007. The unusual items previously discussed totaled $119, net of tax, or $0.26 per diluted share in 2007. Exclusive of these items, earnings in 2007 were $2.63 per diluted share. Net income per diluted share in 2008 represents an increase of 10% over this adjusted amount. During 2008, we repurchased and retired 13,812,000 shares of common stock, favorably impacting earnings per diluted share by approximately $0.03. 27 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The following table itemizes components of our most liquid assets at the end of 2009 and 2008 (dollars in millions, except per share data): 2009 2008 Cash and cash equivalents $ 3,157 $ 2,619 Short term investments 570 656 Total $ 3,727 $ 3,275 Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from warehouse operations and existing cash, cash equivalents, and short term investment balances, which were $3,727 and $3,275 at the end of 2009 and 2008, respectively. Of these balances, approximately $758 and $788 at the end of 2009 and 2008, respectively, represented debit and credit card receivables, primarily related to sales in the week prior to the end of the fiscal year. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $2,092 in 2009 compared to $2,206 in 2008, a decrease of approximately $114. This decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in net income of $197, partially offset by an increase in depreciation and amortization and stock based compensation of $90. Net cash used in investing activities totaled $1,101 in 2009 compared to $1,717 in 2008, a decrease of approximately $616. The decrease in investing activities relates primarily to a $349 decrease in cash used for additions to property and equipment related to warehouse expansion and remodel projects and a prior year reclassification of $371 of cash and cash equivalents to short term investments and other assets on our consolidated balance sheets, explained further below. These activities were partially offset by a decrease in cash provided by the net investment in short term investments of $62 as a result of less cash needed to fund our common stock repurchase activity as well as a decrease in cash proceeds from the sale of property and equipment of $41. In 2008, one of our enhanced money fund investments, Columbia Strategic Cash Portfolio Fund (Columbia), ceased accepting cash redemption requests and changed to a floating net asset value. In light of the restricted liquidity, we elected to receive a pro rata allocation of the underlying securities in a separately managed account. We assessed the fair value of these securities through market quotations and review of current investment ratings, as available, coupled with an evaluation of the liquidation value of each investment and its current performance in meeting scheduled payments of principal and interest. During 2009 and 2008, we recognized $12 and $5, respectively, of other than temporary impairment losses related to these securities. The losses are included in interest income and other in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. At August 30, 2009 and August 31, 2008, the balance of the Columbia fund was $27 and $104, respectively, on the consolidated balance sheets. In 2008, two other enhanced money fund investments, BlackRock Cash Strategies, LLC (BlackRock) and Merrill Lynch Capital Reserve Fund, LLC (Merrill Lynch), ceased accepting redemption requests and commenced liquidation. As of August 31, 2008, the balance of the BlackRock and Merrill Lynch funds was $82 and $43, respectively, on the consolidated balance sheets. During 2009, the remaining balances of these funds were liquidated. During 2008, we reclassified $371 of these three funds from cash and cash equivalents to short term investments and other assets. At August 30, 2009, $24 remained in short term investments and $3 28 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) remained in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets, reflecting the timing of the expected distributions. At August 31, 2008, $161 was in short term investments and $68 in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. The markets relating to these investments remain uncertain, and there may be further declines in the value of these investments that may cause additional losses in future periods. Net cash used in financing activities totaled $439 in 2009 compared to $643 in 2008. The $204 decrease in net cash used in financing activities primarily resulted from a reduction in the cash used to repurchase common stock of $826, partially offset by a decrease in the net proceeds from stock based awards and the excess tax benefit on share based awards of $276, a decrease in the net proceeds from short term borrowings of $195 as well as a decrease in the cash provided by the issuance of long term debt of $103. The effect of exchange rate changes, reflected in the consolidated statement of cash flows, decreased cash by $14 in 2009, compared to a decrease of $7 in 2008. This increase was due primarily to the significant weakening of the Canadian, Korean, and the United Kingdom currencies as compared to the U.S. dollar, during 2009. Dividends In April 2009, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash dividend from $0.16 to $0.18 per share or $0.72 on an annualized basis. Our quarterly cash dividends paid in 2009 totaled $0.68 per share. In 2008, we paid quarterly cash dividends totaling $0.61 per share. Contractual Obligations Our commitments at year end to make future payments under contractual obligations were as follows, as of August 30, 2009: Payments Due by Year Contractual obligations 2010 2011 to2012 2013 to2014 2015 andthereafter Total Purchase obligations (merchandise)(1) $ 3,539 $ 3,539 Long term debt(2) 186 1,120 126 1,432 2,864 Operating leases(3) 145 266 247 1,351 2,009 Purchase obligations (property, equipment, services and other)(4) 151 14 165 Construction Commitments 137 137 Capital lease obligations and other(2) 9 11 11 131 162 Other(5) 17 4 2 24 47 Total $ 4,184 $ 1,415 $ 386 $ 2,938 $ 8,923 (1) Includes open merchandise purchase orders. (2) Includes contractual interest payments. (3) Operating lease obligations exclude amounts commonly referred to as common area maintenance, taxes, and insurance and have been reduced by $163 to reflect sub lease income. (4) The amounts exclude certain services negotiated at the individual warehouse or regional level that are not significant and generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty. 29 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) (5) Consists of $24 in asset retirement obligations, $9 in deferred compensation obligations and includes $14 of current unrecognized tax benefits relating to uncertain tax positions. Amount excludes $16 of noncurrent unrecognized tax benefits due to uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash payments. Expansion Plans Our primary requirement for capital is the financing of land, building, and equipment costs for new and remodeled warehouses. Capital is also required for initial warehouse operations and working capital. While there can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized and plans are subject to change upon further review, it is our current intention to spend approximately $1,300 during fiscal 2010 for real estate, construction, remodeling, and equipment for warehouses and related operations. These expenditures are expected to be financed with a combination of cash provided from operations and existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. We plan to open approximately 16 to 18 new warehouses in 2010, including one to two relocations of existing warehouses to larger and better located facilities. Additional Equity Investments in Subsidiaries and Joint Ventures Our investments in the Costco Mexico joint venture and in other unconsolidated joint ventures that are less than majority owned are accounted for under the equity method. We did not make any capital contributions to our investment in Costco Mexico (a 50% owned joint venture) in 2009, 2008, or 2007. 30 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Bank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs (all amounts stated in millions, in U.S. dollars) Entity Credit FacilityDescription ExpirationDate Total ofall CreditFacilities Credit Line Usage atAugust 30, 2009 AvailableCredit ApplicableInterestRate Stand byLC &Letter ofGuaranty CommercialLetter ofCredit Short TermBorrowing U.S. Uncommitted Stand By Letter of Credit N/A $ 22 $ 22 $ $ $ N/A U.S. Uncommitted Commercial Letter of Credit N/A 50 20 30 N/A Australia(1) Guarantee Line N/A 8 8 N/A Canada(1) Multi Purpose Line March 10 28 18 10 1.76 % Japan(1) Revolving Credit February 10 37 8 29 0.64 % Japan(1) Bank Guaranty March 10 11 11 N/A Japan(1) Revolving Credit February 10 37 8 29 0.70 % Japan(2) Commercial Letter of Credit N/A 1 1 N/A Korea(1) Multi Purpose Line March 10 10 1 9 3.75 % Taiwan Multi Purpose Line January 10 15 4 11 2.50 % Taiwan Multi Purpose Line July 10 15 3 12 2.59 % United Kingdom Revolving Credit February 10 66 66 0.82 % United Kingdom Uncommitted Money Market Line N/A 33 33 3.05 % United Kingdom Uncommitted Overdraft Line N/A 49 49 1.50 % United Kingdom(2) Letter of Guarantee N/A 3 3 N/A United Kingdom Commercial Letter of Credit N/A 3 1 2 N/A TOTAL $ 388 $ 62 $ 21 $ 16 $ 289 (1) The U.S. parent company, Costco Wholesale Corporation, guarantees this entitys credit facility.

(3) The amount shown for short term borrowings under this facility is net of a note issue discount, which is excluded from the available credit amount. Note: We have credit facilities (for commercial and standby letters of credit) totaling $116 and $239 as of August 30, 2009 and August 31, 2008, respectively. The outstanding commitments under these facilities at August 30, 2009 and August 31, 2008, totaled $83 and $116, respectively, including $62 and $69, respectively, in standby letters of credit. For those entities with multi purpose lines, any issuance of either letters of credit (standby and or commercial) or short term borrowings will result in a corresponding decrease in available credit. 32 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Financing Activities In July 2009, we entered into a capital lease for a new warehouse building location and recorded a liability in the amount of $72, representing the net present value of $150 in aggregate future minimum lease payments at an imputed interest rate of 5.4%. This lease expires and becomes subject to a renewal clause in 2040. As of August 30, 2009, $71 is included in long term debt and $1 in the current portion of long term debt in our consolidated balance sheets. We have other minor capital lease obligations that amounted to $5 at the end of 2009 and 2008. In June 2008, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary entered into a ten year term loan in the amount of $32, with a variable rate of interest of Yen TIBOR (6 month) plus a 0.35% margin (0.95% and 1.24% at August 30, 2009 and August 31, 2008, respectively) on the outstanding balance. The net proceeds were used to repay the 1.187% Promissory Notes due in July 2008 and for general corporate purposes. Interest is payable semi annually in December and June and principal is due in June 2018. In October 2007, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes through a private placement in the amount of $69, bearing interest at 2.695%. Interest is payable semi annually, and principal is due in October 2017. The proceeds were used to repay the 2.07% Promissory Notes in October 2007 and for general corporate purposes. In February 2007, we issued $900 of 5.3% Senior Notes due March 15, 2012 at a discount of $2 and $1,100 of 5.5% Senior Notes due March 15, 2017 at a discount of $6 (together, the 2007 Senior Notes). Interest on the 2007 Senior Notes is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The discount and issuance costs associated with the 2007 Senior Notes are being amortized to interest expense over the terms of those notes. At our option, we may redeem the 2007 Senior Notes at any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount of the 2007 Senior Notes to be redeemed, or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, we will be required to make an offer to purchase the 2007 Senior Notes at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase, upon certain events as defined by the terms of the 2007 Senior Notes. In April 2003, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.92% in the amount of $43, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due in April 2010. In November 2002, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.88% in the aggregate amount of $32, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due in November 2009. The U.S. parent company, Costco Wholesale Corporation guarantees all of the promissory notes issued by our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary. In August 1997, we sold $900 principal amount at maturity 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes (Zero Coupon Notes) due in August 2017. The Zero Coupon Notes were priced with a yield to maturity of 3.5%, resulting in gross proceeds of $450. The current Zero Coupon Notes outstanding are convertible into a maximum of 961,000 shares of Costco Common Stock shares at an initial conversion price of $22.71. Holders of the Zero Coupon Notes may require us to purchase the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of purchase) in August 2012. At our option, we may redeem the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of redemption) any time after August 2002. As of August 30, 2009, $858 in principal amount of the Zero Coupon Notes had been converted by note holders to shares of Costco Common Stock, of which $25, $1, and $61 in principal were converted in 2009, 2008, and 2007 respectively, or 33 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) $19 and $42 in 2009 and 2007, respectively, after factoring in the related debt discount. In 2008, the conversion of principle for Zero Coupon Notes after factoring the related debt discount was not significant. Derivatives Effective November 24, 2008, we adopted the disclosure requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities an Amendment of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 133 (SFAS 161). We follow SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (as amended) (SFAS 133), in accounting for derivative and hedging activities. We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in the normal course of our business, which we manage in part through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts, seeking to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on known future expenditures denominated in a foreign currency. The forward foreign exchange contracts are entered into primarily to hedge U.S. dollar merchandise inventory expenditures. Currently, these instruments do not qualify for derivative hedge accounting. We use these instruments to mitigate risk and do not intend to engage in speculative transactions. These contracts do not contain any credit risk related contingent features. We seek to manage the counterparty risk associated with these forward foreign exchange contracts by limiting transactions to counterparties with which we have established banking relationships. There can be no assurance, however, that this effectively mitigates counterparty risk. In addition, the contracts are limited to a time period of less than one year. See Note 1 and Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report, for additional information related to these contracts. We are exposed to risks due to fluctuations in energy prices, particularly electricity and natural gas, which we seek to partially mitigate through the use of fixed price contracts with counterparties for approximately 24% of our warehouses and other facilities in the U.S. and Canada. We also enter into variable priced contracts for some purchases of natural gas and fuel for our gas stations on an index basis. These contracts qualify for treatment as normal purchase or normal sales under SFAS 133 and require no mark to market adjustment. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements With the exception of our operating leases, we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition or consolidated financial statements. Stock Repurchase Programs In September and November of 2007, our Board of Directors approved $300 and $1,000, respectively, of stock repurchases, which expire in August 2010 and November 2010, respectively. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an additional $1,000, which expires in July 2011, bringing total authorizations by our Board of Directors since inception of the program in 2001 to $6,800. During 2009, we repurchased 895,000 shares at an average price of $63.84 per share totaling approximately $57. During 2008, we repurchased 13,812,000 shares of common stock, at an average price of $64.22 per share, totaling approximately $887. The remaining amount available to be purchased under 34 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) our approved plan was $2,002 at the end of 2009. Purchases are made from time to time as conditions warrant in the open market or in block purchases, and pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5 1. Repurchased shares are retired, in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments. We continue to review our accounting policies and evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, investments, merchandise inventory valuation, impairment of long lived assets, warehouse closing costs, insurance/self insurance liabilities, and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. Revenue Recognition We generally recognize sales, net of estimated returns, at the time the member takes possession of merchandise or receives services. When we collect payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services, the amount received is generally recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed. We provide for estimated sales returns based on historical trends in merchandise returns. Amounts collected from members, which under common trade practices are referred to as sales taxes, are recorded on a net basis. We evaluate the criteria of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal Versus Net as an Agent, in determining whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, when we are the primary obligor, subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, influence product or service specifications, or have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded on a gross basis. If we are not the primary obligor and do not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above, we record the net amounts as commissions earned, which is reflected in net sales. Membership fee revenue represents annual membership fees paid by substantially all of our members. We account for membership fee revenue on a deferred basis, whereby revenue is recognized ratably over the one year membership period. Our Executive members qualify for a 2% reward (which can be redeemed only at Costco warehouses), up to a maximum of $500 per year, on all qualified purchases made at Costco. We account for this 2% reward as a reduction in sales, with the related liability being classified within other current liabilities. The sales reduction and corresponding liability are computed after giving effect to the estimated impact of non redemptions based on historical data. Investments Investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other than temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and our intent and ability to hold the investment. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the issuer, including industry and sector performance, 35 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) operational and financing cash flow factors, and rating agency actions. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and or issuer conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments. Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, as determined primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting, and are stated using the last in, first out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all other foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail inventory method of accounting and are stated using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. We believe the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. We record an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the expected annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end. At the end of 2008, due to overall net inflationary trends, merchandise inventories valued at LIFO were lower than the FIFO value, resulting in a $32 charge to merchandise costs. During 2009, due to overall deflationary trends, we recorded a $32 benefit to merchandise costs to adjust inventories valued at LIFO. At the end of 2009 and 2007, merchandise inventories valued at LIFO approximated FIFO after considering the lower of cost or market principle. We provide for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts as a percentage of net sales. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect results of the actual physical inventory counts, which generally occur in the second and fourth quarters of the year. Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as we progress toward earning those rebates, provided they are probable and reasonably estimable. Other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of agreement, or other systematic and rational approaches. Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Warehouse Closing costs We periodically evaluate our long lived assets for indicators of impairment, such as a decision to relocate or close a warehouse location. Our judgments are based on existing market and operational conditions. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring a downward adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value. We provide estimates for warehouse closing costs for both leased and owned locations to be closed or relocated. A considerable amount of judgment is involved in determining any impairment or our net liability, particularly related to the estimated sales price of owned locations and the potential sublease income at leased locations. These estimates are based on real estate conditions in the markets and our experience in those markets. We make assumptions about the average period of time it would take to sublease the location and the amount of potential sublease income for each leased location. We reassess our liability each quarter and adjust our liability accordingly when our estimates change. Insurance/Self Insurance Liabilities We use a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance pool, to provide for potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property damage, director and officers liability, vehicle liability, and 36 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Income Taxes We adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48), which sets out criteria for the use of judgment in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items, at the beginning of 2008. The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Significant judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions. The benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in our consolidated financial statements only after determining a more likely than not probability that the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge, if any, from tax authorities. When facts and circumstances change, we reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the consolidated financial statements as appropriate. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See discussion of Recent Accounting Pronouncements in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report. Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to financial market risk resulting from fluctuations in interest and foreign currency exchange rates. We do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions, nor hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. The current condition of the financial markets, however, has rendered identifiable risks less predictable, and liquidity concerns and credit risks have increased. Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment holdings that are diversified amongst money market funds, debt securities, corporate notes and bonds, and enhanced money funds with effective maturities of generally three months to five years at the date of purchase. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while continuing to generate yields. A revised investment policy was approved in December 2007 by our Board of Directors, limiting future investments to direct U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations, repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations, and U.S. Government and Government Agency Money Market funds. The investment policies of our subsidiaries are consistent with our primary objective to preserve principal while continuing to generate yields. Our wholly owned insurance subsidiary invests in U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations, corporate notes and bonds, and asset and mortgage backed securities with a minimum overall portfolio average credit rating of AA. All of our foreign subsidiaries investments are primarily in money market funds, investment grade securities, bankers acceptances, bank certificates of deposit and term deposits, all denominated in their local currencies. Additionally, our Canadian subsidiary may invest a portion of its investments in U.S. dollar investment grade securities and bank term deposits to meet current U.S. dollar obligations. 37 Table of Contents Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) All of the investment policies of the Company and subsidiaries are reviewed at least annually. Because most of our investments in cash and cash equivalents are of a short term nature, if interest rates were to increase or decrease, the impact would likely be immaterial to our financial statements. Based on our overnight investments and bank balances within cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2009 and 2008, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $24 and $18 (pre tax), respectively, to interest income on an annual basis. For those investments that are classified as available for sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in market volatility and interest rates are reflected within stockholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive income. The nature and amount of our long and short term debt may vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As of the end of 2009, our fixed rate long term debt included: $42 principal amount at maturity of 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes carried at $32; $900 of 5.3% Senior Notes carried at $899; and $1,100 of 5.5% Senior Notes carried at $1,096, and additional notes and capital lease obligations totaling $228. Additionally, our variable rate long term debt included a 0.35% over Yen Tibor (6 month) Term Loan of $32. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt and may affect the interest expense related to the variable rate debt. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report for more information on our long and short term debt. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Our foreign subsidiaries conduct limited transactions in their non functional currencies, which exposes us to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We manage these fluctuations, in part, through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts, seeking to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on known future expenditures denominated in a foreign currency. As of August 30, 2009, and August 31, 2008, we held forward foreign exchange contracts with a notional amount of $183 and $90, respectively, and a fair value liability of $2 and a fair value asset of $5, respectively, on the consolidated balance sheets. A hypothetical 10% strengthening of the functional currency compared to the non functional currency exchange rates at August 30, 2009 and August 31, 2008 would have decreased the fair value of the contracts by $18 and $10, respectively. 
 
Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Foreign currencies, particularly in Canada, the United Kingdom, and Korea, weakened against the U.S. dollar, which negatively impacted net sales during 2009 by approximately $2,421 (341 basis points). Net sales were also negatively impacted by gasoline price deflation during 2009 by approximately $2,164 (305 basis points), which resulted from a 30% decline in the average sales price per gallon. Comparable Sales Comparable sales decreased 4% in 2009. Weakening foreign currencies negatively impacted comparable sales by approximately $2,339 (333 basis points) in 2009. Gasoline price deflation negatively impacted comparable sales results by approximately $2,113 (298 basis points) during 2009. Comparable sales were negatively impacted by a decline in the average amount spent (after adjustment for gasoline price deflation and measured in local currencies), partially offset by an increase in shopping frequency. Reported comparable sales growth includes the negative impact of cannibalization (established warehouses losing sales to our newly opened locations). We believe the decline is a function of adverse economic conditions generally rather that a fundamental change in our members relationship to the company. 2008 vs. 2007 Net sales increased 12.5% to $70,977 in 2008, from $63,088 in 2007. Excluding the impact of the change in the estimated sales returns reserve in 2007, net sales, as adjusted, increased $7,437, or 11.7% in 2008 as compared to the previous year. The $7,437 increase in adjusted net sales is comprised of $5,153 from the increase in comparable warehouse sales and $2,284 primarily from sales at new warehouses opened during 2008 and 2007. In the third quarter of 2007, we introduced a 90 day return policy in the United States on certain electronic items. Significantly stronger foreign currencies, particularly in Canada, positively impacted adjusted net sales by approximately $1,134, or 180 basis points. Gasoline sales also contributed to the $7,437 adjusted net sales growth by approximately $2,236, with approximately $1,489 related to the increase in gasoline sales prices. Additionally, we experienced price increases in certain foods and fresh foods items that positively impacted net sales, which were partially offset by price decreases in certain items within our hardlines category. Most of the comparable sales growth was derived from increased amounts spent by members, with a smaller contribution from increases in shopping frequency. Gasoline sales positively impacted comparable warehouse sales growth by approximately $1,938. Comparable warehouse sales growth excluding gasoline would have been lower by approximately 267 basis points. Significantly stronger foreign currencies, particularly in Canada, positively impacted comparable sales by approximately $1,070, or 170 basis points. Reported comparable sales growth includes the negative impact of cannibalization (established warehouses losing sales to our newly opened locations). Membership Fees 2009 2008 2007 Membership fees $ 1,533 $ 1,506 $ 1,313 Adjustment to deferred membership balance 56 Membership fees, as adjusted $ 1,533 $ 1,506 $ 1,369 Membership fees increase 1.8 % 14.7 % 10.5 % Membership fees increase, as adjusted 1.8 % 10.0 % 15.2 % Membership fees as a percent of net sales 2.19 % 2.12 % 2.08 % Adjusted membership fees, as a percent of adjusted net sales 2.19 % 2.12 % 2.16 % Total cardholders 56,000 53,500 50,400 22 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) 2009 vs. 2008 Membership fees increased 1.8% in 2009 compared to 2008, primarily due to membership sign ups at the 15 new warehouses opened in 2009 (19 opened, two closed due to relocations, and two closed Costco Home locations), the continued benefit of membership sign ups at warehouses opened in 2008, and increased penetration of our higher fee Executive Membership program. This increase was negatively impacted by a charge of $27 related to a proposed litigation settlement concerning our membership renewal policy and the weakening of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar, particularly in Canada, the United Kingdom, and Korea, which negatively impacted membership fees during 2009 by approximately $50. Membership fees were also impacted by a lower number of warehouse openings year over year. Our member renewal rate, currently at 87% is consistent with recent years. As previously disclosed, effective with renewals occurring on and after March 1, 2009, we changed an element of our membership renewal policy. Memberships renewed within two months after expiration of the current membership year are extended for twelve months from the expiration date. (Under the previous policy, renewals within six months of the expiration date were extended for twelve months from the expiration date.) Memberships renewed more than two months after such expiration date are extended for twelve months from the renewal date. Although this change will have the effect of deferring recognition of certain membership fees paid by late renewing members, the effect is not expected to be material. 2008 vs. 2007 Membership fees increased 14.7% to $1,506, or 2.12% of net sales in 2008, from $1,313, or 2.08% of net sales in 2007. Excluding the adjustment to deferred membership fees in 2007, adjusted membership fees increased 10.0% from 2007. The increase was primarily due to: new membership sign ups at the 24 new warehouses opened (34 opened and 10 closed due to relocations); increased penetration of the higher fee Executive Membership program; and the five dollar increase in our annual membership fee in the second half of 2006 for non Executive members. Our member renewal rate at the end of 2008 was 87%. Gross Margin 2009 2008 2007 Gross margin $ 7,554 $ 7,474 $ 6,638 Unusual items 85 Gross margin, as adjusted $ 7,554 $ 7,474 $ 6,723 Gross margin increase 1.1 % 12.6 % 6.8 % Gross margin increase, as adjusted 1.1 % 11.2 % 8.1 % Gross margin as a percent of net sales 10.81 % 10.53 % 10.52 % Adjusted gross margin as a percent of adjusted net sales 10.81 % 10.53 % 10.58 % 2009 vs. 2008 Gross margin, as a percent of net sales, increased 28 basis points compared to 2008. This increase was primarily related to a net 18 basis point increase in our core merchandise departments, primarily in food and sundries, partially offset by a decrease in softlines, and a net seven basis point increase from our warehouse ancillary businesses, primarily our gasoline and pharmacy departments. The majority of this gross margin improvement was due to our lower margin gas business having lower sales penetration, due to the decline in the average selling price per gallon. Increased sales penetration of the Executive Membership two percent reward program negatively affected gross margin by six basis 23 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) points. In addition, gross margin was favorably impacted by nine basis points due to reversing the $32 LIFO reserve established in the prior year as we experienced net deflation, year over year, in the cost of our merchandise inventories. Foreign currencies, particularly in Canada, the United Kingdom and Korea, weakened against the U.S. dollar, which negatively impacted gross margin for 2009 by approximately $258. 2008 vs. 2007 Gross margin, as a percent of net sales, increased one basis point compared to 2007. Excluding the unusual items affecting net sales and gross margin in 2007, adjusted gross margin as a percent of adjusted net sales decreased five basis points in 2008 as compared to 2007. This decrease was largely due to a net 12 basis point decrease in our warehouse ancillary businesses, particularly in one hour photo, tire shop and food services, partially offset by an increase in our gasoline business; a $32, or five basis point LIFO charge, resulting from price increases in certain food items and gasoline; and a three basis point decrease resulting from the increased penetration of the Executive Membership two percent reward program and increased spending by Executive members. These decreases were partially offset by a net 15 basis point increase from our merchandise departments, particularly fresh foods, food and sundries, Costco Online and our international operations, partially offset by a decrease in softlines. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 2009 2008 2007 Selling, general and administrative expenses $ 7,252 $ 6,954 $ 6,273 Unusual items (47 ) SG&A, as adjusted $ 7,252 $ 6,954 $ 6,226 SG&A as a percent of net sales 10.38 % 9.80 % 9.94 % Adjusted SG&A as percent of adjusted net sales 10.38 % 9.80 % 9.80 % 2009 vs. 2008 SG&A expenses, as a percent of net sales, increased 58 basis points compared to 2008. Increased warehouse operating and central administrative costs, as a percent of net sales, negatively impacted SG&A by approximately 56 basis points, resulting primarily from lower sales levels and higher employee health care costs. Higher stock based compensation expense had a negative impact of one basis point. In addition, we recorded an adjustment to the net realizable value of the cash surrender value of employee life insurance contracts, which negatively impacted SG&A, as a percent of net sales, by two basis points. The net realizable value of the insurance contracts is largely based on changes in investment assets underlying the policies and is subject to conditions generally affecting equity and debt markets. In 2008, we recorded a $16 reserve in connection with a legal settlement, which positively impacted the comparison to current years SG&A expense, as a percent of net sales, by two basis points. SG&A expenses, as a percent of net sales, for 2009 were adversely impacted by the decrease in the price of gasoline, as it produced a decline in sales dollars without a comparative reduction in labor or other administrative costs. Foreign currencies, particularly in Canada, the United Kingdom, and Korea, weakened against the U.S. dollar, which positively impacted SG&A for 2009 by approximately $217. 24 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) 2008 vs. 2007 SG&A expenses, as a percent of net sales, decreased 14 basis points compared to 2007. Excluding the unusual items affecting net sales and SG&A expenses in 2007, adjusted SG&A as a percentage of adjusted net sales was comparable to 2007. Warehouse operating and central administrative costs positively impacted adjusted SG&A comparisons, on a net basis, by approximately seven basis points, primarily due to decreased payroll and benefits costs as a percent of adjusted net sales. Stock based compensation expense negatively impacted adjusted SG&A comparisons by three basis points, primarily due to a higher closing stock price on the date that our October 2007 RSU grant was valued as compared to previous grants. Additionally, in 2008, we recorded a $16 reserve in connection with a litigation settlement and accrued approximately $9 for compensation adjustments we made to employees enrolled in our medical and dental plans related to a decision to share a portion of the health plans savings that we achieved. These two items negatively impacted adjusted SG&A comparisons by four basis points. Preopening Expenses 2009 2008 2007 Preopening expenses $ 41 $ 57 $ 55 Warehouse openings 19 34 30 Preopening expenses include costs incurred for startup operations related to new warehouses and the expansion of ancillary operations at existing warehouses. Preopening expenses can vary due to the timing of the opening relative to our year end, whether the warehouse is owned or leased, whether the opening is in an existing, new, or international market. The decline in 2009 is primarily attributable to fewer warehouse openings. Provision for Impaired Assets and Closing Costs, Net 2009 2008 2007 Warehouse closing expenses $ 9 $ 9 $ 16 Impairment of long lived assets 8 10 Net gains on the sale of real property (19 ) (2 ) Provision for impaired assets & closing costs, net $ 17 $ $ 14 This provision primarily includes costs related to impairment of long lived assets; future lease obligations of warehouses that have been closed or relocated to new facilities; accelerated depreciation, based on the shortened useful life through the expected closing date, on buildings to be demolished or sold and that are not otherwise impaired; and losses or gains resulting from the sale of real property, largely comprised of former warehouse locations. 2009 vs. 2008 The net provision for impaired assets and closing costs was a $17 in 2009, compared to a nominal amount in 2008. The provision in 2009 included charges of $9 for warehouse closing expenses, and impairment charges of $8, primarily related to the closing of our two Costco Home locations in July 2009. 25 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) 2008 vs. 2007 The net provision for impaired assets and closing costs was a nominal amount in 2008, compared to $14 in 2007. The provision in 2008 included charges of $9 for warehouse closing expenses, and impairment charges of $10, primarily related to a location in Michigan that was demolished and rebuilt. These charges were offset by $19 of net gain on the sale of real property, largely former warehouse locations. At the end of both 2009 and 2008, the reserve for warehouse closing costs was $5 and primarily related to future lease obligations. Interest Expense 2009 2008 2007 Interest expense $ 108 $ 103 $ 64 2009 vs. 2008 Interest expense primarily relates to our $900 of 5.3% and $1,100 of 5.5% Senior Notes (2007 Senior Notes) issued in 2007. The increase in interest expense is primarily due to a decrease in capitalized interest related to reduced new warehouse and remodel construction activity year over year. 2008 vs. 2007 The increase in interest expense resulted primarily from the issuance of our 2007 Senior Notes in February 2007, partially offset by lower interest expense resulting from the repayment in March 2007 of the $300 5.5% Senior Notes. Interest Income and Other 2009 2008 2007 Interest income $ 27 $ 96 $ 128 Earnings of affiliates 33 42 36 Minority interest and other (15 ) (5 ) 1 Interest Income and other $ 45 $ 133 $ 165 2009 vs. 2008 The decrease in interest income was largely due to lower interest rates, year over year, on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances resulting from a change in policy to invest primarily in U.S. government and agency securities, which earn a lower interest rate. In addition, we recognized $12 of other than temporary impairment losses on certain securities within our investment portfolio in 2009 compared to an impairment loss of $5 in 2008. See further discussion in Liquidity and Capital Resources. The decrease in the earnings of affiliates is primarily attributable to our investment in Costco Mexico (a 50% owned joint venture). Costco Mexicos earnings were lower in 2009, primarily due to the peso weakening against the U.S. dollar. The decrease in minority interest and other is primarily due to a negative $5 mark to market charge in 2009, compared to a $6 gain in 2008, related to our forward foreign exchange contracts. See the Derivatives section for more information. 26 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) 2008 vs. 2007 The decrease in interest income was largely due to lower interest rates, year over year, on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances. In addition, we recognized $5 of other than temporary impairment losses on certain securities within our investment portfolio. The increase in the earnings of affiliates is primarily attributable to our investment in Costco Mexico (a 50% owned joint venture). Provision for Income Taxes 2009 2008 2007 Income tax expense $ 628 $ 716 $ 627 Effective tax rate 36.7 % 35.8 % 36.7 % The lower tax rate in 2008 was primarily attributable to discrete benefits recognized during the year. Net Income 2009 2008 2007 Net income $ 1,086 $ 1,283 $ 1,083 Unusual items (net of tax) 119 Net income, as adjusted $ 1,086 $ 1,283 $ 1,202 Diluted earnings per share $ 2.47 $ 2.89 $ 2.37 Shares used to calculate diluted net income per common share (000s) 440,454 444,240 457,641 Diluted earnings per share (decrease) / increase (15 )% 22 % 3 % 2009 vs. 2008 Net income for 2009 decreased to $1,086, or $2.47 per diluted share, from $1,283, or $2.89 per diluted share, during 2008, representing a 15% decrease in diluted net income per share. As previously discussed, foreign currencies, particularly in Canada, the United Kingdom and Korea, weakened against the U.S. dollar, which negatively impacted net income for 2009 by approximately $83 after tax, or $0.19 per diluted share. Additionally, net income for 2009 was negatively impacted by a $34 pre tax charge, or approximately $0.05 per diluted share, related to a proposed litigation settlement concerning our membership renewal policy, as well as a $23 pre tax charge, or approximately $0.03 per diluted share, for an adjustment to the net realizable value of the cash surrender value of employee life insurance contracts. Net income for 2009 was positively impacted by a $32 pre tax, or $0.05 per diluted share, benefit due to the reversal of the LIFO reserve established in 2008. 2008 vs. 2007 Net income for 2008 increased to $1,283, or $2.89 per diluted share, from $1,083, or $2.37 per diluted share, during 2007. The unusual items previously discussed totaled $119, net of tax, or $0.26 per diluted share in 2007. Exclusive of these items, earnings in 2007 were $2.63 per diluted share. Net income per diluted share in 2008 represents an increase of 10% over this adjusted amount. During 2008, we repurchased and retired 13,812,000 shares of common stock, favorably impacting earnings per diluted share by approximately $0.03. 27 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The following table itemizes components of our most liquid assets at the end of 2009 and 2008 (dollars in millions, except per share data): 2009 2008 Cash and cash equivalents $ 3,157 $ 2,619 Short term investments 570 656 Total $ 3,727 $ 3,275 Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from warehouse operations and existing cash, cash equivalents, and short term investment balances, which were $3,727 and $3,275 at the end of 2009 and 2008, respectively. Of these balances, approximately $758 and $788 at the end of 2009 and 2008, respectively, represented debit and credit card receivables, primarily related to sales in the week prior to the end of the fiscal year. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $2,092 in 2009 compared to $2,206 in 2008, a decrease of approximately $114. This decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in net income of $197, partially offset by an increase in depreciation and amortization and stock based compensation of $90. Net cash used in investing activities totaled $1,101 in 2009 compared to $1,717 in 2008, a decrease of approximately $616. The decrease in investing activities relates primarily to a $349 decrease in cash used for additions to property and equipment related to warehouse expansion and remodel projects and a prior year reclassification of $371 of cash and cash equivalents to short term investments and other assets on our consolidated balance sheets, explained further below. These activities were partially offset by a decrease in cash provided by the net investment in short term investments of $62 as a result of less cash needed to fund our common stock repurchase activity as well as a decrease in cash proceeds from the sale of property and equipment of $41. In 2008, one of our enhanced money fund investments, Columbia Strategic Cash Portfolio Fund (Columbia), ceased accepting cash redemption requests and changed to a floating net asset value. In light of the restricted liquidity, we elected to receive a pro rata allocation of the underlying securities in a separately managed account. We assessed the fair value of these securities through market quotations and review of current investment ratings, as available, coupled with an evaluation of the liquidation value of each investment and its current performance in meeting scheduled payments of principal and interest. During 2009 and 2008, we recognized $12 and $5, respectively, of other than temporary impairment losses related to these securities. The losses are included in interest income and other in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. At August 30, 2009 and August 31, 2008, the balance of the Columbia fund was $27 and $104, respectively, on the consolidated balance sheets. In 2008, two other enhanced money fund investments, BlackRock Cash Strategies, LLC (BlackRock) and Merrill Lynch Capital Reserve Fund, LLC (Merrill Lynch), ceased accepting redemption requests and commenced liquidation. As of August 31, 2008, the balance of the BlackRock and Merrill Lynch funds was $82 and $43, respectively, on the consolidated balance sheets. During 2009, the remaining balances of these funds were liquidated. During 2008, we reclassified $371 of these three funds from cash and cash equivalents to short term investments and other assets. At August 30, 2009, $24 remained in short term investments and $3 28 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) remained in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets, reflecting the timing of the expected distributions. At August 31, 2008, $161 was in short term investments and $68 in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. The markets relating to these investments remain uncertain, and there may be further declines in the value of these investments that may cause additional losses in future periods. Net cash used in financing activities totaled $439 in 2009 compared to $643 in 2008. The $204 decrease in net cash used in financing activities primarily resulted from a reduction in the cash used to repurchase common stock of $826, partially offset by a decrease in the net proceeds from stock based awards and the excess tax benefit on share based awards of $276, a decrease in the net proceeds from short term borrowings of $195 as well as a decrease in the cash provided by the issuance of long term debt of $103. The effect of exchange rate changes, reflected in the consolidated statement of cash flows, decreased cash by $14 in 2009, compared to a decrease of $7 in 2008. This increase was due primarily to the significant weakening of the Canadian, Korean, and the United Kingdom currencies as compared to the U.S. dollar, during 2009. Dividends In April 2009, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash dividend from $0.16 to $0.18 per share or $0.72 on an annualized basis. Our quarterly cash dividends paid in 2009 totaled $0.68 per share. In 2008, we paid quarterly cash dividends totaling $0.61 per share. Contractual Obligations Our commitments at year end to make future payments under contractual obligations were as follows, as of August 30, 2009: Payments Due by Year Contractual obligations 2010 2011 to2012 2013 to2014 2015 andthereafter Total Purchase obligations (merchandise)(1) $ 3,539 $ 3,539 Long term debt(2) 186 1,120 126 1,432 2,864 Operating leases(3) 145 266 247 1,351 2,009 Purchase obligations (property, equipment, services and other)(4) 151 14 165 Construction Commitments 137 137 Capital lease obligations and other(2) 9 11 11 131 162 Other(5) 17 4 2 24 47 Total $ 4,184 $ 1,415 $ 386 $ 2,938 $ 8,923 (1) Includes open merchandise purchase orders. (2) Includes contractual interest payments. (3) Operating lease obligations exclude amounts commonly referred to as common area maintenance, taxes, and insurance and have been reduced by $163 to reflect sub lease income. (4) The amounts exclude certain services negotiated at the individual warehouse or regional level that are not significant and generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty. 29 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) (5) Consists of $24 in asset retirement obligations, $9 in deferred compensation obligations and includes $14 of current unrecognized tax benefits relating to uncertain tax positions. Amount excludes $16 of noncurrent unrecognized tax benefits due to uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash payments. Expansion Plans Our primary requirement for capital is the financing of land, building, and equipment costs for new and remodeled warehouses. Capital is also required for initial warehouse operations and working capital. While there can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized and plans are subject to change upon further review, it is our current intention to spend approximately $1,300 during fiscal 2010 for real estate, construction, remodeling, and equipment for warehouses and related operations. These expenditures are expected to be financed with a combination of cash provided from operations and existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. We plan to open approximately 16 to 18 new warehouses in 2010, including one to two relocations of existing warehouses to larger and better located facilities. Additional Equity Investments in Subsidiaries and Joint Ventures Our investments in the Costco Mexico joint venture and in other unconsolidated joint ventures that are less than majority owned are accounted for under the equity method. We did not make any capital contributions to our investment in Costco Mexico (a 50% owned joint venture) in 2009, 2008, or 2007. 30 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Bank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs (all amounts stated in millions, in U.S. dollars) Entity Credit FacilityDescription ExpirationDate Total ofall CreditFacilities Credit Line Usage atAugust 30, 2009 AvailableCredit ApplicableInterestRate Stand byLC &Letter ofGuaranty CommercialLetter ofCredit Short TermBorrowing U.S. Uncommitted Stand By Letter of Credit N/A $ 22 $ 22 $ $ $ N/A U.S. Uncommitted Commercial Letter of Credit N/A 50 20 30 N/A Australia(1) Guarantee Line N/A 8 8 N/A Canada(1) Multi Purpose Line March 10 28 18 10 1.76 % Japan(1) Revolving Credit February 10 37 8 29 0.64 % Japan(1) Bank Guaranty March 10 11 11 N/A Japan(1) Revolving Credit February 10 37 8 29 0.70 % Japan(2) Commercial Letter of Credit N/A 1 1 N/A Korea(1) Multi Purpose Line March 10 10 1 9 3.75 % Taiwan Multi Purpose Line January 10 15 4 11 2.50 % Taiwan Multi Purpose Line July 10 15 3 12 2.59 % United Kingdom Revolving Credit February 10 66 66 0.82 % United Kingdom Uncommitted Money Market Line N/A 33 33 3.05 % United Kingdom Uncommitted Overdraft Line N/A 49 49 1.50 % United Kingdom(2) Letter of Guarantee N/A 3 3 N/A United Kingdom Commercial Letter of Credit N/A 3 1 2 N/A TOTAL $ 388 $ 62 $ 21 $ 16 $ 289 (1) The U.S. parent company, Costco Wholesale Corporation, guarantees this entitys credit facility.

Note: We have credit facilities (for commercial and standby letters of credit) totaling $116 and $239 as of August 30, 2009 and August 31, 2008, respectively. The outstanding commitments under these facilities at August 30, 2009 and August 31, 2008, totaled $83 and $116, respectively, including $62 and $69, respectively, in standby letters of credit. For those entities with multi purpose lines, any issuance of either letters of credit (standby and or commercial) or short term borrowings will result in a corresponding decrease in available credit. 32 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Financing Activities In July 2009, we entered into a capital lease for a new warehouse building location and recorded a liability in the amount of $72, representing the net present value of $150 in aggregate future minimum lease payments at an imputed interest rate of 5.4%. This lease expires and becomes subject to a renewal clause in 2040. As of August 30, 2009, $71 is included in long term debt and $1 in the current portion of long term debt in our consolidated balance sheets. We have other minor capital lease obligations that amounted to $5 at the end of 2009 and 2008. In June 2008, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary entered into a ten year term loan in the amount of $32, with a variable rate of interest of Yen TIBOR (6 month) plus a 0.35% margin (0.95% and 1.24% at August 30, 2009 and August 31, 2008, respectively) on the outstanding balance. The net proceeds were used to repay the 1.187% Promissory Notes due in July 2008 and for general corporate purposes. Interest is payable semi annually in December and June and principal is due in June 2018. In October 2007, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes through a private placement in the amount of $69, bearing interest at 2.695%. Interest is payable semi annually, and principal is due in October 2017. The proceeds were used to repay the 2.07% Promissory Notes in October 2007 and for general corporate purposes. In February 2007, we issued $900 of 5.3% Senior Notes due March 15, 2012 at a discount of $2 and $1,100 of 5.5% Senior Notes due March 15, 2017 at a discount of $6 (together, the 2007 Senior Notes). Interest on the 2007 Senior Notes is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The discount and issuance costs associated with the 2007 Senior Notes are being amortized to interest expense over the terms of those notes. At our option, we may redeem the 2007 Senior Notes at any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount of the 2007 Senior Notes to be redeemed, or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, we will be required to make an offer to purchase the 2007 Senior Notes at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase, upon certain events as defined by the terms of the 2007 Senior Notes. In April 2003, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.92% in the amount of $43, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due in April 2010. In November 2002, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.88% in the aggregate amount of $32, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due in November 2009. The U.S. parent company, Costco Wholesale Corporation guarantees all of the promissory notes issued by our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary. In August 1997, we sold $900 principal amount at maturity 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes (Zero Coupon Notes) due in August 2017. The Zero Coupon Notes were priced with a yield to maturity of 3.5%, resulting in gross proceeds of $450. The current Zero Coupon Notes outstanding are convertible into a maximum of 961,000 shares of Costco Common Stock shares at an initial conversion price of $22.71. Holders of the Zero Coupon Notes may require us to purchase the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of purchase) in August 2012. At our option, we may redeem the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of redemption) any time after August 2002. As of August 30, 2009, $858 in principal amount of the Zero Coupon Notes had been converted by note holders to shares of Costco Common Stock, of which $25, $1, and $61 in principal were converted in 2009, 2008, and 2007 respectively, or 33 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) $19 and $42 in 2009 and 2007, respectively, after factoring in the related debt discount. In 2008, the conversion of principle for Zero Coupon Notes after factoring the related debt discount was not significant. Derivatives Effective November 24, 2008, we adopted the disclosure requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities an Amendment of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 133 (SFAS 161). We follow SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (as amended) (SFAS 133), in accounting for derivative and hedging activities. We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in the normal course of our business, which we manage in part through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts, seeking to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on known future expenditures denominated in a foreign currency. The forward foreign exchange contracts are entered into primarily to hedge U.S. dollar merchandise inventory expenditures. Currently, these instruments do not qualify for derivative hedge accounting. We use these instruments to mitigate risk and do not intend to engage in speculative transactions. These contracts do not contain any credit risk related contingent features. We seek to manage the counterparty risk associated with these forward foreign exchange contracts by limiting transactions to counterparties with which we have established banking relationships. There can be no assurance, however, that this effectively mitigates counterparty risk. In addition, the contracts are limited to a time period of less than one year. See Note 1 and Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report, for additional information related to these contracts. We are exposed to risks due to fluctuations in energy prices, particularly electricity and natural gas, which we seek to partially mitigate through the use of fixed price contracts with counterparties for approximately 24% of our warehouses and other facilities in the U.S. and Canada. We also enter into variable priced contracts for some purchases of natural gas and fuel for our gas stations on an index basis. These contracts qualify for treatment as normal purchase or normal sales under SFAS 133 and require no mark to market adjustment. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements With the exception of our operating leases, we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition or consolidated financial statements. Stock Repurchase Programs In September and November of 2007, our Board of Directors approved $300 and $1,000, respectively, of stock repurchases, which expire in August 2010 and November 2010, respectively. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an additional $1,000, which expires in July 2011, bringing total authorizations by our Board of Directors since inception of the program in 2001 to $6,800. During 2009, we repurchased 895,000 shares at an average price of $63.84 per share totaling approximately $57. During 2008, we repurchased 13,812,000 shares of common stock, at an average price of $64.22 per share, totaling approximately $887. The remaining amount available to be purchased under 34 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) our approved plan was $2,002 at the end of 2009. Purchases are made from time to time as conditions warrant in the open market or in block purchases, and pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5 1. Repurchased shares are retired, in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments. We continue to review our accounting policies and evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, investments, merchandise inventory valuation, impairment of long lived assets, warehouse closing costs, insurance/self insurance liabilities, and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. Revenue Recognition We generally recognize sales, net of estimated returns, at the time the member takes possession of merchandise or receives services. When we collect payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services, the amount received is generally recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed. We provide for estimated sales returns based on historical trends in merchandise returns. Amounts collected from members, which under common trade practices are referred to as sales taxes, are recorded on a net basis. We evaluate the criteria of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal Versus Net as an Agent, in determining whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, when we are the primary obligor, subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, influence product or service specifications, or have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded on a gross basis. If we are not the primary obligor and do not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above, we record the net amounts as commissions earned, which is reflected in net sales. Membership fee revenue represents annual membership fees paid by substantially all of our members. We account for membership fee revenue on a deferred basis, whereby revenue is recognized ratably over the one year membership period. Our Executive members qualify for a 2% reward (which can be redeemed only at Costco warehouses), up to a maximum of $500 per year, on all qualified purchases made at Costco. We account for this 2% reward as a reduction in sales, with the related liability being classified within other current liabilities. The sales reduction and corresponding liability are computed after giving effect to the estimated impact of non redemptions based on historical data. Investments Investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other than temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and our intent and ability to hold the investment. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the issuer, including industry and sector performance, 35 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) operational and financing cash flow factors, and rating agency actions. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and or issuer conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments. Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, as determined primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting, and are stated using the last in, first out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all other foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail inventory method of accounting and are stated using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. We believe the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. We record an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the expected annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end. At the end of 2008, due to overall net inflationary trends, merchandise inventories valued at LIFO were lower than the FIFO value, resulting in a $32 charge to merchandise costs. During 2009, due to overall deflationary trends, we recorded a $32 benefit to merchandise costs to adjust inventories valued at LIFO. At the end of 2009 and 2007, merchandise inventories valued at LIFO approximated FIFO after considering the lower of cost or market principle. We provide for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts as a percentage of net sales. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect results of the actual physical inventory counts, which generally occur in the second and fourth quarters of the year. Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as we progress toward earning those rebates, provided they are probable and reasonably estimable. Other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of agreement, or other systematic and rational approaches. Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Warehouse Closing costs We periodically evaluate our long lived assets for indicators of impairment, such as a decision to relocate or close a warehouse location. Our judgments are based on existing market and operational conditions. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring a downward adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value. We provide estimates for warehouse closing costs for both leased and owned locations to be closed or relocated. A considerable amount of judgment is involved in determining any impairment or our net liability, particularly related to the estimated sales price of owned locations and the potential sublease income at leased locations. These estimates are based on real estate conditions in the markets and our experience in those markets. We make assumptions about the average period of time it would take to sublease the location and the amount of potential sublease income for each leased location. We reassess our liability each quarter and adjust our liability accordingly when our estimates change. Insurance/Self Insurance Liabilities We use a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance pool, to provide for potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property damage, director and officers liability, vehicle liability, and 36 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Income Taxes We adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48), which sets out criteria for the use of judgment in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items, at the beginning of 2008. The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Significant judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions. The benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in our consolidated financial statements only after determining a more likely than not probability that the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge, if any, from tax authorities. When facts and circumstances change, we reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the consolidated financial statements as appropriate. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See discussion of Recent Accounting Pronouncements in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report. Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to financial market risk resulting from fluctuations in interest and foreign currency exchange rates. We do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions, nor hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. The current condition of the financial markets, however, has rendered identifiable risks less predictable, and liquidity concerns and credit risks have increased. Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment holdings that are diversified amongst money market funds, debt securities, corporate notes and bonds, and enhanced money funds with effective maturities of generally three months to five years at the date of purchase. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while continuing to generate yields. A revised investment policy was approved in December 2007 by our Board of Directors, limiting future investments to direct U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations, repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations, and U.S. Government and Government Agency Money Market funds. The investment policies of our subsidiaries are consistent with our primary objective to preserve principal while continuing to generate yields. Our wholly owned insurance subsidiary invests in U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations, corporate notes and bonds, and asset and mortgage backed securities with a minimum overall portfolio average credit rating of AA. All of our foreign subsidiaries investments are primarily in money market funds, investment grade securities, bankers acceptances, bank certificates of deposit and term deposits, all denominated in their local currencies. Additionally, our Canadian subsidiary may invest a portion of its investments in U.S. dollar investment grade securities and bank term deposits to meet current U.S. dollar obligations. 37 Table of Contents Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) All of the investment policies of the Company and subsidiaries are reviewed at least annually. Because most of our investments in cash and cash equivalents are of a short term nature, if interest rates were to increase or decrease, the impact would likely be immaterial to our financial statements. Based on our overnight investments and bank balances within cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2009 and 2008, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $24 and $18 (pre tax), respectively, to interest income on an annual basis. For those investments that are classified as available for sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in market volatility and interest rates are reflected within stockholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive income. The nature and amount of our long and short term debt may vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As of the end of 2009, our fixed rate long term debt included: $42 principal amount at maturity of 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes carried at $32; $900 of 5.3% Senior Notes carried at $899; and $1,100 of 5.5% Senior Notes carried at $1,096, and additional notes and capital lease obligations totaling $228. Additionally, our variable rate long term debt included a 0.35% over Yen Tibor (6 month) Term Loan of $32. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt and may affect the interest expense related to the variable rate debt. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report for more information on our long and short term debt. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Our foreign subsidiaries conduct limited transactions in their non functional currencies, which exposes us to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We manage these fluctuations, in part, through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts, seeking to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on known future expenditures denominated in a foreign currency. As of August 30, 2009, and August 31, 2008, we held forward foreign exchange contracts with a notional amount of $183 and $90, respectively, and a fair value liability of $2 and a fair value asset of $5, respectively, on the consolidated balance sheets. A hypothetical 10% strengthening of the functional currency compared to the non functional currency exchange rates at August 30, 2009 and August 31, 2008 would have decreased the fair value of the contracts by $18 and $10, respectively. 
 
Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) 2009 vs. 2008 Membership fees increased 1.8% in 2009 compared to 2008, primarily due to membership sign ups at the 15 new warehouses opened in 2009 (19 opened, two closed due to relocations, and two closed Costco Home locations), the continued benefit of membership sign ups at warehouses opened in 2008, and increased penetration of our higher fee Executive Membership program. This increase was negatively impacted by a charge of $27 related to a proposed litigation settlement concerning our membership renewal policy and the weakening of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar, particularly in Canada, the United Kingdom, and Korea, which negatively impacted membership fees during 2009 by approximately $50. Membership fees were also impacted by a lower number of warehouse openings year over year. Our member renewal rate, currently at 87% is consistent with recent years. As previously disclosed, effective with renewals occurring on and after March 1, 2009, we changed an element of our membership renewal policy. Memberships renewed within two months after expiration of the current membership year are extended for twelve months from the expiration date. (Under the previous policy, renewals within six months of the expiration date were extended for twelve months from the expiration date.) Memberships renewed more than two months after such expiration date are extended for twelve months from the renewal date. Although this change will have the effect of deferring recognition of certain membership fees paid by late renewing members, the effect is not expected to be material. 2008 vs. 2007 Membership fees increased 14.7% to $1,506, or 2.12% of net sales in 2008, from $1,313, or 2.08% of net sales in 2007. Excluding the adjustment to deferred membership fees in 2007, adjusted membership fees increased 10.0% from 2007. The increase was primarily due to: new membership sign ups at the 24 new warehouses opened (34 opened and 10 closed due to relocations); increased penetration of the higher fee Executive Membership program; and the five dollar increase in our annual membership fee in the second half of 2006 for non Executive members. Our member renewal rate at the end of 2008 was 87%. Gross Margin 2009 2008 2007 Gross margin $ 7,554 $ 7,474 $ 6,638 Unusual items 85 Gross margin, as adjusted $ 7,554 $ 7,474 $ 6,723 Gross margin increase 1.1 % 12.6 % 6.8 % Gross margin increase, as adjusted 1.1 % 11.2 % 8.1 % Gross margin as a percent of net sales 10.81 % 10.53 % 10.52 % Adjusted gross margin as a percent of adjusted net sales 10.81 % 10.53 % 10.58 % 2009 vs. 2008 Gross margin, as a percent of net sales, increased 28 basis points compared to 2008. This increase was primarily related to a net 18 basis point increase in our core merchandise departments, primarily in food and sundries, partially offset by a decrease in softlines, and a net seven basis point increase from our warehouse ancillary businesses, primarily our gasoline and pharmacy departments. The majority of this gross margin improvement was due to our lower margin gas business having lower sales penetration, due to the decline in the average selling price per gallon. Increased sales penetration of the Executive Membership two percent reward program negatively affected gross margin by six basis 23 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) points. In addition, gross margin was favorably impacted by nine basis points due to reversing the $32 LIFO reserve established in the prior year as we experienced net deflation, year over year, in the cost of our merchandise inventories. Foreign currencies, particularly in Canada, the United Kingdom and Korea, weakened against the U.S. dollar, which negatively impacted gross margin for 2009 by approximately $258. 2008 vs. 2007 Gross margin, as a percent of net sales, increased one basis point compared to 2007. Excluding the unusual items affecting net sales and gross margin in 2007, adjusted gross margin as a percent of adjusted net sales decreased five basis points in 2008 as compared to 2007. This decrease was largely due to a net 12 basis point decrease in our warehouse ancillary businesses, particularly in one hour photo, tire shop and food services, partially offset by an increase in our gasoline business; a $32, or five basis point LIFO charge, resulting from price increases in certain food items and gasoline; and a three basis point decrease resulting from the increased penetration of the Executive Membership two percent reward program and increased spending by Executive members. These decreases were partially offset by a net 15 basis point increase from our merchandise departments, particularly fresh foods, food and sundries, Costco Online and our international operations, partially offset by a decrease in softlines. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 2009 2008 2007 Selling, general and administrative expenses $ 7,252 $ 6,954 $ 6,273 Unusual items (47 ) SG&A, as adjusted $ 7,252 $ 6,954 $ 6,226 SG&A as a percent of net sales 10.38 % 9.80 % 9.94 % Adjusted SG&A as percent of adjusted net sales 10.38 % 9.80 % 9.80 % 2009 vs. 2008 SG&A expenses, as a percent of net sales, increased 58 basis points compared to 2008. Increased warehouse operating and central administrative costs, as a percent of net sales, negatively impacted SG&A by approximately 56 basis points, resulting primarily from lower sales levels and higher employee health care costs. Higher stock based compensation expense had a negative impact of one basis point. In addition, we recorded an adjustment to the net realizable value of the cash surrender value of employee life insurance contracts, which negatively impacted SG&A, as a percent of net sales, by two basis points. The net realizable value of the insurance contracts is largely based on changes in investment assets underlying the policies and is subject to conditions generally affecting equity and debt markets. In 2008, we recorded a $16 reserve in connection with a legal settlement, which positively impacted the comparison to current years SG&A expense, as a percent of net sales, by two basis points. SG&A expenses, as a percent of net sales, for 2009 were adversely impacted by the decrease in the price of gasoline, as it produced a decline in sales dollars without a comparative reduction in labor or other administrative costs. Foreign currencies, particularly in Canada, the United Kingdom, and Korea, weakened against the U.S. dollar, which positively impacted SG&A for 2009 by approximately $217. 24 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) 2008 vs. 2007 SG&A expenses, as a percent of net sales, decreased 14 basis points compared to 2007. Excluding the unusual items affecting net sales and SG&A expenses in 2007, adjusted SG&A as a percentage of adjusted net sales was comparable to 2007. Warehouse operating and central administrative costs positively impacted adjusted SG&A comparisons, on a net basis, by approximately seven basis points, primarily due to decreased payroll and benefits costs as a percent of adjusted net sales. Stock based compensation expense negatively impacted adjusted SG&A comparisons by three basis points, primarily due to a higher closing stock price on the date that our October 2007 RSU grant was valued as compared to previous grants. Additionally, in 2008, we recorded a $16 reserve in connection with a litigation settlement and accrued approximately $9 for compensation adjustments we made to employees enrolled in our medical and dental plans related to a decision to share a portion of the health plans savings that we achieved. These two items negatively impacted adjusted SG&A comparisons by four basis points. Preopening Expenses 2009 2008 2007 Preopening expenses $ 41 $ 57 $ 55 Warehouse openings 19 34 30 Preopening expenses include costs incurred for startup operations related to new warehouses and the expansion of ancillary operations at existing warehouses. Preopening expenses can vary due to the timing of the opening relative to our year end, whether the warehouse is owned or leased, whether the opening is in an existing, new, or international market. The decline in 2009 is primarily attributable to fewer warehouse openings. Provision for Impaired Assets and Closing Costs, Net 2009 2008 2007 Warehouse closing expenses $ 9 $ 9 $ 16 Impairment of long lived assets 8 10 Net gains on the sale of real property (19 ) (2 ) Provision for impaired assets & closing costs, net $ 17 $ $ 14 This provision primarily includes costs related to impairment of long lived assets; future lease obligations of warehouses that have been closed or relocated to new facilities; accelerated depreciation, based on the shortened useful life through the expected closing date, on buildings to be demolished or sold and that are not otherwise impaired; and losses or gains resulting from the sale of real property, largely comprised of former warehouse locations. 2009 vs. 2008 The net provision for impaired assets and closing costs was a $17 in 2009, compared to a nominal amount in 2008. The provision in 2009 included charges of $9 for warehouse closing expenses, and impairment charges of $8, primarily related to the closing of our two Costco Home locations in July 2009. 25 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) 2008 vs. 2007 The net provision for impaired assets and closing costs was a nominal amount in 2008, compared to $14 in 2007. The provision in 2008 included charges of $9 for warehouse closing expenses, and impairment charges of $10, primarily related to a location in Michigan that was demolished and rebuilt. These charges were offset by $19 of net gain on the sale of real property, largely former warehouse locations. At the end of both 2009 and 2008, the reserve for warehouse closing costs was $5 and primarily related to future lease obligations. Interest Expense 2009 2008 2007 Interest expense $ 108 $ 103 $ 64 2009 vs. 2008 Interest expense primarily relates to our $900 of 5.3% and $1,100 of 5.5% Senior Notes (2007 Senior Notes) issued in 2007. The increase in interest expense is primarily due to a decrease in capitalized interest related to reduced new warehouse and remodel construction activity year over year. 2008 vs. 2007 The increase in interest expense resulted primarily from the issuance of our 2007 Senior Notes in February 2007, partially offset by lower interest expense resulting from the repayment in March 2007 of the $300 5.5% Senior Notes. Interest Income and Other 2009 2008 2007 Interest income $ 27 $ 96 $ 128 Earnings of affiliates 33 42 36 Minority interest and other (15 ) (5 ) 1 Interest Income and other $ 45 $ 133 $ 165 2009 vs. 2008 The decrease in interest income was largely due to lower interest rates, year over year, on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances resulting from a change in policy to invest primarily in U.S. government and agency securities, which earn a lower interest rate. In addition, we recognized $12 of other than temporary impairment losses on certain securities within our investment portfolio in 2009 compared to an impairment loss of $5 in 2008. See further discussion in Liquidity and Capital Resources. The decrease in the earnings of affiliates is primarily attributable to our investment in Costco Mexico (a 50% owned joint venture). Costco Mexicos earnings were lower in 2009, primarily due to the peso weakening against the U.S. dollar. The decrease in minority interest and other is primarily due to a negative $5 mark to market charge in 2009, compared to a $6 gain in 2008, related to our forward foreign exchange contracts. See the Derivatives section for more information. 26 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) 2008 vs. 2007 The decrease in interest income was largely due to lower interest rates, year over year, on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances. In addition, we recognized $5 of other than temporary impairment losses on certain securities within our investment portfolio. The increase in the earnings of affiliates is primarily attributable to our investment in Costco Mexico (a 50% owned joint venture). Provision for Income Taxes 2009 2008 2007 Income tax expense $ 628 $ 716 $ 627 Effective tax rate 36.7 % 35.8 % 36.7 % The lower tax rate in 2008 was primarily attributable to discrete benefits recognized during the year. Net Income 2009 2008 2007 Net income $ 1,086 $ 1,283 $ 1,083 Unusual items (net of tax) 119 Net income, as adjusted $ 1,086 $ 1,283 $ 1,202 Diluted earnings per share $ 2.47 $ 2.89 $ 2.37 Shares used to calculate diluted net income per common share (000s) 440,454 444,240 457,641 Diluted earnings per share (decrease) / increase (15 )% 22 % 3 % 2009 vs. 2008 Net income for 2009 decreased to $1,086, or $2.47 per diluted share, from $1,283, or $2.89 per diluted share, during 2008, representing a 15% decrease in diluted net income per share. As previously discussed, foreign currencies, particularly in Canada, the United Kingdom and Korea, weakened against the U.S. dollar, which negatively impacted net income for 2009 by approximately $83 after tax, or $0.19 per diluted share. Additionally, net income for 2009 was negatively impacted by a $34 pre tax charge, or approximately $0.05 per diluted share, related to a proposed litigation settlement concerning our membership renewal policy, as well as a $23 pre tax charge, or approximately $0.03 per diluted share, for an adjustment to the net realizable value of the cash surrender value of employee life insurance contracts. Net income for 2009 was positively impacted by a $32 pre tax, or $0.05 per diluted share, benefit due to the reversal of the LIFO reserve established in 2008. 2008 vs. 2007 Net income for 2008 increased to $1,283, or $2.89 per diluted share, from $1,083, or $2.37 per diluted share, during 2007. The unusual items previously discussed totaled $119, net of tax, or $0.26 per diluted share in 2007. Exclusive of these items, earnings in 2007 were $2.63 per diluted share. Net income per diluted share in 2008 represents an increase of 10% over this adjusted amount. During 2008, we repurchased and retired 13,812,000 shares of common stock, favorably impacting earnings per diluted share by approximately $0.03. 27 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The following table itemizes components of our most liquid assets at the end of 2009 and 2008 (dollars in millions, except per share data): 2009 2008 Cash and cash equivalents $ 3,157 $ 2,619 Short term investments 570 656 Total $ 3,727 $ 3,275 Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from warehouse operations and existing cash, cash equivalents, and short term investment balances, which were $3,727 and $3,275 at the end of 2009 and 2008, respectively. Of these balances, approximately $758 and $788 at the end of 2009 and 2008, respectively, represented debit and credit card receivables, primarily related to sales in the week prior to the end of the fiscal year. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $2,092 in 2009 compared to $2,206 in 2008, a decrease of approximately $114. This decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in net income of $197, partially offset by an increase in depreciation and amortization and stock based compensation of $90. Net cash used in investing activities totaled $1,101 in 2009 compared to $1,717 in 2008, a decrease of approximately $616. The decrease in investing activities relates primarily to a $349 decrease in cash used for additions to property and equipment related to warehouse expansion and remodel projects and a prior year reclassification of $371 of cash and cash equivalents to short term investments and other assets on our consolidated balance sheets, explained further below. These activities were partially offset by a decrease in cash provided by the net investment in short term investments of $62 as a result of less cash needed to fund our common stock repurchase activity as well as a decrease in cash proceeds from the sale of property and equipment of $41. In 2008, one of our enhanced money fund investments, Columbia Strategic Cash Portfolio Fund (Columbia), ceased accepting cash redemption requests and changed to a floating net asset value. In light of the restricted liquidity, we elected to receive a pro rata allocation of the underlying securities in a separately managed account. We assessed the fair value of these securities through market quotations and review of current investment ratings, as available, coupled with an evaluation of the liquidation value of each investment and its current performance in meeting scheduled payments of principal and interest. During 2009 and 2008, we recognized $12 and $5, respectively, of other than temporary impairment losses related to these securities. The losses are included in interest income and other in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. At August 30, 2009 and August 31, 2008, the balance of the Columbia fund was $27 and $104, respectively, on the consolidated balance sheets. In 2008, two other enhanced money fund investments, BlackRock Cash Strategies, LLC (BlackRock) and Merrill Lynch Capital Reserve Fund, LLC (Merrill Lynch), ceased accepting redemption requests and commenced liquidation. As of August 31, 2008, the balance of the BlackRock and Merrill Lynch funds was $82 and $43, respectively, on the consolidated balance sheets. During 2009, the remaining balances of these funds were liquidated. During 2008, we reclassified $371 of these three funds from cash and cash equivalents to short term investments and other assets. At August 30, 2009, $24 remained in short term investments and $3 28 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) remained in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets, reflecting the timing of the expected distributions. At August 31, 2008, $161 was in short term investments and $68 in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. The markets relating to these investments remain uncertain, and there may be further declines in the value of these investments that may cause additional losses in future periods. Net cash used in financing activities totaled $439 in 2009 compared to $643 in 2008. The $204 decrease in net cash used in financing activities primarily resulted from a reduction in the cash used to repurchase common stock of $826, partially offset by a decrease in the net proceeds from stock based awards and the excess tax benefit on share based awards of $276, a decrease in the net proceeds from short term borrowings of $195 as well as a decrease in the cash provided by the issuance of long term debt of $103. The effect of exchange rate changes, reflected in the consolidated statement of cash flows, decreased cash by $14 in 2009, compared to a decrease of $7 in 2008. This increase was due primarily to the significant weakening of the Canadian, Korean, and the United Kingdom currencies as compared to the U.S. dollar, during 2009. Dividends In April 2009, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash dividend from $0.16 to $0.18 per share or $0.72 on an annualized basis. Our quarterly cash dividends paid in 2009 totaled $0.68 per share. In 2008, we paid quarterly cash dividends totaling $0.61 per share. Contractual Obligations Our commitments at year end to make future payments under contractual obligations were as follows, as of August 30, 2009: Payments Due by Year Contractual obligations 2010 2011 to2012 2013 to2014 2015 andthereafter Total Purchase obligations (merchandise)(1) $ 3,539 $ 3,539 Long term debt(2) 186 1,120 126 1,432 2,864 Operating leases(3) 145 266 247 1,351 2,009 Purchase obligations (property, equipment, services and other)(4) 151 14 165 Construction Commitments 137 137 Capital lease obligations and other(2) 9 11 11 131 162 Other(5) 17 4 2 24 47 Total $ 4,184 $ 1,415 $ 386 $ 2,938 $ 8,923 (1) Includes open merchandise purchase orders. (2) Includes contractual interest payments. (3) Operating lease obligations exclude amounts commonly referred to as common area maintenance, taxes, and insurance and have been reduced by $163 to reflect sub lease income. (4) The amounts exclude certain services negotiated at the individual warehouse or regional level that are not significant and generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty. 29 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) (5) Consists of $24 in asset retirement obligations, $9 in deferred compensation obligations and includes $14 of current unrecognized tax benefits relating to uncertain tax positions. Amount excludes $16 of noncurrent unrecognized tax benefits due to uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash payments. Expansion Plans Our primary requirement for capital is the financing of land, building, and equipment costs for new and remodeled warehouses. Capital is also required for initial warehouse operations and working capital. While there can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized and plans are subject to change upon further review, it is our current intention to spend approximately $1,300 during fiscal 2010 for real estate, construction, remodeling, and equipment for warehouses and related operations. These expenditures are expected to be financed with a combination of cash provided from operations and existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. We plan to open approximately 16 to 18 new warehouses in 2010, including one to two relocations of existing warehouses to larger and better located facilities. Additional Equity Investments in Subsidiaries and Joint Ventures Our investments in the Costco Mexico joint venture and in other unconsolidated joint ventures that are less than majority owned are accounted for under the equity method. We did not make any capital contributions to our investment in Costco Mexico (a 50% owned joint venture) in 2009, 2008, or 2007. 30 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Bank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs (all amounts stated in millions, in U.S. dollars) Entity Credit FacilityDescription ExpirationDate Total ofall CreditFacilities Credit Line Usage atAugust 30, 2009 AvailableCredit ApplicableInterestRate Stand byLC &Letter ofGuaranty CommercialLetter ofCredit Short TermBorrowing U.S. Uncommitted Stand By Letter of Credit N/A $ 22 $ 22 $ $ $ N/A U.S. Uncommitted Commercial Letter of Credit N/A 50 20 30 N/A Australia(1) Guarantee Line N/A 8 8 N/A Canada(1) Multi Purpose Line March 10 28 18 10 1.76 % Japan(1) Revolving Credit February 10 37 8 29 0.64 % Japan(1) Bank Guaranty March 10 11 11 N/A Japan(1) Revolving Credit February 10 37 8 29 0.70 % Japan(2) Commercial Letter of Credit N/A 1 1 N/A Korea(1) Multi Purpose Line March 10 10 1 9 3.75 % Taiwan Multi Purpose Line January 10 15 4 11 2.50 % Taiwan Multi Purpose Line July 10 15 3 12 2.59 % United Kingdom Revolving Credit February 10 66 66 0.82 % United Kingdom Uncommitted Money Market Line N/A 33 33 3.05 % United Kingdom Uncommitted Overdraft Line N/A 49 49 1.50 % United Kingdom(2) Letter of Guarantee N/A 3 3 N/A United Kingdom Commercial Letter of Credit N/A 3 1 2 N/A TOTAL $ 388 $ 62 $ 21 $ 16 $ 289 (1) The U.S. parent company, Costco Wholesale Corporation, guarantees this entitys credit facility.

(3) The amount shown for short term borrowings under this facility is net of a note issue discount, which is excluded from the available credit amount. Note: We have credit facilities (for commercial and standby letters of credit) totaling $116 and $239 as of August 30, 2009 and August 31, 2008, respectively. The outstanding commitments under these facilities at August 30, 2009 and August 31, 2008, totaled $83 and $116, respectively, including $62 and $69, respectively, in standby letters of credit. For those entities with multi purpose lines, any issuance of either letters of credit (standby and or commercial) or short term borrowings will result in a corresponding decrease in available credit. 32 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Financing Activities In July 2009, we entered into a capital lease for a new warehouse building location and recorded a liability in the amount of $72, representing the net present value of $150 in aggregate future minimum lease payments at an imputed interest rate of 5.4%. This lease expires and becomes subject to a renewal clause in 2040. As of August 30, 2009, $71 is included in long term debt and $1 in the current portion of long term debt in our consolidated balance sheets. We have other minor capital lease obligations that amounted to $5 at the end of 2009 and 2008. In June 2008, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary entered into a ten year term loan in the amount of $32, with a variable rate of interest of Yen TIBOR (6 month) plus a 0.35% margin (0.95% and 1.24% at August 30, 2009 and August 31, 2008, respectively) on the outstanding balance. The net proceeds were used to repay the 1.187% Promissory Notes due in July 2008 and for general corporate purposes. Interest is payable semi annually in December and June and principal is due in June 2018. In October 2007, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes through a private placement in the amount of $69, bearing interest at 2.695%. Interest is payable semi annually, and principal is due in October 2017. The proceeds were used to repay the 2.07% Promissory Notes in October 2007 and for general corporate purposes. In February 2007, we issued $900 of 5.3% Senior Notes due March 15, 2012 at a discount of $2 and $1,100 of 5.5% Senior Notes due March 15, 2017 at a discount of $6 (together, the 2007 Senior Notes). Interest on the 2007 Senior Notes is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The discount and issuance costs associated with the 2007 Senior Notes are being amortized to interest expense over the terms of those notes. At our option, we may redeem the 2007 Senior Notes at any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount of the 2007 Senior Notes to be redeemed, or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, we will be required to make an offer to purchase the 2007 Senior Notes at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase, upon certain events as defined by the terms of the 2007 Senior Notes. In April 2003, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.92% in the amount of $43, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due in April 2010. In November 2002, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.88% in the aggregate amount of $32, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due in November 2009. The U.S. parent company, Costco Wholesale Corporation guarantees all of the promissory notes issued by our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary. In August 1997, we sold $900 principal amount at maturity 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes (Zero Coupon Notes) due in August 2017. The Zero Coupon Notes were priced with a yield to maturity of 3.5%, resulting in gross proceeds of $450. The current Zero Coupon Notes outstanding are convertible into a maximum of 961,000 shares of Costco Common Stock shares at an initial conversion price of $22.71. Holders of the Zero Coupon Notes may require us to purchase the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of purchase) in August 2012. At our option, we may redeem the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of redemption) any time after August 2002. As of August 30, 2009, $858 in principal amount of the Zero Coupon Notes had been converted by note holders to shares of Costco Common Stock, of which $25, $1, and $61 in principal were converted in 2009, 2008, and 2007 respectively, or 33 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) $19 and $42 in 2009 and 2007, respectively, after factoring in the related debt discount. In 2008, the conversion of principle for Zero Coupon Notes after factoring the related debt discount was not significant. Derivatives Effective November 24, 2008, we adopted the disclosure requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities an Amendment of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 133 (SFAS 161). We follow SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (as amended) (SFAS 133), in accounting for derivative and hedging activities. We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in the normal course of our business, which we manage in part through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts, seeking to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on known future expenditures denominated in a foreign currency. The forward foreign exchange contracts are entered into primarily to hedge U.S. dollar merchandise inventory expenditures. Currently, these instruments do not qualify for derivative hedge accounting. We use these instruments to mitigate risk and do not intend to engage in speculative transactions. These contracts do not contain any credit risk related contingent features. We seek to manage the counterparty risk associated with these forward foreign exchange contracts by limiting transactions to counterparties with which we have established banking relationships. There can be no assurance, however, that this effectively mitigates counterparty risk. In addition, the contracts are limited to a time period of less than one year. See Note 1 and Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report, for additional information related to these contracts. We are exposed to risks due to fluctuations in energy prices, particularly electricity and natural gas, which we seek to partially mitigate through the use of fixed price contracts with counterparties for approximately 24% of our warehouses and other facilities in the U.S. and Canada. We also enter into variable priced contracts for some purchases of natural gas and fuel for our gas stations on an index basis. These contracts qualify for treatment as normal purchase or normal sales under SFAS 133 and require no mark to market adjustment. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements With the exception of our operating leases, we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition or consolidated financial statements. Stock Repurchase Programs In September and November of 2007, our Board of Directors approved $300 and $1,000, respectively, of stock repurchases, which expire in August 2010 and November 2010, respectively. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an additional $1,000, which expires in July 2011, bringing total authorizations by our Board of Directors since inception of the program in 2001 to $6,800. During 2009, we repurchased 895,000 shares at an average price of $63.84 per share totaling approximately $57. During 2008, we repurchased 13,812,000 shares of common stock, at an average price of $64.22 per share, totaling approximately $887. The remaining amount available to be purchased under 34 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) our approved plan was $2,002 at the end of 2009. Purchases are made from time to time as conditions warrant in the open market or in block purchases, and pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5 1. Repurchased shares are retired, in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments. We continue to review our accounting policies and evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, investments, merchandise inventory valuation, impairment of long lived assets, warehouse closing costs, insurance/self insurance liabilities, and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. Revenue Recognition We generally recognize sales, net of estimated returns, at the time the member takes possession of merchandise or receives services. When we collect payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services, the amount received is generally recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed. We provide for estimated sales returns based on historical trends in merchandise returns. Amounts collected from members, which under common trade practices are referred to as sales taxes, are recorded on a net basis. We evaluate the criteria of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal Versus Net as an Agent, in determining whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, when we are the primary obligor, subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, influence product or service specifications, or have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded on a gross basis. If we are not the primary obligor and do not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above, we record the net amounts as commissions earned, which is reflected in net sales. Membership fee revenue represents annual membership fees paid by substantially all of our members. We account for membership fee revenue on a deferred basis, whereby revenue is recognized ratably over the one year membership period. Our Executive members qualify for a 2% reward (which can be redeemed only at Costco warehouses), up to a maximum of $500 per year, on all qualified purchases made at Costco. We account for this 2% reward as a reduction in sales, with the related liability being classified within other current liabilities. The sales reduction and corresponding liability are computed after giving effect to the estimated impact of non redemptions based on historical data. Investments Investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other than temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and our intent and ability to hold the investment. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the issuer, including industry and sector performance, 35 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) operational and financing cash flow factors, and rating agency actions. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and or issuer conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments. Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, as determined primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting, and are stated using the last in, first out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all other foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail inventory method of accounting and are stated using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. We believe the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. We record an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the expected annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end. At the end of 2008, due to overall net inflationary trends, merchandise inventories valued at LIFO were lower than the FIFO value, resulting in a $32 charge to merchandise costs. During 2009, due to overall deflationary trends, we recorded a $32 benefit to merchandise costs to adjust inventories valued at LIFO. At the end of 2009 and 2007, merchandise inventories valued at LIFO approximated FIFO after considering the lower of cost or market principle. We provide for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts as a percentage of net sales. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect results of the actual physical inventory counts, which generally occur in the second and fourth quarters of the year. Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as we progress toward earning those rebates, provided they are probable and reasonably estimable. Other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of agreement, or other systematic and rational approaches. Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Warehouse Closing costs We periodically evaluate our long lived assets for indicators of impairment, such as a decision to relocate or close a warehouse location. Our judgments are based on existing market and operational conditions. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring a downward adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value. We provide estimates for warehouse closing costs for both leased and owned locations to be closed or relocated. A considerable amount of judgment is involved in determining any impairment or our net liability, particularly related to the estimated sales price of owned locations and the potential sublease income at leased locations. These estimates are based on real estate conditions in the markets and our experience in those markets. We make assumptions about the average period of time it would take to sublease the location and the amount of potential sublease income for each leased location. We reassess our liability each quarter and adjust our liability accordingly when our estimates change. Insurance/Self Insurance Liabilities We use a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance pool, to provide for potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property damage, director and officers liability, vehicle liability, and 36 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Income Taxes We adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48), which sets out criteria for the use of judgment in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items, at the beginning of 2008. The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Significant judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions. The benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in our consolidated financial statements only after determining a more likely than not probability that the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge, if any, from tax authorities. When facts and circumstances change, we reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the consolidated financial statements as appropriate. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See discussion of Recent Accounting Pronouncements in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report. Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to financial market risk resulting from fluctuations in interest and foreign currency exchange rates. We do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions, nor hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. The current condition of the financial markets, however, has rendered identifiable risks less predictable, and liquidity concerns and credit risks have increased. Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment holdings that are diversified amongst money market funds, debt securities, corporate notes and bonds, and enhanced money funds with effective maturities of generally three months to five years at the date of purchase. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while continuing to generate yields. A revised investment policy was approved in December 2007 by our Board of Directors, limiting future investments to direct U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations, repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations, and U.S. Government and Government Agency Money Market funds. The investment policies of our subsidiaries are consistent with our primary objective to preserve principal while continuing to generate yields. Our wholly owned insurance subsidiary invests in U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations, corporate notes and bonds, and asset and mortgage backed securities with a minimum overall portfolio average credit rating of AA. All of our foreign subsidiaries investments are primarily in money market funds, investment grade securities, bankers acceptances, bank certificates of deposit and term deposits, all denominated in their local currencies. Additionally, our Canadian subsidiary may invest a portion of its investments in U.S. dollar investment grade securities and bank term deposits to meet current U.S. dollar obligations. 37 Table of Contents Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) All of the investment policies of the Company and subsidiaries are reviewed at least annually. Because most of our investments in cash and cash equivalents are of a short term nature, if interest rates were to increase or decrease, the impact would likely be immaterial to our financial statements. Based on our overnight investments and bank balances within cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2009 and 2008, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $24 and $18 (pre tax), respectively, to interest income on an annual basis. For those investments that are classified as available for sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in market volatility and interest rates are reflected within stockholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive income. The nature and amount of our long and short term debt may vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As of the end of 2009, our fixed rate long term debt included: $42 principal amount at maturity of 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes carried at $32; $900 of 5.3% Senior Notes carried at $899; and $1,100 of 5.5% Senior Notes carried at $1,096, and additional notes and capital lease obligations totaling $228. Additionally, our variable rate long term debt included a 0.35% over Yen Tibor (6 month) Term Loan of $32. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt and may affect the interest expense related to the variable rate debt. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report for more information on our long and short term debt. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Our foreign subsidiaries conduct limited transactions in their non functional currencies, which exposes us to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We manage these fluctuations, in part, through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts, seeking to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on known future expenditures denominated in a foreign currency. As of August 30, 2009, and August 31, 2008, we held forward foreign exchange contracts with a notional amount of $183 and $90, respectively, and a fair value liability of $2 and a fair value asset of $5, respectively, on the consolidated balance sheets. A hypothetical 10% strengthening of the functional currency compared to the non functional currency exchange rates at August 30, 2009 and August 31, 2008 would have decreased the fair value of the contracts by $18 and $10, respectively. 
 
Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) points. In addition, gross margin was favorably impacted by nine basis points due to reversing the $32 LIFO reserve established in the prior year as we experienced net deflation, year over year, in the cost of our merchandise inventories. Foreign currencies, particularly in Canada, the United Kingdom and Korea, weakened against the U.S. dollar, which negatively impacted gross margin for 2009 by approximately $258. 2008 vs. 2007 Gross margin, as a percent of net sales, increased one basis point compared to 2007. Excluding the unusual items affecting net sales and gross margin in 2007, adjusted gross margin as a percent of adjusted net sales decreased five basis points in 2008 as compared to 2007. This decrease was largely due to a net 12 basis point decrease in our warehouse ancillary businesses, particularly in one hour photo, tire shop and food services, partially offset by an increase in our gasoline business; a $32, or five basis point LIFO charge, resulting from price increases in certain food items and gasoline; and a three basis point decrease resulting from the increased penetration of the Executive Membership two percent reward program and increased spending by Executive members. These decreases were partially offset by a net 15 basis point increase from our merchandise departments, particularly fresh foods, food and sundries, Costco Online and our international operations, partially offset by a decrease in softlines. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 2009 2008 2007 Selling, general and administrative expenses $ 7,252 $ 6,954 $ 6,273 Unusual items (47 ) SG&A, as adjusted $ 7,252 $ 6,954 $ 6,226 SG&A as a percent of net sales 10.38 % 9.80 % 9.94 % Adjusted SG&A as percent of adjusted net sales 10.38 % 9.80 % 9.80 % 2009 vs. 2008 SG&A expenses, as a percent of net sales, increased 58 basis points compared to 2008. Increased warehouse operating and central administrative costs, as a percent of net sales, negatively impacted SG&A by approximately 56 basis points, resulting primarily from lower sales levels and higher employee health care costs. Higher stock based compensation expense had a negative impact of one basis point. In addition, we recorded an adjustment to the net realizable value of the cash surrender value of employee life insurance contracts, which negatively impacted SG&A, as a percent of net sales, by two basis points. The net realizable value of the insurance contracts is largely based on changes in investment assets underlying the policies and is subject to conditions generally affecting equity and debt markets. In 2008, we recorded a $16 reserve in connection with a legal settlement, which positively impacted the comparison to current years SG&A expense, as a percent of net sales, by two basis points. SG&A expenses, as a percent of net sales, for 2009 were adversely impacted by the decrease in the price of gasoline, as it produced a decline in sales dollars without a comparative reduction in labor or other administrative costs. Foreign currencies, particularly in Canada, the United Kingdom, and Korea, weakened against the U.S. dollar, which positively impacted SG&A for 2009 by approximately $217. 24 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) 2008 vs. 2007 SG&A expenses, as a percent of net sales, decreased 14 basis points compared to 2007. Excluding the unusual items affecting net sales and SG&A expenses in 2007, adjusted SG&A as a percentage of adjusted net sales was comparable to 2007. Warehouse operating and central administrative costs positively impacted adjusted SG&A comparisons, on a net basis, by approximately seven basis points, primarily due to decreased payroll and benefits costs as a percent of adjusted net sales. Stock based compensation expense negatively impacted adjusted SG&A comparisons by three basis points, primarily due to a higher closing stock price on the date that our October 2007 RSU grant was valued as compared to previous grants. Additionally, in 2008, we recorded a $16 reserve in connection with a litigation settlement and accrued approximately $9 for compensation adjustments we made to employees enrolled in our medical and dental plans related to a decision to share a portion of the health plans savings that we achieved. These two items negatively impacted adjusted SG&A comparisons by four basis points. Preopening Expenses 2009 2008 2007 Preopening expenses $ 41 $ 57 $ 55 Warehouse openings 19 34 30 Preopening expenses include costs incurred for startup operations related to new warehouses and the expansion of ancillary operations at existing warehouses. Preopening expenses can vary due to the timing of the opening relative to our year end, whether the warehouse is owned or leased, whether the opening is in an existing, new, or international market. The decline in 2009 is primarily attributable to fewer warehouse openings. Provision for Impaired Assets and Closing Costs, Net 2009 2008 2007 Warehouse closing expenses $ 9 $ 9 $ 16 Impairment of long lived assets 8 10 Net gains on the sale of real property (19 ) (2 ) Provision for impaired assets & closing costs, net $ 17 $ $ 14 This provision primarily includes costs related to impairment of long lived assets; future lease obligations of warehouses that have been closed or relocated to new facilities; accelerated depreciation, based on the shortened useful life through the expected closing date, on buildings to be demolished or sold and that are not otherwise impaired; and losses or gains resulting from the sale of real property, largely comprised of former warehouse locations. 2009 vs. 2008 The net provision for impaired assets and closing costs was a $17 in 2009, compared to a nominal amount in 2008. The provision in 2009 included charges of $9 for warehouse closing expenses, and impairment charges of $8, primarily related to the closing of our two Costco Home locations in July 2009. 25 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) 2008 vs. 2007 The net provision for impaired assets and closing costs was a nominal amount in 2008, compared to $14 in 2007. The provision in 2008 included charges of $9 for warehouse closing expenses, and impairment charges of $10, primarily related to a location in Michigan that was demolished and rebuilt. These charges were offset by $19 of net gain on the sale of real property, largely former warehouse locations. At the end of both 2009 and 2008, the reserve for warehouse closing costs was $5 and primarily related to future lease obligations. Interest Expense 2009 2008 2007 Interest expense $ 108 $ 103 $ 64 2009 vs. 2008 Interest expense primarily relates to our $900 of 5.3% and $1,100 of 5.5% Senior Notes (2007 Senior Notes) issued in 2007. The increase in interest expense is primarily due to a decrease in capitalized interest related to reduced new warehouse and remodel construction activity year over year. 2008 vs. 2007 The increase in interest expense resulted primarily from the issuance of our 2007 Senior Notes in February 2007, partially offset by lower interest expense resulting from the repayment in March 2007 of the $300 5.5% Senior Notes. Interest Income and Other 2009 2008 2007 Interest income $ 27 $ 96 $ 128 Earnings of affiliates 33 42 36 Minority interest and other (15 ) (5 ) 1 Interest Income and other $ 45 $ 133 $ 165 2009 vs. 2008 The decrease in interest income was largely due to lower interest rates, year over year, on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances resulting from a change in policy to invest primarily in U.S. government and agency securities, which earn a lower interest rate. In addition, we recognized $12 of other than temporary impairment losses on certain securities within our investment portfolio in 2009 compared to an impairment loss of $5 in 2008. See further discussion in Liquidity and Capital Resources. The decrease in the earnings of affiliates is primarily attributable to our investment in Costco Mexico (a 50% owned joint venture). Costco Mexicos earnings were lower in 2009, primarily due to the peso weakening against the U.S. dollar. The decrease in minority interest and other is primarily due to a negative $5 mark to market charge in 2009, compared to a $6 gain in 2008, related to our forward foreign exchange contracts. See the Derivatives section for more information. 26 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) 2008 vs. 2007 The decrease in interest income was largely due to lower interest rates, year over year, on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances. In addition, we recognized $5 of other than temporary impairment losses on certain securities within our investment portfolio. The increase in the earnings of affiliates is primarily attributable to our investment in Costco Mexico (a 50% owned joint venture). Provision for Income Taxes 2009 2008 2007 Income tax expense $ 628 $ 716 $ 627 Effective tax rate 36.7 % 35.8 % 36.7 % The lower tax rate in 2008 was primarily attributable to discrete benefits recognized during the year. Net Income 2009 2008 2007 Net income $ 1,086 $ 1,283 $ 1,083 Unusual items (net of tax) 119 Net income, as adjusted $ 1,086 $ 1,283 $ 1,202 Diluted earnings per share $ 2.47 $ 2.89 $ 2.37 Shares used to calculate diluted net income per common share (000s) 440,454 444,240 457,641 Diluted earnings per share (decrease) / increase (15 )% 22 % 3 % 2009 vs. 2008 Net income for 2009 decreased to $1,086, or $2.47 per diluted share, from $1,283, or $2.89 per diluted share, during 2008, representing a 15% decrease in diluted net income per share. As previously discussed, foreign currencies, particularly in Canada, the United Kingdom and Korea, weakened against the U.S. dollar, which negatively impacted net income for 2009 by approximately $83 after tax, or $0.19 per diluted share. Additionally, net income for 2009 was negatively impacted by a $34 pre tax charge, or approximately $0.05 per diluted share, related to a proposed litigation settlement concerning our membership renewal policy, as well as a $23 pre tax charge, or approximately $0.03 per diluted share, for an adjustment to the net realizable value of the cash surrender value of employee life insurance contracts. Net income for 2009 was positively impacted by a $32 pre tax, or $0.05 per diluted share, benefit due to the reversal of the LIFO reserve established in 2008. 2008 vs. 2007 Net income for 2008 increased to $1,283, or $2.89 per diluted share, from $1,083, or $2.37 per diluted share, during 2007. The unusual items previously discussed totaled $119, net of tax, or $0.26 per diluted share in 2007. Exclusive of these items, earnings in 2007 were $2.63 per diluted share. Net income per diluted share in 2008 represents an increase of 10% over this adjusted amount. During 2008, we repurchased and retired 13,812,000 shares of common stock, favorably impacting earnings per diluted share by approximately $0.03. 27 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The following table itemizes components of our most liquid assets at the end of 2009 and 2008 (dollars in millions, except per share data): 2009 2008 Cash and cash equivalents $ 3,157 $ 2,619 Short term investments 570 656 Total $ 3,727 $ 3,275 Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from warehouse operations and existing cash, cash equivalents, and short term investment balances, which were $3,727 and $3,275 at the end of 2009 and 2008, respectively. Of these balances, approximately $758 and $788 at the end of 2009 and 2008, respectively, represented debit and credit card receivables, primarily related to sales in the week prior to the end of the fiscal year. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $2,092 in 2009 compared to $2,206 in 2008, a decrease of approximately $114. This decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in net income of $197, partially offset by an increase in depreciation and amortization and stock based compensation of $90. Net cash used in investing activities totaled $1,101 in 2009 compared to $1,717 in 2008, a decrease of approximately $616. The decrease in investing activities relates primarily to a $349 decrease in cash used for additions to property and equipment related to warehouse expansion and remodel projects and a prior year reclassification of $371 of cash and cash equivalents to short term investments and other assets on our consolidated balance sheets, explained further below. These activities were partially offset by a decrease in cash provided by the net investment in short term investments of $62 as a result of less cash needed to fund our common stock repurchase activity as well as a decrease in cash proceeds from the sale of property and equipment of $41. In 2008, one of our enhanced money fund investments, Columbia Strategic Cash Portfolio Fund (Columbia), ceased accepting cash redemption requests and changed to a floating net asset value. In light of the restricted liquidity, we elected to receive a pro rata allocation of the underlying securities in a separately managed account. We assessed the fair value of these securities through market quotations and review of current investment ratings, as available, coupled with an evaluation of the liquidation value of each investment and its current performance in meeting scheduled payments of principal and interest. During 2009 and 2008, we recognized $12 and $5, respectively, of other than temporary impairment losses related to these securities. The losses are included in interest income and other in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. At August 30, 2009 and August 31, 2008, the balance of the Columbia fund was $27 and $104, respectively, on the consolidated balance sheets. In 2008, two other enhanced money fund investments, BlackRock Cash Strategies, LLC (BlackRock) and Merrill Lynch Capital Reserve Fund, LLC (Merrill Lynch), ceased accepting redemption requests and commenced liquidation. As of August 31, 2008, the balance of the BlackRock and Merrill Lynch funds was $82 and $43, respectively, on the consolidated balance sheets. During 2009, the remaining balances of these funds were liquidated. During 2008, we reclassified $371 of these three funds from cash and cash equivalents to short term investments and other assets. At August 30, 2009, $24 remained in short term investments and $3 28 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) remained in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets, reflecting the timing of the expected distributions. At August 31, 2008, $161 was in short term investments and $68 in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. The markets relating to these investments remain uncertain, and there may be further declines in the value of these investments that may cause additional losses in future periods. Net cash used in financing activities totaled $439 in 2009 compared to $643 in 2008. The $204 decrease in net cash used in financing activities primarily resulted from a reduction in the cash used to repurchase common stock of $826, partially offset by a decrease in the net proceeds from stock based awards and the excess tax benefit on share based awards of $276, a decrease in the net proceeds from short term borrowings of $195 as well as a decrease in the cash provided by the issuance of long term debt of $103. The effect of exchange rate changes, reflected in the consolidated statement of cash flows, decreased cash by $14 in 2009, compared to a decrease of $7 in 2008. This increase was due primarily to the significant weakening of the Canadian, Korean, and the United Kingdom currencies as compared to the U.S. dollar, during 2009. Dividends In April 2009, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash dividend from $0.16 to $0.18 per share or $0.72 on an annualized basis. Our quarterly cash dividends paid in 2009 totaled $0.68 per share. In 2008, we paid quarterly cash dividends totaling $0.61 per share. Contractual Obligations Our commitments at year end to make future payments under contractual obligations were as follows, as of August 30, 2009: Payments Due by Year Contractual obligations 2010 2011 to2012 2013 to2014 2015 andthereafter Total Purchase obligations (merchandise)(1) $ 3,539 $ 3,539 Long term debt(2) 186 1,120 126 1,432 2,864 Operating leases(3) 145 266 247 1,351 2,009 Purchase obligations (property, equipment, services and other)(4) 151 14 165 Construction Commitments 137 137 Capital lease obligations and other(2) 9 11 11 131 162 Other(5) 17 4 2 24 47 Total $ 4,184 $ 1,415 $ 386 $ 2,938 $ 8,923 (1) Includes open merchandise purchase orders. (2) Includes contractual interest payments. (3) Operating lease obligations exclude amounts commonly referred to as common area maintenance, taxes, and insurance and have been reduced by $163 to reflect sub lease income. (4) The amounts exclude certain services negotiated at the individual warehouse or regional level that are not significant and generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty. 29 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) (5) Consists of $24 in asset retirement obligations, $9 in deferred compensation obligations and includes $14 of current unrecognized tax benefits relating to uncertain tax positions. Amount excludes $16 of noncurrent unrecognized tax benefits due to uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash payments. Expansion Plans Our primary requirement for capital is the financing of land, building, and equipment costs for new and remodeled warehouses. Capital is also required for initial warehouse operations and working capital. While there can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized and plans are subject to change upon further review, it is our current intention to spend approximately $1,300 during fiscal 2010 for real estate, construction, remodeling, and equipment for warehouses and related operations. These expenditures are expected to be financed with a combination of cash provided from operations and existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. We plan to open approximately 16 to 18 new warehouses in 2010, including one to two relocations of existing warehouses to larger and better located facilities. Additional Equity Investments in Subsidiaries and Joint Ventures Our investments in the Costco Mexico joint venture and in other unconsolidated joint ventures that are less than majority owned are accounted for under the equity method. We did not make any capital contributions to our investment in Costco Mexico (a 50% owned joint venture) in 2009, 2008, or 2007. 30 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Bank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs (all amounts stated in millions, in U.S. dollars) Entity Credit FacilityDescription ExpirationDate Total ofall CreditFacilities Credit Line Usage atAugust 30, 2009 AvailableCredit ApplicableInterestRate Stand byLC &Letter ofGuaranty CommercialLetter ofCredit Short TermBorrowing U.S. Uncommitted Stand By Letter of Credit N/A $ 22 $ 22 $ $ $ N/A U.S. Uncommitted Commercial Letter of Credit N/A 50 20 30 N/A Australia(1) Guarantee Line N/A 8 8 N/A Canada(1) Multi Purpose Line March 10 28 18 10 1.76 % Japan(1) Revolving Credit February 10 37 8 29 0.64 % Japan(1) Bank Guaranty March 10 11 11 N/A Japan(1) Revolving Credit February 10 37 8 29 0.70 % Japan(2) Commercial Letter of Credit N/A 1 1 N/A Korea(1) Multi Purpose Line March 10 10 1 9 3.75 % Taiwan Multi Purpose Line January 10 15 4 11 2.50 % Taiwan Multi Purpose Line July 10 15 3 12 2.59 % United Kingdom Revolving Credit February 10 66 66 0.82 % United Kingdom Uncommitted Money Market Line N/A 33 33 3.05 % United Kingdom Uncommitted Overdraft Line N/A 49 49 1.50 % United Kingdom(2) Letter of Guarantee N/A 3 3 N/A United Kingdom Commercial Letter of Credit N/A 3 1 2 N/A TOTAL $ 388 $ 62 $ 21 $ 16 $ 289 (1) The U.S. parent company, Costco Wholesale Corporation, guarantees this entitys credit facility.

Note: We have credit facilities (for commercial and standby letters of credit) totaling $116 and $239 as of August 30, 2009 and August 31, 2008, respectively. The outstanding commitments under these facilities at August 30, 2009 and August 31, 2008, totaled $83 and $116, respectively, including $62 and $69, respectively, in standby letters of credit. For those entities with multi purpose lines, any issuance of either letters of credit (standby and or commercial) or short term borrowings will result in a corresponding decrease in available credit. 32 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Financing Activities In July 2009, we entered into a capital lease for a new warehouse building location and recorded a liability in the amount of $72, representing the net present value of $150 in aggregate future minimum lease payments at an imputed interest rate of 5.4%. This lease expires and becomes subject to a renewal clause in 2040. As of August 30, 2009, $71 is included in long term debt and $1 in the current portion of long term debt in our consolidated balance sheets. We have other minor capital lease obligations that amounted to $5 at the end of 2009 and 2008. In June 2008, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary entered into a ten year term loan in the amount of $32, with a variable rate of interest of Yen TIBOR (6 month) plus a 0.35% margin (0.95% and 1.24% at August 30, 2009 and August 31, 2008, respectively) on the outstanding balance. The net proceeds were used to repay the 1.187% Promissory Notes due in July 2008 and for general corporate purposes. Interest is payable semi annually in December and June and principal is due in June 2018. In October 2007, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes through a private placement in the amount of $69, bearing interest at 2.695%. Interest is payable semi annually, and principal is due in October 2017. The proceeds were used to repay the 2.07% Promissory Notes in October 2007 and for general corporate purposes. In February 2007, we issued $900 of 5.3% Senior Notes due March 15, 2012 at a discount of $2 and $1,100 of 5.5% Senior Notes due March 15, 2017 at a discount of $6 (together, the 2007 Senior Notes). Interest on the 2007 Senior Notes is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The discount and issuance costs associated with the 2007 Senior Notes are being amortized to interest expense over the terms of those notes. At our option, we may redeem the 2007 Senior Notes at any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount of the 2007 Senior Notes to be redeemed, or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, we will be required to make an offer to purchase the 2007 Senior Notes at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase, upon certain events as defined by the terms of the 2007 Senior Notes. In April 2003, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.92% in the amount of $43, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due in April 2010. In November 2002, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.88% in the aggregate amount of $32, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due in November 2009. The U.S. parent company, Costco Wholesale Corporation guarantees all of the promissory notes issued by our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary. In August 1997, we sold $900 principal amount at maturity 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes (Zero Coupon Notes) due in August 2017. The Zero Coupon Notes were priced with a yield to maturity of 3.5%, resulting in gross proceeds of $450. The current Zero Coupon Notes outstanding are convertible into a maximum of 961,000 shares of Costco Common Stock shares at an initial conversion price of $22.71. Holders of the Zero Coupon Notes may require us to purchase the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of purchase) in August 2012. At our option, we may redeem the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of redemption) any time after August 2002. As of August 30, 2009, $858 in principal amount of the Zero Coupon Notes had been converted by note holders to shares of Costco Common Stock, of which $25, $1, and $61 in principal were converted in 2009, 2008, and 2007 respectively, or 33 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) $19 and $42 in 2009 and 2007, respectively, after factoring in the related debt discount. In 2008, the conversion of principle for Zero Coupon Notes after factoring the related debt discount was not significant. Derivatives Effective November 24, 2008, we adopted the disclosure requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities an Amendment of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 133 (SFAS 161). We follow SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (as amended) (SFAS 133), in accounting for derivative and hedging activities. We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in the normal course of our business, which we manage in part through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts, seeking to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on known future expenditures denominated in a foreign currency. The forward foreign exchange contracts are entered into primarily to hedge U.S. dollar merchandise inventory expenditures. Currently, these instruments do not qualify for derivative hedge accounting. We use these instruments to mitigate risk and do not intend to engage in speculative transactions. These contracts do not contain any credit risk related contingent features. We seek to manage the counterparty risk associated with these forward foreign exchange contracts by limiting transactions to counterparties with which we have established banking relationships. There can be no assurance, however, that this effectively mitigates counterparty risk. In addition, the contracts are limited to a time period of less than one year. See Note 1 and Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report, for additional information related to these contracts. We are exposed to risks due to fluctuations in energy prices, particularly electricity and natural gas, which we seek to partially mitigate through the use of fixed price contracts with counterparties for approximately 24% of our warehouses and other facilities in the U.S. and Canada. We also enter into variable priced contracts for some purchases of natural gas and fuel for our gas stations on an index basis. These contracts qualify for treatment as normal purchase or normal sales under SFAS 133 and require no mark to market adjustment. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements With the exception of our operating leases, we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition or consolidated financial statements. Stock Repurchase Programs In September and November of 2007, our Board of Directors approved $300 and $1,000, respectively, of stock repurchases, which expire in August 2010 and November 2010, respectively. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an additional $1,000, which expires in July 2011, bringing total authorizations by our Board of Directors since inception of the program in 2001 to $6,800. During 2009, we repurchased 895,000 shares at an average price of $63.84 per share totaling approximately $57. During 2008, we repurchased 13,812,000 shares of common stock, at an average price of $64.22 per share, totaling approximately $887. The remaining amount available to be purchased under 34 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) our approved plan was $2,002 at the end of 2009. Purchases are made from time to time as conditions warrant in the open market or in block purchases, and pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5 1. Repurchased shares are retired, in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments. We continue to review our accounting policies and evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, investments, merchandise inventory valuation, impairment of long lived assets, warehouse closing costs, insurance/self insurance liabilities, and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. Revenue Recognition We generally recognize sales, net of estimated returns, at the time the member takes possession of merchandise or receives services. When we collect payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services, the amount received is generally recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed. We provide for estimated sales returns based on historical trends in merchandise returns. Amounts collected from members, which under common trade practices are referred to as sales taxes, are recorded on a net basis. We evaluate the criteria of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal Versus Net as an Agent, in determining whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, when we are the primary obligor, subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, influence product or service specifications, or have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded on a gross basis. If we are not the primary obligor and do not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above, we record the net amounts as commissions earned, which is reflected in net sales. Membership fee revenue represents annual membership fees paid by substantially all of our members. We account for membership fee revenue on a deferred basis, whereby revenue is recognized ratably over the one year membership period. Our Executive members qualify for a 2% reward (which can be redeemed only at Costco warehouses), up to a maximum of $500 per year, on all qualified purchases made at Costco. We account for this 2% reward as a reduction in sales, with the related liability being classified within other current liabilities. The sales reduction and corresponding liability are computed after giving effect to the estimated impact of non redemptions based on historical data. Investments Investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other than temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and our intent and ability to hold the investment. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the issuer, including industry and sector performance, 35 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) operational and financing cash flow factors, and rating agency actions. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and or issuer conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments. Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, as determined primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting, and are stated using the last in, first out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all other foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail inventory method of accounting and are stated using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. We believe the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. We record an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the expected annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end. At the end of 2008, due to overall net inflationary trends, merchandise inventories valued at LIFO were lower than the FIFO value, resulting in a $32 charge to merchandise costs. During 2009, due to overall deflationary trends, we recorded a $32 benefit to merchandise costs to adjust inventories valued at LIFO. At the end of 2009 and 2007, merchandise inventories valued at LIFO approximated FIFO after considering the lower of cost or market principle. We provide for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts as a percentage of net sales. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect results of the actual physical inventory counts, which generally occur in the second and fourth quarters of the year. Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as we progress toward earning those rebates, provided they are probable and reasonably estimable. Other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of agreement, or other systematic and rational approaches. Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Warehouse Closing costs We periodically evaluate our long lived assets for indicators of impairment, such as a decision to relocate or close a warehouse location. Our judgments are based on existing market and operational conditions. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring a downward adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value. We provide estimates for warehouse closing costs for both leased and owned locations to be closed or relocated. A considerable amount of judgment is involved in determining any impairment or our net liability, particularly related to the estimated sales price of owned locations and the potential sublease income at leased locations. These estimates are based on real estate conditions in the markets and our experience in those markets. We make assumptions about the average period of time it would take to sublease the location and the amount of potential sublease income for each leased location. We reassess our liability each quarter and adjust our liability accordingly when our estimates change. Insurance/Self Insurance Liabilities We use a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance pool, to provide for potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property damage, director and officers liability, vehicle liability, and 36 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Income Taxes We adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48), which sets out criteria for the use of judgment in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items, at the beginning of 2008. The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Significant judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions. The benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in our consolidated financial statements only after determining a more likely than not probability that the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge, if any, from tax authorities. When facts and circumstances change, we reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the consolidated financial statements as appropriate. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See discussion of Recent Accounting Pronouncements in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report. Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to financial market risk resulting from fluctuations in interest and foreign currency exchange rates. We do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions, nor hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. The current condition of the financial markets, however, has rendered identifiable risks less predictable, and liquidity concerns and credit risks have increased. Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment holdings that are diversified amongst money market funds, debt securities, corporate notes and bonds, and enhanced money funds with effective maturities of generally three months to five years at the date of purchase. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while continuing to generate yields. A revised investment policy was approved in December 2007 by our Board of Directors, limiting future investments to direct U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations, repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations, and U.S. Government and Government Agency Money Market funds. The investment policies of our subsidiaries are consistent with our primary objective to preserve principal while continuing to generate yields. Our wholly owned insurance subsidiary invests in U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations, corporate notes and bonds, and asset and mortgage backed securities with a minimum overall portfolio average credit rating of AA. All of our foreign subsidiaries investments are primarily in money market funds, investment grade securities, bankers acceptances, bank certificates of deposit and term deposits, all denominated in their local currencies. Additionally, our Canadian subsidiary may invest a portion of its investments in U.S. dollar investment grade securities and bank term deposits to meet current U.S. dollar obligations. 37 Table of Contents Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) All of the investment policies of the Company and subsidiaries are reviewed at least annually. Because most of our investments in cash and cash equivalents are of a short term nature, if interest rates were to increase or decrease, the impact would likely be immaterial to our financial statements. Based on our overnight investments and bank balances within cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2009 and 2008, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $24 and $18 (pre tax), respectively, to interest income on an annual basis. For those investments that are classified as available for sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in market volatility and interest rates are reflected within stockholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive income. The nature and amount of our long and short term debt may vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As of the end of 2009, our fixed rate long term debt included: $42 principal amount at maturity of 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes carried at $32; $900 of 5.3% Senior Notes carried at $899; and $1,100 of 5.5% Senior Notes carried at $1,096, and additional notes and capital lease obligations totaling $228. Additionally, our variable rate long term debt included a 0.35% over Yen Tibor (6 month) Term Loan of $32. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt and may affect the interest expense related to the variable rate debt. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report for more information on our long and short term debt. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Our foreign subsidiaries conduct limited transactions in their non functional currencies, which exposes us to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We manage these fluctuations, in part, through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts, seeking to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on known future expenditures denominated in a foreign currency. As of August 30, 2009, and August 31, 2008, we held forward foreign exchange contracts with a notional amount of $183 and $90, respectively, and a fair value liability of $2 and a fair value asset of $5, respectively, on the consolidated balance sheets. A hypothetical 10% strengthening of the functional currency compared to the non functional currency exchange rates at August 30, 2009 and August 31, 2008 would have decreased the fair value of the contracts by $18 and $10, respectively. 
 
Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) 2008 vs. 2007 SG&A expenses, as a percent of net sales, decreased 14 basis points compared to 2007. Excluding the unusual items affecting net sales and SG&A expenses in 2007, adjusted SG&A as a percentage of adjusted net sales was comparable to 2007. Warehouse operating and central administrative costs positively impacted adjusted SG&A comparisons, on a net basis, by approximately seven basis points, primarily due to decreased payroll and benefits costs as a percent of adjusted net sales. Stock based compensation expense negatively impacted adjusted SG&A comparisons by three basis points, primarily due to a higher closing stock price on the date that our October 2007 RSU grant was valued as compared to previous grants. Additionally, in 2008, we recorded a $16 reserve in connection with a litigation settlement and accrued approximately $9 for compensation adjustments we made to employees enrolled in our medical and dental plans related to a decision to share a portion of the health plans savings that we achieved. These two items negatively impacted adjusted SG&A comparisons by four basis points. Preopening Expenses 2009 2008 2007 Preopening expenses $ 41 $ 57 $ 55 Warehouse openings 19 34 30 Preopening expenses include costs incurred for startup operations related to new warehouses and the expansion of ancillary operations at existing warehouses. Preopening expenses can vary due to the timing of the opening relative to our year end, whether the warehouse is owned or leased, whether the opening is in an existing, new, or international market. The decline in 2009 is primarily attributable to fewer warehouse openings. Provision for Impaired Assets and Closing Costs, Net 2009 2008 2007 Warehouse closing expenses $ 9 $ 9 $ 16 Impairment of long lived assets 8 10 Net gains on the sale of real property (19 ) (2 ) Provision for impaired assets & closing costs, net $ 17 $ $ 14 This provision primarily includes costs related to impairment of long lived assets; future lease obligations of warehouses that have been closed or relocated to new facilities; accelerated depreciation, based on the shortened useful life through the expected closing date, on buildings to be demolished or sold and that are not otherwise impaired; and losses or gains resulting from the sale of real property, largely comprised of former warehouse locations. 2009 vs. 2008 The net provision for impaired assets and closing costs was a $17 in 2009, compared to a nominal amount in 2008. The provision in 2009 included charges of $9 for warehouse closing expenses, and impairment charges of $8, primarily related to the closing of our two Costco Home locations in July 2009. 25 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) 2008 vs. 2007 The net provision for impaired assets and closing costs was a nominal amount in 2008, compared to $14 in 2007. The provision in 2008 included charges of $9 for warehouse closing expenses, and impairment charges of $10, primarily related to a location in Michigan that was demolished and rebuilt. These charges were offset by $19 of net gain on the sale of real property, largely former warehouse locations. At the end of both 2009 and 2008, the reserve for warehouse closing costs was $5 and primarily related to future lease obligations. Interest Expense 2009 2008 2007 Interest expense $ 108 $ 103 $ 64 2009 vs. 2008 Interest expense primarily relates to our $900 of 5.3% and $1,100 of 5.5% Senior Notes (2007 Senior Notes) issued in 2007. The increase in interest expense is primarily due to a decrease in capitalized interest related to reduced new warehouse and remodel construction activity year over year. 2008 vs. 2007 The increase in interest expense resulted primarily from the issuance of our 2007 Senior Notes in February 2007, partially offset by lower interest expense resulting from the repayment in March 2007 of the $300 5.5% Senior Notes. Interest Income and Other 2009 2008 2007 Interest income $ 27 $ 96 $ 128 Earnings of affiliates 33 42 36 Minority interest and other (15 ) (5 ) 1 Interest Income and other $ 45 $ 133 $ 165 2009 vs. 2008 The decrease in interest income was largely due to lower interest rates, year over year, on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances resulting from a change in policy to invest primarily in U.S. government and agency securities, which earn a lower interest rate. In addition, we recognized $12 of other than temporary impairment losses on certain securities within our investment portfolio in 2009 compared to an impairment loss of $5 in 2008. See further discussion in Liquidity and Capital Resources. The decrease in the earnings of affiliates is primarily attributable to our investment in Costco Mexico (a 50% owned joint venture). Costco Mexicos earnings were lower in 2009, primarily due to the peso weakening against the U.S. dollar. The decrease in minority interest and other is primarily due to a negative $5 mark to market charge in 2009, compared to a $6 gain in 2008, related to our forward foreign exchange contracts. See the Derivatives section for more information. 26 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) 2008 vs. 2007 The decrease in interest income was largely due to lower interest rates, year over year, on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances. In addition, we recognized $5 of other than temporary impairment losses on certain securities within our investment portfolio. The increase in the earnings of affiliates is primarily attributable to our investment in Costco Mexico (a 50% owned joint venture). Provision for Income Taxes 2009 2008 2007 Income tax expense $ 628 $ 716 $ 627 Effective tax rate 36.7 % 35.8 % 36.7 % The lower tax rate in 2008 was primarily attributable to discrete benefits recognized during the year. Net Income 2009 2008 2007 Net income $ 1,086 $ 1,283 $ 1,083 Unusual items (net of tax) 119 Net income, as adjusted $ 1,086 $ 1,283 $ 1,202 Diluted earnings per share $ 2.47 $ 2.89 $ 2.37 Shares used to calculate diluted net income per common share (000s) 440,454 444,240 457,641 Diluted earnings per share (decrease) / increase (15 )% 22 % 3 % 2009 vs. 2008 Net income for 2009 decreased to $1,086, or $2.47 per diluted share, from $1,283, or $2.89 per diluted share, during 2008, representing a 15% decrease in diluted net income per share. As previously discussed, foreign currencies, particularly in Canada, the United Kingdom and Korea, weakened against the U.S. dollar, which negatively impacted net income for 2009 by approximately $83 after tax, or $0.19 per diluted share. Additionally, net income for 2009 was negatively impacted by a $34 pre tax charge, or approximately $0.05 per diluted share, related to a proposed litigation settlement concerning our membership renewal policy, as well as a $23 pre tax charge, or approximately $0.03 per diluted share, for an adjustment to the net realizable value of the cash surrender value of employee life insurance contracts. Net income for 2009 was positively impacted by a $32 pre tax, or $0.05 per diluted share, benefit due to the reversal of the LIFO reserve established in 2008. 2008 vs. 2007 Net income for 2008 increased to $1,283, or $2.89 per diluted share, from $1,083, or $2.37 per diluted share, during 2007. The unusual items previously discussed totaled $119, net of tax, or $0.26 per diluted share in 2007. Exclusive of these items, earnings in 2007 were $2.63 per diluted share. Net income per diluted share in 2008 represents an increase of 10% over this adjusted amount. During 2008, we repurchased and retired 13,812,000 shares of common stock, favorably impacting earnings per diluted share by approximately $0.03. 27 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The following table itemizes components of our most liquid assets at the end of 2009 and 2008 (dollars in millions, except per share data): 2009 2008 Cash and cash equivalents $ 3,157 $ 2,619 Short term investments 570 656 Total $ 3,727 $ 3,275 Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from warehouse operations and existing cash, cash equivalents, and short term investment balances, which were $3,727 and $3,275 at the end of 2009 and 2008, respectively. Of these balances, approximately $758 and $788 at the end of 2009 and 2008, respectively, represented debit and credit card receivables, primarily related to sales in the week prior to the end of the fiscal year. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $2,092 in 2009 compared to $2,206 in 2008, a decrease of approximately $114. This decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in net income of $197, partially offset by an increase in depreciation and amortization and stock based compensation of $90. Net cash used in investing activities totaled $1,101 in 2009 compared to $1,717 in 2008, a decrease of approximately $616. The decrease in investing activities relates primarily to a $349 decrease in cash used for additions to property and equipment related to warehouse expansion and remodel projects and a prior year reclassification of $371 of cash and cash equivalents to short term investments and other assets on our consolidated balance sheets, explained further below. These activities were partially offset by a decrease in cash provided by the net investment in short term investments of $62 as a result of less cash needed to fund our common stock repurchase activity as well as a decrease in cash proceeds from the sale of property and equipment of $41. In 2008, one of our enhanced money fund investments, Columbia Strategic Cash Portfolio Fund (Columbia), ceased accepting cash redemption requests and changed to a floating net asset value. In light of the restricted liquidity, we elected to receive a pro rata allocation of the underlying securities in a separately managed account. We assessed the fair value of these securities through market quotations and review of current investment ratings, as available, coupled with an evaluation of the liquidation value of each investment and its current performance in meeting scheduled payments of principal and interest. During 2009 and 2008, we recognized $12 and $5, respectively, of other than temporary impairment losses related to these securities. The losses are included in interest income and other in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. At August 30, 2009 and August 31, 2008, the balance of the Columbia fund was $27 and $104, respectively, on the consolidated balance sheets. In 2008, two other enhanced money fund investments, BlackRock Cash Strategies, LLC (BlackRock) and Merrill Lynch Capital Reserve Fund, LLC (Merrill Lynch), ceased accepting redemption requests and commenced liquidation. As of August 31, 2008, the balance of the BlackRock and Merrill Lynch funds was $82 and $43, respectively, on the consolidated balance sheets. During 2009, the remaining balances of these funds were liquidated. During 2008, we reclassified $371 of these three funds from cash and cash equivalents to short term investments and other assets. At August 30, 2009, $24 remained in short term investments and $3 28 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) remained in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets, reflecting the timing of the expected distributions. At August 31, 2008, $161 was in short term investments and $68 in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. The markets relating to these investments remain uncertain, and there may be further declines in the value of these investments that may cause additional losses in future periods. Net cash used in financing activities totaled $439 in 2009 compared to $643 in 2008. The $204 decrease in net cash used in financing activities primarily resulted from a reduction in the cash used to repurchase common stock of $826, partially offset by a decrease in the net proceeds from stock based awards and the excess tax benefit on share based awards of $276, a decrease in the net proceeds from short term borrowings of $195 as well as a decrease in the cash provided by the issuance of long term debt of $103. The effect of exchange rate changes, reflected in the consolidated statement of cash flows, decreased cash by $14 in 2009, compared to a decrease of $7 in 2008. This increase was due primarily to the significant weakening of the Canadian, Korean, and the United Kingdom currencies as compared to the U.S. dollar, during 2009. Dividends In April 2009, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash dividend from $0.16 to $0.18 per share or $0.72 on an annualized basis. Our quarterly cash dividends paid in 2009 totaled $0.68 per share. In 2008, we paid quarterly cash dividends totaling $0.61 per share. Contractual Obligations Our commitments at year end to make future payments under contractual obligations were as follows, as of August 30, 2009: Payments Due by Year Contractual obligations 2010 2011 to2012 2013 to2014 2015 andthereafter Total Purchase obligations (merchandise)(1) $ 3,539 $ 3,539 Long term debt(2) 186 1,120 126 1,432 2,864 Operating leases(3) 145 266 247 1,351 2,009 Purchase obligations (property, equipment, services and other)(4) 151 14 165 Construction Commitments 137 137 Capital lease obligations and other(2) 9 11 11 131 162 Other(5) 17 4 2 24 47 Total $ 4,184 $ 1,415 $ 386 $ 2,938 $ 8,923 (1) Includes open merchandise purchase orders. (2) Includes contractual interest payments. (3) Operating lease obligations exclude amounts commonly referred to as common area maintenance, taxes, and insurance and have been reduced by $163 to reflect sub lease income. (4) The amounts exclude certain services negotiated at the individual warehouse or regional level that are not significant and generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty. 29 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) (5) Consists of $24 in asset retirement obligations, $9 in deferred compensation obligations and includes $14 of current unrecognized tax benefits relating to uncertain tax positions. Amount excludes $16 of noncurrent unrecognized tax benefits due to uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash payments. Expansion Plans Our primary requirement for capital is the financing of land, building, and equipment costs for new and remodeled warehouses. Capital is also required for initial warehouse operations and working capital. While there can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized and plans are subject to change upon further review, it is our current intention to spend approximately $1,300 during fiscal 2010 for real estate, construction, remodeling, and equipment for warehouses and related operations. These expenditures are expected to be financed with a combination of cash provided from operations and existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. We plan to open approximately 16 to 18 new warehouses in 2010, including one to two relocations of existing warehouses to larger and better located facilities. Additional Equity Investments in Subsidiaries and Joint Ventures Our investments in the Costco Mexico joint venture and in other unconsolidated joint ventures that are less than majority owned are accounted for under the equity method. We did not make any capital contributions to our investment in Costco Mexico (a 50% owned joint venture) in 2009, 2008, or 2007. 30 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Bank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs (all amounts stated in millions, in U.S. dollars) Entity Credit FacilityDescription ExpirationDate Total ofall CreditFacilities Credit Line Usage atAugust 30, 2009 AvailableCredit ApplicableInterestRate Stand byLC &Letter ofGuaranty CommercialLetter ofCredit Short TermBorrowing U.S. Uncommitted Stand By Letter of Credit N/A $ 22 $ 22 $ $ $ N/A U.S. Uncommitted Commercial Letter of Credit N/A 50 20 30 N/A Australia(1) Guarantee Line N/A 8 8 N/A Canada(1) Multi Purpose Line March 10 28 18 10 1.76 % Japan(1) Revolving Credit February 10 37 8 29 0.64 % Japan(1) Bank Guaranty March 10 11 11 N/A Japan(1) Revolving Credit February 10 37 8 29 0.70 % Japan(2) Commercial Letter of Credit N/A 1 1 N/A Korea(1) Multi Purpose Line March 10 10 1 9 3.75 % Taiwan Multi Purpose Line January 10 15 4 11 2.50 % Taiwan Multi Purpose Line July 10 15 3 12 2.59 % United Kingdom Revolving Credit February 10 66 66 0.82 % United Kingdom Uncommitted Money Market Line N/A 33 33 3.05 % United Kingdom Uncommitted Overdraft Line N/A 49 49 1.50 % United Kingdom(2) Letter of Guarantee N/A 3 3 N/A United Kingdom Commercial Letter of Credit N/A 3 1 2 N/A TOTAL $ 388 $ 62 $ 21 $ 16 $ 289 (1) The U.S. parent company, Costco Wholesale Corporation, guarantees this entitys credit facility.

(3) The amount shown for short term borrowings under this facility is net of a note issue discount, which is excluded from the available credit amount. Note: We have credit facilities (for commercial and standby letters of credit) totaling $116 and $239 as of August 30, 2009 and August 31, 2008, respectively. The outstanding commitments under these facilities at August 30, 2009 and August 31, 2008, totaled $83 and $116, respectively, including $62 and $69, respectively, in standby letters of credit. For those entities with multi purpose lines, any issuance of either letters of credit (standby and or commercial) or short term borrowings will result in a corresponding decrease in available credit. 32 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Financing Activities In July 2009, we entered into a capital lease for a new warehouse building location and recorded a liability in the amount of $72, representing the net present value of $150 in aggregate future minimum lease payments at an imputed interest rate of 5.4%. This lease expires and becomes subject to a renewal clause in 2040. As of August 30, 2009, $71 is included in long term debt and $1 in the current portion of long term debt in our consolidated balance sheets. We have other minor capital lease obligations that amounted to $5 at the end of 2009 and 2008. In June 2008, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary entered into a ten year term loan in the amount of $32, with a variable rate of interest of Yen TIBOR (6 month) plus a 0.35% margin (0.95% and 1.24% at August 30, 2009 and August 31, 2008, respectively) on the outstanding balance. The net proceeds were used to repay the 1.187% Promissory Notes due in July 2008 and for general corporate purposes. Interest is payable semi annually in December and June and principal is due in June 2018. In October 2007, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes through a private placement in the amount of $69, bearing interest at 2.695%. Interest is payable semi annually, and principal is due in October 2017. The proceeds were used to repay the 2.07% Promissory Notes in October 2007 and for general corporate purposes. In February 2007, we issued $900 of 5.3% Senior Notes due March 15, 2012 at a discount of $2 and $1,100 of 5.5% Senior Notes due March 15, 2017 at a discount of $6 (together, the 2007 Senior Notes). Interest on the 2007 Senior Notes is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The discount and issuance costs associated with the 2007 Senior Notes are being amortized to interest expense over the terms of those notes. At our option, we may redeem the 2007 Senior Notes at any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount of the 2007 Senior Notes to be redeemed, or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, we will be required to make an offer to purchase the 2007 Senior Notes at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase, upon certain events as defined by the terms of the 2007 Senior Notes. In April 2003, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.92% in the amount of $43, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due in April 2010. In November 2002, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.88% in the aggregate amount of $32, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due in November 2009. The U.S. parent company, Costco Wholesale Corporation guarantees all of the promissory notes issued by our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary. In August 1997, we sold $900 principal amount at maturity 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes (Zero Coupon Notes) due in August 2017. The Zero Coupon Notes were priced with a yield to maturity of 3.5%, resulting in gross proceeds of $450. The current Zero Coupon Notes outstanding are convertible into a maximum of 961,000 shares of Costco Common Stock shares at an initial conversion price of $22.71. Holders of the Zero Coupon Notes may require us to purchase the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of purchase) in August 2012. At our option, we may redeem the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of redemption) any time after August 2002. As of August 30, 2009, $858 in principal amount of the Zero Coupon Notes had been converted by note holders to shares of Costco Common Stock, of which $25, $1, and $61 in principal were converted in 2009, 2008, and 2007 respectively, or 33 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) $19 and $42 in 2009 and 2007, respectively, after factoring in the related debt discount. In 2008, the conversion of principle for Zero Coupon Notes after factoring the related debt discount was not significant. Derivatives Effective November 24, 2008, we adopted the disclosure requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities an Amendment of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 133 (SFAS 161). We follow SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (as amended) (SFAS 133), in accounting for derivative and hedging activities. We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in the normal course of our business, which we manage in part through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts, seeking to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on known future expenditures denominated in a foreign currency. The forward foreign exchange contracts are entered into primarily to hedge U.S. dollar merchandise inventory expenditures. Currently, these instruments do not qualify for derivative hedge accounting. We use these instruments to mitigate risk and do not intend to engage in speculative transactions. These contracts do not contain any credit risk related contingent features. We seek to manage the counterparty risk associated with these forward foreign exchange contracts by limiting transactions to counterparties with which we have established banking relationships. There can be no assurance, however, that this effectively mitigates counterparty risk. In addition, the contracts are limited to a time period of less than one year. See Note 1 and Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report, for additional information related to these contracts. We are exposed to risks due to fluctuations in energy prices, particularly electricity and natural gas, which we seek to partially mitigate through the use of fixed price contracts with counterparties for approximately 24% of our warehouses and other facilities in the U.S. and Canada. We also enter into variable priced contracts for some purchases of natural gas and fuel for our gas stations on an index basis. These contracts qualify for treatment as normal purchase or normal sales under SFAS 133 and require no mark to market adjustment. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements With the exception of our operating leases, we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition or consolidated financial statements. Stock Repurchase Programs In September and November of 2007, our Board of Directors approved $300 and $1,000, respectively, of stock repurchases, which expire in August 2010 and November 2010, respectively. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an additional $1,000, which expires in July 2011, bringing total authorizations by our Board of Directors since inception of the program in 2001 to $6,800. During 2009, we repurchased 895,000 shares at an average price of $63.84 per share totaling approximately $57. During 2008, we repurchased 13,812,000 shares of common stock, at an average price of $64.22 per share, totaling approximately $887. The remaining amount available to be purchased under 34 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) our approved plan was $2,002 at the end of 2009. Purchases are made from time to time as conditions warrant in the open market or in block purchases, and pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5 1. Repurchased shares are retired, in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments. We continue to review our accounting policies and evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, investments, merchandise inventory valuation, impairment of long lived assets, warehouse closing costs, insurance/self insurance liabilities, and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. Revenue Recognition We generally recognize sales, net of estimated returns, at the time the member takes possession of merchandise or receives services. When we collect payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services, the amount received is generally recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed. We provide for estimated sales returns based on historical trends in merchandise returns. Amounts collected from members, which under common trade practices are referred to as sales taxes, are recorded on a net basis. We evaluate the criteria of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal Versus Net as an Agent, in determining whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, when we are the primary obligor, subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, influence product or service specifications, or have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded on a gross basis. If we are not the primary obligor and do not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above, we record the net amounts as commissions earned, which is reflected in net sales. Membership fee revenue represents annual membership fees paid by substantially all of our members. We account for membership fee revenue on a deferred basis, whereby revenue is recognized ratably over the one year membership period. Our Executive members qualify for a 2% reward (which can be redeemed only at Costco warehouses), up to a maximum of $500 per year, on all qualified purchases made at Costco. We account for this 2% reward as a reduction in sales, with the related liability being classified within other current liabilities. The sales reduction and corresponding liability are computed after giving effect to the estimated impact of non redemptions based on historical data. Investments Investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other than temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and our intent and ability to hold the investment. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the issuer, including industry and sector performance, 35 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) operational and financing cash flow factors, and rating agency actions. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and or issuer conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments. Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, as determined primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting, and are stated using the last in, first out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all other foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail inventory method of accounting and are stated using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. We believe the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. We record an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the expected annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end. At the end of 2008, due to overall net inflationary trends, merchandise inventories valued at LIFO were lower than the FIFO value, resulting in a $32 charge to merchandise costs. During 2009, due to overall deflationary trends, we recorded a $32 benefit to merchandise costs to adjust inventories valued at LIFO. At the end of 2009 and 2007, merchandise inventories valued at LIFO approximated FIFO after considering the lower of cost or market principle. We provide for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts as a percentage of net sales. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect results of the actual physical inventory counts, which generally occur in the second and fourth quarters of the year. Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as we progress toward earning those rebates, provided they are probable and reasonably estimable. Other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of agreement, or other systematic and rational approaches. Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Warehouse Closing costs We periodically evaluate our long lived assets for indicators of impairment, such as a decision to relocate or close a warehouse location. Our judgments are based on existing market and operational conditions. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring a downward adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value. We provide estimates for warehouse closing costs for both leased and owned locations to be closed or relocated. A considerable amount of judgment is involved in determining any impairment or our net liability, particularly related to the estimated sales price of owned locations and the potential sublease income at leased locations. These estimates are based on real estate conditions in the markets and our experience in those markets. We make assumptions about the average period of time it would take to sublease the location and the amount of potential sublease income for each leased location. We reassess our liability each quarter and adjust our liability accordingly when our estimates change. Insurance/Self Insurance Liabilities We use a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance pool, to provide for potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property damage, director and officers liability, vehicle liability, and 36 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Income Taxes We adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48), which sets out criteria for the use of judgment in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items, at the beginning of 2008. The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Significant judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions. The benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in our consolidated financial statements only after determining a more likely than not probability that the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge, if any, from tax authorities. When facts and circumstances change, we reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the consolidated financial statements as appropriate. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See discussion of Recent Accounting Pronouncements in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report. Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to financial market risk resulting from fluctuations in interest and foreign currency exchange rates. We do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions, nor hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. The current condition of the financial markets, however, has rendered identifiable risks less predictable, and liquidity concerns and credit risks have increased. Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment holdings that are diversified amongst money market funds, debt securities, corporate notes and bonds, and enhanced money funds with effective maturities of generally three months to five years at the date of purchase. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while continuing to generate yields. A revised investment policy was approved in December 2007 by our Board of Directors, limiting future investments to direct U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations, repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations, and U.S. Government and Government Agency Money Market funds. The investment policies of our subsidiaries are consistent with our primary objective to preserve principal while continuing to generate yields. Our wholly owned insurance subsidiary invests in U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations, corporate notes and bonds, and asset and mortgage backed securities with a minimum overall portfolio average credit rating of AA. All of our foreign subsidiaries investments are primarily in money market funds, investment grade securities, bankers acceptances, bank certificates of deposit and term deposits, all denominated in their local currencies. Additionally, our Canadian subsidiary may invest a portion of its investments in U.S. dollar investment grade securities and bank term deposits to meet current U.S. dollar obligations. 37 Table of Contents Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) All of the investment policies of the Company and subsidiaries are reviewed at least annually. Because most of our investments in cash and cash equivalents are of a short term nature, if interest rates were to increase or decrease, the impact would likely be immaterial to our financial statements. Based on our overnight investments and bank balances within cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2009 and 2008, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $24 and $18 (pre tax), respectively, to interest income on an annual basis. For those investments that are classified as available for sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in market volatility and interest rates are reflected within stockholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive income. The nature and amount of our long and short term debt may vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As of the end of 2009, our fixed rate long term debt included: $42 principal amount at maturity of 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes carried at $32; $900 of 5.3% Senior Notes carried at $899; and $1,100 of 5.5% Senior Notes carried at $1,096, and additional notes and capital lease obligations totaling $228. Additionally, our variable rate long term debt included a 0.35% over Yen Tibor (6 month) Term Loan of $32. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt and may affect the interest expense related to the variable rate debt. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report for more information on our long and short term debt. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Our foreign subsidiaries conduct limited transactions in their non functional currencies, which exposes us to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We manage these fluctuations, in part, through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts, seeking to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on known future expenditures denominated in a foreign currency. As of August 30, 2009, and August 31, 2008, we held forward foreign exchange contracts with a notional amount of $183 and $90, respectively, and a fair value liability of $2 and a fair value asset of $5, respectively, on the consolidated balance sheets. A hypothetical 10% strengthening of the functional currency compared to the non functional currency exchange rates at August 30, 2009 and August 31, 2008 would have decreased the fair value of the contracts by $18 and $10, respectively. 
 
Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) 2008 vs. 2007 The net provision for impaired assets and closing costs was a nominal amount in 2008, compared to $14 in 2007. The provision in 2008 included charges of $9 for warehouse closing expenses, and impairment charges of $10, primarily related to a location in Michigan that was demolished and rebuilt. These charges were offset by $19 of net gain on the sale of real property, largely former warehouse locations. At the end of both 2009 and 2008, the reserve for warehouse closing costs was $5 and primarily related to future lease obligations. Interest Expense 2009 2008 2007 Interest expense $ 108 $ 103 $ 64 2009 vs. 2008 Interest expense primarily relates to our $900 of 5.3% and $1,100 of 5.5% Senior Notes (2007 Senior Notes) issued in 2007. The increase in interest expense is primarily due to a decrease in capitalized interest related to reduced new warehouse and remodel construction activity year over year. 2008 vs. 2007 The increase in interest expense resulted primarily from the issuance of our 2007 Senior Notes in February 2007, partially offset by lower interest expense resulting from the repayment in March 2007 of the $300 5.5% Senior Notes. Interest Income and Other 2009 2008 2007 Interest income $ 27 $ 96 $ 128 Earnings of affiliates 33 42 36 Minority interest and other (15 ) (5 ) 1 Interest Income and other $ 45 $ 133 $ 165 2009 vs. 2008 The decrease in interest income was largely due to lower interest rates, year over year, on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances resulting from a change in policy to invest primarily in U.S. government and agency securities, which earn a lower interest rate. In addition, we recognized $12 of other than temporary impairment losses on certain securities within our investment portfolio in 2009 compared to an impairment loss of $5 in 2008. See further discussion in Liquidity and Capital Resources. The decrease in the earnings of affiliates is primarily attributable to our investment in Costco Mexico (a 50% owned joint venture). Costco Mexicos earnings were lower in 2009, primarily due to the peso weakening against the U.S. dollar. The decrease in minority interest and other is primarily due to a negative $5 mark to market charge in 2009, compared to a $6 gain in 2008, related to our forward foreign exchange contracts. See the Derivatives section for more information. 26 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) 2008 vs. 2007 The decrease in interest income was largely due to lower interest rates, year over year, on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances. In addition, we recognized $5 of other than temporary impairment losses on certain securities within our investment portfolio. The increase in the earnings of affiliates is primarily attributable to our investment in Costco Mexico (a 50% owned joint venture). Provision for Income Taxes 2009 2008 2007 Income tax expense $ 628 $ 716 $ 627 Effective tax rate 36.7 % 35.8 % 36.7 % The lower tax rate in 2008 was primarily attributable to discrete benefits recognized during the year. Net Income 2009 2008 2007 Net income $ 1,086 $ 1,283 $ 1,083 Unusual items (net of tax) 119 Net income, as adjusted $ 1,086 $ 1,283 $ 1,202 Diluted earnings per share $ 2.47 $ 2.89 $ 2.37 Shares used to calculate diluted net income per common share (000s) 440,454 444,240 457,641 Diluted earnings per share (decrease) / increase (15 )% 22 % 3 % 2009 vs. 2008 Net income for 2009 decreased to $1,086, or $2.47 per diluted share, from $1,283, or $2.89 per diluted share, during 2008, representing a 15% decrease in diluted net income per share. As previously discussed, foreign currencies, particularly in Canada, the United Kingdom and Korea, weakened against the U.S. dollar, which negatively impacted net income for 2009 by approximately $83 after tax, or $0.19 per diluted share. Additionally, net income for 2009 was negatively impacted by a $34 pre tax charge, or approximately $0.05 per diluted share, related to a proposed litigation settlement concerning our membership renewal policy, as well as a $23 pre tax charge, or approximately $0.03 per diluted share, for an adjustment to the net realizable value of the cash surrender value of employee life insurance contracts. Net income for 2009 was positively impacted by a $32 pre tax, or $0.05 per diluted share, benefit due to the reversal of the LIFO reserve established in 2008. 2008 vs. 2007 Net income for 2008 increased to $1,283, or $2.89 per diluted share, from $1,083, or $2.37 per diluted share, during 2007. The unusual items previously discussed totaled $119, net of tax, or $0.26 per diluted share in 2007. Exclusive of these items, earnings in 2007 were $2.63 per diluted share. Net income per diluted share in 2008 represents an increase of 10% over this adjusted amount. During 2008, we repurchased and retired 13,812,000 shares of common stock, favorably impacting earnings per diluted share by approximately $0.03. 27 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The following table itemizes components of our most liquid assets at the end of 2009 and 2008 (dollars in millions, except per share data): 2009 2008 Cash and cash equivalents $ 3,157 $ 2,619 Short term investments 570 656 Total $ 3,727 $ 3,275 Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from warehouse operations and existing cash, cash equivalents, and short term investment balances, which were $3,727 and $3,275 at the end of 2009 and 2008, respectively. Of these balances, approximately $758 and $788 at the end of 2009 and 2008, respectively, represented debit and credit card receivables, primarily related to sales in the week prior to the end of the fiscal year. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $2,092 in 2009 compared to $2,206 in 2008, a decrease of approximately $114. This decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in net income of $197, partially offset by an increase in depreciation and amortization and stock based compensation of $90. Net cash used in investing activities totaled $1,101 in 2009 compared to $1,717 in 2008, a decrease of approximately $616. The decrease in investing activities relates primarily to a $349 decrease in cash used for additions to property and equipment related to warehouse expansion and remodel projects and a prior year reclassification of $371 of cash and cash equivalents to short term investments and other assets on our consolidated balance sheets, explained further below. These activities were partially offset by a decrease in cash provided by the net investment in short term investments of $62 as a result of less cash needed to fund our common stock repurchase activity as well as a decrease in cash proceeds from the sale of property and equipment of $41. In 2008, one of our enhanced money fund investments, Columbia Strategic Cash Portfolio Fund (Columbia), ceased accepting cash redemption requests and changed to a floating net asset value. In light of the restricted liquidity, we elected to receive a pro rata allocation of the underlying securities in a separately managed account. We assessed the fair value of these securities through market quotations and review of current investment ratings, as available, coupled with an evaluation of the liquidation value of each investment and its current performance in meeting scheduled payments of principal and interest. During 2009 and 2008, we recognized $12 and $5, respectively, of other than temporary impairment losses related to these securities. The losses are included in interest income and other in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. At August 30, 2009 and August 31, 2008, the balance of the Columbia fund was $27 and $104, respectively, on the consolidated balance sheets. In 2008, two other enhanced money fund investments, BlackRock Cash Strategies, LLC (BlackRock) and Merrill Lynch Capital Reserve Fund, LLC (Merrill Lynch), ceased accepting redemption requests and commenced liquidation. As of August 31, 2008, the balance of the BlackRock and Merrill Lynch funds was $82 and $43, respectively, on the consolidated balance sheets. During 2009, the remaining balances of these funds were liquidated. During 2008, we reclassified $371 of these three funds from cash and cash equivalents to short term investments and other assets. At August 30, 2009, $24 remained in short term investments and $3 28 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) remained in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets, reflecting the timing of the expected distributions. At August 31, 2008, $161 was in short term investments and $68 in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. The markets relating to these investments remain uncertain, and there may be further declines in the value of these investments that may cause additional losses in future periods. Net cash used in financing activities totaled $439 in 2009 compared to $643 in 2008. The $204 decrease in net cash used in financing activities primarily resulted from a reduction in the cash used to repurchase common stock of $826, partially offset by a decrease in the net proceeds from stock based awards and the excess tax benefit on share based awards of $276, a decrease in the net proceeds from short term borrowings of $195 as well as a decrease in the cash provided by the issuance of long term debt of $103. The effect of exchange rate changes, reflected in the consolidated statement of cash flows, decreased cash by $14 in 2009, compared to a decrease of $7 in 2008. This increase was due primarily to the significant weakening of the Canadian, Korean, and the United Kingdom currencies as compared to the U.S. dollar, during 2009. Dividends In April 2009, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash dividend from $0.16 to $0.18 per share or $0.72 on an annualized basis. Our quarterly cash dividends paid in 2009 totaled $0.68 per share. In 2008, we paid quarterly cash dividends totaling $0.61 per share. Contractual Obligations Our commitments at year end to make future payments under contractual obligations were as follows, as of August 30, 2009: Payments Due by Year Contractual obligations 2010 2011 to2012 2013 to2014 2015 andthereafter Total Purchase obligations (merchandise)(1) $ 3,539 $ 3,539 Long term debt(2) 186 1,120 126 1,432 2,864 Operating leases(3) 145 266 247 1,351 2,009 Purchase obligations (property, equipment, services and other)(4) 151 14 165 Construction Commitments 137 137 Capital lease obligations and other(2) 9 11 11 131 162 Other(5) 17 4 2 24 47 Total $ 4,184 $ 1,415 $ 386 $ 2,938 $ 8,923 (1) Includes open merchandise purchase orders. (2) Includes contractual interest payments. (3) Operating lease obligations exclude amounts commonly referred to as common area maintenance, taxes, and insurance and have been reduced by $163 to reflect sub lease income. (4) The amounts exclude certain services negotiated at the individual warehouse or regional level that are not significant and generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty. 29 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) (5) Consists of $24 in asset retirement obligations, $9 in deferred compensation obligations and includes $14 of current unrecognized tax benefits relating to uncertain tax positions. Amount excludes $16 of noncurrent unrecognized tax benefits due to uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash payments. Expansion Plans Our primary requirement for capital is the financing of land, building, and equipment costs for new and remodeled warehouses. Capital is also required for initial warehouse operations and working capital. While there can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized and plans are subject to change upon further review, it is our current intention to spend approximately $1,300 during fiscal 2010 for real estate, construction, remodeling, and equipment for warehouses and related operations. These expenditures are expected to be financed with a combination of cash provided from operations and existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. We plan to open approximately 16 to 18 new warehouses in 2010, including one to two relocations of existing warehouses to larger and better located facilities. Additional Equity Investments in Subsidiaries and Joint Ventures Our investments in the Costco Mexico joint venture and in other unconsolidated joint ventures that are less than majority owned are accounted for under the equity method. We did not make any capital contributions to our investment in Costco Mexico (a 50% owned joint venture) in 2009, 2008, or 2007. 30 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Bank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs (all amounts stated in millions, in U.S. dollars) Entity Credit FacilityDescription ExpirationDate Total ofall CreditFacilities Credit Line Usage atAugust 30, 2009 AvailableCredit ApplicableInterestRate Stand byLC &Letter ofGuaranty CommercialLetter ofCredit Short TermBorrowing U.S. Uncommitted Stand By Letter of Credit N/A $ 22 $ 22 $ $ $ N/A U.S. Uncommitted Commercial Letter of Credit N/A 50 20 30 N/A Australia(1) Guarantee Line N/A 8 8 N/A Canada(1) Multi Purpose Line March 10 28 18 10 1.76 % Japan(1) Revolving Credit February 10 37 8 29 0.64 % Japan(1) Bank Guaranty March 10 11 11 N/A Japan(1) Revolving Credit February 10 37 8 29 0.70 % Japan(2) Commercial Letter of Credit N/A 1 1 N/A Korea(1) Multi Purpose Line March 10 10 1 9 3.75 % Taiwan Multi Purpose Line January 10 15 4 11 2.50 % Taiwan Multi Purpose Line July 10 15 3 12 2.59 % United Kingdom Revolving Credit February 10 66 66 0.82 % United Kingdom Uncommitted Money Market Line N/A 33 33 3.05 % United Kingdom Uncommitted Overdraft Line N/A 49 49 1.50 % United Kingdom(2) Letter of Guarantee N/A 3 3 N/A United Kingdom Commercial Letter of Credit N/A 3 1 2 N/A TOTAL $ 388 $ 62 $ 21 $ 16 $ 289 (1) The U.S. parent company, Costco Wholesale Corporation, guarantees this entitys credit facility.

Note: We have credit facilities (for commercial and standby letters of credit) totaling $116 and $239 as of August 30, 2009 and August 31, 2008, respectively. The outstanding commitments under these facilities at August 30, 2009 and August 31, 2008, totaled $83 and $116, respectively, including $62 and $69, respectively, in standby letters of credit. For those entities with multi purpose lines, any issuance of either letters of credit (standby and or commercial) or short term borrowings will result in a corresponding decrease in available credit. 32 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Financing Activities In July 2009, we entered into a capital lease for a new warehouse building location and recorded a liability in the amount of $72, representing the net present value of $150 in aggregate future minimum lease payments at an imputed interest rate of 5.4%. This lease expires and becomes subject to a renewal clause in 2040. As of August 30, 2009, $71 is included in long term debt and $1 in the current portion of long term debt in our consolidated balance sheets. We have other minor capital lease obligations that amounted to $5 at the end of 2009 and 2008. In June 2008, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary entered into a ten year term loan in the amount of $32, with a variable rate of interest of Yen TIBOR (6 month) plus a 0.35% margin (0.95% and 1.24% at August 30, 2009 and August 31, 2008, respectively) on the outstanding balance. The net proceeds were used to repay the 1.187% Promissory Notes due in July 2008 and for general corporate purposes. Interest is payable semi annually in December and June and principal is due in June 2018. In October 2007, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes through a private placement in the amount of $69, bearing interest at 2.695%. Interest is payable semi annually, and principal is due in October 2017. The proceeds were used to repay the 2.07% Promissory Notes in October 2007 and for general corporate purposes. In February 2007, we issued $900 of 5.3% Senior Notes due March 15, 2012 at a discount of $2 and $1,100 of 5.5% Senior Notes due March 15, 2017 at a discount of $6 (together, the 2007 Senior Notes). Interest on the 2007 Senior Notes is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The discount and issuance costs associated with the 2007 Senior Notes are being amortized to interest expense over the terms of those notes. At our option, we may redeem the 2007 Senior Notes at any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount of the 2007 Senior Notes to be redeemed, or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, we will be required to make an offer to purchase the 2007 Senior Notes at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase, upon certain events as defined by the terms of the 2007 Senior Notes. In April 2003, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.92% in the amount of $43, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due in April 2010. In November 2002, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.88% in the aggregate amount of $32, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due in November 2009. The U.S. parent company, Costco Wholesale Corporation guarantees all of the promissory notes issued by our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary. In August 1997, we sold $900 principal amount at maturity 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes (Zero Coupon Notes) due in August 2017. The Zero Coupon Notes were priced with a yield to maturity of 3.5%, resulting in gross proceeds of $450. The current Zero Coupon Notes outstanding are convertible into a maximum of 961,000 shares of Costco Common Stock shares at an initial conversion price of $22.71. Holders of the Zero Coupon Notes may require us to purchase the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of purchase) in August 2012. At our option, we may redeem the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of redemption) any time after August 2002. As of August 30, 2009, $858 in principal amount of the Zero Coupon Notes had been converted by note holders to shares of Costco Common Stock, of which $25, $1, and $61 in principal were converted in 2009, 2008, and 2007 respectively, or 33 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) $19 and $42 in 2009 and 2007, respectively, after factoring in the related debt discount. In 2008, the conversion of principle for Zero Coupon Notes after factoring the related debt discount was not significant. Derivatives Effective November 24, 2008, we adopted the disclosure requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities an Amendment of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 133 (SFAS 161). We follow SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (as amended) (SFAS 133), in accounting for derivative and hedging activities. We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in the normal course of our business, which we manage in part through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts, seeking to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on known future expenditures denominated in a foreign currency. The forward foreign exchange contracts are entered into primarily to hedge U.S. dollar merchandise inventory expenditures. Currently, these instruments do not qualify for derivative hedge accounting. We use these instruments to mitigate risk and do not intend to engage in speculative transactions. These contracts do not contain any credit risk related contingent features. We seek to manage the counterparty risk associated with these forward foreign exchange contracts by limiting transactions to counterparties with which we have established banking relationships. There can be no assurance, however, that this effectively mitigates counterparty risk. In addition, the contracts are limited to a time period of less than one year. See Note 1 and Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report, for additional information related to these contracts. We are exposed to risks due to fluctuations in energy prices, particularly electricity and natural gas, which we seek to partially mitigate through the use of fixed price contracts with counterparties for approximately 24% of our warehouses and other facilities in the U.S. and Canada. We also enter into variable priced contracts for some purchases of natural gas and fuel for our gas stations on an index basis. These contracts qualify for treatment as normal purchase or normal sales under SFAS 133 and require no mark to market adjustment. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements With the exception of our operating leases, we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition or consolidated financial statements. Stock Repurchase Programs In September and November of 2007, our Board of Directors approved $300 and $1,000, respectively, of stock repurchases, which expire in August 2010 and November 2010, respectively. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an additional $1,000, which expires in July 2011, bringing total authorizations by our Board of Directors since inception of the program in 2001 to $6,800. During 2009, we repurchased 895,000 shares at an average price of $63.84 per share totaling approximately $57. During 2008, we repurchased 13,812,000 shares of common stock, at an average price of $64.22 per share, totaling approximately $887. The remaining amount available to be purchased under 34 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) our approved plan was $2,002 at the end of 2009. Purchases are made from time to time as conditions warrant in the open market or in block purchases, and pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5 1. Repurchased shares are retired, in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments. We continue to review our accounting policies and evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, investments, merchandise inventory valuation, impairment of long lived assets, warehouse closing costs, insurance/self insurance liabilities, and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. Revenue Recognition We generally recognize sales, net of estimated returns, at the time the member takes possession of merchandise or receives services. When we collect payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services, the amount received is generally recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed. We provide for estimated sales returns based on historical trends in merchandise returns. Amounts collected from members, which under common trade practices are referred to as sales taxes, are recorded on a net basis. We evaluate the criteria of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal Versus Net as an Agent, in determining whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, when we are the primary obligor, subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, influence product or service specifications, or have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded on a gross basis. If we are not the primary obligor and do not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above, we record the net amounts as commissions earned, which is reflected in net sales. Membership fee revenue represents annual membership fees paid by substantially all of our members. We account for membership fee revenue on a deferred basis, whereby revenue is recognized ratably over the one year membership period. Our Executive members qualify for a 2% reward (which can be redeemed only at Costco warehouses), up to a maximum of $500 per year, on all qualified purchases made at Costco. We account for this 2% reward as a reduction in sales, with the related liability being classified within other current liabilities. The sales reduction and corresponding liability are computed after giving effect to the estimated impact of non redemptions based on historical data. Investments Investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other than temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and our intent and ability to hold the investment. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the issuer, including industry and sector performance, 35 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) operational and financing cash flow factors, and rating agency actions. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and or issuer conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments. Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, as determined primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting, and are stated using the last in, first out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all other foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail inventory method of accounting and are stated using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. We believe the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. We record an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the expected annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end. At the end of 2008, due to overall net inflationary trends, merchandise inventories valued at LIFO were lower than the FIFO value, resulting in a $32 charge to merchandise costs. During 2009, due to overall deflationary trends, we recorded a $32 benefit to merchandise costs to adjust inventories valued at LIFO. At the end of 2009 and 2007, merchandise inventories valued at LIFO approximated FIFO after considering the lower of cost or market principle. We provide for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts as a percentage of net sales. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect results of the actual physical inventory counts, which generally occur in the second and fourth quarters of the year. Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as we progress toward earning those rebates, provided they are probable and reasonably estimable. Other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of agreement, or other systematic and rational approaches. Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Warehouse Closing costs We periodically evaluate our long lived assets for indicators of impairment, such as a decision to relocate or close a warehouse location. Our judgments are based on existing market and operational conditions. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring a downward adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value. We provide estimates for warehouse closing costs for both leased and owned locations to be closed or relocated. A considerable amount of judgment is involved in determining any impairment or our net liability, particularly related to the estimated sales price of owned locations and the potential sublease income at leased locations. These estimates are based on real estate conditions in the markets and our experience in those markets. We make assumptions about the average period of time it would take to sublease the location and the amount of potential sublease income for each leased location. We reassess our liability each quarter and adjust our liability accordingly when our estimates change. Insurance/Self Insurance Liabilities We use a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance pool, to provide for potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property damage, director and officers liability, vehicle liability, and 36 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Income Taxes We adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48), which sets out criteria for the use of judgment in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items, at the beginning of 2008. The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Significant judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions. The benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in our consolidated financial statements only after determining a more likely than not probability that the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge, if any, from tax authorities. When facts and circumstances change, we reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the consolidated financial statements as appropriate. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See discussion of Recent Accounting Pronouncements in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report. Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to financial market risk resulting from fluctuations in interest and foreign currency exchange rates. We do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions, nor hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. The current condition of the financial markets, however, has rendered identifiable risks less predictable, and liquidity concerns and credit risks have increased. Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment holdings that are diversified amongst money market funds, debt securities, corporate notes and bonds, and enhanced money funds with effective maturities of generally three months to five years at the date of purchase. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while continuing to generate yields. A revised investment policy was approved in December 2007 by our Board of Directors, limiting future investments to direct U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations, repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations, and U.S. Government and Government Agency Money Market funds. The investment policies of our subsidiaries are consistent with our primary objective to preserve principal while continuing to generate yields. Our wholly owned insurance subsidiary invests in U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations, corporate notes and bonds, and asset and mortgage backed securities with a minimum overall portfolio average credit rating of AA. All of our foreign subsidiaries investments are primarily in money market funds, investment grade securities, bankers acceptances, bank certificates of deposit and term deposits, all denominated in their local currencies. Additionally, our Canadian subsidiary may invest a portion of its investments in U.S. dollar investment grade securities and bank term deposits to meet current U.S. dollar obligations. 37 Table of Contents Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) All of the investment policies of the Company and subsidiaries are reviewed at least annually. Because most of our investments in cash and cash equivalents are of a short term nature, if interest rates were to increase or decrease, the impact would likely be immaterial to our financial statements. Based on our overnight investments and bank balances within cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2009 and 2008, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $24 and $18 (pre tax), respectively, to interest income on an annual basis. For those investments that are classified as available for sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in market volatility and interest rates are reflected within stockholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive income. The nature and amount of our long and short term debt may vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As of the end of 2009, our fixed rate long term debt included: $42 principal amount at maturity of 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes carried at $32; $900 of 5.3% Senior Notes carried at $899; and $1,100 of 5.5% Senior Notes carried at $1,096, and additional notes and capital lease obligations totaling $228. Additionally, our variable rate long term debt included a 0.35% over Yen Tibor (6 month) Term Loan of $32. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt and may affect the interest expense related to the variable rate debt. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report for more information on our long and short term debt. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Our foreign subsidiaries conduct limited transactions in their non functional currencies, which exposes us to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We manage these fluctuations, in part, through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts, seeking to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on known future expenditures denominated in a foreign currency. As of August 30, 2009, and August 31, 2008, we held forward foreign exchange contracts with a notional amount of $183 and $90, respectively, and a fair value liability of $2 and a fair value asset of $5, respectively, on the consolidated balance sheets. A hypothetical 10% strengthening of the functional currency compared to the non functional currency exchange rates at August 30, 2009 and August 31, 2008 would have decreased the fair value of the contracts by $18 and $10, respectively. 
 
Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) 2008 vs. 2007 The decrease in interest income was largely due to lower interest rates, year over year, on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances. In addition, we recognized $5 of other than temporary impairment losses on certain securities within our investment portfolio. The increase in the earnings of affiliates is primarily attributable to our investment in Costco Mexico (a 50% owned joint venture). Provision for Income Taxes 2009 2008 2007 Income tax expense $ 628 $ 716 $ 627 Effective tax rate 36.7 % 35.8 % 36.7 % The lower tax rate in 2008 was primarily attributable to discrete benefits recognized during the year. Net Income 2009 2008 2007 Net income $ 1,086 $ 1,283 $ 1,083 Unusual items (net of tax) 119 Net income, as adjusted $ 1,086 $ 1,283 $ 1,202 Diluted earnings per share $ 2.47 $ 2.89 $ 2.37 Shares used to calculate diluted net income per common share (000s) 440,454 444,240 457,641 Diluted earnings per share (decrease) / increase (15 )% 22 % 3 % 2009 vs. 2008 Net income for 2009 decreased to $1,086, or $2.47 per diluted share, from $1,283, or $2.89 per diluted share, during 2008, representing a 15% decrease in diluted net income per share. As previously discussed, foreign currencies, particularly in Canada, the United Kingdom and Korea, weakened against the U.S. dollar, which negatively impacted net income for 2009 by approximately $83 after tax, or $0.19 per diluted share. Additionally, net income for 2009 was negatively impacted by a $34 pre tax charge, or approximately $0.05 per diluted share, related to a proposed litigation settlement concerning our membership renewal policy, as well as a $23 pre tax charge, or approximately $0.03 per diluted share, for an adjustment to the net realizable value of the cash surrender value of employee life insurance contracts. Net income for 2009 was positively impacted by a $32 pre tax, or $0.05 per diluted share, benefit due to the reversal of the LIFO reserve established in 2008. 2008 vs. 2007 Net income for 2008 increased to $1,283, or $2.89 per diluted share, from $1,083, or $2.37 per diluted share, during 2007. The unusual items previously discussed totaled $119, net of tax, or $0.26 per diluted share in 2007. Exclusive of these items, earnings in 2007 were $2.63 per diluted share. Net income per diluted share in 2008 represents an increase of 10% over this adjusted amount. During 2008, we repurchased and retired 13,812,000 shares of common stock, favorably impacting earnings per diluted share by approximately $0.03. 27 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The following table itemizes components of our most liquid assets at the end of 2009 and 2008 (dollars in millions, except per share data): 2009 2008 Cash and cash equivalents $ 3,157 $ 2,619 Short term investments 570 656 Total $ 3,727 $ 3,275 Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from warehouse operations and existing cash, cash equivalents, and short term investment balances, which were $3,727 and $3,275 at the end of 2009 and 2008, respectively. Of these balances, approximately $758 and $788 at the end of 2009 and 2008, respectively, represented debit and credit card receivables, primarily related to sales in the week prior to the end of the fiscal year. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $2,092 in 2009 compared to $2,206 in 2008, a decrease of approximately $114. This decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in net income of $197, partially offset by an increase in depreciation and amortization and stock based compensation of $90. Net cash used in investing activities totaled $1,101 in 2009 compared to $1,717 in 2008, a decrease of approximately $616. The decrease in investing activities relates primarily to a $349 decrease in cash used for additions to property and equipment related to warehouse expansion and remodel projects and a prior year reclassification of $371 of cash and cash equivalents to short term investments and other assets on our consolidated balance sheets, explained further below. These activities were partially offset by a decrease in cash provided by the net investment in short term investments of $62 as a result of less cash needed to fund our common stock repurchase activity as well as a decrease in cash proceeds from the sale of property and equipment of $41. In 2008, one of our enhanced money fund investments, Columbia Strategic Cash Portfolio Fund (Columbia), ceased accepting cash redemption requests and changed to a floating net asset value. In light of the restricted liquidity, we elected to receive a pro rata allocation of the underlying securities in a separately managed account. We assessed the fair value of these securities through market quotations and review of current investment ratings, as available, coupled with an evaluation of the liquidation value of each investment and its current performance in meeting scheduled payments of principal and interest. During 2009 and 2008, we recognized $12 and $5, respectively, of other than temporary impairment losses related to these securities. The losses are included in interest income and other in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. At August 30, 2009 and August 31, 2008, the balance of the Columbia fund was $27 and $104, respectively, on the consolidated balance sheets. In 2008, two other enhanced money fund investments, BlackRock Cash Strategies, LLC (BlackRock) and Merrill Lynch Capital Reserve Fund, LLC (Merrill Lynch), ceased accepting redemption requests and commenced liquidation. As of August 31, 2008, the balance of the BlackRock and Merrill Lynch funds was $82 and $43, respectively, on the consolidated balance sheets. During 2009, the remaining balances of these funds were liquidated. During 2008, we reclassified $371 of these three funds from cash and cash equivalents to short term investments and other assets. At August 30, 2009, $24 remained in short term investments and $3 28 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) remained in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets, reflecting the timing of the expected distributions. At August 31, 2008, $161 was in short term investments and $68 in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. The markets relating to these investments remain uncertain, and there may be further declines in the value of these investments that may cause additional losses in future periods. Net cash used in financing activities totaled $439 in 2009 compared to $643 in 2008. The $204 decrease in net cash used in financing activities primarily resulted from a reduction in the cash used to repurchase common stock of $826, partially offset by a decrease in the net proceeds from stock based awards and the excess tax benefit on share based awards of $276, a decrease in the net proceeds from short term borrowings of $195 as well as a decrease in the cash provided by the issuance of long term debt of $103. The effect of exchange rate changes, reflected in the consolidated statement of cash flows, decreased cash by $14 in 2009, compared to a decrease of $7 in 2008. This increase was due primarily to the significant weakening of the Canadian, Korean, and the United Kingdom currencies as compared to the U.S. dollar, during 2009. Dividends In April 2009, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash dividend from $0.16 to $0.18 per share or $0.72 on an annualized basis. Our quarterly cash dividends paid in 2009 totaled $0.68 per share. In 2008, we paid quarterly cash dividends totaling $0.61 per share. Contractual Obligations Our commitments at year end to make future payments under contractual obligations were as follows, as of August 30, 2009: Payments Due by Year Contractual obligations 2010 2011 to2012 2013 to2014 2015 andthereafter Total Purchase obligations (merchandise)(1) $ 3,539 $ 3,539 Long term debt(2) 186 1,120 126 1,432 2,864 Operating leases(3) 145 266 247 1,351 2,009 Purchase obligations (property, equipment, services and other)(4) 151 14 165 Construction Commitments 137 137 Capital lease obligations and other(2) 9 11 11 131 162 Other(5) 17 4 2 24 47 Total $ 4,184 $ 1,415 $ 386 $ 2,938 $ 8,923 (1) Includes open merchandise purchase orders. (2) Includes contractual interest payments. (3) Operating lease obligations exclude amounts commonly referred to as common area maintenance, taxes, and insurance and have been reduced by $163 to reflect sub lease income. (4) The amounts exclude certain services negotiated at the individual warehouse or regional level that are not significant and generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty. 29 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) (5) Consists of $24 in asset retirement obligations, $9 in deferred compensation obligations and includes $14 of current unrecognized tax benefits relating to uncertain tax positions. Amount excludes $16 of noncurrent unrecognized tax benefits due to uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash payments. Expansion Plans Our primary requirement for capital is the financing of land, building, and equipment costs for new and remodeled warehouses. Capital is also required for initial warehouse operations and working capital. While there can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized and plans are subject to change upon further review, it is our current intention to spend approximately $1,300 during fiscal 2010 for real estate, construction, remodeling, and equipment for warehouses and related operations. These expenditures are expected to be financed with a combination of cash provided from operations and existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. We plan to open approximately 16 to 18 new warehouses in 2010, including one to two relocations of existing warehouses to larger and better located facilities. Additional Equity Investments in Subsidiaries and Joint Ventures Our investments in the Costco Mexico joint venture and in other unconsolidated joint ventures that are less than majority owned are accounted for under the equity method. We did not make any capital contributions to our investment in Costco Mexico (a 50% owned joint venture) in 2009, 2008, or 2007. 30 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Bank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs (all amounts stated in millions, in U.S. dollars) Entity Credit FacilityDescription ExpirationDate Total ofall CreditFacilities Credit Line Usage atAugust 30, 2009 AvailableCredit ApplicableInterestRate Stand byLC &Letter ofGuaranty CommercialLetter ofCredit Short TermBorrowing U.S. Uncommitted Stand By Letter of Credit N/A $ 22 $ 22 $ $ $ N/A U.S. Uncommitted Commercial Letter of Credit N/A 50 20 30 N/A Australia(1) Guarantee Line N/A 8 8 N/A Canada(1) Multi Purpose Line March 10 28 18 10 1.76 % Japan(1) Revolving Credit February 10 37 8 29 0.64 % Japan(1) Bank Guaranty March 10 11 11 N/A Japan(1) Revolving Credit February 10 37 8 29 0.70 % Japan(2) Commercial Letter of Credit N/A 1 1 N/A Korea(1) Multi Purpose Line March 10 10 1 9 3.75 % Taiwan Multi Purpose Line January 10 15 4 11 2.50 % Taiwan Multi Purpose Line July 10 15 3 12 2.59 % United Kingdom Revolving Credit February 10 66 66 0.82 % United Kingdom Uncommitted Money Market Line N/A 33 33 3.05 % United Kingdom Uncommitted Overdraft Line N/A 49 49 1.50 % United Kingdom(2) Letter of Guarantee N/A 3 3 N/A United Kingdom Commercial Letter of Credit N/A 3 1 2 N/A TOTAL $ 388 $ 62 $ 21 $ 16 $ 289 (1) The U.S. parent company, Costco Wholesale Corporation, guarantees this entitys credit facility.

Note: We have credit facilities (for commercial and standby letters of credit) totaling $116 and $239 as of August 30, 2009 and August 31, 2008, respectively. The outstanding commitments under these facilities at August 30, 2009 and August 31, 2008, totaled $83 and $116, respectively, including $62 and $69, respectively, in standby letters of credit. For those entities with multi purpose lines, any issuance of either letters of credit (standby and or commercial) or short term borrowings will result in a corresponding decrease in available credit. 32 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Financing Activities In July 2009, we entered into a capital lease for a new warehouse building location and recorded a liability in the amount of $72, representing the net present value of $150 in aggregate future minimum lease payments at an imputed interest rate of 5.4%. This lease expires and becomes subject to a renewal clause in 2040. As of August 30, 2009, $71 is included in long term debt and $1 in the current portion of long term debt in our consolidated balance sheets. We have other minor capital lease obligations that amounted to $5 at the end of 2009 and 2008. In June 2008, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary entered into a ten year term loan in the amount of $32, with a variable rate of interest of Yen TIBOR (6 month) plus a 0.35% margin (0.95% and 1.24% at August 30, 2009 and August 31, 2008, respectively) on the outstanding balance. The net proceeds were used to repay the 1.187% Promissory Notes due in July 2008 and for general corporate purposes. Interest is payable semi annually in December and June and principal is due in June 2018. In October 2007, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes through a private placement in the amount of $69, bearing interest at 2.695%. Interest is payable semi annually, and principal is due in October 2017. The proceeds were used to repay the 2.07% Promissory Notes in October 2007 and for general corporate purposes. In February 2007, we issued $900 of 5.3% Senior Notes due March 15, 2012 at a discount of $2 and $1,100 of 5.5% Senior Notes due March 15, 2017 at a discount of $6 (together, the 2007 Senior Notes). Interest on the 2007 Senior Notes is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The discount and issuance costs associated with the 2007 Senior Notes are being amortized to interest expense over the terms of those notes. At our option, we may redeem the 2007 Senior Notes at any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount of the 2007 Senior Notes to be redeemed, or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, we will be required to make an offer to purchase the 2007 Senior Notes at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase, upon certain events as defined by the terms of the 2007 Senior Notes. In April 2003, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.92% in the amount of $43, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due in April 2010. In November 2002, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.88% in the aggregate amount of $32, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due in November 2009. The U.S. parent company, Costco Wholesale Corporation guarantees all of the promissory notes issued by our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary. In August 1997, we sold $900 principal amount at maturity 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes (Zero Coupon Notes) due in August 2017. The Zero Coupon Notes were priced with a yield to maturity of 3.5%, resulting in gross proceeds of $450. The current Zero Coupon Notes outstanding are convertible into a maximum of 961,000 shares of Costco Common Stock shares at an initial conversion price of $22.71. Holders of the Zero Coupon Notes may require us to purchase the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of purchase) in August 2012. At our option, we may redeem the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of redemption) any time after August 2002. As of August 30, 2009, $858 in principal amount of the Zero Coupon Notes had been converted by note holders to shares of Costco Common Stock, of which $25, $1, and $61 in principal were converted in 2009, 2008, and 2007 respectively, or 33 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) $19 and $42 in 2009 and 2007, respectively, after factoring in the related debt discount. In 2008, the conversion of principle for Zero Coupon Notes after factoring the related debt discount was not significant. Derivatives Effective November 24, 2008, we adopted the disclosure requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities an Amendment of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 133 (SFAS 161). We follow SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (as amended) (SFAS 133), in accounting for derivative and hedging activities. We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in the normal course of our business, which we manage in part through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts, seeking to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on known future expenditures denominated in a foreign currency. The forward foreign exchange contracts are entered into primarily to hedge U.S. dollar merchandise inventory expenditures. Currently, these instruments do not qualify for derivative hedge accounting. We use these instruments to mitigate risk and do not intend to engage in speculative transactions. These contracts do not contain any credit risk related contingent features. We seek to manage the counterparty risk associated with these forward foreign exchange contracts by limiting transactions to counterparties with which we have established banking relationships. There can be no assurance, however, that this effectively mitigates counterparty risk. In addition, the contracts are limited to a time period of less than one year. See Note 1 and Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report, for additional information related to these contracts. We are exposed to risks due to fluctuations in energy prices, particularly electricity and natural gas, which we seek to partially mitigate through the use of fixed price contracts with counterparties for approximately 24% of our warehouses and other facilities in the U.S. and Canada. We also enter into variable priced contracts for some purchases of natural gas and fuel for our gas stations on an index basis. These contracts qualify for treatment as normal purchase or normal sales under SFAS 133 and require no mark to market adjustment. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements With the exception of our operating leases, we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition or consolidated financial statements. Stock Repurchase Programs In September and November of 2007, our Board of Directors approved $300 and $1,000, respectively, of stock repurchases, which expire in August 2010 and November 2010, respectively. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an additional $1,000, which expires in July 2011, bringing total authorizations by our Board of Directors since inception of the program in 2001 to $6,800. During 2009, we repurchased 895,000 shares at an average price of $63.84 per share totaling approximately $57. During 2008, we repurchased 13,812,000 shares of common stock, at an average price of $64.22 per share, totaling approximately $887. The remaining amount available to be purchased under 34 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) our approved plan was $2,002 at the end of 2009. Purchases are made from time to time as conditions warrant in the open market or in block purchases, and pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5 1. Repurchased shares are retired, in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments. We continue to review our accounting policies and evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, investments, merchandise inventory valuation, impairment of long lived assets, warehouse closing costs, insurance/self insurance liabilities, and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. Revenue Recognition We generally recognize sales, net of estimated returns, at the time the member takes possession of merchandise or receives services. When we collect payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services, the amount received is generally recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed. We provide for estimated sales returns based on historical trends in merchandise returns. Amounts collected from members, which under common trade practices are referred to as sales taxes, are recorded on a net basis. We evaluate the criteria of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal Versus Net as an Agent, in determining whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, when we are the primary obligor, subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, influence product or service specifications, or have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded on a gross basis. If we are not the primary obligor and do not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above, we record the net amounts as commissions earned, which is reflected in net sales. Membership fee revenue represents annual membership fees paid by substantially all of our members. We account for membership fee revenue on a deferred basis, whereby revenue is recognized ratably over the one year membership period. Our Executive members qualify for a 2% reward (which can be redeemed only at Costco warehouses), up to a maximum of $500 per year, on all qualified purchases made at Costco. We account for this 2% reward as a reduction in sales, with the related liability being classified within other current liabilities. The sales reduction and corresponding liability are computed after giving effect to the estimated impact of non redemptions based on historical data. Investments Investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other than temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and our intent and ability to hold the investment. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the issuer, including industry and sector performance, 35 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) operational and financing cash flow factors, and rating agency actions. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and or issuer conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments. Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, as determined primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting, and are stated using the last in, first out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all other foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail inventory method of accounting and are stated using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. We believe the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. We record an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the expected annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end. At the end of 2008, due to overall net inflationary trends, merchandise inventories valued at LIFO were lower than the FIFO value, resulting in a $32 charge to merchandise costs. During 2009, due to overall deflationary trends, we recorded a $32 benefit to merchandise costs to adjust inventories valued at LIFO. At the end of 2009 and 2007, merchandise inventories valued at LIFO approximated FIFO after considering the lower of cost or market principle. We provide for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts as a percentage of net sales. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect results of the actual physical inventory counts, which generally occur in the second and fourth quarters of the year. Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as we progress toward earning those rebates, provided they are probable and reasonably estimable. Other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of agreement, or other systematic and rational approaches. Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Warehouse Closing costs We periodically evaluate our long lived assets for indicators of impairment, such as a decision to relocate or close a warehouse location. Our judgments are based on existing market and operational conditions. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring a downward adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value. We provide estimates for warehouse closing costs for both leased and owned locations to be closed or relocated. A considerable amount of judgment is involved in determining any impairment or our net liability, particularly related to the estimated sales price of owned locations and the potential sublease income at leased locations. These estimates are based on real estate conditions in the markets and our experience in those markets. We make assumptions about the average period of time it would take to sublease the location and the amount of potential sublease income for each leased location. We reassess our liability each quarter and adjust our liability accordingly when our estimates change. Insurance/Self Insurance Liabilities We use a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance pool, to provide for potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property damage, director and officers liability, vehicle liability, and 36 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Income Taxes We adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48), which sets out criteria for the use of judgment in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items, at the beginning of 2008. The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Significant judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions. The benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in our consolidated financial statements only after determining a more likely than not probability that the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge, if any, from tax authorities. When facts and circumstances change, we reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the consolidated financial statements as appropriate. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See discussion of Recent Accounting Pronouncements in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report. Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to financial market risk resulting from fluctuations in interest and foreign currency exchange rates. We do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions, nor hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. The current condition of the financial markets, however, has rendered identifiable risks less predictable, and liquidity concerns and credit risks have increased. Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment holdings that are diversified amongst money market funds, debt securities, corporate notes and bonds, and enhanced money funds with effective maturities of generally three months to five years at the date of purchase. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while continuing to generate yields. A revised investment policy was approved in December 2007 by our Board of Directors, limiting future investments to direct U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations, repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations, and U.S. Government and Government Agency Money Market funds. The investment policies of our subsidiaries are consistent with our primary objective to preserve principal while continuing to generate yields. Our wholly owned insurance subsidiary invests in U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations, corporate notes and bonds, and asset and mortgage backed securities with a minimum overall portfolio average credit rating of AA. All of our foreign subsidiaries investments are primarily in money market funds, investment grade securities, bankers acceptances, bank certificates of deposit and term deposits, all denominated in their local currencies. Additionally, our Canadian subsidiary may invest a portion of its investments in U.S. dollar investment grade securities and bank term deposits to meet current U.S. dollar obligations. 37 Table of Contents Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) All of the investment policies of the Company and subsidiaries are reviewed at least annually. Because most of our investments in cash and cash equivalents are of a short term nature, if interest rates were to increase or decrease, the impact would likely be immaterial to our financial statements. Based on our overnight investments and bank balances within cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2009 and 2008, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $24 and $18 (pre tax), respectively, to interest income on an annual basis. For those investments that are classified as available for sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in market volatility and interest rates are reflected within stockholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive income. The nature and amount of our long and short term debt may vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As of the end of 2009, our fixed rate long term debt included: $42 principal amount at maturity of 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes carried at $32; $900 of 5.3% Senior Notes carried at $899; and $1,100 of 5.5% Senior Notes carried at $1,096, and additional notes and capital lease obligations totaling $228. Additionally, our variable rate long term debt included a 0.35% over Yen Tibor (6 month) Term Loan of $32. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt and may affect the interest expense related to the variable rate debt. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report for more information on our long and short term debt. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Our foreign subsidiaries conduct limited transactions in their non functional currencies, which exposes us to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We manage these fluctuations, in part, through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts, seeking to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on known future expenditures denominated in a foreign currency. As of August 30, 2009, and August 31, 2008, we held forward foreign exchange contracts with a notional amount of $183 and $90, respectively, and a fair value liability of $2 and a fair value asset of $5, respectively, on the consolidated balance sheets. A hypothetical 10% strengthening of the functional currency compared to the non functional currency exchange rates at August 30, 2009 and August 31, 2008 would have decreased the fair value of the contracts by $18 and $10, respectively. 
 
Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The following table itemizes components of our most liquid assets at the end of 2009 and 2008 (dollars in millions, except per share data): 2009 2008 Cash and cash equivalents $ 3,157 $ 2,619 Short term investments 570 656 Total $ 3,727 $ 3,275 Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from warehouse operations and existing cash, cash equivalents, and short term investment balances, which were $3,727 and $3,275 at the end of 2009 and 2008, respectively. Of these balances, approximately $758 and $788 at the end of 2009 and 2008, respectively, represented debit and credit card receivables, primarily related to sales in the week prior to the end of the fiscal year. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $2,092 in 2009 compared to $2,206 in 2008, a decrease of approximately $114. This decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in net income of $197, partially offset by an increase in depreciation and amortization and stock based compensation of $90. Net cash used in investing activities totaled $1,101 in 2009 compared to $1,717 in 2008, a decrease of approximately $616. The decrease in investing activities relates primarily to a $349 decrease in cash used for additions to property and equipment related to warehouse expansion and remodel projects and a prior year reclassification of $371 of cash and cash equivalents to short term investments and other assets on our consolidated balance sheets, explained further below. These activities were partially offset by a decrease in cash provided by the net investment in short term investments of $62 as a result of less cash needed to fund our common stock repurchase activity as well as a decrease in cash proceeds from the sale of property and equipment of $41. In 2008, one of our enhanced money fund investments, Columbia Strategic Cash Portfolio Fund (Columbia), ceased accepting cash redemption requests and changed to a floating net asset value. In light of the restricted liquidity, we elected to receive a pro rata allocation of the underlying securities in a separately managed account. We assessed the fair value of these securities through market quotations and review of current investment ratings, as available, coupled with an evaluation of the liquidation value of each investment and its current performance in meeting scheduled payments of principal and interest. During 2009 and 2008, we recognized $12 and $5, respectively, of other than temporary impairment losses related to these securities. The losses are included in interest income and other in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. At August 30, 2009 and August 31, 2008, the balance of the Columbia fund was $27 and $104, respectively, on the consolidated balance sheets. In 2008, two other enhanced money fund investments, BlackRock Cash Strategies, LLC (BlackRock) and Merrill Lynch Capital Reserve Fund, LLC (Merrill Lynch), ceased accepting redemption requests and commenced liquidation. As of August 31, 2008, the balance of the BlackRock and Merrill Lynch funds was $82 and $43, respectively, on the consolidated balance sheets. During 2009, the remaining balances of these funds were liquidated. During 2008, we reclassified $371 of these three funds from cash and cash equivalents to short term investments and other assets. At August 30, 2009, $24 remained in short term investments and $3 28 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) remained in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets, reflecting the timing of the expected distributions. At August 31, 2008, $161 was in short term investments and $68 in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. The markets relating to these investments remain uncertain, and there may be further declines in the value of these investments that may cause additional losses in future periods. Net cash used in financing activities totaled $439 in 2009 compared to $643 in 2008. The $204 decrease in net cash used in financing activities primarily resulted from a reduction in the cash used to repurchase common stock of $826, partially offset by a decrease in the net proceeds from stock based awards and the excess tax benefit on share based awards of $276, a decrease in the net proceeds from short term borrowings of $195 as well as a decrease in the cash provided by the issuance of long term debt of $103. The effect of exchange rate changes, reflected in the consolidated statement of cash flows, decreased cash by $14 in 2009, compared to a decrease of $7 in 2008. This increase was due primarily to the significant weakening of the Canadian, Korean, and the United Kingdom currencies as compared to the U.S. dollar, during 2009. Dividends In April 2009, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash dividend from $0.16 to $0.18 per share or $0.72 on an annualized basis. Our quarterly cash dividends paid in 2009 totaled $0.68 per share. In 2008, we paid quarterly cash dividends totaling $0.61 per share. Contractual Obligations Our commitments at year end to make future payments under contractual obligations were as follows, as of August 30, 2009: Payments Due by Year Contractual obligations 2010 2011 to2012 2013 to2014 2015 andthereafter Total Purchase obligations (merchandise)(1) $ 3,539 $ 3,539 Long term debt(2) 186 1,120 126 1,432 2,864 Operating leases(3) 145 266 247 1,351 2,009 Purchase obligations (property, equipment, services and other)(4) 151 14 165 Construction Commitments 137 137 Capital lease obligations and other(2) 9 11 11 131 162 Other(5) 17 4 2 24 47 Total $ 4,184 $ 1,415 $ 386 $ 2,938 $ 8,923 (1) Includes open merchandise purchase orders. (2) Includes contractual interest payments. (3) Operating lease obligations exclude amounts commonly referred to as common area maintenance, taxes, and insurance and have been reduced by $163 to reflect sub lease income. (4) The amounts exclude certain services negotiated at the individual warehouse or regional level that are not significant and generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty. 29 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) (5) Consists of $24 in asset retirement obligations, $9 in deferred compensation obligations and includes $14 of current unrecognized tax benefits relating to uncertain tax positions. Amount excludes $16 of noncurrent unrecognized tax benefits due to uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash payments. Expansion Plans Our primary requirement for capital is the financing of land, building, and equipment costs for new and remodeled warehouses. Capital is also required for initial warehouse operations and working capital. While there can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized and plans are subject to change upon further review, it is our current intention to spend approximately $1,300 during fiscal 2010 for real estate, construction, remodeling, and equipment for warehouses and related operations. These expenditures are expected to be financed with a combination of cash provided from operations and existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. We plan to open approximately 16 to 18 new warehouses in 2010, including one to two relocations of existing warehouses to larger and better located facilities. Additional Equity Investments in Subsidiaries and Joint Ventures Our investments in the Costco Mexico joint venture and in other unconsolidated joint ventures that are less than majority owned are accounted for under the equity method. We did not make any capital contributions to our investment in Costco Mexico (a 50% owned joint venture) in 2009, 2008, or 2007. 30 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Bank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs (all amounts stated in millions, in U.S. dollars) Entity Credit FacilityDescription ExpirationDate Total ofall CreditFacilities Credit Line Usage atAugust 30, 2009 AvailableCredit ApplicableInterestRate Stand byLC &Letter ofGuaranty CommercialLetter ofCredit Short TermBorrowing U.S. Uncommitted Stand By Letter of Credit N/A $ 22 $ 22 $ $ $ N/A U.S. Uncommitted Commercial Letter of Credit N/A 50 20 30 N/A Australia(1) Guarantee Line N/A 8 8 N/A Canada(1) Multi Purpose Line March 10 28 18 10 1.76 % Japan(1) Revolving Credit February 10 37 8 29 0.64 % Japan(1) Bank Guaranty March 10 11 11 N/A Japan(1) Revolving Credit February 10 37 8 29 0.70 % Japan(2) Commercial Letter of Credit N/A 1 1 N/A Korea(1) Multi Purpose Line March 10 10 1 9 3.75 % Taiwan Multi Purpose Line January 10 15 4 11 2.50 % Taiwan Multi Purpose Line July 10 15 3 12 2.59 % United Kingdom Revolving Credit February 10 66 66 0.82 % United Kingdom Uncommitted Money Market Line N/A 33 33 3.05 % United Kingdom Uncommitted Overdraft Line N/A 49 49 1.50 % United Kingdom(2) Letter of Guarantee N/A 3 3 N/A United Kingdom Commercial Letter of Credit N/A 3 1 2 N/A TOTAL $ 388 $ 62 $ 21 $ 16 $ 289 (1) The U.S. parent company, Costco Wholesale Corporation, guarantees this entitys credit facility.

Note: We have credit facilities (for commercial and standby letters of credit) totaling $116 and $239 as of August 30, 2009 and August 31, 2008, respectively. The outstanding commitments under these facilities at August 30, 2009 and August 31, 2008, totaled $83 and $116, respectively, including $62 and $69, respectively, in standby letters of credit. For those entities with multi purpose lines, any issuance of either letters of credit (standby and or commercial) or short term borrowings will result in a corresponding decrease in available credit. 32 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Financing Activities In July 2009, we entered into a capital lease for a new warehouse building location and recorded a liability in the amount of $72, representing the net present value of $150 in aggregate future minimum lease payments at an imputed interest rate of 5.4%. This lease expires and becomes subject to a renewal clause in 2040. As of August 30, 2009, $71 is included in long term debt and $1 in the current portion of long term debt in our consolidated balance sheets. We have other minor capital lease obligations that amounted to $5 at the end of 2009 and 2008. In June 2008, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary entered into a ten year term loan in the amount of $32, with a variable rate of interest of Yen TIBOR (6 month) plus a 0.35% margin (0.95% and 1.24% at August 30, 2009 and August 31, 2008, respectively) on the outstanding balance. The net proceeds were used to repay the 1.187% Promissory Notes due in July 2008 and for general corporate purposes. Interest is payable semi annually in December and June and principal is due in June 2018. In October 2007, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes through a private placement in the amount of $69, bearing interest at 2.695%. Interest is payable semi annually, and principal is due in October 2017. The proceeds were used to repay the 2.07% Promissory Notes in October 2007 and for general corporate purposes. In February 2007, we issued $900 of 5.3% Senior Notes due March 15, 2012 at a discount of $2 and $1,100 of 5.5% Senior Notes due March 15, 2017 at a discount of $6 (together, the 2007 Senior Notes). Interest on the 2007 Senior Notes is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The discount and issuance costs associated with the 2007 Senior Notes are being amortized to interest expense over the terms of those notes. At our option, we may redeem the 2007 Senior Notes at any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount of the 2007 Senior Notes to be redeemed, or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, we will be required to make an offer to purchase the 2007 Senior Notes at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase, upon certain events as defined by the terms of the 2007 Senior Notes. In April 2003, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.92% in the amount of $43, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due in April 2010. In November 2002, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.88% in the aggregate amount of $32, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due in November 2009. The U.S. parent company, Costco Wholesale Corporation guarantees all of the promissory notes issued by our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary. In August 1997, we sold $900 principal amount at maturity 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes (Zero Coupon Notes) due in August 2017. The Zero Coupon Notes were priced with a yield to maturity of 3.5%, resulting in gross proceeds of $450. The current Zero Coupon Notes outstanding are convertible into a maximum of 961,000 shares of Costco Common Stock shares at an initial conversion price of $22.71. Holders of the Zero Coupon Notes may require us to purchase the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of purchase) in August 2012. At our option, we may redeem the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of redemption) any time after August 2002. As of August 30, 2009, $858 in principal amount of the Zero Coupon Notes had been converted by note holders to shares of Costco Common Stock, of which $25, $1, and $61 in principal were converted in 2009, 2008, and 2007 respectively, or 33 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) $19 and $42 in 2009 and 2007, respectively, after factoring in the related debt discount. In 2008, the conversion of principle for Zero Coupon Notes after factoring the related debt discount was not significant. Derivatives Effective November 24, 2008, we adopted the disclosure requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities an Amendment of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 133 (SFAS 161). We follow SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (as amended) (SFAS 133), in accounting for derivative and hedging activities. We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in the normal course of our business, which we manage in part through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts, seeking to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on known future expenditures denominated in a foreign currency. The forward foreign exchange contracts are entered into primarily to hedge U.S. dollar merchandise inventory expenditures. Currently, these instruments do not qualify for derivative hedge accounting. We use these instruments to mitigate risk and do not intend to engage in speculative transactions. These contracts do not contain any credit risk related contingent features. We seek to manage the counterparty risk associated with these forward foreign exchange contracts by limiting transactions to counterparties with which we have established banking relationships. There can be no assurance, however, that this effectively mitigates counterparty risk. In addition, the contracts are limited to a time period of less than one year. See Note 1 and Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report, for additional information related to these contracts. We are exposed to risks due to fluctuations in energy prices, particularly electricity and natural gas, which we seek to partially mitigate through the use of fixed price contracts with counterparties for approximately 24% of our warehouses and other facilities in the U.S. and Canada. We also enter into variable priced contracts for some purchases of natural gas and fuel for our gas stations on an index basis. These contracts qualify for treatment as normal purchase or normal sales under SFAS 133 and require no mark to market adjustment. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements With the exception of our operating leases, we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition or consolidated financial statements. Stock Repurchase Programs In September and November of 2007, our Board of Directors approved $300 and $1,000, respectively, of stock repurchases, which expire in August 2010 and November 2010, respectively. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an additional $1,000, which expires in July 2011, bringing total authorizations by our Board of Directors since inception of the program in 2001 to $6,800. During 2009, we repurchased 895,000 shares at an average price of $63.84 per share totaling approximately $57. During 2008, we repurchased 13,812,000 shares of common stock, at an average price of $64.22 per share, totaling approximately $887. The remaining amount available to be purchased under 34 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) our approved plan was $2,002 at the end of 2009. Purchases are made from time to time as conditions warrant in the open market or in block purchases, and pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5 1. Repurchased shares are retired, in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments. We continue to review our accounting policies and evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, investments, merchandise inventory valuation, impairment of long lived assets, warehouse closing costs, insurance/self insurance liabilities, and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. Revenue Recognition We generally recognize sales, net of estimated returns, at the time the member takes possession of merchandise or receives services. When we collect payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services, the amount received is generally recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed. We provide for estimated sales returns based on historical trends in merchandise returns. Amounts collected from members, which under common trade practices are referred to as sales taxes, are recorded on a net basis. We evaluate the criteria of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal Versus Net as an Agent, in determining whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, when we are the primary obligor, subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, influence product or service specifications, or have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded on a gross basis. If we are not the primary obligor and do not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above, we record the net amounts as commissions earned, which is reflected in net sales. Membership fee revenue represents annual membership fees paid by substantially all of our members. We account for membership fee revenue on a deferred basis, whereby revenue is recognized ratably over the one year membership period. Our Executive members qualify for a 2% reward (which can be redeemed only at Costco warehouses), up to a maximum of $500 per year, on all qualified purchases made at Costco. We account for this 2% reward as a reduction in sales, with the related liability being classified within other current liabilities. The sales reduction and corresponding liability are computed after giving effect to the estimated impact of non redemptions based on historical data. Investments Investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other than temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and our intent and ability to hold the investment. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the issuer, including industry and sector performance, 35 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) operational and financing cash flow factors, and rating agency actions. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and or issuer conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments. Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, as determined primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting, and are stated using the last in, first out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all other foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail inventory method of accounting and are stated using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. We believe the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. We record an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the expected annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end. At the end of 2008, due to overall net inflationary trends, merchandise inventories valued at LIFO were lower than the FIFO value, resulting in a $32 charge to merchandise costs. During 2009, due to overall deflationary trends, we recorded a $32 benefit to merchandise costs to adjust inventories valued at LIFO. At the end of 2009 and 2007, merchandise inventories valued at LIFO approximated FIFO after considering the lower of cost or market principle. We provide for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts as a percentage of net sales. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect results of the actual physical inventory counts, which generally occur in the second and fourth quarters of the year. Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as we progress toward earning those rebates, provided they are probable and reasonably estimable. Other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of agreement, or other systematic and rational approaches. Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Warehouse Closing costs We periodically evaluate our long lived assets for indicators of impairment, such as a decision to relocate or close a warehouse location. Our judgments are based on existing market and operational conditions. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring a downward adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value. We provide estimates for warehouse closing costs for both leased and owned locations to be closed or relocated. A considerable amount of judgment is involved in determining any impairment or our net liability, particularly related to the estimated sales price of owned locations and the potential sublease income at leased locations. These estimates are based on real estate conditions in the markets and our experience in those markets. We make assumptions about the average period of time it would take to sublease the location and the amount of potential sublease income for each leased location. We reassess our liability each quarter and adjust our liability accordingly when our estimates change. Insurance/Self Insurance Liabilities We use a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance pool, to provide for potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property damage, director and officers liability, vehicle liability, and 36 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Income Taxes We adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48), which sets out criteria for the use of judgment in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items, at the beginning of 2008. The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Significant judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions. The benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in our consolidated financial statements only after determining a more likely than not probability that the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge, if any, from tax authorities. When facts and circumstances change, we reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the consolidated financial statements as appropriate. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See discussion of Recent Accounting Pronouncements in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report. Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to financial market risk resulting from fluctuations in interest and foreign currency exchange rates. We do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions, nor hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. The current condition of the financial markets, however, has rendered identifiable risks less predictable, and liquidity concerns and credit risks have increased. Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment holdings that are diversified amongst money market funds, debt securities, corporate notes and bonds, and enhanced money funds with effective maturities of generally three months to five years at the date of purchase. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while continuing to generate yields. A revised investment policy was approved in December 2007 by our Board of Directors, limiting future investments to direct U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations, repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations, and U.S. Government and Government Agency Money Market funds. The investment policies of our subsidiaries are consistent with our primary objective to preserve principal while continuing to generate yields. Our wholly owned insurance subsidiary invests in U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations, corporate notes and bonds, and asset and mortgage backed securities with a minimum overall portfolio average credit rating of AA. All of our foreign subsidiaries investments are primarily in money market funds, investment grade securities, bankers acceptances, bank certificates of deposit and term deposits, all denominated in their local currencies. Additionally, our Canadian subsidiary may invest a portion of its investments in U.S. dollar investment grade securities and bank term deposits to meet current U.S. dollar obligations. 37 Table of Contents Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) All of the investment policies of the Company and subsidiaries are reviewed at least annually. Because most of our investments in cash and cash equivalents are of a short term nature, if interest rates were to increase or decrease, the impact would likely be immaterial to our financial statements. Based on our overnight investments and bank balances within cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2009 and 2008, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $24 and $18 (pre tax), respectively, to interest income on an annual basis. For those investments that are classified as available for sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in market volatility and interest rates are reflected within stockholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive income. The nature and amount of our long and short term debt may vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As of the end of 2009, our fixed rate long term debt included: $42 principal amount at maturity of 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes carried at $32; $900 of 5.3% Senior Notes carried at $899; and $1,100 of 5.5% Senior Notes carried at $1,096, and additional notes and capital lease obligations totaling $228. Additionally, our variable rate long term debt included a 0.35% over Yen Tibor (6 month) Term Loan of $32. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt and may affect the interest expense related to the variable rate debt. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report for more information on our long and short term debt. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Our foreign subsidiaries conduct limited transactions in their non functional currencies, which exposes us to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We manage these fluctuations, in part, through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts, seeking to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on known future expenditures denominated in a foreign currency. As of August 30, 2009, and August 31, 2008, we held forward foreign exchange contracts with a notional amount of $183 and $90, respectively, and a fair value liability of $2 and a fair value asset of $5, respectively, on the consolidated balance sheets. A hypothetical 10% strengthening of the functional currency compared to the non functional currency exchange rates at August 30, 2009 and August 31, 2008 would have decreased the fair value of the contracts by $18 and $10, respectively. 
 
Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) remained in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets, reflecting the timing of the expected distributions. At August 31, 2008, $161 was in short term investments and $68 in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. The markets relating to these investments remain uncertain, and there may be further declines in the value of these investments that may cause additional losses in future periods. Net cash used in financing activities totaled $439 in 2009 compared to $643 in 2008. The $204 decrease in net cash used in financing activities primarily resulted from a reduction in the cash used to repurchase common stock of $826, partially offset by a decrease in the net proceeds from stock based awards and the excess tax benefit on share based awards of $276, a decrease in the net proceeds from short term borrowings of $195 as well as a decrease in the cash provided by the issuance of long term debt of $103. The effect of exchange rate changes, reflected in the consolidated statement of cash flows, decreased cash by $14 in 2009, compared to a decrease of $7 in 2008. This increase was due primarily to the significant weakening of the Canadian, Korean, and the United Kingdom currencies as compared to the U.S. dollar, during 2009. Dividends In April 2009, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash dividend from $0.16 to $0.18 per share or $0.72 on an annualized basis. Our quarterly cash dividends paid in 2009 totaled $0.68 per share. In 2008, we paid quarterly cash dividends totaling $0.61 per share. Contractual Obligations Our commitments at year end to make future payments under contractual obligations were as follows, as of August 30, 2009: Payments Due by Year Contractual obligations 2010 2011 to2012 2013 to2014 2015 andthereafter Total Purchase obligations (merchandise)(1) $ 3,539 $ 3,539 Long term debt(2) 186 1,120 126 1,432 2,864 Operating leases(3) 145 266 247 1,351 2,009 Purchase obligations (property, equipment, services and other)(4) 151 14 165 Construction Commitments 137 137 Capital lease obligations and other(2) 9 11 11 131 162 Other(5) 17 4 2 24 47 Total $ 4,184 $ 1,415 $ 386 $ 2,938 $ 8,923 (1) Includes open merchandise purchase orders. (2) Includes contractual interest payments. (3) Operating lease obligations exclude amounts commonly referred to as common area maintenance, taxes, and insurance and have been reduced by $163 to reflect sub lease income. (4) The amounts exclude certain services negotiated at the individual warehouse or regional level that are not significant and generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty. 29 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) (5) Consists of $24 in asset retirement obligations, $9 in deferred compensation obligations and includes $14 of current unrecognized tax benefits relating to uncertain tax positions. Amount excludes $16 of noncurrent unrecognized tax benefits due to uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash payments. Expansion Plans Our primary requirement for capital is the financing of land, building, and equipment costs for new and remodeled warehouses. Capital is also required for initial warehouse operations and working capital. While there can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized and plans are subject to change upon further review, it is our current intention to spend approximately $1,300 during fiscal 2010 for real estate, construction, remodeling, and equipment for warehouses and related operations. These expenditures are expected to be financed with a combination of cash provided from operations and existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. We plan to open approximately 16 to 18 new warehouses in 2010, including one to two relocations of existing warehouses to larger and better located facilities. Additional Equity Investments in Subsidiaries and Joint Ventures Our investments in the Costco Mexico joint venture and in other unconsolidated joint ventures that are less than majority owned are accounted for under the equity method. We did not make any capital contributions to our investment in Costco Mexico (a 50% owned joint venture) in 2009, 2008, or 2007. 30 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Bank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs (all amounts stated in millions, in U.S. dollars) Entity Credit FacilityDescription ExpirationDate Total ofall CreditFacilities Credit Line Usage atAugust 30, 2009 AvailableCredit ApplicableInterestRate Stand byLC &Letter ofGuaranty CommercialLetter ofCredit Short TermBorrowing U.S. Uncommitted Stand By Letter of Credit N/A $ 22 $ 22 $ $ $ N/A U.S. Uncommitted Commercial Letter of Credit N/A 50 20 30 N/A Australia(1) Guarantee Line N/A 8 8 N/A Canada(1) Multi Purpose Line March 10 28 18 10 1.76 % Japan(1) Revolving Credit February 10 37 8 29 0.64 % Japan(1) Bank Guaranty March 10 11 11 N/A Japan(1) Revolving Credit February 10 37 8 29 0.70 % Japan(2) Commercial Letter of Credit N/A 1 1 N/A Korea(1) Multi Purpose Line March 10 10 1 9 3.75 % Taiwan Multi Purpose Line January 10 15 4 11 2.50 % Taiwan Multi Purpose Line July 10 15 3 12 2.59 % United Kingdom Revolving Credit February 10 66 66 0.82 % United Kingdom Uncommitted Money Market Line N/A 33 33 3.05 % United Kingdom Uncommitted Overdraft Line N/A 49 49 1.50 % United Kingdom(2) Letter of Guarantee N/A 3 3 N/A United Kingdom Commercial Letter of Credit N/A 3 1 2 N/A TOTAL $ 388 $ 62 $ 21 $ 16 $ 289 (1) The U.S. parent company, Costco Wholesale Corporation, guarantees this entitys credit facility.

Note: We have credit facilities (for commercial and standby letters of credit) totaling $116 and $239 as of August 30, 2009 and August 31, 2008, respectively. The outstanding commitments under these facilities at August 30, 2009 and August 31, 2008, totaled $83 and $116, respectively, including $62 and $69, respectively, in standby letters of credit. For those entities with multi purpose lines, any issuance of either letters of credit (standby and or commercial) or short term borrowings will result in a corresponding decrease in available credit. 32 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Financing Activities In July 2009, we entered into a capital lease for a new warehouse building location and recorded a liability in the amount of $72, representing the net present value of $150 in aggregate future minimum lease payments at an imputed interest rate of 5.4%. This lease expires and becomes subject to a renewal clause in 2040. As of August 30, 2009, $71 is included in long term debt and $1 in the current portion of long term debt in our consolidated balance sheets. We have other minor capital lease obligations that amounted to $5 at the end of 2009 and 2008. In June 2008, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary entered into a ten year term loan in the amount of $32, with a variable rate of interest of Yen TIBOR (6 month) plus a 0.35% margin (0.95% and 1.24% at August 30, 2009 and August 31, 2008, respectively) on the outstanding balance. The net proceeds were used to repay the 1.187% Promissory Notes due in July 2008 and for general corporate purposes. Interest is payable semi annually in December and June and principal is due in June 2018. In October 2007, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes through a private placement in the amount of $69, bearing interest at 2.695%. Interest is payable semi annually, and principal is due in October 2017. The proceeds were used to repay the 2.07% Promissory Notes in October 2007 and for general corporate purposes. In February 2007, we issued $900 of 5.3% Senior Notes due March 15, 2012 at a discount of $2 and $1,100 of 5.5% Senior Notes due March 15, 2017 at a discount of $6 (together, the 2007 Senior Notes). Interest on the 2007 Senior Notes is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The discount and issuance costs associated with the 2007 Senior Notes are being amortized to interest expense over the terms of those notes. At our option, we may redeem the 2007 Senior Notes at any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount of the 2007 Senior Notes to be redeemed, or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, we will be required to make an offer to purchase the 2007 Senior Notes at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase, upon certain events as defined by the terms of the 2007 Senior Notes. In April 2003, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.92% in the amount of $43, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due in April 2010. In November 2002, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.88% in the aggregate amount of $32, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due in November 2009. The U.S. parent company, Costco Wholesale Corporation guarantees all of the promissory notes issued by our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary. In August 1997, we sold $900 principal amount at maturity 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes (Zero Coupon Notes) due in August 2017. The Zero Coupon Notes were priced with a yield to maturity of 3.5%, resulting in gross proceeds of $450. The current Zero Coupon Notes outstanding are convertible into a maximum of 961,000 shares of Costco Common Stock shares at an initial conversion price of $22.71. Holders of the Zero Coupon Notes may require us to purchase the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of purchase) in August 2012. At our option, we may redeem the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of redemption) any time after August 2002. As of August 30, 2009, $858 in principal amount of the Zero Coupon Notes had been converted by note holders to shares of Costco Common Stock, of which $25, $1, and $61 in principal were converted in 2009, 2008, and 2007 respectively, or 33 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) $19 and $42 in 2009 and 2007, respectively, after factoring in the related debt discount. In 2008, the conversion of principle for Zero Coupon Notes after factoring the related debt discount was not significant. Derivatives Effective November 24, 2008, we adopted the disclosure requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities an Amendment of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 133 (SFAS 161). We follow SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (as amended) (SFAS 133), in accounting for derivative and hedging activities. We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in the normal course of our business, which we manage in part through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts, seeking to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on known future expenditures denominated in a foreign currency. The forward foreign exchange contracts are entered into primarily to hedge U.S. dollar merchandise inventory expenditures. Currently, these instruments do not qualify for derivative hedge accounting. We use these instruments to mitigate risk and do not intend to engage in speculative transactions. These contracts do not contain any credit risk related contingent features. We seek to manage the counterparty risk associated with these forward foreign exchange contracts by limiting transactions to counterparties with which we have established banking relationships. There can be no assurance, however, that this effectively mitigates counterparty risk. In addition, the contracts are limited to a time period of less than one year. See Note 1 and Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report, for additional information related to these contracts. We are exposed to risks due to fluctuations in energy prices, particularly electricity and natural gas, which we seek to partially mitigate through the use of fixed price contracts with counterparties for approximately 24% of our warehouses and other facilities in the U.S. and Canada. We also enter into variable priced contracts for some purchases of natural gas and fuel for our gas stations on an index basis. These contracts qualify for treatment as normal purchase or normal sales under SFAS 133 and require no mark to market adjustment. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements With the exception of our operating leases, we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition or consolidated financial statements. Stock Repurchase Programs In September and November of 2007, our Board of Directors approved $300 and $1,000, respectively, of stock repurchases, which expire in August 2010 and November 2010, respectively. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an additional $1,000, which expires in July 2011, bringing total authorizations by our Board of Directors since inception of the program in 2001 to $6,800. During 2009, we repurchased 895,000 shares at an average price of $63.84 per share totaling approximately $57. During 2008, we repurchased 13,812,000 shares of common stock, at an average price of $64.22 per share, totaling approximately $887. The remaining amount available to be purchased under 34 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) our approved plan was $2,002 at the end of 2009. Purchases are made from time to time as conditions warrant in the open market or in block purchases, and pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5 1. Repurchased shares are retired, in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments. We continue to review our accounting policies and evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, investments, merchandise inventory valuation, impairment of long lived assets, warehouse closing costs, insurance/self insurance liabilities, and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. Revenue Recognition We generally recognize sales, net of estimated returns, at the time the member takes possession of merchandise or receives services. When we collect payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services, the amount received is generally recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed. We provide for estimated sales returns based on historical trends in merchandise returns. Amounts collected from members, which under common trade practices are referred to as sales taxes, are recorded on a net basis. We evaluate the criteria of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal Versus Net as an Agent, in determining whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, when we are the primary obligor, subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, influence product or service specifications, or have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded on a gross basis. If we are not the primary obligor and do not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above, we record the net amounts as commissions earned, which is reflected in net sales. Membership fee revenue represents annual membership fees paid by substantially all of our members. We account for membership fee revenue on a deferred basis, whereby revenue is recognized ratably over the one year membership period. Our Executive members qualify for a 2% reward (which can be redeemed only at Costco warehouses), up to a maximum of $500 per year, on all qualified purchases made at Costco. We account for this 2% reward as a reduction in sales, with the related liability being classified within other current liabilities. The sales reduction and corresponding liability are computed after giving effect to the estimated impact of non redemptions based on historical data. Investments Investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other than temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and our intent and ability to hold the investment. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the issuer, including industry and sector performance, 35 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) operational and financing cash flow factors, and rating agency actions. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and or issuer conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments. Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, as determined primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting, and are stated using the last in, first out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all other foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail inventory method of accounting and are stated using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. We believe the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. We record an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the expected annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end. At the end of 2008, due to overall net inflationary trends, merchandise inventories valued at LIFO were lower than the FIFO value, resulting in a $32 charge to merchandise costs. During 2009, due to overall deflationary trends, we recorded a $32 benefit to merchandise costs to adjust inventories valued at LIFO. At the end of 2009 and 2007, merchandise inventories valued at LIFO approximated FIFO after considering the lower of cost or market principle. We provide for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts as a percentage of net sales. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect results of the actual physical inventory counts, which generally occur in the second and fourth quarters of the year. Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as we progress toward earning those rebates, provided they are probable and reasonably estimable. Other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of agreement, or other systematic and rational approaches. Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Warehouse Closing costs We periodically evaluate our long lived assets for indicators of impairment, such as a decision to relocate or close a warehouse location. Our judgments are based on existing market and operational conditions. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring a downward adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value. We provide estimates for warehouse closing costs for both leased and owned locations to be closed or relocated. A considerable amount of judgment is involved in determining any impairment or our net liability, particularly related to the estimated sales price of owned locations and the potential sublease income at leased locations. These estimates are based on real estate conditions in the markets and our experience in those markets. We make assumptions about the average period of time it would take to sublease the location and the amount of potential sublease income for each leased location. We reassess our liability each quarter and adjust our liability accordingly when our estimates change. Insurance/Self Insurance Liabilities We use a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance pool, to provide for potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property damage, director and officers liability, vehicle liability, and 36 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Income Taxes We adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48), which sets out criteria for the use of judgment in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items, at the beginning of 2008. The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Significant judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions. The benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in our consolidated financial statements only after determining a more likely than not probability that the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge, if any, from tax authorities. When facts and circumstances change, we reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the consolidated financial statements as appropriate. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See discussion of Recent Accounting Pronouncements in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report. Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to financial market risk resulting from fluctuations in interest and foreign currency exchange rates. We do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions, nor hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. The current condition of the financial markets, however, has rendered identifiable risks less predictable, and liquidity concerns and credit risks have increased. Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment holdings that are diversified amongst money market funds, debt securities, corporate notes and bonds, and enhanced money funds with effective maturities of generally three months to five years at the date of purchase. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while continuing to generate yields. A revised investment policy was approved in December 2007 by our Board of Directors, limiting future investments to direct U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations, repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations, and U.S. Government and Government Agency Money Market funds. The investment policies of our subsidiaries are consistent with our primary objective to preserve principal while continuing to generate yields. Our wholly owned insurance subsidiary invests in U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations, corporate notes and bonds, and asset and mortgage backed securities with a minimum overall portfolio average credit rating of AA. All of our foreign subsidiaries investments are primarily in money market funds, investment grade securities, bankers acceptances, bank certificates of deposit and term deposits, all denominated in their local currencies. Additionally, our Canadian subsidiary may invest a portion of its investments in U.S. dollar investment grade securities and bank term deposits to meet current U.S. dollar obligations. 37 Table of Contents Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) All of the investment policies of the Company and subsidiaries are reviewed at least annually. Because most of our investments in cash and cash equivalents are of a short term nature, if interest rates were to increase or decrease, the impact would likely be immaterial to our financial statements. Based on our overnight investments and bank balances within cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2009 and 2008, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $24 and $18 (pre tax), respectively, to interest income on an annual basis. For those investments that are classified as available for sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in market volatility and interest rates are reflected within stockholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive income. The nature and amount of our long and short term debt may vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As of the end of 2009, our fixed rate long term debt included: $42 principal amount at maturity of 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes carried at $32; $900 of 5.3% Senior Notes carried at $899; and $1,100 of 5.5% Senior Notes carried at $1,096, and additional notes and capital lease obligations totaling $228. Additionally, our variable rate long term debt included a 0.35% over Yen Tibor (6 month) Term Loan of $32. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt and may affect the interest expense related to the variable rate debt. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report for more information on our long and short term debt. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Our foreign subsidiaries conduct limited transactions in their non functional currencies, which exposes us to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We manage these fluctuations, in part, through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts, seeking to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on known future expenditures denominated in a foreign currency. As of August 30, 2009, and August 31, 2008, we held forward foreign exchange contracts with a notional amount of $183 and $90, respectively, and a fair value liability of $2 and a fair value asset of $5, respectively, on the consolidated balance sheets. A hypothetical 10% strengthening of the functional currency compared to the non functional currency exchange rates at August 30, 2009 and August 31, 2008 would have decreased the fair value of the contracts by $18 and $10, respectively. 
 
Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) (5) Consists of $24 in asset retirement obligations, $9 in deferred compensation obligations and includes $14 of current unrecognized tax benefits relating to uncertain tax positions. Amount excludes $16 of noncurrent unrecognized tax benefits due to uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash payments. Expansion Plans Our primary requirement for capital is the financing of land, building, and equipment costs for new and remodeled warehouses. Capital is also required for initial warehouse operations and working capital. While there can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized and plans are subject to change upon further review, it is our current intention to spend approximately $1,300 during fiscal 2010 for real estate, construction, remodeling, and equipment for warehouses and related operations. These expenditures are expected to be financed with a combination of cash provided from operations and existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. We plan to open approximately 16 to 18 new warehouses in 2010, including one to two relocations of existing warehouses to larger and better located facilities. Additional Equity Investments in Subsidiaries and Joint Ventures Our investments in the Costco Mexico joint venture and in other unconsolidated joint ventures that are less than majority owned are accounted for under the equity method. We did not make any capital contributions to our investment in Costco Mexico (a 50% owned joint venture) in 2009, 2008, or 2007. 30 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Bank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs (all amounts stated in millions, in U.S. dollars) Entity Credit FacilityDescription ExpirationDate Total ofall CreditFacilities Credit Line Usage atAugust 30, 2009 AvailableCredit ApplicableInterestRate Stand byLC &Letter ofGuaranty CommercialLetter ofCredit Short TermBorrowing U.S. Uncommitted Stand By Letter of Credit N/A $ 22 $ 22 $ $ $ N/A U.S. Uncommitted Commercial Letter of Credit N/A 50 20 30 N/A Australia(1) Guarantee Line N/A 8 8 N/A Canada(1) Multi Purpose Line March 10 28 18 10 1.76 % Japan(1) Revolving Credit February 10 37 8 29 0.64 % Japan(1) Bank Guaranty March 10 11 11 N/A Japan(1) Revolving Credit February 10 37 8 29 0.70 % Japan(2) Commercial Letter of Credit N/A 1 1 N/A Korea(1) Multi Purpose Line March 10 10 1 9 3.75 % Taiwan Multi Purpose Line January 10 15 4 11 2.50 % Taiwan Multi Purpose Line July 10 15 3 12 2.59 % United Kingdom Revolving Credit February 10 66 66 0.82 % United Kingdom Uncommitted Money Market Line N/A 33 33 3.05 % United Kingdom Uncommitted Overdraft Line N/A 49 49 1.50 % United Kingdom(2) Letter of Guarantee N/A 3 3 N/A United Kingdom Commercial Letter of Credit N/A 3 1 2 N/A TOTAL $ 388 $ 62 $ 21 $ 16 $ 289 (1) The U.S. parent company, Costco Wholesale Corporation, guarantees this entitys credit facility.

Note: We have credit facilities (for commercial and standby letters of credit) totaling $116 and $239 as of August 30, 2009 and August 31, 2008, respectively. The outstanding commitments under these facilities at August 30, 2009 and August 31, 2008, totaled $83 and $116, respectively, including $62 and $69, respectively, in standby letters of credit. For those entities with multi purpose lines, any issuance of either letters of credit (standby and or commercial) or short term borrowings will result in a corresponding decrease in available credit. 32 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Financing Activities In July 2009, we entered into a capital lease for a new warehouse building location and recorded a liability in the amount of $72, representing the net present value of $150 in aggregate future minimum lease payments at an imputed interest rate of 5.4%. This lease expires and becomes subject to a renewal clause in 2040. As of August 30, 2009, $71 is included in long term debt and $1 in the current portion of long term debt in our consolidated balance sheets. We have other minor capital lease obligations that amounted to $5 at the end of 2009 and 2008. In June 2008, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary entered into a ten year term loan in the amount of $32, with a variable rate of interest of Yen TIBOR (6 month) plus a 0.35% margin (0.95% and 1.24% at August 30, 2009 and August 31, 2008, respectively) on the outstanding balance. The net proceeds were used to repay the 1.187% Promissory Notes due in July 2008 and for general corporate purposes. Interest is payable semi annually in December and June and principal is due in June 2018. In October 2007, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes through a private placement in the amount of $69, bearing interest at 2.695%. Interest is payable semi annually, and principal is due in October 2017. The proceeds were used to repay the 2.07% Promissory Notes in October 2007 and for general corporate purposes. In February 2007, we issued $900 of 5.3% Senior Notes due March 15, 2012 at a discount of $2 and $1,100 of 5.5% Senior Notes due March 15, 2017 at a discount of $6 (together, the 2007 Senior Notes). Interest on the 2007 Senior Notes is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The discount and issuance costs associated with the 2007 Senior Notes are being amortized to interest expense over the terms of those notes. At our option, we may redeem the 2007 Senior Notes at any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount of the 2007 Senior Notes to be redeemed, or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, we will be required to make an offer to purchase the 2007 Senior Notes at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase, upon certain events as defined by the terms of the 2007 Senior Notes. In April 2003, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.92% in the amount of $43, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due in April 2010. In November 2002, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.88% in the aggregate amount of $32, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due in November 2009. The U.S. parent company, Costco Wholesale Corporation guarantees all of the promissory notes issued by our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary. In August 1997, we sold $900 principal amount at maturity 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes (Zero Coupon Notes) due in August 2017. The Zero Coupon Notes were priced with a yield to maturity of 3.5%, resulting in gross proceeds of $450. The current Zero Coupon Notes outstanding are convertible into a maximum of 961,000 shares of Costco Common Stock shares at an initial conversion price of $22.71. Holders of the Zero Coupon Notes may require us to purchase the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of purchase) in August 2012. At our option, we may redeem the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of redemption) any time after August 2002. As of August 30, 2009, $858 in principal amount of the Zero Coupon Notes had been converted by note holders to shares of Costco Common Stock, of which $25, $1, and $61 in principal were converted in 2009, 2008, and 2007 respectively, or 33 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) $19 and $42 in 2009 and 2007, respectively, after factoring in the related debt discount. In 2008, the conversion of principle for Zero Coupon Notes after factoring the related debt discount was not significant. Derivatives Effective November 24, 2008, we adopted the disclosure requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities an Amendment of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 133 (SFAS 161). We follow SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (as amended) (SFAS 133), in accounting for derivative and hedging activities. We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in the normal course of our business, which we manage in part through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts, seeking to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on known future expenditures denominated in a foreign currency. The forward foreign exchange contracts are entered into primarily to hedge U.S. dollar merchandise inventory expenditures. Currently, these instruments do not qualify for derivative hedge accounting. We use these instruments to mitigate risk and do not intend to engage in speculative transactions. These contracts do not contain any credit risk related contingent features. We seek to manage the counterparty risk associated with these forward foreign exchange contracts by limiting transactions to counterparties with which we have established banking relationships. There can be no assurance, however, that this effectively mitigates counterparty risk. In addition, the contracts are limited to a time period of less than one year. See Note 1 and Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report, for additional information related to these contracts. We are exposed to risks due to fluctuations in energy prices, particularly electricity and natural gas, which we seek to partially mitigate through the use of fixed price contracts with counterparties for approximately 24% of our warehouses and other facilities in the U.S. and Canada. We also enter into variable priced contracts for some purchases of natural gas and fuel for our gas stations on an index basis. These contracts qualify for treatment as normal purchase or normal sales under SFAS 133 and require no mark to market adjustment. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements With the exception of our operating leases, we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition or consolidated financial statements. Stock Repurchase Programs In September and November of 2007, our Board of Directors approved $300 and $1,000, respectively, of stock repurchases, which expire in August 2010 and November 2010, respectively. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an additional $1,000, which expires in July 2011, bringing total authorizations by our Board of Directors since inception of the program in 2001 to $6,800. During 2009, we repurchased 895,000 shares at an average price of $63.84 per share totaling approximately $57. During 2008, we repurchased 13,812,000 shares of common stock, at an average price of $64.22 per share, totaling approximately $887. The remaining amount available to be purchased under 34 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) our approved plan was $2,002 at the end of 2009. Purchases are made from time to time as conditions warrant in the open market or in block purchases, and pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5 1. Repurchased shares are retired, in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments. We continue to review our accounting policies and evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, investments, merchandise inventory valuation, impairment of long lived assets, warehouse closing costs, insurance/self insurance liabilities, and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. Revenue Recognition We generally recognize sales, net of estimated returns, at the time the member takes possession of merchandise or receives services. When we collect payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services, the amount received is generally recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed. We provide for estimated sales returns based on historical trends in merchandise returns. Amounts collected from members, which under common trade practices are referred to as sales taxes, are recorded on a net basis. We evaluate the criteria of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal Versus Net as an Agent, in determining whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, when we are the primary obligor, subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, influence product or service specifications, or have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded on a gross basis. If we are not the primary obligor and do not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above, we record the net amounts as commissions earned, which is reflected in net sales. Membership fee revenue represents annual membership fees paid by substantially all of our members. We account for membership fee revenue on a deferred basis, whereby revenue is recognized ratably over the one year membership period. Our Executive members qualify for a 2% reward (which can be redeemed only at Costco warehouses), up to a maximum of $500 per year, on all qualified purchases made at Costco. We account for this 2% reward as a reduction in sales, with the related liability being classified within other current liabilities. The sales reduction and corresponding liability are computed after giving effect to the estimated impact of non redemptions based on historical data. Investments Investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other than temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and our intent and ability to hold the investment. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the issuer, including industry and sector performance, 35 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) operational and financing cash flow factors, and rating agency actions. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and or issuer conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments. Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, as determined primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting, and are stated using the last in, first out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all other foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail inventory method of accounting and are stated using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. We believe the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. We record an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the expected annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end. At the end of 2008, due to overall net inflationary trends, merchandise inventories valued at LIFO were lower than the FIFO value, resulting in a $32 charge to merchandise costs. During 2009, due to overall deflationary trends, we recorded a $32 benefit to merchandise costs to adjust inventories valued at LIFO. At the end of 2009 and 2007, merchandise inventories valued at LIFO approximated FIFO after considering the lower of cost or market principle. We provide for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts as a percentage of net sales. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect results of the actual physical inventory counts, which generally occur in the second and fourth quarters of the year. Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as we progress toward earning those rebates, provided they are probable and reasonably estimable. Other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of agreement, or other systematic and rational approaches. Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Warehouse Closing costs We periodically evaluate our long lived assets for indicators of impairment, such as a decision to relocate or close a warehouse location. Our judgments are based on existing market and operational conditions. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring a downward adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value. We provide estimates for warehouse closing costs for both leased and owned locations to be closed or relocated. A considerable amount of judgment is involved in determining any impairment or our net liability, particularly related to the estimated sales price of owned locations and the potential sublease income at leased locations. These estimates are based on real estate conditions in the markets and our experience in those markets. We make assumptions about the average period of time it would take to sublease the location and the amount of potential sublease income for each leased location. We reassess our liability each quarter and adjust our liability accordingly when our estimates change. Insurance/Self Insurance Liabilities We use a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance pool, to provide for potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property damage, director and officers liability, vehicle liability, and 36 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Income Taxes We adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48), which sets out criteria for the use of judgment in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items, at the beginning of 2008. The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Significant judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions. The benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in our consolidated financial statements only after determining a more likely than not probability that the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge, if any, from tax authorities. When facts and circumstances change, we reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the consolidated financial statements as appropriate.

Our wholly owned insurance subsidiary invests in U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations, corporate notes and bonds, and asset and mortgage backed securities with a minimum overall portfolio average credit rating of AA. All of our foreign subsidiaries investments are primarily in money market funds, investment grade securities, bankers acceptances, bank certificates of deposit and term deposits, all denominated in their local currencies. Additionally, our Canadian subsidiary may invest a portion of its investments in U.S. dollar investment grade securities and bank term deposits to meet current U.S. dollar obligations. 37 Table of Contents Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) All of the investment policies of the Company and subsidiaries are reviewed at least annually. Because most of our investments in cash and cash equivalents are of a short term nature, if interest rates were to increase or decrease, the impact would likely be immaterial to our financial statements. Based on our overnight investments and bank balances within cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2009 and 2008, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $24 and $18 (pre tax), respectively, to interest income on an annual basis. For those investments that are classified as available for sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in market volatility and interest rates are reflected within stockholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive income. The nature and amount of our long and short term debt may vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As of the end of 2009, our fixed rate long term debt included: $42 principal amount at maturity of 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes carried at $32; $900 of 5.3% Senior Notes carried at $899; and $1,100 of 5.5% Senior Notes carried at $1,096, and additional notes and capital lease obligations totaling $228. Additionally, our variable rate long term debt included a 0.35% over Yen Tibor (6 month) Term Loan of $32. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt and may affect the interest expense related to the variable rate debt.

A hypothetical 10% strengthening of the functional currency compared to the non functional currency exchange rates at August 30, 2009 and August 31, 2008 would have decreased the fair value of the contracts by $18 and $10, respectively.

(3) The amount shown for short term borrowings under this facility is net of a note issue discount, which is excluded from the available credit amount. Note: We have credit facilities (for commercial and standby letters of credit) totaling $116 and $239 as of August 30, 2009 and August 31, 2008, respectively. The outstanding commitments under these facilities at August 30, 2009 and August 31, 2008, totaled $83 and $116, respectively, including $62 and $69, respectively, in standby letters of credit. For those entities with multi purpose lines, any issuance of either letters of credit (standby and or commercial) or short term borrowings will result in a corresponding decrease in available credit. 32 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Financing Activities In July 2009, we entered into a capital lease for a new warehouse building location and recorded a liability in the amount of $72, representing the net present value of $150 in aggregate future minimum lease payments at an imputed interest rate of 5.4%. This lease expires and becomes subject to a renewal clause in 2040. As of August 30, 2009, $71 is included in long term debt and $1 in the current portion of long term debt in our consolidated balance sheets. We have other minor capital lease obligations that amounted to $5 at the end of 2009 and 2008. In June 2008, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary entered into a ten year term loan in the amount of $32, with a variable rate of interest of Yen TIBOR (6 month) plus a 0.35% margin (0.95% and 1.24% at August 30, 2009 and August 31, 2008, respectively) on the outstanding balance. The net proceeds were used to repay the 1.187% Promissory Notes due in July 2008 and for general corporate purposes. Interest is payable semi annually in December and June and principal is due in June 2018. In October 2007, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes through a private placement in the amount of $69, bearing interest at 2.695%. Interest is payable semi annually, and principal is due in October 2017. The proceeds were used to repay the 2.07% Promissory Notes in October 2007 and for general corporate purposes. In February 2007, we issued $900 of 5.3% Senior Notes due March 15, 2012 at a discount of $2 and $1,100 of 5.5% Senior Notes due March 15, 2017 at a discount of $6 (together, the 2007 Senior Notes). Interest on the 2007 Senior Notes is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The discount and issuance costs associated with the 2007 Senior Notes are being amortized to interest expense over the terms of those notes. At our option, we may redeem the 2007 Senior Notes at any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount of the 2007 Senior Notes to be redeemed, or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, we will be required to make an offer to purchase the 2007 Senior Notes at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase, upon certain events as defined by the terms of the 2007 Senior Notes. In April 2003, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.92% in the amount of $43, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due in April 2010. In November 2002, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.88% in the aggregate amount of $32, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due in November 2009. The U.S. parent company, Costco Wholesale Corporation guarantees all of the promissory notes issued by our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary. In August 1997, we sold $900 principal amount at maturity 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes (Zero Coupon Notes) due in August 2017. The Zero Coupon Notes were priced with a yield to maturity of 3.5%, resulting in gross proceeds of $450. The current Zero Coupon Notes outstanding are convertible into a maximum of 961,000 shares of Costco Common Stock shares at an initial conversion price of $22.71. Holders of the Zero Coupon Notes may require us to purchase the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of purchase) in August 2012. At our option, we may redeem the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of redemption) any time after August 2002. As of August 30, 2009, $858 in principal amount of the Zero Coupon Notes had been converted by note holders to shares of Costco Common Stock, of which $25, $1, and $61 in principal were converted in 2009, 2008, and 2007 respectively, or 33 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) $19 and $42 in 2009 and 2007, respectively, after factoring in the related debt discount. In 2008, the conversion of principle for Zero Coupon Notes after factoring the related debt discount was not significant. Derivatives Effective November 24, 2008, we adopted the disclosure requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities an Amendment of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 133 (SFAS 161). We follow SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (as amended) (SFAS 133), in accounting for derivative and hedging activities. We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in the normal course of our business, which we manage in part through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts, seeking to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on known future expenditures denominated in a foreign currency. The forward foreign exchange contracts are entered into primarily to hedge U.S. dollar merchandise inventory expenditures. Currently, these instruments do not qualify for derivative hedge accounting. We use these instruments to mitigate risk and do not intend to engage in speculative transactions. These contracts do not contain any credit risk related contingent features. We seek to manage the counterparty risk associated with these forward foreign exchange contracts by limiting transactions to counterparties with which we have established banking relationships. There can be no assurance, however, that this effectively mitigates counterparty risk. In addition, the contracts are limited to a time period of less than one year. See Note 1 and Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report, for additional information related to these contracts. We are exposed to risks due to fluctuations in energy prices, particularly electricity and natural gas, which we seek to partially mitigate through the use of fixed price contracts with counterparties for approximately 24% of our warehouses and other facilities in the U.S. and Canada. We also enter into variable priced contracts for some purchases of natural gas and fuel for our gas stations on an index basis. These contracts qualify for treatment as normal purchase or normal sales under SFAS 133 and require no mark to market adjustment. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements With the exception of our operating leases, we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition or consolidated financial statements. Stock Repurchase Programs In September and November of 2007, our Board of Directors approved $300 and $1,000, respectively, of stock repurchases, which expire in August 2010 and November 2010, respectively. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an additional $1,000, which expires in July 2011, bringing total authorizations by our Board of Directors since inception of the program in 2001 to $6,800. During 2009, we repurchased 895,000 shares at an average price of $63.84 per share totaling approximately $57. During 2008, we repurchased 13,812,000 shares of common stock, at an average price of $64.22 per share, totaling approximately $887. The remaining amount available to be purchased under 34 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) our approved plan was $2,002 at the end of 2009. Purchases are made from time to time as conditions warrant in the open market or in block purchases, and pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5 1. Repurchased shares are retired, in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments. We continue to review our accounting policies and evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, investments, merchandise inventory valuation, impairment of long lived assets, warehouse closing costs, insurance/self insurance liabilities, and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. Revenue Recognition We generally recognize sales, net of estimated returns, at the time the member takes possession of merchandise or receives services. When we collect payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services, the amount received is generally recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed. We provide for estimated sales returns based on historical trends in merchandise returns. Amounts collected from members, which under common trade practices are referred to as sales taxes, are recorded on a net basis. We evaluate the criteria of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal Versus Net as an Agent, in determining whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, when we are the primary obligor, subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, influence product or service specifications, or have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded on a gross basis. If we are not the primary obligor and do not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above, we record the net amounts as commissions earned, which is reflected in net sales. Membership fee revenue represents annual membership fees paid by substantially all of our members. We account for membership fee revenue on a deferred basis, whereby revenue is recognized ratably over the one year membership period. Our Executive members qualify for a 2% reward (which can be redeemed only at Costco warehouses), up to a maximum of $500 per year, on all qualified purchases made at Costco. We account for this 2% reward as a reduction in sales, with the related liability being classified within other current liabilities. The sales reduction and corresponding liability are computed after giving effect to the estimated impact of non redemptions based on historical data. Investments Investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other than temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and our intent and ability to hold the investment. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the issuer, including industry and sector performance, 35 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) operational and financing cash flow factors, and rating agency actions. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and or issuer conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments. Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, as determined primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting, and are stated using the last in, first out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all other foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail inventory method of accounting and are stated using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. We believe the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. We record an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the expected annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end. At the end of 2008, due to overall net inflationary trends, merchandise inventories valued at LIFO were lower than the FIFO value, resulting in a $32 charge to merchandise costs. During 2009, due to overall deflationary trends, we recorded a $32 benefit to merchandise costs to adjust inventories valued at LIFO. At the end of 2009 and 2007, merchandise inventories valued at LIFO approximated FIFO after considering the lower of cost or market principle. We provide for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts as a percentage of net sales. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect results of the actual physical inventory counts, which generally occur in the second and fourth quarters of the year. Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as we progress toward earning those rebates, provided they are probable and reasonably estimable. Other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of agreement, or other systematic and rational approaches. Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Warehouse Closing costs We periodically evaluate our long lived assets for indicators of impairment, such as a decision to relocate or close a warehouse location. Our judgments are based on existing market and operational conditions. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring a downward adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value. We provide estimates for warehouse closing costs for both leased and owned locations to be closed or relocated. A considerable amount of judgment is involved in determining any impairment or our net liability, particularly related to the estimated sales price of owned locations and the potential sublease income at leased locations. These estimates are based on real estate conditions in the markets and our experience in those markets. We make assumptions about the average period of time it would take to sublease the location and the amount of potential sublease income for each leased location. We reassess our liability each quarter and adjust our liability accordingly when our estimates change. Insurance/Self Insurance Liabilities We use a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance pool, to provide for potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property damage, director and officers liability, vehicle liability, and 36 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Income Taxes We adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48), which sets out criteria for the use of judgment in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items, at the beginning of 2008. The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Significant judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions. The benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in our consolidated financial statements only after determining a more likely than not probability that the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge, if any, from tax authorities. When facts and circumstances change, we reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the consolidated financial statements as appropriate. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See discussion of Recent Accounting Pronouncements in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report. Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to financial market risk resulting from fluctuations in interest and foreign currency exchange rates. We do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions, nor hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. The current condition of the financial markets, however, has rendered identifiable risks less predictable, and liquidity concerns and credit risks have increased. Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment holdings that are diversified amongst money market funds, debt securities, corporate notes and bonds, and enhanced money funds with effective maturities of generally three months to five years at the date of purchase. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while continuing to generate yields. A revised investment policy was approved in December 2007 by our Board of Directors, limiting future investments to direct U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations, repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations, and U.S. Government and Government Agency Money Market funds. The investment policies of our subsidiaries are consistent with our primary objective to preserve principal while continuing to generate yields. Our wholly owned insurance subsidiary invests in U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations, corporate notes and bonds, and asset and mortgage backed securities with a minimum overall portfolio average credit rating of AA. All of our foreign subsidiaries investments are primarily in money market funds, investment grade securities, bankers acceptances, bank certificates of deposit and term deposits, all denominated in their local currencies. Additionally, our Canadian subsidiary may invest a portion of its investments in U.S. dollar investment grade securities and bank term deposits to meet current U.S. dollar obligations. 37 Table of Contents Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) All of the investment policies of the Company and subsidiaries are reviewed at least annually. Because most of our investments in cash and cash equivalents are of a short term nature, if interest rates were to increase or decrease, the impact would likely be immaterial to our financial statements. Based on our overnight investments and bank balances within cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2009 and 2008, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $24 and $18 (pre tax), respectively, to interest income on an annual basis. For those investments that are classified as available for sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in market volatility and interest rates are reflected within stockholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive income. The nature and amount of our long and short term debt may vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As of the end of 2009, our fixed rate long term debt included: $42 principal amount at maturity of 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes carried at $32; $900 of 5.3% Senior Notes carried at $899; and $1,100 of 5.5% Senior Notes carried at $1,096, and additional notes and capital lease obligations totaling $228. Additionally, our variable rate long term debt included a 0.35% over Yen Tibor (6 month) Term Loan of $32. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt and may affect the interest expense related to the variable rate debt. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report for more information on our long and short term debt. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Our foreign subsidiaries conduct limited transactions in their non functional currencies, which exposes us to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We manage these fluctuations, in part, through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts, seeking to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on known future expenditures denominated in a foreign currency. As of August 30, 2009, and August 31, 2008, we held forward foreign exchange contracts with a notional amount of $183 and $90, respectively, and a fair value liability of $2 and a fair value asset of $5, respectively, on the consolidated balance sheets. A hypothetical 10% strengthening of the functional currency compared to the non functional currency exchange rates at August 30, 2009 and August 31, 2008 would have decreased the fair value of the contracts by $18 and $10, respectively.

We have other minor capital lease obligations that amounted to $5 at the end of 2009 and 2008. In June 2008, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary entered into a ten year term loan in the amount of $32, with a variable rate of interest of Yen TIBOR (6 month) plus a 0.35% margin (0.95% and 1.24% at August 30, 2009 and August 31, 2008, respectively) on the outstanding balance. The net proceeds were used to repay the 1.187% Promissory Notes due in July 2008 and for general corporate purposes. Interest is payable semi annually in December and June and principal is due in June 2018. In October 2007, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes through a private placement in the amount of $69, bearing interest at 2.695%. Interest is payable semi annually, and principal is due in October 2017. The proceeds were used to repay the 2.07% Promissory Notes in October 2007 and for general corporate purposes. In February 2007, we issued $900 of 5.3% Senior Notes due March 15, 2012 at a discount of $2 and $1,100 of 5.5% Senior Notes due March 15, 2017 at a discount of $6 (together, the 2007 Senior Notes). Interest on the 2007 Senior Notes is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The discount and issuance costs associated with the 2007 Senior Notes are being amortized to interest expense over the terms of those notes. At our option, we may redeem the 2007 Senior Notes at any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest.

Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due in November 2009. The U.S. parent company, Costco Wholesale Corporation guarantees all of the promissory notes issued by our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary. In August 1997, we sold $900 principal amount at maturity 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes (Zero Coupon Notes) due in August 2017. The Zero Coupon Notes were priced with a yield to maturity of 3.5%, resulting in gross proceeds of $450. The current Zero Coupon Notes outstanding are convertible into a maximum of 961,000 shares of Costco Common Stock shares at an initial conversion price of $22.71. Holders of the Zero Coupon Notes may require us to purchase the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of purchase) in August 2012. At our option, we may redeem the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of redemption) any time after August 2002.

We use these instruments to mitigate risk and do not intend to engage in speculative transactions. These contracts do not contain any credit risk related contingent features. We seek to manage the counterparty risk associated with these forward foreign exchange contracts by limiting transactions to counterparties with which we have established banking relationships. There can be no assurance, however, that this effectively mitigates counterparty risk. In addition, the contracts are limited to a time period of less than one year. See Note 1 and Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report, for additional information related to these contracts. We are exposed to risks due to fluctuations in energy prices, particularly electricity and natural gas, which we seek to partially mitigate through the use of fixed price contracts with counterparties for approximately 24% of our warehouses and other facilities in the U.S. and Canada. We also enter into variable priced contracts for some purchases of natural gas and fuel for our gas stations on an index basis. These contracts qualify for treatment as normal purchase or normal sales under SFAS 133 and require no mark to market adjustment. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements With the exception of our operating leases, we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition or consolidated financial statements. Stock Repurchase Programs In September and November of 2007, our Board of Directors approved $300 and $1,000, respectively, of stock repurchases, which expire in August 2010 and November 2010, respectively. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an additional $1,000, which expires in July 2011, bringing total authorizations by our Board of Directors since inception of the program in 2001 to $6,800. During 2009, we repurchased 895,000 shares at an average price of $63.84 per share totaling approximately $57. During 2008, we repurchased 13,812,000 shares of common stock, at an average price of $64.22 per share, totaling approximately $887. The remaining amount available to be purchased under 34 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) our approved plan was $2,002 at the end of 2009. Purchases are made from time to time as conditions warrant in the open market or in block purchases, and pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5 1. Repurchased shares are retired, in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments. We continue to review our accounting policies and evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, investments, merchandise inventory valuation, impairment of long lived assets, warehouse closing costs, insurance/self insurance liabilities, and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. Revenue Recognition We generally recognize sales, net of estimated returns, at the time the member takes possession of merchandise or receives services. When we collect payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services, the amount received is generally recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed. We provide for estimated sales returns based on historical trends in merchandise returns. Amounts collected from members, which under common trade practices are referred to as sales taxes, are recorded on a net basis. We evaluate the criteria of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal Versus Net as an Agent, in determining whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, when we are the primary obligor, subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, influence product or service specifications, or have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded on a gross basis. If we are not the primary obligor and do not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above, we record the net amounts as commissions earned, which is reflected in net sales. Membership fee revenue represents annual membership fees paid by substantially all of our members. We account for membership fee revenue on a deferred basis, whereby revenue is recognized ratably over the one year membership period. Our Executive members qualify for a 2% reward (which can be redeemed only at Costco warehouses), up to a maximum of $500 per year, on all qualified purchases made at Costco. We account for this 2% reward as a reduction in sales, with the related liability being classified within other current liabilities. The sales reduction and corresponding liability are computed after giving effect to the estimated impact of non redemptions based on historical data. Investments Investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other than temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and our intent and ability to hold the investment. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the issuer, including industry and sector performance, 35 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) operational and financing cash flow factors, and rating agency actions. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and or issuer conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments. Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, as determined primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting, and are stated using the last in, first out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all other foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail inventory method of accounting and are stated using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. We believe the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. We record an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the expected annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end. At the end of 2008, due to overall net inflationary trends, merchandise inventories valued at LIFO were lower than the FIFO value, resulting in a $32 charge to merchandise costs. During 2009, due to overall deflationary trends, we recorded a $32 benefit to merchandise costs to adjust inventories valued at LIFO. At the end of 2009 and 2007, merchandise inventories valued at LIFO approximated FIFO after considering the lower of cost or market principle. We provide for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts as a percentage of net sales. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect results of the actual physical inventory counts, which generally occur in the second and fourth quarters of the year. Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as we progress toward earning those rebates, provided they are probable and reasonably estimable. Other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of agreement, or other systematic and rational approaches. Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Warehouse Closing costs We periodically evaluate our long lived assets for indicators of impairment, such as a decision to relocate or close a warehouse location. Our judgments are based on existing market and operational conditions. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring a downward adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value. We provide estimates for warehouse closing costs for both leased and owned locations to be closed or relocated. A considerable amount of judgment is involved in determining any impairment or our net liability, particularly related to the estimated sales price of owned locations and the potential sublease income at leased locations. These estimates are based on real estate conditions in the markets and our experience in those markets. We make assumptions about the average period of time it would take to sublease the location and the amount of potential sublease income for each leased location. We reassess our liability each quarter and adjust our liability accordingly when our estimates change. Insurance/Self Insurance Liabilities We use a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance pool, to provide for potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property damage, director and officers liability, vehicle liability, and 36 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Income Taxes We adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48), which sets out criteria for the use of judgment in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items, at the beginning of 2008. The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Significant judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions. The benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in our consolidated financial statements only after determining a more likely than not probability that the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge, if any, from tax authorities. When facts and circumstances change, we reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the consolidated financial statements as appropriate. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See discussion of Recent Accounting Pronouncements in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report. Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to financial market risk resulting from fluctuations in interest and foreign currency exchange rates. We do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions, nor hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. The current condition of the financial markets, however, has rendered identifiable risks less predictable, and liquidity concerns and credit risks have increased. Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment holdings that are diversified amongst money market funds, debt securities, corporate notes and bonds, and enhanced money funds with effective maturities of generally three months to five years at the date of purchase. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while continuing to generate yields. A revised investment policy was approved in December 2007 by our Board of Directors, limiting future investments to direct U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations, repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations, and U.S. Government and Government Agency Money Market funds. The investment policies of our subsidiaries are consistent with our primary objective to preserve principal while continuing to generate yields. Our wholly owned insurance subsidiary invests in U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations, corporate notes and bonds, and asset and mortgage backed securities with a minimum overall portfolio average credit rating of AA. All of our foreign subsidiaries investments are primarily in money market funds, investment grade securities, bankers acceptances, bank certificates of deposit and term deposits, all denominated in their local currencies. Additionally, our Canadian subsidiary may invest a portion of its investments in U.S. dollar investment grade securities and bank term deposits to meet current U.S. dollar obligations. 37 Table of Contents Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) All of the investment policies of the Company and subsidiaries are reviewed at least annually. Because most of our investments in cash and cash equivalents are of a short term nature, if interest rates were to increase or decrease, the impact would likely be immaterial to our financial statements. Based on our overnight investments and bank balances within cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2009 and 2008, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $24 and $18 (pre tax), respectively, to interest income on an annual basis. For those investments that are classified as available for sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in market volatility and interest rates are reflected within stockholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive income. The nature and amount of our long and short term debt may vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As of the end of 2009, our fixed rate long term debt included: $42 principal amount at maturity of 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes carried at $32; $900 of 5.3% Senior Notes carried at $899; and $1,100 of 5.5% Senior Notes carried at $1,096, and additional notes and capital lease obligations totaling $228. Additionally, our variable rate long term debt included a 0.35% over Yen Tibor (6 month) Term Loan of $32. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt and may affect the interest expense related to the variable rate debt. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report for more information on our long and short term debt. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Our foreign subsidiaries conduct limited transactions in their non functional currencies, which exposes us to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We manage these fluctuations, in part, through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts, seeking to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on known future expenditures denominated in a foreign currency. As of August 30, 2009, and August 31, 2008, we held forward foreign exchange contracts with a notional amount of $183 and $90, respectively, and a fair value liability of $2 and a fair value asset of $5, respectively, on the consolidated balance sheets. A hypothetical 10% strengthening of the functional currency compared to the non functional currency exchange rates at August 30, 2009 and August 31, 2008 would have decreased the fair value of the contracts by $18 and $10, respectively. 
 
Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Financing Activities In July 2009, we entered into a capital lease for a new warehouse building location and recorded a liability in the amount of $72, representing the net present value of $150 in aggregate future minimum lease payments at an imputed interest rate of 5.4%. This lease expires and becomes subject to a renewal clause in 2040. As of August 30, 2009, $71 is included in long term debt and $1 in the current portion of long term debt in our consolidated balance sheets. We have other minor capital lease obligations that amounted to $5 at the end of 2009 and 2008. In June 2008, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary entered into a ten year term loan in the amount of $32, with a variable rate of interest of Yen TIBOR (6 month) plus a 0.35% margin (0.95% and 1.24% at August 30, 2009 and August 31, 2008, respectively) on the outstanding balance. The net proceeds were used to repay the 1.187% Promissory Notes due in July 2008 and for general corporate purposes. Interest is payable semi annually in December and June and principal is due in June 2018. In October 2007, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes through a private placement in the amount of $69, bearing interest at 2.695%. Interest is payable semi annually, and principal is due in October 2017. The proceeds were used to repay the 2.07% Promissory Notes in October 2007 and for general corporate purposes. In February 2007, we issued $900 of 5.3% Senior Notes due March 15, 2012 at a discount of $2 and $1,100 of 5.5% Senior Notes due March 15, 2017 at a discount of $6 (together, the 2007 Senior Notes). Interest on the 2007 Senior Notes is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The discount and issuance costs associated with the 2007 Senior Notes are being amortized to interest expense over the terms of those notes. At our option, we may redeem the 2007 Senior Notes at any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount of the 2007 Senior Notes to be redeemed, or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, we will be required to make an offer to purchase the 2007 Senior Notes at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase, upon certain events as defined by the terms of the 2007 Senior Notes. In April 2003, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.92% in the amount of $43, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due in April 2010. In November 2002, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.88% in the aggregate amount of $32, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi annually and principal is due in November 2009. The U.S. parent company, Costco Wholesale Corporation guarantees all of the promissory notes issued by our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary. In August 1997, we sold $900 principal amount at maturity 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes (Zero Coupon Notes) due in August 2017. The Zero Coupon Notes were priced with a yield to maturity of 3.5%, resulting in gross proceeds of $450. The current Zero Coupon Notes outstanding are convertible into a maximum of 961,000 shares of Costco Common Stock shares at an initial conversion price of $22.71. Holders of the Zero Coupon Notes may require us to purchase the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of purchase) in August 2012. At our option, we may redeem the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of redemption) any time after August 2002. As of August 30, 2009, $858 in principal amount of the Zero Coupon Notes had been converted by note holders to shares of Costco Common Stock, of which $25, $1, and $61 in principal were converted in 2009, 2008, and 2007 respectively, or 33 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) $19 and $42 in 2009 and 2007, respectively, after factoring in the related debt discount. In 2008, the conversion of principle for Zero Coupon Notes after factoring the related debt discount was not significant. Derivatives Effective November 24, 2008, we adopted the disclosure requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities an Amendment of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 133 (SFAS 161). We follow SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (as amended) (SFAS 133), in accounting for derivative and hedging activities. We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in the normal course of our business, which we manage in part through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts, seeking to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on known future expenditures denominated in a foreign currency. The forward foreign exchange contracts are entered into primarily to hedge U.S. dollar merchandise inventory expenditures. Currently, these instruments do not qualify for derivative hedge accounting. We use these instruments to mitigate risk and do not intend to engage in speculative transactions. These contracts do not contain any credit risk related contingent features. We seek to manage the counterparty risk associated with these forward foreign exchange contracts by limiting transactions to counterparties with which we have established banking relationships. There can be no assurance, however, that this effectively mitigates counterparty risk. In addition, the contracts are limited to a time period of less than one year. See Note 1 and Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report, for additional information related to these contracts. We are exposed to risks due to fluctuations in energy prices, particularly electricity and natural gas, which we seek to partially mitigate through the use of fixed price contracts with counterparties for approximately 24% of our warehouses and other facilities in the U.S. and Canada. We also enter into variable priced contracts for some purchases of natural gas and fuel for our gas stations on an index basis. These contracts qualify for treatment as normal purchase or normal sales under SFAS 133 and require no mark to market adjustment. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements With the exception of our operating leases, we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition or consolidated financial statements. Stock Repurchase Programs In September and November of 2007, our Board of Directors approved $300 and $1,000, respectively, of stock repurchases, which expire in August 2010 and November 2010, respectively. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an additional $1,000, which expires in July 2011, bringing total authorizations by our Board of Directors since inception of the program in 2001 to $6,800. During 2009, we repurchased 895,000 shares at an average price of $63.84 per share totaling approximately $57. During 2008, we repurchased 13,812,000 shares of common stock, at an average price of $64.22 per share, totaling approximately $887. The remaining amount available to be purchased under 34 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) our approved plan was $2,002 at the end of 2009. Purchases are made from time to time as conditions warrant in the open market or in block purchases, and pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5 1. Repurchased shares are retired, in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments. We continue to review our accounting policies and evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, investments, merchandise inventory valuation, impairment of long lived assets, warehouse closing costs, insurance/self insurance liabilities, and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. Revenue Recognition We generally recognize sales, net of estimated returns, at the time the member takes possession of merchandise or receives services. When we collect payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services, the amount received is generally recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed. We provide for estimated sales returns based on historical trends in merchandise returns. Amounts collected from members, which under common trade practices are referred to as sales taxes, are recorded on a net basis.

If we are not the primary obligor and do not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above, we record the net amounts as commissions earned, which is reflected in net sales. Membership fee revenue represents annual membership fees paid by substantially all of our members. We account for membership fee revenue on a deferred basis, whereby revenue is recognized ratably over the one year membership period. Our Executive members qualify for a 2% reward (which can be redeemed only at Costco warehouses), up to a maximum of $500 per year, on all qualified purchases made at Costco. We account for this 2% reward as a reduction in sales, with the related liability being classified within other current liabilities. The sales reduction and corresponding liability are computed after giving effect to the estimated impact of non redemptions based on historical data. Investments Investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other than temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and our intent and ability to hold the investment. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the issuer, including industry and sector performance, 35 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) operational and financing cash flow factors, and rating agency actions. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and or issuer conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments. Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, as determined primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting, and are stated using the last in, first out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all other foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail inventory method of accounting and are stated using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. We believe the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. We record an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the expected annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end. At the end of 2008, due to overall net inflationary trends, merchandise inventories valued at LIFO were lower than the FIFO value, resulting in a $32 charge to merchandise costs. During 2009, due to overall deflationary trends, we recorded a $32 benefit to merchandise costs to adjust inventories valued at LIFO. At the end of 2009 and 2007, merchandise inventories valued at LIFO approximated FIFO after considering the lower of cost or market principle. We provide for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts as a percentage of net sales. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect results of the actual physical inventory counts, which generally occur in the second and fourth quarters of the year. Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as we progress toward earning those rebates, provided they are probable and reasonably estimable. Other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of agreement, or other systematic and rational approaches. Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Warehouse Closing costs We periodically evaluate our long lived assets for indicators of impairment, such as a decision to relocate or close a warehouse location. Our judgments are based on existing market and operational conditions. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring a downward adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value. We provide estimates for warehouse closing costs for both leased and owned locations to be closed or relocated. A considerable amount of judgment is involved in determining any impairment or our net liability, particularly related to the estimated sales price of owned locations and the potential sublease income at leased locations. These estimates are based on real estate conditions in the markets and our experience in those markets. We make assumptions about the average period of time it would take to sublease the location and the amount of potential sublease income for each leased location. We reassess our liability each quarter and adjust our liability accordingly when our estimates change. Insurance/Self Insurance Liabilities We use a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance pool, to provide for potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property damage, director and officers liability, vehicle liability, and 36 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions.

In 2008, the conversion of principle for Zero Coupon Notes after factoring the related debt discount was not significant. Derivatives Effective November 24, 2008, we adopted the disclosure requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities an Amendment of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 133 (SFAS 161). We follow SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (as amended) (SFAS 133), in accounting for derivative and hedging activities. We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in the normal course of our business, which we manage in part through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts, seeking to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on known future expenditures denominated in a foreign currency. The forward foreign exchange contracts are entered into primarily to hedge U.S. dollar merchandise inventory expenditures. Currently, these instruments do not qualify for derivative hedge accounting. We use these instruments to mitigate risk and do not intend to engage in speculative transactions. These contracts do not contain any credit risk related contingent features. We seek to manage the counterparty risk associated with these forward foreign exchange contracts by limiting transactions to counterparties with which we have established banking relationships. There can be no assurance, however, that this effectively mitigates counterparty risk. In addition, the contracts are limited to a time period of less than one year. See Note 1 and Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report, for additional information related to these contracts. We are exposed to risks due to fluctuations in energy prices, particularly electricity and natural gas, which we seek to partially mitigate through the use of fixed price contracts with counterparties for approximately 24% of our warehouses and other facilities in the U.S. and Canada. We also enter into variable priced contracts for some purchases of natural gas and fuel for our gas stations on an index basis. These contracts qualify for treatment as normal purchase or normal sales under SFAS 133 and require no mark to market adjustment. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements With the exception of our operating leases, we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition or consolidated financial statements. Stock Repurchase Programs In September and November of 2007, our Board of Directors approved $300 and $1,000, respectively, of stock repurchases, which expire in August 2010 and November 2010, respectively. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an additional $1,000, which expires in July 2011, bringing total authorizations by our Board of Directors since inception of the program in 2001 to $6,800. During 2009, we repurchased 895,000 shares at an average price of $63.84 per share totaling approximately $57. During 2008, we repurchased 13,812,000 shares of common stock, at an average price of $64.22 per share, totaling approximately $887. The remaining amount available to be purchased under 34 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) our approved plan was $2,002 at the end of 2009. Purchases are made from time to time as conditions warrant in the open market or in block purchases, and pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5 1. Repurchased shares are retired, in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments. We continue to review our accounting policies and evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, investments, merchandise inventory valuation, impairment of long lived assets, warehouse closing costs, insurance/self insurance liabilities, and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. Revenue Recognition We generally recognize sales, net of estimated returns, at the time the member takes possession of merchandise or receives services. When we collect payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services, the amount received is generally recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed. We provide for estimated sales returns based on historical trends in merchandise returns. Amounts collected from members, which under common trade practices are referred to as sales taxes, are recorded on a net basis. We evaluate the criteria of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal Versus Net as an Agent, in determining whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, when we are the primary obligor, subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, influence product or service specifications, or have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded on a gross basis. If we are not the primary obligor and do not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above, we record the net amounts as commissions earned, which is reflected in net sales. Membership fee revenue represents annual membership fees paid by substantially all of our members. We account for membership fee revenue on a deferred basis, whereby revenue is recognized ratably over the one year membership period. Our Executive members qualify for a 2% reward (which can be redeemed only at Costco warehouses), up to a maximum of $500 per year, on all qualified purchases made at Costco. We account for this 2% reward as a reduction in sales, with the related liability being classified within other current liabilities. The sales reduction and corresponding liability are computed after giving effect to the estimated impact of non redemptions based on historical data. Investments Investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other than temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and our intent and ability to hold the investment. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the issuer, including industry and sector performance, 35 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) operational and financing cash flow factors, and rating agency actions. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and or issuer conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments. Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, as determined primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting, and are stated using the last in, first out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all other foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail inventory method of accounting and are stated using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. We believe the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. We record an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the expected annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end. At the end of 2008, due to overall net inflationary trends, merchandise inventories valued at LIFO were lower than the FIFO value, resulting in a $32 charge to merchandise costs. During 2009, due to overall deflationary trends, we recorded a $32 benefit to merchandise costs to adjust inventories valued at LIFO. At the end of 2009 and 2007, merchandise inventories valued at LIFO approximated FIFO after considering the lower of cost or market principle. We provide for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts as a percentage of net sales. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect results of the actual physical inventory counts, which generally occur in the second and fourth quarters of the year. Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as we progress toward earning those rebates, provided they are probable and reasonably estimable. Other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of agreement, or other systematic and rational approaches. Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Warehouse Closing costs We periodically evaluate our long lived assets for indicators of impairment, such as a decision to relocate or close a warehouse location. Our judgments are based on existing market and operational conditions. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring a downward adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value. We provide estimates for warehouse closing costs for both leased and owned locations to be closed or relocated. A considerable amount of judgment is involved in determining any impairment or our net liability, particularly related to the estimated sales price of owned locations and the potential sublease income at leased locations. These estimates are based on real estate conditions in the markets and our experience in those markets. We make assumptions about the average period of time it would take to sublease the location and the amount of potential sublease income for each leased location. We reassess our liability each quarter and adjust our liability accordingly when our estimates change. Insurance/Self Insurance Liabilities We use a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance pool, to provide for potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property damage, director and officers liability, vehicle liability, and 36 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Income Taxes We adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48), which sets out criteria for the use of judgment in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items, at the beginning of 2008. The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Significant judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions. The benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in our consolidated financial statements only after determining a more likely than not probability that the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge, if any, from tax authorities. When facts and circumstances change, we reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the consolidated financial statements as appropriate. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See discussion of Recent Accounting Pronouncements in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report. Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to financial market risk resulting from fluctuations in interest and foreign currency exchange rates. We do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions, nor hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. The current condition of the financial markets, however, has rendered identifiable risks less predictable, and liquidity concerns and credit risks have increased. Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment holdings that are diversified amongst money market funds, debt securities, corporate notes and bonds, and enhanced money funds with effective maturities of generally three months to five years at the date of purchase. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while continuing to generate yields. A revised investment policy was approved in December 2007 by our Board of Directors, limiting future investments to direct U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations, repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations, and U.S. Government and Government Agency Money Market funds. The investment policies of our subsidiaries are consistent with our primary objective to preserve principal while continuing to generate yields. Our wholly owned insurance subsidiary invests in U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations, corporate notes and bonds, and asset and mortgage backed securities with a minimum overall portfolio average credit rating of AA. All of our foreign subsidiaries investments are primarily in money market funds, investment grade securities, bankers acceptances, bank certificates of deposit and term deposits, all denominated in their local currencies. Additionally, our Canadian subsidiary may invest a portion of its investments in U.S. dollar investment grade securities and bank term deposits to meet current U.S. dollar obligations. 37 Table of Contents Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) All of the investment policies of the Company and subsidiaries are reviewed at least annually. Because most of our investments in cash and cash equivalents are of a short term nature, if interest rates were to increase or decrease, the impact would likely be immaterial to our financial statements. Based on our overnight investments and bank balances within cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2009 and 2008, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $24 and $18 (pre tax), respectively, to interest income on an annual basis. For those investments that are classified as available for sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in market volatility and interest rates are reflected within stockholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive income. The nature and amount of our long and short term debt may vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As of the end of 2009, our fixed rate long term debt included: $42 principal amount at maturity of 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes carried at $32; $900 of 5.3% Senior Notes carried at $899; and $1,100 of 5.5% Senior Notes carried at $1,096, and additional notes and capital lease obligations totaling $228. Additionally, our variable rate long term debt included a 0.35% over Yen Tibor (6 month) Term Loan of $32. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt and may affect the interest expense related to the variable rate debt. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report for more information on our long and short term debt. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Our foreign subsidiaries conduct limited transactions in their non functional currencies, which exposes us to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We manage these fluctuations, in part, through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts, seeking to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on known future expenditures denominated in a foreign currency. As of August 30, 2009, and August 31, 2008, we held forward foreign exchange contracts with a notional amount of $183 and $90, respectively, and a fair value liability of $2 and a fair value asset of $5, respectively, on the consolidated balance sheets. A hypothetical 10% strengthening of the functional currency compared to the non functional currency exchange rates at August 30, 2009 and August 31, 2008 would have decreased the fair value of the contracts by $18 and $10, respectively.

Additionally, our variable rate long term debt included a 0.35% over Yen Tibor (6 month) Term Loan of $32. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt and may affect the interest expense related to the variable rate debt. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report for more information on our long and short term debt. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Our foreign subsidiaries conduct limited transactions in their non functional currencies, which exposes us to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We manage these fluctuations, in part, through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts, seeking to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on known future expenditures denominated in a foreign currency. As of August 30, 2009, and August 31, 2008, we held forward foreign exchange contracts with a notional amount of $183 and $90, respectively, and a fair value liability of $2 and a fair value asset of $5, respectively, on the consolidated balance sheets. A hypothetical 10% strengthening of the functional currency compared to the non functional currency exchange rates at August 30, 2009 and August 31, 2008 would have decreased the fair value of the contracts by $18 and $10, respectively. 
 
Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Income Taxes We adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48), which sets out criteria for the use of judgment in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items, at the beginning of 2008. The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Significant judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions. The benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in our consolidated financial statements only after determining a more likely than not probability that the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge, if any, from tax authorities. When facts and circumstances change, we reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the consolidated financial statements as appropriate.

Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to financial market risk resulting from fluctuations in interest and foreign currency exchange rates. We do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions, nor hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. The current condition of the financial markets, however, has rendered identifiable risks less predictable, and liquidity concerns and credit risks have increased. Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment holdings that are diversified amongst money market funds, debt securities, corporate notes and bonds, and enhanced money funds with effective maturities of generally three months to five years at the date of purchase. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while continuing to generate yields. A revised investment policy was approved in December 2007 by our Board of Directors, limiting future investments to direct U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations, repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations, and U.S. Government and Government Agency Money Market funds. The investment policies of our subsidiaries are consistent with our primary objective to preserve principal while continuing to generate yields. Our wholly owned insurance subsidiary invests in U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations, corporate notes and bonds, and asset and mortgage backed securities with a minimum overall portfolio average credit rating of AA. All of our foreign subsidiaries investments are primarily in money market funds, investment grade securities, bankers acceptances, bank certificates of deposit and term deposits, all denominated in their local currencies. Additionally, our Canadian subsidiary may invest a portion of its investments in U.S. dollar investment grade securities and bank term deposits to meet current U.S. dollar obligations. 37 Table of Contents Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) All of the investment policies of the Company and subsidiaries are reviewed at least annually. Because most of our investments in cash and cash equivalents are of a short term nature, if interest rates were to increase or decrease, the impact would likely be immaterial to our financial statements. Based on our overnight investments and bank balances within cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2009 and 2008, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $24 and $18 (pre tax), respectively, to interest income on an annual basis. For those investments that are classified as available for sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in market volatility and interest rates are reflected within stockholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive income.
