Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) OVERVIEW Our fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to August 31. References to 2010, 2009, and 2008 relate to the 52 week years ended August 29, 2010, August 30, 2009, and August 31, 2008, respectively. Certain percentages presented are calculated using actual results prior to rounding. Unless otherwise noted, references to net income relate to net income attributable to Costco. Key items for 2010 included: Net sales increased 9.1% from the prior year to $76,255, driven by a 7% increase in comparable sales (sales in warehouses open for at least one year, including relocated warehouses) and sales at the 13 new warehouses (14 opened and one closed due to relocation) in 2010. Net sales were positively impacted by the year over year increase in the price of gasoline and by the strengthening of certain foreign currency exchange rates; Membership fees increased 10.3% to $1,691; however, excluding the $27 charge recorded in 2009 related to a litigation settlement, membership fees increased 8.4%, due to new membership sign ups and increased penetration of the higher fee Executive Membership program; Gross margin (net sales less merchandise costs) as a percentage of net sales increased two basis points over the prior year; Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses as a percentage of net sales improved 10 basis points over the prior year; Net income increased 20% to $1,303, or $2.92 per diluted share, compared to $1,086, or $2.47 per diluted share, in 2009; The Board of Directors approved an increase in the quarterly cash dividend from $0.18 to $0.205 per share; We repurchased 9,943,000 shares of our common stock, at an average cost of $57.14 per share, totaling approximately $568; The Board of Directors appointed W. Craig Jelinek as Costcos President and Chief Operating Officer and elected him a director. Jim Sinegal will continue as Chief Executive Officer; and In May 2010, we announced the retirement of Dick DiCerchio, as our Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, effective June 4, 2010. We believe that the most important driver of increasing our profitability is sales growth, particularly comparable sales growth. Comparable sales growth is achieved through increasing the frequency with which our members shop and the amounts they spend on each visit. Sales comparisons can also be particularly influenced by two factors that are beyond our control, including fluctuations in currency exchange rates (with respect to the consolidation of the results of our international operations) and changes in the cost of gasoline and associated competitive conditions (primarily impacting domestic operations). The higher our comparable sales not associated with currency fluctuations the more we can leverage certain of our selling, general and administrative expenses, reducing them as a percentage of sales and enhancing profitability. Generating comparable sales growth is foremost a question of making available to our members the right merchandise at the right prices, a skill that we believe we have repeatedly demonstrated over the long term. Another substantial factor in sales growth is the health of the economies in which we do business, especially the United States. Adverse economic conditions negatively impacted spending by our customers during 2009 and 2010, and that negative impact may continue. Sales growth and our gross margin are also impacted by our competition, which is vigorous and widespread, including other warehouse clubs, discount, department, drug, variety and 20 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) specialty stores, and supermarkets, as well as internet retailers. While we cannot control or reliably predict general economic health or changes in competition, we believe that we have been successful historically in adapting our business to these changes, such as through adjustments to our pricing and to our merchandise mix, including increasing the penetration of our private label items. Our philosophy is not to focus in the short term on maximizing prices that our members can be charged but to maintain what we believe is a perception among our members of our pricing authority consistently providing the most competitive values. This may cause us, for example, to absorb increases in merchandise costs at certain times rather than immediately passing them along to our members, negatively impacting gross margin. We also achieve sales growth by opening new warehouses and relocating existing warehouses to larger facilities. As our warehouse base grows and available and desirable potential sites become more difficult to secure, square footage growth becomes a comparatively less substantial component of growth, but the negative aspects of such growth (including lower initial operating profitability relative to existing warehouses and cannibalization of sales at existing warehouse when openings occur in existing markets) are ameliorated. Our rate of square footage growth is higher in foreign markets, due to the smaller base in those markets, and we expect that to continue. Our financial performance also depends heavily on our ability to control costs. While we believe that we have achieved successes in this area historically, some significant costs are partially outside our control, most particularly health care expenses. With respect to expenses relating to the compensation of our employees, our philosophy is not to seek to minimize the wages and benefits that they earn. Rather, we believe that achieving our longer term objectives of reducing turnover and enhancing employee satisfaction requires maintaining compensation levels that are better than the industry average for much of our workforce. This may cause us, for example, to absorb costs that other employers might seek to pass through to their workforces. Because our business is operated on very low margins, modest changes in various items in the income statement, particularly gross margin and selling, general and administrative expenses, can have substantial impacts on net income. Results of Operations Net Sales 2010 2009 2008 Net sales $ 76,255 $ 69,889 $ 70,977 Net sales increase (decrease) 9.1 % (1.5 %) 12.5 % Increase (decrease) in comparable sales 7 % (4 %) 8 % Warehouse openings, net 13 15 24 2010 vs. 2009 Net Sales Net sales increased 9.1% during 2010 compared to 2009. The $6,366 increase was comprised of a $4,871 increase in comparable sales and the remainder primarily from sales at new warehouses opened during 2010 and 2009. Foreign currencies, particularly in Canada, Korea, and Japan, strengthened against the U.S. dollar, which positively impacted net sales during 2010 by approximately $1,570 (225 basis points). Net sales were also positively impacted by gasoline price inflation during 2010 by approximately $895 (128 basis points), which resulted from a 17% increase in the average sales price per gallon. 21 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Our sales results continue to be negatively impacted by general economic conditions, and those conditions may continue to have a significant adverse impact on spending by our members. We believe, however, that due to the nature of our business model, we are better positioned than many retailers to compete in such an environment. Comparable Sales Comparable sales increased 7% in 2010 and were positively impacted primarily by an increase in shopping frequency. Strengthening foreign currencies positively impacted comparable sales by approximately $1,510 (217 basis points) in 2010. Gasoline price inflation positively impacted comparable sales results by approximately $882 (126 basis points) during 2010. Reported comparable sales growth includes the negative impact of cannibalization (established warehouses losing sales to our newly opened locations). 2009 vs. 2008 Net Sales Our 2009 sales results, particularly in hardlines and softlines, were negatively impacted by general economic conditions. Net sales decreased 1.5% during 2009 compared to 2008. The $1,088 decrease was comprised of a $2,590 decrease in comparable sales, partially offset by an increase of $1,502 primarily from sales at new warehouses opened during 2009 and 2008. Our sales were also impacted by a lower number of warehouse openings year over year. Foreign currencies, particularly in Canada, the United Kingdom, and Korea, weakened against the U.S. dollar, which negatively impacted net sales during 2009 by approximately $2,421 (341 basis points). Net sales were also negatively impacted by gasoline price deflation during 2009 by approximately $2,164 (305 basis points), which resulted from a 30% decline in the average sales price per gallon. Comparable Sales Comparable sales decreased 4% in 2009. Weakening foreign currencies negatively impacted comparable sales by approximately $2,339 (333 basis points) in 2009. Gasoline price deflation negatively impacted comparable sales results by approximately $2,113 (298 basis points) during 2009. Comparable sales were negatively impacted by a decline in the average amount spent (after adjustment for gasoline price deflation and measured in local currencies), partially offset by an increase in shopping frequency. Reported comparable sales growth includes the negative impact of cannibalization. Membership Fees 2010 2009 2008 Membership fees $ 1,691 $ 1,533 $ 1,506 Membership fees increase 10.3 % 1.8 % 14.7 % Membership fees as a percent of net sales 2.22 % 2.19 % 2.12 % Total cardholders (000s) 58,000 56,000 53,500 22 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) 2010 vs. 2009 Membership fees increased 10.3% in 2010 compared to 2009. Membership fees in 2010 were positively impacted due to the increased penetration of our higher fee Executive Membership program, the continued benefit of membership sign ups at warehouses opened in 2009 and 2008, a 2009 $27 charge to membership fees related to a litigation settlement concerning our membership renewal policy, and the additional membership sign ups at the 13 new warehouses opened in 2010 (14 opened and one closed due to a relocation). Our member renewal rate, currently at 88% in the U.S. and Canada, is consistent with recent years. Foreign currencies, particularly in Canada, Korea, and Japan, strengthened against the U.S. dollar in 2010, which positively impacted membership fees by approximately $36. 2009 vs. 2008 Membership fees increased 1.8% in 2009 compared to 2008. The increase was primarily due to membership sign ups at the 15 new warehouses opened in 2009 (19 opened, two closed due to relocations, and two closed Costco Home locations), the continued benefit of membership sign ups at warehouses opened in 2008, and increased penetration of our higher fee Executive Membership program. This increase was negatively impacted by the $27 charge for the litigation settlement discussed above, the weakening of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar, particularly in Canada, the United Kingdom, and Korea, which negatively impacted membership fees during 2009 by approximately $50, and a lower number of warehouse openings year over year. Our member renewal rate at the end of 2009 was 87% in the U.S. and Canada. Gross Margin 2010 2009 2008 Gross margin $ 8,260 $ 7,554 $ 7,474 Gross margin increase 9.4 % 1.1 % 12.6 % Gross margin as a percent of net sales 10.83 % 10.81 % 10.53 % 2010 vs. 2009 Gross margin, as a percent of net sales, increased two basis points compared to 2009. The core merchandise gross margin, when expressed as a percent of core merchandise sales and not total net sales, increased 25 basis points year over year, with all categories showing increases. However, the increased sales penetration of the lower margin gasoline business caused this increase to be only six basis points when expressed as a percent of total net sales. Warehouse ancillary businesses gross margins increased by three basis points as a percent of total net sales. In addition, gross margin comparisons were negatively impacted by five basis points due to a favorable LIFO adjustment in 2009 compared to no adjustment in 2010. Increased penetration of the Executive Membership two percent reward program and increased spending by Executive Members negatively affected gross margin by two basis points. Foreign currencies, particularly in Canada, Korea, and Japan, strengthened against the U.S. dollar, which positively impacted gross margin for 2010 by approximately $183. 23 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) 2009 vs. 2008 Gross margin, as a percent of net sales, increased 28 basis points compared to 2008. This increase was primarily related to a net 18 basis point increase in our core merchandise departments, primarily in food and sundries, partially offset by a decrease in softlines, and a net seven basis point increase from our warehouse ancillary businesses, primarily our gasoline and pharmacy departments. The majority of this gross margin improvement was due to our lower margin gas business having lower sales penetration, resulting from the decline in the average selling price per gallon. Increased sales penetration of the Executive Membership two percent reward program negatively affected gross margin by six basis points. In addition, gross margin was favorably impacted by nine basis points due to reversing the $32 LIFO reserve established in the prior year as we experienced net deflation, year over year, in the cost of our merchandise inventories. Foreign currencies, particularly in Canada, the United Kingdom, and Korea, weakened against the U.S. dollar, which negatively impacted gross margin in 2009 by approximately $258. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 2010 2009 2008 Selling, general and administrative expenses $ 7,840 $ 7,252 $ 6,954 SG&A as a percent of net sales 10.28 % 10.38 % 9.80 % 2010 vs. 2009 SG&A expenses, as a percent of net sales, improved ten basis points compared to 2009. If the effect of gasoline price inflation on net sales in 2010 is excluded, these expenses increased three basis points compared to 2009. Warehouse operating costs, excluding the effect of gasoline price inflation, increased seven basis points, primarily due to higher employee benefit costs, particularly employee healthcare and workers compensation. SG&A expense comparisons were positively impacted by six basis points related to: the recovery of amounts expensed in fiscal 2007 and 2008 on behalf of certain employees in Canada to cover adverse tax consequences resulting from our previously announced stock option investigation; and a charge recorded in 2009 to write down the net realizable value of the cash surrender value of employee life insurance contracts with no comparable charge this year. Foreign currencies, particularly in Canada, Korea, and Japan, strengthened against the U.S. dollar, which negatively impacted SG&A for 2010 by approximately $140. 2009 vs. 2008 SG&A expenses, as a percent of net sales, increased 58 basis points compared to 2008. Increased warehouse operating and central administrative costs, as a percent of net sales, negatively impacted SG&A by approximately 56 basis points, resulting primarily from lower sales levels and higher employee health care costs. Higher stock based compensation expense had a negative impact of one basis point. In addition, we recorded an adjustment to the net realizable value of the cash surrender value of employee life insurance contracts, which negatively impacted SG&A, as a percent of net sales, by two basis points. The net realizable value of the insurance contracts is largely based on 24 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) changes in investment assets underlying the policies and is subject to conditions generally affecting equity and debt markets. In 2008, we recorded a $16 reserve in connection with a legal settlement, which positively impacted the comparison to current years SG&A expense, as a percent of net sales, by two basis points. SG&A expenses, as a percent of net sales, for 2009 were adversely impacted by the decrease in the price of gasoline, as it produced a decline in sales dollars without a comparative reduction in labor or other administrative costs. Foreign currencies, particularly in Canada, the United Kingdom, and Korea, weakened against the U.S. dollar, which positively impacted SG&A for 2009 by approximately $217. Preopening Expenses 2010 2009 2008 Preopening expenses $ 26 $ 41 $ 57 Warehouse openings, including relocations 14 19 34 Preopening expenses include costs incurred for startup operations related to new warehouses and the expansion of operations at existing warehouses. Preopening expenses can vary due to the timing of the warehouse opening relative to our year end, whether the warehouse is owned or leased, and whether the opening is in an existing, new, or international market. The 2009 preopening expense included costs related to several international warehouses that opened in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. Provision for Impaired Assets and Closing Costs, Net 2010 2009 2008 Warehouse closing expenses $ 6 $ 9 $ 9 Impairment of long lived assets 2 8 10 Net gains on the sale of real property (19 ) Provision for impaired assets & closing costs, net $ 8 $ 17 $ This provision primarily includes costs related to: impairment of long lived assets; future lease obligations of warehouses that have been closed or relocated to new facilities; accelerated depreciation, based on the shortened useful life through the expected closing date on buildings to be demolished or sold and that are not otherwise impaired; and gains and losses resulting from the sale of real property, largely comprised of former warehouse locations. 2010 vs. 2009 The net provision for impaired assets and closing costs was $8 in 2010, compared to $17 in 2009. The provision in 2010 included charges of $6 for warehouse closing expenses and impairment charges of $2. 2009 vs. 2008 The net provision for impaired assets and closing costs was $17 in 2009, compared to a nominal amount in 2008. The provision in 2009 included charges of $9 for warehouse closing expenses, and impairment charges of $8, primarily related to the closing of our two Costco Home locations in July 2009. The impairment charge in 2008 primarily related to a warehouse in Michigan that was demolished and rebuilt. 25 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) At the end of both 2010 and 2009, the reserve for warehouse closing costs was $5, and primarily related to future lease obligations. Interest Expense 2010 2009 2008 Interest expense $ 111 $ 108 $ 103 Interest expense primarily relates to our $900 of 5.3% and $1,100 of 5.5% Senior Notes (2007 Senior Notes) issued in 2007. Interest Income and Other, Net 2010 2009 2008 Earnings of affiliates and other, net $ 65 $ 31 $ 49 Interest income 23 27 96 Interest Income and other, net $ 88 $ 58 $ 145 2010 vs. 2009 The decrease in interest income is due to lower interest rates on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances. Interest income also includes a $12 other than temporary impairment loss recognized on certain securities within our investment portfolio in 2009. No impairment was recognized in 2010. The increase in earnings of affiliates and other is primarily due to an increase in earnings from our 50% owned joint venture in Mexico. Costco Mexicos earnings increased due to stronger sales and the Mexican peso strengthening against the U.S. dollar. The net gain on foreign currency transactions was $13 in 2010, but was not significant in 2009. These amounts generally relate to the difference between the foreign exchange rate in effect when title to merchandise inventory is transferred and the rate at the time of payment. In addition, there was a favorable $1 mark to market adjustment in 2010 compared to a negative $5 adjustment in 2009, related to our forward foreign exchange contracts. See Derivatives section for more information. 2009 vs. 2008 The decrease in interest income was largely due to lower interest rates on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances resulting from a change in policy to invest primarily in U.S. government and agency securities, which earn lower interest rates. In addition, we recognized $12 of other than temporary impairment losses on certain securities within our investment portfolio in 2009 compared to an impairment loss of $5 in 2008. The decrease in the earnings of affiliates was primarily attributable to lower earnings by our investment in Costco Mexico. Costco Mexicos earnings were lower in 2009, primarily due to the peso weakening against the U.S. dollar. In addition, there was a negative $5 mark to market adjustment in 2009 compared to a favorable $6 adjustment in 2008, related to our forward foreign exchange contracts. 26 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Provision for Income Taxes 2010 2009 2008 Income tax expense $ 731 $ 628 $ 716 Effective tax rate 35.6 % 36.4 % 35.6 % The decline in the effective tax rate from 2009 to 2010 is primarily attributable to a change in the mix of earnings between domestic and international operations. The 2009 effective tax rates also include the unfavorable impact of a write down on investments that were non deductible for tax purposes. The lower tax rate in 2008 was primarily attributable to discrete benefits recognized during the year. Net Income Attributable to Costco (Net Income) 2010 2009 2008 Net income $ 1,303 $ 1,086 $ 1,283 Net income per diluted share $ 2.92 $ 2.47 $ 2.89 Shares used to calculate diluted net income per diluted share (000s) 445,970 440,454 444,240 Diluted net income per share increase / (decrease) 18 % (15 %) 22 % 2010 vs. 2009 Net income for 2010 increased to $1,303, or $2.92 per diluted share, from $1,086, or $2.47 per diluted share, during 2009, representing an 18% increase in diluted net income per share. As previously discussed, foreign currencies, particularly in Canada, Korea and Japan, strengthened against the U.S. dollar, which positively impacted net income for 2010 by approximately $61 after tax, or $0.14 per diluted share. Various factors, discussed in detail above (including sales, membership fees, gross margin, and selling, general and administrative expenses), contributed to the increase in net income for 2010. 2009 vs. 2008 Net income for 2009 decreased to $1,086, or $2.47 per diluted share, from $1,283, or $2.89 per diluted share, during 2008, representing a 15% decrease in diluted net income per share. As previously discussed, foreign currencies, particularly in Canada, the United Kingdom and Korea, weakened against the U.S. dollar, which negatively impacted net income for 2009 by approximately $83 after tax, or $0.19 per diluted share. Various factors, discussed in detail above (including sales, membership fees, gross margin, and selling, general and administrative expenses), contributed to the decrease in net income for 2009. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The following table itemizes components of our most liquid assets at the end of 2010 and 2009 (dollars in millions, except per share data): 2010 2009 Cash and cash equivalents $ 3,214 $ 3,157 Short term investments 1,535 570 Total $ 4,749 $ 3,727 27 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from warehouse operations and cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances, which were $4,749 and $3,727 at the end of 2010 and 2009, respectively. Of these balances, approximately $862 and $758 at the end of 2010 and 2009, respectively, represented debit and credit card receivables, primarily related to sales in the week prior to the end of our fiscal year. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $2,780 in 2010 compared to $2,092 in 2009. This net increase of $688 was primarily attributable to a $371 decrease in our net investment in merchandise inventories (merchandise inventories less accounts payable), an increase in net income of $224, and a $141 increase from the change in our other current operating assets and liabilities. Net cash used in investing activities totaled $2,015 in 2010 compared to $1,101 in 2009, an increase of $914. This increase relates primarily to a $1,113 decrease in cash provided by the net investment in short term investments, partially offset by a $195 decrease in cash used for purchase of property and equipment. Net cash used in financing activities totaled $719 in 2010 compared to $439 in 2009, an increase of $280. This increase was primarily attributable to a $482 increase in cash used to repurchase common stock, a $78 increase in repayments of long term debt and a $42 increase in dividends paid. These were partially offset by a $124 increase in the net proceeds from stock based awards and, a $116 increase in the net proceeds from short term borrowings. The effect of exchange rate changes, increased cash by $11 in 2010, compared to a decrease of $14 in 2009. This increase was primarily due to the strengthening of foreign currencies, primarily in Canada, Korea, and Japan during 2010. Dividends In April 2010, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash dividend from $0.18 to $0.205 per share. Our quarterly cash dividends paid in 2010 totaled $0.77 per share, as compared to $0.68 per share in 2009. Contractual Obligations Our commitments at year end to make future payments under contractual obligations were as follows, as of August 29, 2010: Payments Due by Fiscal Year Contractual obligations 2011 2012 to2013 2014 to2015 2016 andthereafter Total Purchase obligations (merchandise)(1) $ 4,492 $ 1 $ $ $ 4,493 Long term debt(2) 111 1,073 126 1,379 2,689 Operating leases(3) 162 312 282 1,572 2,328 Purchase obligations (property, equipment, services and other)(4) 246 63 309 Construction commitments 186 186 Capital lease obligations(2) 10 20 22 256 308 Other(5) 6 4 2 26 38 Total $ 5,213 $ 1,473 $ 432 $ 3,233 $ 10,351 28 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) (1) Includes open merchandise purchase orders. (2) Includes contractual interest payments. (3) Operating lease obligations exclude amounts commonly referred to as common area maintenance, taxes, and insurance and have been reduced by $173 to reflect sub lease income. (4) The amounts exclude certain services negotiated at the individual warehouse or regional level that are not significant and generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty. (5) Consists of $26 in asset retirement obligations, $9 in deferred compensation obligations and includes $3 of current unrecognized tax benefits relating to uncertain tax positions. The total amount excludes $38 of noncurrent unrecognized tax benefits due to uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash payments. Expansion Plans Our primary requirement for capital is the financing of land, buildings, and equipment costs for new and remodeled warehouses. To a lesser extent, capital is also required for initial warehouse operations and working capital. While there can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized and plans are subject to change upon further review, it is our current intention to spend approximately $1,600 during fiscal 2011 for real estate, construction, remodeling, and equipment for warehouses and related operations. These expenditures are expected to be financed with a combination of cash provided from operations and existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. We plan to open up to 31 new warehouses in 2011, including one to two relocations of existing warehouses to larger and better located facilities. Additional Equity Investments in Subsidiaries and Joint Ventures Our investments in the Costco Mexico joint venture and in other unconsolidated joint ventures that are less than majority owned are accounted for under the equity method.

In November 2009, our Japanese subsidiary paid the outstanding principal and interest balances totaling $33 related to the 0.88% promissory notes due November 2009, originally issued in November 2002. In June 2008, our Japanese subsidiary entered into a ten year term loan in the amount of $35, with a variable rate of interest of Yen TIBOR (6 month) plus a 0.35% margin (0.84% and 0.95% at the end of 2010 and 2009, respectively) on the outstanding balance. Interest is payable semi annually in December and June and principal is due in June 2018. In October 2007, our Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes through a private placement in the amount of $77, bearing interest at 2.695%. Interest is payable semi annually, and principal is due in October 2017. We guarantee all of the promissory notes issued by our Japanese subsidiary. In February 2007, we issued $900 of 5.3% Senior Notes due March 15, 2012 (2012 Notes) at a discount of $2 and $1,100 of 5.5% Senior Notes due March 15, 2017 (2017 Notes) at a discount of $6 (together the 2007 Senior Notes). Interest on the 2007 Senior Notes is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The discount and issuance costs associated with the Senior Notes are being amortized to interest expense over the terms of those notes. At our option, we may redeem the 2007 Senior Notes at any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount of the 2007 Senior Notes to be redeemed, or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, we will be required to make an offer to purchase the 2007 Senior Notes at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase, upon certain events as defined by the terms of the 2007 Senior Notes. In August 1997, we sold $900 principal amount at maturity 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes (Zero Coupon Notes) due in August 2017. The Zero Coupon Notes were priced with a yield to maturity of 3.5%, resulting in gross proceeds to the Company of $450. The remaining Zero Coupon Notes outstanding are convertible into a maximum of 943,000 shares of Costco Common Stock shares at an initial conversion price of $22.71. Holders of the Zero Coupon Notes may require us to purchase the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of purchase) in August 2012. At our option, we may redeem the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of redemption) any time after August 2002. As of August 29, 2010, $859 in principal amount of Zero Coupon Notes had been converted by note holders to shares of Costco Common Stock, of which the principal converted during 2010, 2009 and 2008 is detailed in the table below: 2010 2009 2008 Principal converted during period $ 1 $ 25 $ 1 Principal converted, including the related debt discount $ 1 $ 19 $ 0 Shares issued upon conversion (000s) 18 562 13 Derivatives We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in the normal course of our business, which we manage, in part, through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts seeking to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on known future expenditures denominated in a foreign 32 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) currency. The contracts are intended primarily to hedge U.S. dollar merchandise inventory expenditures. Currently, these contracts do not qualify for derivative hedge accounting. We seek to mitigate risk with the use of these contracts and do not intend to engage in speculative transactions. These contracts do not contain any credit risk related contingent features. We seek to manage the counterparty risk associated with these contracts by limiting transactions to counterparties with which we have established banking relationships. There can be no assurance, however, that this practice effectively mitigates counterparty risk. The contracts are limited to less than one year. See Note 1 and Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report, for additional information related to these contracts. We are exposed to fluctuations in energy prices, particularly electricity and natural gas, which we seek to partially mitigate through the use of fixed price contracts for approximately 26% of our warehouses and other facilities in the U.S. and Canada. We also enter into variable priced contracts for some purchases of natural gas, in addition to fuel for our gas stations on an index basis. These contracts generally qualify for treatment as normal purchases or normal sales and require no mark to market adjustment. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements With the exception of our operating leases, we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition or consolidated financial statements. Stock Repurchase Programs In September and November of 2007, our Board of Directors approved $300 and $1,000, respectively, of stock repurchases, which expire in August 2010 and November 2010. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an additional $1,000, which expires in July 2011, bringing total authorizations by our Board of Directors since inception of the program in 2001 to $6,800. During 2010, we repurchased 9,943,000 shares of common stock, at an average price of $57.14 per share, totaling approximately $568. During 2009, we repurchased 895,000 shares of common stock, at an average price of $63.84 per share, totaling approximately $57. The remaining amount available to be purchased under our approved plan was $1,434 at the end of 2010, $434 of which expires in November 2010. Purchases are made from time to time, as conditions warrant, in the open market or in block purchases and pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5 1. Repurchased shares are retired, in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments. We continue to review our accounting policies and evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, investments, merchandise inventory valuation, impairment of long lived assets, warehouse closing costs, insurance/self insurance liabilities, and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. 33 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Revenue Recognition We generally recognize sales, net of estimated returns, at the time the member takes possession of merchandise or receives services. When we collect payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services, the amount received is generally recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed. We provide for estimated sales returns based on historical trends in merchandise returns. Amounts collected from members that under common trade practices are referred to as sales taxes are recorded on a net basis. We evaluate whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, when we are the primary obligor, subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, influence product or service specifications, or have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded on a gross basis. If we are not the primary obligor and do not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above, we record the net amounts as commissions earned, which is reflected in net sales. Membership fee revenue represents annual membership fees paid by our members. We account for membership fee revenue, net of estimated refunds, on a deferred basis, whereby revenue is recognized ratably over the one year membership period. Our Executive members qualify for a 2% reward (which can be redeemed only at Costco warehouses), up to a maximum of $500 per year, on qualified purchases made at Costco. We account for this 2% reward as a reduction in sales, with the related liability being classified within other current liabilities. The sales reduction and corresponding liability are computed after giving effect to the estimated impact of non redemptions based on historical data. Investments Investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other than temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment. We employ a methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and our intent and ability to hold the investment. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the issuer, including industry and sector performance, operational and financing cash flow factors, and rating agency actions. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and or issuer conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments. Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, as determined primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting, and are stated using the last in, first out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail inventory method of accounting and are stated using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. We believe the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. We record an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the expected annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end. At the end of 2008, due to overall net inflationary trends, merchandise 34 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) inventories valued at LIFO were lower than the FIFO value, resulting in a $32 charge to merchandise costs. During 2009, due to overall deflationary trends, we recorded a $32 benefit to merchandise costs to adjust inventories valued at LIFO. At the end of 2010 and 2009, merchandise inventories valued at LIFO approximated FIFO after considering the lower of cost or market principle. We provide for estimated inventory losses (shrink) between physical inventory counts as a percentage of net sales. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect results of the actual physical inventory counts, which generally occur in the second and fourth quarters of the year. Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as we progress toward earning those rebates, provided they are probable and reasonably estimable. Other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of agreement, or other systematic and rational approaches. Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Warehouse Closing costs We periodically evaluate our long lived assets for indicators of impairment, such as a decision to relocate or close a warehouse facility. Our judgments are based on existing market and operational conditions. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring a downward adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value. We provide estimates for warehouse closing costs for leased and owned locations to be closed or relocated. A considerable amount of judgment is involved in determining any impairment or our net liability, particularly related to the estimated sales price of owned locations and the potential sublease income at leased locations. These estimates are based on real estate conditions in the markets and our experience in those markets. We make assumptions about the average period of time it would take to sublease the location and the amount of potential sublease income for each leased location. We reassess our liability each quarter and adjust our liability accordingly when our estimates change. Insurance/Self Insurance Liabilities We use a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance pool, to provide for potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property damage, director and officers liability, vehicle liability, and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Income Taxes At the beginning of 2008, we adopted authoritative guidance related to uncertain tax positions, which sets out criteria for the use of judgment in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items. The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Significant judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions. The benefits associated with uncertain tax positions are recorded in our consolidated financial statements only after determining a more likely than not probability that the positions will withstand challenge from tax authorities. When facts and circumstances change, we reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the consolidated financial statements as appropriate. 35 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Recent Accounting Pronouncements See discussion of Recent Accounting Pronouncements in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report. Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to financial market risk resulting from fluctuations in interest and foreign currency exchange rates. We do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions or hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment holdings that are diversified among money market funds, U.S. Government and Agency debt securities, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insured corporate notes, and corporate notes and bonds with effective maturities of generally three months to five years at the date of purchase. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and secondarily to generate yields. The majority of our short term investments are in fixed interest rate securities. These securities are subject to changes in fair value due to interest rate fluctuations. A revised investment policy was approved in December 2007 by our Board of Directors, limiting future investments to direct U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations, repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations, and U.S. Government and Government Agency Money Market funds. The investment policies of our subsidiaries are consistent with our primary objective to preserve principal and secondarily to generate yields. Our wholly owned insurance subsidiary invests in U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations, corporate notes and bonds, and asset and mortgage backed securities with a minimum overall portfolio average credit rating of AAA. All of our foreign subsidiaries investments are primarily in money market funds, investment grade securities, bankers acceptances, bank certificates of deposit and term deposits, all denominated in their local currencies. Additionally, our Canadian subsidiary may invest a portion of its investments in U.S. dollar investment grade securities and bank term deposits to meet current U.S. dollar obligations. Because most of our investments in cash and cash equivalents are short term, interest rate changes are not likely be material to our financial statements. Based on our overnight investments and bank balances within cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2010 and 2009, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $23 and $24 (pre tax), respectively, to interest income on an annual basis. For those investments that are classified as available for sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in market volatility and interest rates are reflected within stockholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive income. The nature and amount of our long and short term debt may vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As of the end of 2010, our fixed rate long term debt included: $41 principal amount at maturity of 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes carried at $32; $900 of 5.3% Senior Notes carried at $899; and $1,100 of 5.5% Senior Notes carried at $1,096, and additional notes totaling $78. Additionally, our variable rate long term debt included a 0.35% over Yen Tibor (6 month) Term Loan of $35. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt and may affect the interest expense related to the variable rate debt. See 36 Table of Contents Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report for more information on our long and short term debt. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Our foreign subsidiaries conduct limited transactions in their non functional currencies, which exposes us to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We manage these fluctuations, in part, through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts, seeking to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on known future expenditures denominated in a foreign currency. As of August 29, 2010, and August 30, 2009, we held forward foreign exchange contracts with a notional amount of $225 and $183, respectively. At the end of 2010 and 2009, fair value assets of $1 and $2, respectively, and a fair value liabilities of $3 and $4, respectively, were recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. A hypothetical 10% strengthening of the functional currency compared to the non functional currency exchange rates at August 29, 2010 and August 30, 2009 would have decreased the fair value of the contracts by $23 and $18, respectively. 
 
Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) specialty stores, and supermarkets, as well as internet retailers. While we cannot control or reliably predict general economic health or changes in competition, we believe that we have been successful historically in adapting our business to these changes, such as through adjustments to our pricing and to our merchandise mix, including increasing the penetration of our private label items. Our philosophy is not to focus in the short term on maximizing prices that our members can be charged but to maintain what we believe is a perception among our members of our pricing authority consistently providing the most competitive values. This may cause us, for example, to absorb increases in merchandise costs at certain times rather than immediately passing them along to our members, negatively impacting gross margin. We also achieve sales growth by opening new warehouses and relocating existing warehouses to larger facilities. As our warehouse base grows and available and desirable potential sites become more difficult to secure, square footage growth becomes a comparatively less substantial component of growth, but the negative aspects of such growth (including lower initial operating profitability relative to existing warehouses and cannibalization of sales at existing warehouse when openings occur in existing markets) are ameliorated. Our rate of square footage growth is higher in foreign markets, due to the smaller base in those markets, and we expect that to continue. Our financial performance also depends heavily on our ability to control costs. While we believe that we have achieved successes in this area historically, some significant costs are partially outside our control, most particularly health care expenses. With respect to expenses relating to the compensation of our employees, our philosophy is not to seek to minimize the wages and benefits that they earn. Rather, we believe that achieving our longer term objectives of reducing turnover and enhancing employee satisfaction requires maintaining compensation levels that are better than the industry average for much of our workforce. This may cause us, for example, to absorb costs that other employers might seek to pass through to their workforces. Because our business is operated on very low margins, modest changes in various items in the income statement, particularly gross margin and selling, general and administrative expenses, can have substantial impacts on net income. Results of Operations Net Sales 2010 2009 2008 Net sales $ 76,255 $ 69,889 $ 70,977 Net sales increase (decrease) 9.1 % (1.5 %) 12.5 % Increase (decrease) in comparable sales 7 % (4 %) 8 % Warehouse openings, net 13 15 24 2010 vs. 2009 Net Sales Net sales increased 9.1% during 2010 compared to 2009. The $6,366 increase was comprised of a $4,871 increase in comparable sales and the remainder primarily from sales at new warehouses opened during 2010 and 2009. Foreign currencies, particularly in Canada, Korea, and Japan, strengthened against the U.S. dollar, which positively impacted net sales during 2010 by approximately $1,570 (225 basis points). Net sales were also positively impacted by gasoline price inflation during 2010 by approximately $895 (128 basis points), which resulted from a 17% increase in the average sales price per gallon. 21 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Our sales results continue to be negatively impacted by general economic conditions, and those conditions may continue to have a significant adverse impact on spending by our members. We believe, however, that due to the nature of our business model, we are better positioned than many retailers to compete in such an environment. Comparable Sales Comparable sales increased 7% in 2010 and were positively impacted primarily by an increase in shopping frequency. Strengthening foreign currencies positively impacted comparable sales by approximately $1,510 (217 basis points) in 2010. Gasoline price inflation positively impacted comparable sales results by approximately $882 (126 basis points) during 2010. Reported comparable sales growth includes the negative impact of cannibalization (established warehouses losing sales to our newly opened locations). 2009 vs. 2008 Net Sales Our 2009 sales results, particularly in hardlines and softlines, were negatively impacted by general economic conditions. Net sales decreased 1.5% during 2009 compared to 2008. The $1,088 decrease was comprised of a $2,590 decrease in comparable sales, partially offset by an increase of $1,502 primarily from sales at new warehouses opened during 2009 and 2008. Our sales were also impacted by a lower number of warehouse openings year over year. Foreign currencies, particularly in Canada, the United Kingdom, and Korea, weakened against the U.S. dollar, which negatively impacted net sales during 2009 by approximately $2,421 (341 basis points). Net sales were also negatively impacted by gasoline price deflation during 2009 by approximately $2,164 (305 basis points), which resulted from a 30% decline in the average sales price per gallon. Comparable Sales Comparable sales decreased 4% in 2009. Weakening foreign currencies negatively impacted comparable sales by approximately $2,339 (333 basis points) in 2009. Gasoline price deflation negatively impacted comparable sales results by approximately $2,113 (298 basis points) during 2009. Comparable sales were negatively impacted by a decline in the average amount spent (after adjustment for gasoline price deflation and measured in local currencies), partially offset by an increase in shopping frequency. Reported comparable sales growth includes the negative impact of cannibalization. Membership Fees 2010 2009 2008 Membership fees $ 1,691 $ 1,533 $ 1,506 Membership fees increase 10.3 % 1.8 % 14.7 % Membership fees as a percent of net sales 2.22 % 2.19 % 2.12 % Total cardholders (000s) 58,000 56,000 53,500 22 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) 2010 vs. 2009 Membership fees increased 10.3% in 2010 compared to 2009. Membership fees in 2010 were positively impacted due to the increased penetration of our higher fee Executive Membership program, the continued benefit of membership sign ups at warehouses opened in 2009 and 2008, a 2009 $27 charge to membership fees related to a litigation settlement concerning our membership renewal policy, and the additional membership sign ups at the 13 new warehouses opened in 2010 (14 opened and one closed due to a relocation). Our member renewal rate, currently at 88% in the U.S. and Canada, is consistent with recent years. Foreign currencies, particularly in Canada, Korea, and Japan, strengthened against the U.S. dollar in 2010, which positively impacted membership fees by approximately $36. 2009 vs. 2008 Membership fees increased 1.8% in 2009 compared to 2008. The increase was primarily due to membership sign ups at the 15 new warehouses opened in 2009 (19 opened, two closed due to relocations, and two closed Costco Home locations), the continued benefit of membership sign ups at warehouses opened in 2008, and increased penetration of our higher fee Executive Membership program. This increase was negatively impacted by the $27 charge for the litigation settlement discussed above, the weakening of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar, particularly in Canada, the United Kingdom, and Korea, which negatively impacted membership fees during 2009 by approximately $50, and a lower number of warehouse openings year over year. Our member renewal rate at the end of 2009 was 87% in the U.S. and Canada. Gross Margin 2010 2009 2008 Gross margin $ 8,260 $ 7,554 $ 7,474 Gross margin increase 9.4 % 1.1 % 12.6 % Gross margin as a percent of net sales 10.83 % 10.81 % 10.53 % 2010 vs. 2009 Gross margin, as a percent of net sales, increased two basis points compared to 2009. The core merchandise gross margin, when expressed as a percent of core merchandise sales and not total net sales, increased 25 basis points year over year, with all categories showing increases. However, the increased sales penetration of the lower margin gasoline business caused this increase to be only six basis points when expressed as a percent of total net sales. Warehouse ancillary businesses gross margins increased by three basis points as a percent of total net sales. In addition, gross margin comparisons were negatively impacted by five basis points due to a favorable LIFO adjustment in 2009 compared to no adjustment in 2010. Increased penetration of the Executive Membership two percent reward program and increased spending by Executive Members negatively affected gross margin by two basis points. Foreign currencies, particularly in Canada, Korea, and Japan, strengthened against the U.S. dollar, which positively impacted gross margin for 2010 by approximately $183. 23 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) 2009 vs. 2008 Gross margin, as a percent of net sales, increased 28 basis points compared to 2008. This increase was primarily related to a net 18 basis point increase in our core merchandise departments, primarily in food and sundries, partially offset by a decrease in softlines, and a net seven basis point increase from our warehouse ancillary businesses, primarily our gasoline and pharmacy departments. The majority of this gross margin improvement was due to our lower margin gas business having lower sales penetration, resulting from the decline in the average selling price per gallon. Increased sales penetration of the Executive Membership two percent reward program negatively affected gross margin by six basis points. In addition, gross margin was favorably impacted by nine basis points due to reversing the $32 LIFO reserve established in the prior year as we experienced net deflation, year over year, in the cost of our merchandise inventories. Foreign currencies, particularly in Canada, the United Kingdom, and Korea, weakened against the U.S. dollar, which negatively impacted gross margin in 2009 by approximately $258. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 2010 2009 2008 Selling, general and administrative expenses $ 7,840 $ 7,252 $ 6,954 SG&A as a percent of net sales 10.28 % 10.38 % 9.80 % 2010 vs. 2009 SG&A expenses, as a percent of net sales, improved ten basis points compared to 2009. If the effect of gasoline price inflation on net sales in 2010 is excluded, these expenses increased three basis points compared to 2009. Warehouse operating costs, excluding the effect of gasoline price inflation, increased seven basis points, primarily due to higher employee benefit costs, particularly employee healthcare and workers compensation. SG&A expense comparisons were positively impacted by six basis points related to: the recovery of amounts expensed in fiscal 2007 and 2008 on behalf of certain employees in Canada to cover adverse tax consequences resulting from our previously announced stock option investigation; and a charge recorded in 2009 to write down the net realizable value of the cash surrender value of employee life insurance contracts with no comparable charge this year. Foreign currencies, particularly in Canada, Korea, and Japan, strengthened against the U.S. dollar, which negatively impacted SG&A for 2010 by approximately $140. 2009 vs. 2008 SG&A expenses, as a percent of net sales, increased 58 basis points compared to 2008. Increased warehouse operating and central administrative costs, as a percent of net sales, negatively impacted SG&A by approximately 56 basis points, resulting primarily from lower sales levels and higher employee health care costs. Higher stock based compensation expense had a negative impact of one basis point. In addition, we recorded an adjustment to the net realizable value of the cash surrender value of employee life insurance contracts, which negatively impacted SG&A, as a percent of net sales, by two basis points. The net realizable value of the insurance contracts is largely based on 24 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) changes in investment assets underlying the policies and is subject to conditions generally affecting equity and debt markets. In 2008, we recorded a $16 reserve in connection with a legal settlement, which positively impacted the comparison to current years SG&A expense, as a percent of net sales, by two basis points. SG&A expenses, as a percent of net sales, for 2009 were adversely impacted by the decrease in the price of gasoline, as it produced a decline in sales dollars without a comparative reduction in labor or other administrative costs. Foreign currencies, particularly in Canada, the United Kingdom, and Korea, weakened against the U.S. dollar, which positively impacted SG&A for 2009 by approximately $217. Preopening Expenses 2010 2009 2008 Preopening expenses $ 26 $ 41 $ 57 Warehouse openings, including relocations 14 19 34 Preopening expenses include costs incurred for startup operations related to new warehouses and the expansion of operations at existing warehouses. Preopening expenses can vary due to the timing of the warehouse opening relative to our year end, whether the warehouse is owned or leased, and whether the opening is in an existing, new, or international market. The 2009 preopening expense included costs related to several international warehouses that opened in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. Provision for Impaired Assets and Closing Costs, Net 2010 2009 2008 Warehouse closing expenses $ 6 $ 9 $ 9 Impairment of long lived assets 2 8 10 Net gains on the sale of real property (19 ) Provision for impaired assets & closing costs, net $ 8 $ 17 $ This provision primarily includes costs related to: impairment of long lived assets; future lease obligations of warehouses that have been closed or relocated to new facilities; accelerated depreciation, based on the shortened useful life through the expected closing date on buildings to be demolished or sold and that are not otherwise impaired; and gains and losses resulting from the sale of real property, largely comprised of former warehouse locations. 2010 vs. 2009 The net provision for impaired assets and closing costs was $8 in 2010, compared to $17 in 2009. The provision in 2010 included charges of $6 for warehouse closing expenses and impairment charges of $2. 2009 vs. 2008 The net provision for impaired assets and closing costs was $17 in 2009, compared to a nominal amount in 2008. The provision in 2009 included charges of $9 for warehouse closing expenses, and impairment charges of $8, primarily related to the closing of our two Costco Home locations in July 2009. The impairment charge in 2008 primarily related to a warehouse in Michigan that was demolished and rebuilt. 25 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) At the end of both 2010 and 2009, the reserve for warehouse closing costs was $5, and primarily related to future lease obligations. Interest Expense 2010 2009 2008 Interest expense $ 111 $ 108 $ 103 Interest expense primarily relates to our $900 of 5.3% and $1,100 of 5.5% Senior Notes (2007 Senior Notes) issued in 2007. Interest Income and Other, Net 2010 2009 2008 Earnings of affiliates and other, net $ 65 $ 31 $ 49 Interest income 23 27 96 Interest Income and other, net $ 88 $ 58 $ 145 2010 vs. 2009 The decrease in interest income is due to lower interest rates on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances. Interest income also includes a $12 other than temporary impairment loss recognized on certain securities within our investment portfolio in 2009. No impairment was recognized in 2010. The increase in earnings of affiliates and other is primarily due to an increase in earnings from our 50% owned joint venture in Mexico. Costco Mexicos earnings increased due to stronger sales and the Mexican peso strengthening against the U.S. dollar. The net gain on foreign currency transactions was $13 in 2010, but was not significant in 2009. These amounts generally relate to the difference between the foreign exchange rate in effect when title to merchandise inventory is transferred and the rate at the time of payment. In addition, there was a favorable $1 mark to market adjustment in 2010 compared to a negative $5 adjustment in 2009, related to our forward foreign exchange contracts. See Derivatives section for more information. 2009 vs. 2008 The decrease in interest income was largely due to lower interest rates on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances resulting from a change in policy to invest primarily in U.S. government and agency securities, which earn lower interest rates. In addition, we recognized $12 of other than temporary impairment losses on certain securities within our investment portfolio in 2009 compared to an impairment loss of $5 in 2008. The decrease in the earnings of affiliates was primarily attributable to lower earnings by our investment in Costco Mexico. Costco Mexicos earnings were lower in 2009, primarily due to the peso weakening against the U.S. dollar. In addition, there was a negative $5 mark to market adjustment in 2009 compared to a favorable $6 adjustment in 2008, related to our forward foreign exchange contracts. 26 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Provision for Income Taxes 2010 2009 2008 Income tax expense $ 731 $ 628 $ 716 Effective tax rate 35.6 % 36.4 % 35.6 % The decline in the effective tax rate from 2009 to 2010 is primarily attributable to a change in the mix of earnings between domestic and international operations. The 2009 effective tax rates also include the unfavorable impact of a write down on investments that were non deductible for tax purposes. The lower tax rate in 2008 was primarily attributable to discrete benefits recognized during the year. Net Income Attributable to Costco (Net Income) 2010 2009 2008 Net income $ 1,303 $ 1,086 $ 1,283 Net income per diluted share $ 2.92 $ 2.47 $ 2.89 Shares used to calculate diluted net income per diluted share (000s) 445,970 440,454 444,240 Diluted net income per share increase / (decrease) 18 % (15 %) 22 % 2010 vs. 2009 Net income for 2010 increased to $1,303, or $2.92 per diluted share, from $1,086, or $2.47 per diluted share, during 2009, representing an 18% increase in diluted net income per share. As previously discussed, foreign currencies, particularly in Canada, Korea and Japan, strengthened against the U.S. dollar, which positively impacted net income for 2010 by approximately $61 after tax, or $0.14 per diluted share. Various factors, discussed in detail above (including sales, membership fees, gross margin, and selling, general and administrative expenses), contributed to the increase in net income for 2010. 2009 vs. 2008 Net income for 2009 decreased to $1,086, or $2.47 per diluted share, from $1,283, or $2.89 per diluted share, during 2008, representing a 15% decrease in diluted net income per share. As previously discussed, foreign currencies, particularly in Canada, the United Kingdom and Korea, weakened against the U.S. dollar, which negatively impacted net income for 2009 by approximately $83 after tax, or $0.19 per diluted share. Various factors, discussed in detail above (including sales, membership fees, gross margin, and selling, general and administrative expenses), contributed to the decrease in net income for 2009. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The following table itemizes components of our most liquid assets at the end of 2010 and 2009 (dollars in millions, except per share data): 2010 2009 Cash and cash equivalents $ 3,214 $ 3,157 Short term investments 1,535 570 Total $ 4,749 $ 3,727 27 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from warehouse operations and cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances, which were $4,749 and $3,727 at the end of 2010 and 2009, respectively. Of these balances, approximately $862 and $758 at the end of 2010 and 2009, respectively, represented debit and credit card receivables, primarily related to sales in the week prior to the end of our fiscal year. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $2,780 in 2010 compared to $2,092 in 2009. This net increase of $688 was primarily attributable to a $371 decrease in our net investment in merchandise inventories (merchandise inventories less accounts payable), an increase in net income of $224, and a $141 increase from the change in our other current operating assets and liabilities. Net cash used in investing activities totaled $2,015 in 2010 compared to $1,101 in 2009, an increase of $914. This increase relates primarily to a $1,113 decrease in cash provided by the net investment in short term investments, partially offset by a $195 decrease in cash used for purchase of property and equipment. Net cash used in financing activities totaled $719 in 2010 compared to $439 in 2009, an increase of $280. This increase was primarily attributable to a $482 increase in cash used to repurchase common stock, a $78 increase in repayments of long term debt and a $42 increase in dividends paid. These were partially offset by a $124 increase in the net proceeds from stock based awards and, a $116 increase in the net proceeds from short term borrowings. The effect of exchange rate changes, increased cash by $11 in 2010, compared to a decrease of $14 in 2009. This increase was primarily due to the strengthening of foreign currencies, primarily in Canada, Korea, and Japan during 2010. Dividends In April 2010, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash dividend from $0.18 to $0.205 per share. Our quarterly cash dividends paid in 2010 totaled $0.77 per share, as compared to $0.68 per share in 2009. Contractual Obligations Our commitments at year end to make future payments under contractual obligations were as follows, as of August 29, 2010: Payments Due by Fiscal Year Contractual obligations 2011 2012 to2013 2014 to2015 2016 andthereafter Total Purchase obligations (merchandise)(1) $ 4,492 $ 1 $ $ $ 4,493 Long term debt(2) 111 1,073 126 1,379 2,689 Operating leases(3) 162 312 282 1,572 2,328 Purchase obligations (property, equipment, services and other)(4) 246 63 309 Construction commitments 186 186 Capital lease obligations(2) 10 20 22 256 308 Other(5) 6 4 2 26 38 Total $ 5,213 $ 1,473 $ 432 $ 3,233 $ 10,351 28 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) (1) Includes open merchandise purchase orders. (2) Includes contractual interest payments. (3) Operating lease obligations exclude amounts commonly referred to as common area maintenance, taxes, and insurance and have been reduced by $173 to reflect sub lease income. (4) The amounts exclude certain services negotiated at the individual warehouse or regional level that are not significant and generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty. (5) Consists of $26 in asset retirement obligations, $9 in deferred compensation obligations and includes $3 of current unrecognized tax benefits relating to uncertain tax positions. The total amount excludes $38 of noncurrent unrecognized tax benefits due to uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash payments. Expansion Plans Our primary requirement for capital is the financing of land, buildings, and equipment costs for new and remodeled warehouses. To a lesser extent, capital is also required for initial warehouse operations and working capital. While there can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized and plans are subject to change upon further review, it is our current intention to spend approximately $1,600 during fiscal 2011 for real estate, construction, remodeling, and equipment for warehouses and related operations. These expenditures are expected to be financed with a combination of cash provided from operations and existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. We plan to open up to 31 new warehouses in 2011, including one to two relocations of existing warehouses to larger and better located facilities. Additional Equity Investments in Subsidiaries and Joint Ventures Our investments in the Costco Mexico joint venture and in other unconsolidated joint ventures that are less than majority owned are accounted for under the equity method. We did not make any capital contributions to Costco Mexico (a 50% owned joint venture) in 2010, 2009, or 2008. 29 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Bank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs Credit FacilityDescription ExpirationDate Credit Line Usage atAugust 29, 2010 ApplicableInterestRate Entity Total ofall CreditFacilities Stand byLetter ofCredit(LC) &Letter ofGuaranty CommercialLC Short TermBorrowing AvailableCredit U.S. UncommittedStandby LC N/A $ 22 $ 22 $ $ $ N/A U.S. UncommittedCommercial LC N/A 50 9 41 N/A Australia(1) Guarantee Line N/A 9 9 N/A Canada(1)(3) Multi PurposeLine N/A 28 16 12 2.25 % Japan(1) Revolving Credit March 11 41 13 28 0.61 % Japan(1) Bank Guaranty March 11 18 18 N/A Japan(1) Revolving Credit February 11 41 13 28 0.61 % Japan(2) Commercial LC N/A 1 1 N/A Korea(1) Multi PurposeLine March 11 10 2 8 3.63 % Taiwan Multi PurposeLine January 11 22 5 17 2.63 % Taiwan Multi PurposeLine July 11 16 3 13 2.65 % United Kingdom UncommittedMoney MarketLine N/A 31 31 3.05 % United Kingdom UncommittedOverdraft Line N/A 46 46 1.50 % United Kingdom(2) Letter ofGuarantee N/A 3 3 N/A United Kingdom Commercial LC N/A 3 1 2 N/A TOTAL $ 341 $ 70 $ 9 $ 26 $ 236 (1) The U.S. parent company, Costco Wholesale Corporation, guarantees this entitys credit facility.

In November 2009, our Japanese subsidiary paid the outstanding principal and interest balances totaling $33 related to the 0.88% promissory notes due November 2009, originally issued in November 2002. In June 2008, our Japanese subsidiary entered into a ten year term loan in the amount of $35, with a variable rate of interest of Yen TIBOR (6 month) plus a 0.35% margin (0.84% and 0.95% at the end of 2010 and 2009, respectively) on the outstanding balance. Interest is payable semi annually in December and June and principal is due in June 2018. In October 2007, our Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes through a private placement in the amount of $77, bearing interest at 2.695%. Interest is payable semi annually, and principal is due in October 2017. We guarantee all of the promissory notes issued by our Japanese subsidiary. In February 2007, we issued $900 of 5.3% Senior Notes due March 15, 2012 (2012 Notes) at a discount of $2 and $1,100 of 5.5% Senior Notes due March 15, 2017 (2017 Notes) at a discount of $6 (together the 2007 Senior Notes). Interest on the 2007 Senior Notes is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The discount and issuance costs associated with the Senior Notes are being amortized to interest expense over the terms of those notes. At our option, we may redeem the 2007 Senior Notes at any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount of the 2007 Senior Notes to be redeemed, or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, we will be required to make an offer to purchase the 2007 Senior Notes at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase, upon certain events as defined by the terms of the 2007 Senior Notes. In August 1997, we sold $900 principal amount at maturity 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes (Zero Coupon Notes) due in August 2017. The Zero Coupon Notes were priced with a yield to maturity of 3.5%, resulting in gross proceeds to the Company of $450. The remaining Zero Coupon Notes outstanding are convertible into a maximum of 943,000 shares of Costco Common Stock shares at an initial conversion price of $22.71. Holders of the Zero Coupon Notes may require us to purchase the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of purchase) in August 2012. At our option, we may redeem the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of redemption) any time after August 2002. As of August 29, 2010, $859 in principal amount of Zero Coupon Notes had been converted by note holders to shares of Costco Common Stock, of which the principal converted during 2010, 2009 and 2008 is detailed in the table below: 2010 2009 2008 Principal converted during period $ 1 $ 25 $ 1 Principal converted, including the related debt discount $ 1 $ 19 $ 0 Shares issued upon conversion (000s) 18 562 13 Derivatives We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in the normal course of our business, which we manage, in part, through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts seeking to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on known future expenditures denominated in a foreign 32 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) currency. The contracts are intended primarily to hedge U.S. dollar merchandise inventory expenditures. Currently, these contracts do not qualify for derivative hedge accounting. We seek to mitigate risk with the use of these contracts and do not intend to engage in speculative transactions. These contracts do not contain any credit risk related contingent features. We seek to manage the counterparty risk associated with these contracts by limiting transactions to counterparties with which we have established banking relationships. There can be no assurance, however, that this practice effectively mitigates counterparty risk. The contracts are limited to less than one year. See Note 1 and Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report, for additional information related to these contracts. We are exposed to fluctuations in energy prices, particularly electricity and natural gas, which we seek to partially mitigate through the use of fixed price contracts for approximately 26% of our warehouses and other facilities in the U.S. and Canada. We also enter into variable priced contracts for some purchases of natural gas, in addition to fuel for our gas stations on an index basis. These contracts generally qualify for treatment as normal purchases or normal sales and require no mark to market adjustment. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements With the exception of our operating leases, we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition or consolidated financial statements. Stock Repurchase Programs In September and November of 2007, our Board of Directors approved $300 and $1,000, respectively, of stock repurchases, which expire in August 2010 and November 2010. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an additional $1,000, which expires in July 2011, bringing total authorizations by our Board of Directors since inception of the program in 2001 to $6,800. During 2010, we repurchased 9,943,000 shares of common stock, at an average price of $57.14 per share, totaling approximately $568. During 2009, we repurchased 895,000 shares of common stock, at an average price of $63.84 per share, totaling approximately $57. The remaining amount available to be purchased under our approved plan was $1,434 at the end of 2010, $434 of which expires in November 2010. Purchases are made from time to time, as conditions warrant, in the open market or in block purchases and pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5 1. Repurchased shares are retired, in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments. We continue to review our accounting policies and evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, investments, merchandise inventory valuation, impairment of long lived assets, warehouse closing costs, insurance/self insurance liabilities, and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. 33 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Revenue Recognition We generally recognize sales, net of estimated returns, at the time the member takes possession of merchandise or receives services. When we collect payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services, the amount received is generally recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed. We provide for estimated sales returns based on historical trends in merchandise returns. Amounts collected from members that under common trade practices are referred to as sales taxes are recorded on a net basis. We evaluate whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, when we are the primary obligor, subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, influence product or service specifications, or have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded on a gross basis. If we are not the primary obligor and do not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above, we record the net amounts as commissions earned, which is reflected in net sales. Membership fee revenue represents annual membership fees paid by our members. We account for membership fee revenue, net of estimated refunds, on a deferred basis, whereby revenue is recognized ratably over the one year membership period. Our Executive members qualify for a 2% reward (which can be redeemed only at Costco warehouses), up to a maximum of $500 per year, on qualified purchases made at Costco. We account for this 2% reward as a reduction in sales, with the related liability being classified within other current liabilities. The sales reduction and corresponding liability are computed after giving effect to the estimated impact of non redemptions based on historical data. Investments Investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other than temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment. We employ a methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and our intent and ability to hold the investment. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the issuer, including industry and sector performance, operational and financing cash flow factors, and rating agency actions. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and or issuer conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments. Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, as determined primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting, and are stated using the last in, first out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail inventory method of accounting and are stated using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. We believe the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. We record an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the expected annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end. At the end of 2008, due to overall net inflationary trends, merchandise 34 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) inventories valued at LIFO were lower than the FIFO value, resulting in a $32 charge to merchandise costs. During 2009, due to overall deflationary trends, we recorded a $32 benefit to merchandise costs to adjust inventories valued at LIFO. At the end of 2010 and 2009, merchandise inventories valued at LIFO approximated FIFO after considering the lower of cost or market principle. We provide for estimated inventory losses (shrink) between physical inventory counts as a percentage of net sales. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect results of the actual physical inventory counts, which generally occur in the second and fourth quarters of the year. Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as we progress toward earning those rebates, provided they are probable and reasonably estimable. Other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of agreement, or other systematic and rational approaches. Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Warehouse Closing costs We periodically evaluate our long lived assets for indicators of impairment, such as a decision to relocate or close a warehouse facility. Our judgments are based on existing market and operational conditions. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring a downward adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value. We provide estimates for warehouse closing costs for leased and owned locations to be closed or relocated. A considerable amount of judgment is involved in determining any impairment or our net liability, particularly related to the estimated sales price of owned locations and the potential sublease income at leased locations. These estimates are based on real estate conditions in the markets and our experience in those markets. We make assumptions about the average period of time it would take to sublease the location and the amount of potential sublease income for each leased location. We reassess our liability each quarter and adjust our liability accordingly when our estimates change. Insurance/Self Insurance Liabilities We use a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance pool, to provide for potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property damage, director and officers liability, vehicle liability, and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Income Taxes At the beginning of 2008, we adopted authoritative guidance related to uncertain tax positions, which sets out criteria for the use of judgment in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items. The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Significant judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions. The benefits associated with uncertain tax positions are recorded in our consolidated financial statements only after determining a more likely than not probability that the positions will withstand challenge from tax authorities. When facts and circumstances change, we reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the consolidated financial statements as appropriate. 35 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Recent Accounting Pronouncements See discussion of Recent Accounting Pronouncements in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report. Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to financial market risk resulting from fluctuations in interest and foreign currency exchange rates. We do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions or hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment holdings that are diversified among money market funds, U.S. Government and Agency debt securities, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insured corporate notes, and corporate notes and bonds with effective maturities of generally three months to five years at the date of purchase. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and secondarily to generate yields. The majority of our short term investments are in fixed interest rate securities. These securities are subject to changes in fair value due to interest rate fluctuations. A revised investment policy was approved in December 2007 by our Board of Directors, limiting future investments to direct U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations, repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations, and U.S. Government and Government Agency Money Market funds. The investment policies of our subsidiaries are consistent with our primary objective to preserve principal and secondarily to generate yields. Our wholly owned insurance subsidiary invests in U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations, corporate notes and bonds, and asset and mortgage backed securities with a minimum overall portfolio average credit rating of AAA. All of our foreign subsidiaries investments are primarily in money market funds, investment grade securities, bankers acceptances, bank certificates of deposit and term deposits, all denominated in their local currencies. Additionally, our Canadian subsidiary may invest a portion of its investments in U.S. dollar investment grade securities and bank term deposits to meet current U.S. dollar obligations. Because most of our investments in cash and cash equivalents are short term, interest rate changes are not likely be material to our financial statements. Based on our overnight investments and bank balances within cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2010 and 2009, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $23 and $24 (pre tax), respectively, to interest income on an annual basis. For those investments that are classified as available for sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in market volatility and interest rates are reflected within stockholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive income. The nature and amount of our long and short term debt may vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As of the end of 2010, our fixed rate long term debt included: $41 principal amount at maturity of 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes carried at $32; $900 of 5.3% Senior Notes carried at $899; and $1,100 of 5.5% Senior Notes carried at $1,096, and additional notes totaling $78. Additionally, our variable rate long term debt included a 0.35% over Yen Tibor (6 month) Term Loan of $35. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt and may affect the interest expense related to the variable rate debt. See 36 Table of Contents Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report for more information on our long and short term debt. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Our foreign subsidiaries conduct limited transactions in their non functional currencies, which exposes us to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We manage these fluctuations, in part, through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts, seeking to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on known future expenditures denominated in a foreign currency. As of August 29, 2010, and August 30, 2009, we held forward foreign exchange contracts with a notional amount of $225 and $183, respectively. At the end of 2010 and 2009, fair value assets of $1 and $2, respectively, and a fair value liabilities of $3 and $4, respectively, were recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. A hypothetical 10% strengthening of the functional currency compared to the non functional currency exchange rates at August 29, 2010 and August 30, 2009 would have decreased the fair value of the contracts by $23 and $18, respectively. 
 
Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Our sales results continue to be negatively impacted by general economic conditions, and those conditions may continue to have a significant adverse impact on spending by our members. We believe, however, that due to the nature of our business model, we are better positioned than many retailers to compete in such an environment. Comparable Sales Comparable sales increased 7% in 2010 and were positively impacted primarily by an increase in shopping frequency. Strengthening foreign currencies positively impacted comparable sales by approximately $1,510 (217 basis points) in 2010. Gasoline price inflation positively impacted comparable sales results by approximately $882 (126 basis points) during 2010. Reported comparable sales growth includes the negative impact of cannibalization (established warehouses losing sales to our newly opened locations). 2009 vs. 2008 Net Sales Our 2009 sales results, particularly in hardlines and softlines, were negatively impacted by general economic conditions. Net sales decreased 1.5% during 2009 compared to 2008. The $1,088 decrease was comprised of a $2,590 decrease in comparable sales, partially offset by an increase of $1,502 primarily from sales at new warehouses opened during 2009 and 2008. Our sales were also impacted by a lower number of warehouse openings year over year. Foreign currencies, particularly in Canada, the United Kingdom, and Korea, weakened against the U.S. dollar, which negatively impacted net sales during 2009 by approximately $2,421 (341 basis points). Net sales were also negatively impacted by gasoline price deflation during 2009 by approximately $2,164 (305 basis points), which resulted from a 30% decline in the average sales price per gallon. Comparable Sales Comparable sales decreased 4% in 2009. Weakening foreign currencies negatively impacted comparable sales by approximately $2,339 (333 basis points) in 2009. Gasoline price deflation negatively impacted comparable sales results by approximately $2,113 (298 basis points) during 2009. Comparable sales were negatively impacted by a decline in the average amount spent (after adjustment for gasoline price deflation and measured in local currencies), partially offset by an increase in shopping frequency. Reported comparable sales growth includes the negative impact of cannibalization. Membership Fees 2010 2009 2008 Membership fees $ 1,691 $ 1,533 $ 1,506 Membership fees increase 10.3 % 1.8 % 14.7 % Membership fees as a percent of net sales 2.22 % 2.19 % 2.12 % Total cardholders (000s) 58,000 56,000 53,500 22 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) 2010 vs. 2009 Membership fees increased 10.3% in 2010 compared to 2009. Membership fees in 2010 were positively impacted due to the increased penetration of our higher fee Executive Membership program, the continued benefit of membership sign ups at warehouses opened in 2009 and 2008, a 2009 $27 charge to membership fees related to a litigation settlement concerning our membership renewal policy, and the additional membership sign ups at the 13 new warehouses opened in 2010 (14 opened and one closed due to a relocation). Our member renewal rate, currently at 88% in the U.S. and Canada, is consistent with recent years. Foreign currencies, particularly in Canada, Korea, and Japan, strengthened against the U.S. dollar in 2010, which positively impacted membership fees by approximately $36. 2009 vs. 2008 Membership fees increased 1.8% in 2009 compared to 2008. The increase was primarily due to membership sign ups at the 15 new warehouses opened in 2009 (19 opened, two closed due to relocations, and two closed Costco Home locations), the continued benefit of membership sign ups at warehouses opened in 2008, and increased penetration of our higher fee Executive Membership program. This increase was negatively impacted by the $27 charge for the litigation settlement discussed above, the weakening of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar, particularly in Canada, the United Kingdom, and Korea, which negatively impacted membership fees during 2009 by approximately $50, and a lower number of warehouse openings year over year. Our member renewal rate at the end of 2009 was 87% in the U.S. and Canada. Gross Margin 2010 2009 2008 Gross margin $ 8,260 $ 7,554 $ 7,474 Gross margin increase 9.4 % 1.1 % 12.6 % Gross margin as a percent of net sales 10.83 % 10.81 % 10.53 % 2010 vs. 2009 Gross margin, as a percent of net sales, increased two basis points compared to 2009. The core merchandise gross margin, when expressed as a percent of core merchandise sales and not total net sales, increased 25 basis points year over year, with all categories showing increases. However, the increased sales penetration of the lower margin gasoline business caused this increase to be only six basis points when expressed as a percent of total net sales. Warehouse ancillary businesses gross margins increased by three basis points as a percent of total net sales. In addition, gross margin comparisons were negatively impacted by five basis points due to a favorable LIFO adjustment in 2009 compared to no adjustment in 2010. Increased penetration of the Executive Membership two percent reward program and increased spending by Executive Members negatively affected gross margin by two basis points. Foreign currencies, particularly in Canada, Korea, and Japan, strengthened against the U.S. dollar, which positively impacted gross margin for 2010 by approximately $183. 23 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) 2009 vs. 2008 Gross margin, as a percent of net sales, increased 28 basis points compared to 2008. This increase was primarily related to a net 18 basis point increase in our core merchandise departments, primarily in food and sundries, partially offset by a decrease in softlines, and a net seven basis point increase from our warehouse ancillary businesses, primarily our gasoline and pharmacy departments. The majority of this gross margin improvement was due to our lower margin gas business having lower sales penetration, resulting from the decline in the average selling price per gallon. Increased sales penetration of the Executive Membership two percent reward program negatively affected gross margin by six basis points. In addition, gross margin was favorably impacted by nine basis points due to reversing the $32 LIFO reserve established in the prior year as we experienced net deflation, year over year, in the cost of our merchandise inventories. Foreign currencies, particularly in Canada, the United Kingdom, and Korea, weakened against the U.S. dollar, which negatively impacted gross margin in 2009 by approximately $258. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 2010 2009 2008 Selling, general and administrative expenses $ 7,840 $ 7,252 $ 6,954 SG&A as a percent of net sales 10.28 % 10.38 % 9.80 % 2010 vs. 2009 SG&A expenses, as a percent of net sales, improved ten basis points compared to 2009. If the effect of gasoline price inflation on net sales in 2010 is excluded, these expenses increased three basis points compared to 2009. Warehouse operating costs, excluding the effect of gasoline price inflation, increased seven basis points, primarily due to higher employee benefit costs, particularly employee healthcare and workers compensation. SG&A expense comparisons were positively impacted by six basis points related to: the recovery of amounts expensed in fiscal 2007 and 2008 on behalf of certain employees in Canada to cover adverse tax consequences resulting from our previously announced stock option investigation; and a charge recorded in 2009 to write down the net realizable value of the cash surrender value of employee life insurance contracts with no comparable charge this year. Foreign currencies, particularly in Canada, Korea, and Japan, strengthened against the U.S. dollar, which negatively impacted SG&A for 2010 by approximately $140. 2009 vs. 2008 SG&A expenses, as a percent of net sales, increased 58 basis points compared to 2008. Increased warehouse operating and central administrative costs, as a percent of net sales, negatively impacted SG&A by approximately 56 basis points, resulting primarily from lower sales levels and higher employee health care costs. Higher stock based compensation expense had a negative impact of one basis point. In addition, we recorded an adjustment to the net realizable value of the cash surrender value of employee life insurance contracts, which negatively impacted SG&A, as a percent of net sales, by two basis points. The net realizable value of the insurance contracts is largely based on 24 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) changes in investment assets underlying the policies and is subject to conditions generally affecting equity and debt markets. In 2008, we recorded a $16 reserve in connection with a legal settlement, which positively impacted the comparison to current years SG&A expense, as a percent of net sales, by two basis points. SG&A expenses, as a percent of net sales, for 2009 were adversely impacted by the decrease in the price of gasoline, as it produced a decline in sales dollars without a comparative reduction in labor or other administrative costs. Foreign currencies, particularly in Canada, the United Kingdom, and Korea, weakened against the U.S. dollar, which positively impacted SG&A for 2009 by approximately $217. Preopening Expenses 2010 2009 2008 Preopening expenses $ 26 $ 41 $ 57 Warehouse openings, including relocations 14 19 34 Preopening expenses include costs incurred for startup operations related to new warehouses and the expansion of operations at existing warehouses. Preopening expenses can vary due to the timing of the warehouse opening relative to our year end, whether the warehouse is owned or leased, and whether the opening is in an existing, new, or international market. The 2009 preopening expense included costs related to several international warehouses that opened in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. Provision for Impaired Assets and Closing Costs, Net 2010 2009 2008 Warehouse closing expenses $ 6 $ 9 $ 9 Impairment of long lived assets 2 8 10 Net gains on the sale of real property (19 ) Provision for impaired assets & closing costs, net $ 8 $ 17 $ This provision primarily includes costs related to: impairment of long lived assets; future lease obligations of warehouses that have been closed or relocated to new facilities; accelerated depreciation, based on the shortened useful life through the expected closing date on buildings to be demolished or sold and that are not otherwise impaired; and gains and losses resulting from the sale of real property, largely comprised of former warehouse locations. 2010 vs. 2009 The net provision for impaired assets and closing costs was $8 in 2010, compared to $17 in 2009. The provision in 2010 included charges of $6 for warehouse closing expenses and impairment charges of $2. 2009 vs. 2008 The net provision for impaired assets and closing costs was $17 in 2009, compared to a nominal amount in 2008. The provision in 2009 included charges of $9 for warehouse closing expenses, and impairment charges of $8, primarily related to the closing of our two Costco Home locations in July 2009. The impairment charge in 2008 primarily related to a warehouse in Michigan that was demolished and rebuilt. 25 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) At the end of both 2010 and 2009, the reserve for warehouse closing costs was $5, and primarily related to future lease obligations. Interest Expense 2010 2009 2008 Interest expense $ 111 $ 108 $ 103 Interest expense primarily relates to our $900 of 5.3% and $1,100 of 5.5% Senior Notes (2007 Senior Notes) issued in 2007. Interest Income and Other, Net 2010 2009 2008 Earnings of affiliates and other, net $ 65 $ 31 $ 49 Interest income 23 27 96 Interest Income and other, net $ 88 $ 58 $ 145 2010 vs. 2009 The decrease in interest income is due to lower interest rates on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances. Interest income also includes a $12 other than temporary impairment loss recognized on certain securities within our investment portfolio in 2009. No impairment was recognized in 2010. The increase in earnings of affiliates and other is primarily due to an increase in earnings from our 50% owned joint venture in Mexico. Costco Mexicos earnings increased due to stronger sales and the Mexican peso strengthening against the U.S. dollar. The net gain on foreign currency transactions was $13 in 2010, but was not significant in 2009. These amounts generally relate to the difference between the foreign exchange rate in effect when title to merchandise inventory is transferred and the rate at the time of payment. In addition, there was a favorable $1 mark to market adjustment in 2010 compared to a negative $5 adjustment in 2009, related to our forward foreign exchange contracts. See Derivatives section for more information. 2009 vs. 2008 The decrease in interest income was largely due to lower interest rates on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances resulting from a change in policy to invest primarily in U.S. government and agency securities, which earn lower interest rates. In addition, we recognized $12 of other than temporary impairment losses on certain securities within our investment portfolio in 2009 compared to an impairment loss of $5 in 2008. The decrease in the earnings of affiliates was primarily attributable to lower earnings by our investment in Costco Mexico. Costco Mexicos earnings were lower in 2009, primarily due to the peso weakening against the U.S. dollar. In addition, there was a negative $5 mark to market adjustment in 2009 compared to a favorable $6 adjustment in 2008, related to our forward foreign exchange contracts. 26 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Provision for Income Taxes 2010 2009 2008 Income tax expense $ 731 $ 628 $ 716 Effective tax rate 35.6 % 36.4 % 35.6 % The decline in the effective tax rate from 2009 to 2010 is primarily attributable to a change in the mix of earnings between domestic and international operations. The 2009 effective tax rates also include the unfavorable impact of a write down on investments that were non deductible for tax purposes. The lower tax rate in 2008 was primarily attributable to discrete benefits recognized during the year. Net Income Attributable to Costco (Net Income) 2010 2009 2008 Net income $ 1,303 $ 1,086 $ 1,283 Net income per diluted share $ 2.92 $ 2.47 $ 2.89 Shares used to calculate diluted net income per diluted share (000s) 445,970 440,454 444,240 Diluted net income per share increase / (decrease) 18 % (15 %) 22 % 2010 vs. 2009 Net income for 2010 increased to $1,303, or $2.92 per diluted share, from $1,086, or $2.47 per diluted share, during 2009, representing an 18% increase in diluted net income per share. As previously discussed, foreign currencies, particularly in Canada, Korea and Japan, strengthened against the U.S. dollar, which positively impacted net income for 2010 by approximately $61 after tax, or $0.14 per diluted share. Various factors, discussed in detail above (including sales, membership fees, gross margin, and selling, general and administrative expenses), contributed to the increase in net income for 2010. 2009 vs. 2008 Net income for 2009 decreased to $1,086, or $2.47 per diluted share, from $1,283, or $2.89 per diluted share, during 2008, representing a 15% decrease in diluted net income per share. As previously discussed, foreign currencies, particularly in Canada, the United Kingdom and Korea, weakened against the U.S. dollar, which negatively impacted net income for 2009 by approximately $83 after tax, or $0.19 per diluted share. Various factors, discussed in detail above (including sales, membership fees, gross margin, and selling, general and administrative expenses), contributed to the decrease in net income for 2009. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The following table itemizes components of our most liquid assets at the end of 2010 and 2009 (dollars in millions, except per share data): 2010 2009 Cash and cash equivalents $ 3,214 $ 3,157 Short term investments 1,535 570 Total $ 4,749 $ 3,727 27 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from warehouse operations and cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances, which were $4,749 and $3,727 at the end of 2010 and 2009, respectively. Of these balances, approximately $862 and $758 at the end of 2010 and 2009, respectively, represented debit and credit card receivables, primarily related to sales in the week prior to the end of our fiscal year. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $2,780 in 2010 compared to $2,092 in 2009. This net increase of $688 was primarily attributable to a $371 decrease in our net investment in merchandise inventories (merchandise inventories less accounts payable), an increase in net income of $224, and a $141 increase from the change in our other current operating assets and liabilities. Net cash used in investing activities totaled $2,015 in 2010 compared to $1,101 in 2009, an increase of $914. This increase relates primarily to a $1,113 decrease in cash provided by the net investment in short term investments, partially offset by a $195 decrease in cash used for purchase of property and equipment. Net cash used in financing activities totaled $719 in 2010 compared to $439 in 2009, an increase of $280. This increase was primarily attributable to a $482 increase in cash used to repurchase common stock, a $78 increase in repayments of long term debt and a $42 increase in dividends paid. These were partially offset by a $124 increase in the net proceeds from stock based awards and, a $116 increase in the net proceeds from short term borrowings. The effect of exchange rate changes, increased cash by $11 in 2010, compared to a decrease of $14 in 2009. This increase was primarily due to the strengthening of foreign currencies, primarily in Canada, Korea, and Japan during 2010. Dividends In April 2010, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash dividend from $0.18 to $0.205 per share. Our quarterly cash dividends paid in 2010 totaled $0.77 per share, as compared to $0.68 per share in 2009. Contractual Obligations Our commitments at year end to make future payments under contractual obligations were as follows, as of August 29, 2010: Payments Due by Fiscal Year Contractual obligations 2011 2012 to2013 2014 to2015 2016 andthereafter Total Purchase obligations (merchandise)(1) $ 4,492 $ 1 $ $ $ 4,493 Long term debt(2) 111 1,073 126 1,379 2,689 Operating leases(3) 162 312 282 1,572 2,328 Purchase obligations (property, equipment, services and other)(4) 246 63 309 Construction commitments 186 186 Capital lease obligations(2) 10 20 22 256 308 Other(5) 6 4 2 26 38 Total $ 5,213 $ 1,473 $ 432 $ 3,233 $ 10,351 28 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) (1) Includes open merchandise purchase orders. (2) Includes contractual interest payments. (3) Operating lease obligations exclude amounts commonly referred to as common area maintenance, taxes, and insurance and have been reduced by $173 to reflect sub lease income. (4) The amounts exclude certain services negotiated at the individual warehouse or regional level that are not significant and generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty. (5) Consists of $26 in asset retirement obligations, $9 in deferred compensation obligations and includes $3 of current unrecognized tax benefits relating to uncertain tax positions. The total amount excludes $38 of noncurrent unrecognized tax benefits due to uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash payments. Expansion Plans Our primary requirement for capital is the financing of land, buildings, and equipment costs for new and remodeled warehouses. To a lesser extent, capital is also required for initial warehouse operations and working capital. While there can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized and plans are subject to change upon further review, it is our current intention to spend approximately $1,600 during fiscal 2011 for real estate, construction, remodeling, and equipment for warehouses and related operations. These expenditures are expected to be financed with a combination of cash provided from operations and existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. We plan to open up to 31 new warehouses in 2011, including one to two relocations of existing warehouses to larger and better located facilities. Additional Equity Investments in Subsidiaries and Joint Ventures Our investments in the Costco Mexico joint venture and in other unconsolidated joint ventures that are less than majority owned are accounted for under the equity method. We did not make any capital contributions to Costco Mexico (a 50% owned joint venture) in 2010, 2009, or 2008. 29 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Bank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs Credit FacilityDescription ExpirationDate Credit Line Usage atAugust 29, 2010 ApplicableInterestRate Entity Total ofall CreditFacilities Stand byLetter ofCredit(LC) &Letter ofGuaranty CommercialLC Short TermBorrowing AvailableCredit U.S. UncommittedStandby LC N/A $ 22 $ 22 $ $ $ N/A U.S. UncommittedCommercial LC N/A 50 9 41 N/A Australia(1) Guarantee Line N/A 9 9 N/A Canada(1)(3) Multi PurposeLine N/A 28 16 12 2.25 % Japan(1) Revolving Credit March 11 41 13 28 0.61 % Japan(1) Bank Guaranty March 11 18 18 N/A Japan(1) Revolving Credit February 11 41 13 28 0.61 % Japan(2) Commercial LC N/A 1 1 N/A Korea(1) Multi PurposeLine March 11 10 2 8 3.63 % Taiwan Multi PurposeLine January 11 22 5 17 2.63 % Taiwan Multi PurposeLine July 11 16 3 13 2.65 % United Kingdom UncommittedMoney MarketLine N/A 31 31 3.05 % United Kingdom UncommittedOverdraft Line N/A 46 46 1.50 % United Kingdom(2) Letter ofGuarantee N/A 3 3 N/A United Kingdom Commercial LC N/A 3 1 2 N/A TOTAL $ 341 $ 70 $ 9 $ 26 $ 236 (1) The U.S. parent company, Costco Wholesale Corporation, guarantees this entitys credit facility.

In June 2008, our Japanese subsidiary entered into a ten year term loan in the amount of $35, with a variable rate of interest of Yen TIBOR (6 month) plus a 0.35% margin (0.84% and 0.95% at the end of 2010 and 2009, respectively) on the outstanding balance. Interest is payable semi annually in December and June and principal is due in June 2018. In October 2007, our Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes through a private placement in the amount of $77, bearing interest at 2.695%. Interest is payable semi annually, and principal is due in October 2017. We guarantee all of the promissory notes issued by our Japanese subsidiary. In February 2007, we issued $900 of 5.3% Senior Notes due March 15, 2012 (2012 Notes) at a discount of $2 and $1,100 of 5.5% Senior Notes due March 15, 2017 (2017 Notes) at a discount of $6 (together the 2007 Senior Notes). Interest on the 2007 Senior Notes is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The discount and issuance costs associated with the Senior Notes are being amortized to interest expense over the terms of those notes. At our option, we may redeem the 2007 Senior Notes at any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount of the 2007 Senior Notes to be redeemed, or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, we will be required to make an offer to purchase the 2007 Senior Notes at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase, upon certain events as defined by the terms of the 2007 Senior Notes. In August 1997, we sold $900 principal amount at maturity 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes (Zero Coupon Notes) due in August 2017. The Zero Coupon Notes were priced with a yield to maturity of 3.5%, resulting in gross proceeds to the Company of $450. The remaining Zero Coupon Notes outstanding are convertible into a maximum of 943,000 shares of Costco Common Stock shares at an initial conversion price of $22.71. Holders of the Zero Coupon Notes may require us to purchase the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of purchase) in August 2012. At our option, we may redeem the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of redemption) any time after August 2002. As of August 29, 2010, $859 in principal amount of Zero Coupon Notes had been converted by note holders to shares of Costco Common Stock, of which the principal converted during 2010, 2009 and 2008 is detailed in the table below: 2010 2009 2008 Principal converted during period $ 1 $ 25 $ 1 Principal converted, including the related debt discount $ 1 $ 19 $ 0 Shares issued upon conversion (000s) 18 562 13 Derivatives We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in the normal course of our business, which we manage, in part, through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts seeking to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on known future expenditures denominated in a foreign 32 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) currency. The contracts are intended primarily to hedge U.S. dollar merchandise inventory expenditures. Currently, these contracts do not qualify for derivative hedge accounting. We seek to mitigate risk with the use of these contracts and do not intend to engage in speculative transactions. These contracts do not contain any credit risk related contingent features. We seek to manage the counterparty risk associated with these contracts by limiting transactions to counterparties with which we have established banking relationships. There can be no assurance, however, that this practice effectively mitigates counterparty risk. The contracts are limited to less than one year. See Note 1 and Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report, for additional information related to these contracts. We are exposed to fluctuations in energy prices, particularly electricity and natural gas, which we seek to partially mitigate through the use of fixed price contracts for approximately 26% of our warehouses and other facilities in the U.S. and Canada. We also enter into variable priced contracts for some purchases of natural gas, in addition to fuel for our gas stations on an index basis. These contracts generally qualify for treatment as normal purchases or normal sales and require no mark to market adjustment. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements With the exception of our operating leases, we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition or consolidated financial statements. Stock Repurchase Programs In September and November of 2007, our Board of Directors approved $300 and $1,000, respectively, of stock repurchases, which expire in August 2010 and November 2010. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an additional $1,000, which expires in July 2011, bringing total authorizations by our Board of Directors since inception of the program in 2001 to $6,800. During 2010, we repurchased 9,943,000 shares of common stock, at an average price of $57.14 per share, totaling approximately $568. During 2009, we repurchased 895,000 shares of common stock, at an average price of $63.84 per share, totaling approximately $57. The remaining amount available to be purchased under our approved plan was $1,434 at the end of 2010, $434 of which expires in November 2010. Purchases are made from time to time, as conditions warrant, in the open market or in block purchases and pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5 1. Repurchased shares are retired, in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments. We continue to review our accounting policies and evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, investments, merchandise inventory valuation, impairment of long lived assets, warehouse closing costs, insurance/self insurance liabilities, and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. 33 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Revenue Recognition We generally recognize sales, net of estimated returns, at the time the member takes possession of merchandise or receives services. When we collect payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services, the amount received is generally recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed. We provide for estimated sales returns based on historical trends in merchandise returns. Amounts collected from members that under common trade practices are referred to as sales taxes are recorded on a net basis. We evaluate whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, when we are the primary obligor, subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, influence product or service specifications, or have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded on a gross basis. If we are not the primary obligor and do not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above, we record the net amounts as commissions earned, which is reflected in net sales. Membership fee revenue represents annual membership fees paid by our members. We account for membership fee revenue, net of estimated refunds, on a deferred basis, whereby revenue is recognized ratably over the one year membership period. Our Executive members qualify for a 2% reward (which can be redeemed only at Costco warehouses), up to a maximum of $500 per year, on qualified purchases made at Costco. We account for this 2% reward as a reduction in sales, with the related liability being classified within other current liabilities. The sales reduction and corresponding liability are computed after giving effect to the estimated impact of non redemptions based on historical data. Investments Investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other than temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment. We employ a methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and our intent and ability to hold the investment. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the issuer, including industry and sector performance, operational and financing cash flow factors, and rating agency actions. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and or issuer conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments. Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, as determined primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting, and are stated using the last in, first out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail inventory method of accounting and are stated using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. We believe the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. We record an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the expected annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end. At the end of 2008, due to overall net inflationary trends, merchandise 34 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) inventories valued at LIFO were lower than the FIFO value, resulting in a $32 charge to merchandise costs. During 2009, due to overall deflationary trends, we recorded a $32 benefit to merchandise costs to adjust inventories valued at LIFO. At the end of 2010 and 2009, merchandise inventories valued at LIFO approximated FIFO after considering the lower of cost or market principle. We provide for estimated inventory losses (shrink) between physical inventory counts as a percentage of net sales. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect results of the actual physical inventory counts, which generally occur in the second and fourth quarters of the year. Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as we progress toward earning those rebates, provided they are probable and reasonably estimable. Other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of agreement, or other systematic and rational approaches. Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Warehouse Closing costs We periodically evaluate our long lived assets for indicators of impairment, such as a decision to relocate or close a warehouse facility. Our judgments are based on existing market and operational conditions. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring a downward adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value. We provide estimates for warehouse closing costs for leased and owned locations to be closed or relocated. A considerable amount of judgment is involved in determining any impairment or our net liability, particularly related to the estimated sales price of owned locations and the potential sublease income at leased locations. These estimates are based on real estate conditions in the markets and our experience in those markets. We make assumptions about the average period of time it would take to sublease the location and the amount of potential sublease income for each leased location. We reassess our liability each quarter and adjust our liability accordingly when our estimates change. Insurance/Self Insurance Liabilities We use a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance pool, to provide for potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property damage, director and officers liability, vehicle liability, and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Income Taxes At the beginning of 2008, we adopted authoritative guidance related to uncertain tax positions, which sets out criteria for the use of judgment in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items. The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Significant judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions. The benefits associated with uncertain tax positions are recorded in our consolidated financial statements only after determining a more likely than not probability that the positions will withstand challenge from tax authorities. When facts and circumstances change, we reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the consolidated financial statements as appropriate. 35 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Recent Accounting Pronouncements See discussion of Recent Accounting Pronouncements in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report. Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to financial market risk resulting from fluctuations in interest and foreign currency exchange rates. We do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions or hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment holdings that are diversified among money market funds, U.S. Government and Agency debt securities, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insured corporate notes, and corporate notes and bonds with effective maturities of generally three months to five years at the date of purchase. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and secondarily to generate yields. The majority of our short term investments are in fixed interest rate securities. These securities are subject to changes in fair value due to interest rate fluctuations. A revised investment policy was approved in December 2007 by our Board of Directors, limiting future investments to direct U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations, repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations, and U.S. Government and Government Agency Money Market funds. The investment policies of our subsidiaries are consistent with our primary objective to preserve principal and secondarily to generate yields. Our wholly owned insurance subsidiary invests in U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations, corporate notes and bonds, and asset and mortgage backed securities with a minimum overall portfolio average credit rating of AAA. All of our foreign subsidiaries investments are primarily in money market funds, investment grade securities, bankers acceptances, bank certificates of deposit and term deposits, all denominated in their local currencies. Additionally, our Canadian subsidiary may invest a portion of its investments in U.S. dollar investment grade securities and bank term deposits to meet current U.S. dollar obligations. Because most of our investments in cash and cash equivalents are short term, interest rate changes are not likely be material to our financial statements. Based on our overnight investments and bank balances within cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2010 and 2009, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $23 and $24 (pre tax), respectively, to interest income on an annual basis. For those investments that are classified as available for sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in market volatility and interest rates are reflected within stockholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive income. The nature and amount of our long and short term debt may vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As of the end of 2010, our fixed rate long term debt included: $41 principal amount at maturity of 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes carried at $32; $900 of 5.3% Senior Notes carried at $899; and $1,100 of 5.5% Senior Notes carried at $1,096, and additional notes totaling $78. Additionally, our variable rate long term debt included a 0.35% over Yen Tibor (6 month) Term Loan of $35. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt and may affect the interest expense related to the variable rate debt. See 36 Table of Contents Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report for more information on our long and short term debt. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Our foreign subsidiaries conduct limited transactions in their non functional currencies, which exposes us to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We manage these fluctuations, in part, through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts, seeking to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on known future expenditures denominated in a foreign currency. As of August 29, 2010, and August 30, 2009, we held forward foreign exchange contracts with a notional amount of $225 and $183, respectively. At the end of 2010 and 2009, fair value assets of $1 and $2, respectively, and a fair value liabilities of $3 and $4, respectively, were recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. A hypothetical 10% strengthening of the functional currency compared to the non functional currency exchange rates at August 29, 2010 and August 30, 2009 would have decreased the fair value of the contracts by $23 and $18, respectively. 
 
Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) 2010 vs. 2009 Membership fees increased 10.3% in 2010 compared to 2009. Membership fees in 2010 were positively impacted due to the increased penetration of our higher fee Executive Membership program, the continued benefit of membership sign ups at warehouses opened in 2009 and 2008, a 2009 $27 charge to membership fees related to a litigation settlement concerning our membership renewal policy, and the additional membership sign ups at the 13 new warehouses opened in 2010 (14 opened and one closed due to a relocation). Our member renewal rate, currently at 88% in the U.S. and Canada, is consistent with recent years. Foreign currencies, particularly in Canada, Korea, and Japan, strengthened against the U.S. dollar in 2010, which positively impacted membership fees by approximately $36. 2009 vs. 2008 Membership fees increased 1.8% in 2009 compared to 2008. The increase was primarily due to membership sign ups at the 15 new warehouses opened in 2009 (19 opened, two closed due to relocations, and two closed Costco Home locations), the continued benefit of membership sign ups at warehouses opened in 2008, and increased penetration of our higher fee Executive Membership program. This increase was negatively impacted by the $27 charge for the litigation settlement discussed above, the weakening of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar, particularly in Canada, the United Kingdom, and Korea, which negatively impacted membership fees during 2009 by approximately $50, and a lower number of warehouse openings year over year. Our member renewal rate at the end of 2009 was 87% in the U.S. and Canada. Gross Margin 2010 2009 2008 Gross margin $ 8,260 $ 7,554 $ 7,474 Gross margin increase 9.4 % 1.1 % 12.6 % Gross margin as a percent of net sales 10.83 % 10.81 % 10.53 % 2010 vs. 2009 Gross margin, as a percent of net sales, increased two basis points compared to 2009. The core merchandise gross margin, when expressed as a percent of core merchandise sales and not total net sales, increased 25 basis points year over year, with all categories showing increases. However, the increased sales penetration of the lower margin gasoline business caused this increase to be only six basis points when expressed as a percent of total net sales. Warehouse ancillary businesses gross margins increased by three basis points as a percent of total net sales. In addition, gross margin comparisons were negatively impacted by five basis points due to a favorable LIFO adjustment in 2009 compared to no adjustment in 2010. Increased penetration of the Executive Membership two percent reward program and increased spending by Executive Members negatively affected gross margin by two basis points. Foreign currencies, particularly in Canada, Korea, and Japan, strengthened against the U.S. dollar, which positively impacted gross margin for 2010 by approximately $183. 23 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) 2009 vs. 2008 Gross margin, as a percent of net sales, increased 28 basis points compared to 2008. This increase was primarily related to a net 18 basis point increase in our core merchandise departments, primarily in food and sundries, partially offset by a decrease in softlines, and a net seven basis point increase from our warehouse ancillary businesses, primarily our gasoline and pharmacy departments. The majority of this gross margin improvement was due to our lower margin gas business having lower sales penetration, resulting from the decline in the average selling price per gallon. Increased sales penetration of the Executive Membership two percent reward program negatively affected gross margin by six basis points. In addition, gross margin was favorably impacted by nine basis points due to reversing the $32 LIFO reserve established in the prior year as we experienced net deflation, year over year, in the cost of our merchandise inventories. Foreign currencies, particularly in Canada, the United Kingdom, and Korea, weakened against the U.S. dollar, which negatively impacted gross margin in 2009 by approximately $258. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 2010 2009 2008 Selling, general and administrative expenses $ 7,840 $ 7,252 $ 6,954 SG&A as a percent of net sales 10.28 % 10.38 % 9.80 % 2010 vs. 2009 SG&A expenses, as a percent of net sales, improved ten basis points compared to 2009. If the effect of gasoline price inflation on net sales in 2010 is excluded, these expenses increased three basis points compared to 2009. Warehouse operating costs, excluding the effect of gasoline price inflation, increased seven basis points, primarily due to higher employee benefit costs, particularly employee healthcare and workers compensation. SG&A expense comparisons were positively impacted by six basis points related to: the recovery of amounts expensed in fiscal 2007 and 2008 on behalf of certain employees in Canada to cover adverse tax consequences resulting from our previously announced stock option investigation; and a charge recorded in 2009 to write down the net realizable value of the cash surrender value of employee life insurance contracts with no comparable charge this year. Foreign currencies, particularly in Canada, Korea, and Japan, strengthened against the U.S. dollar, which negatively impacted SG&A for 2010 by approximately $140. 2009 vs. 2008 SG&A expenses, as a percent of net sales, increased 58 basis points compared to 2008. Increased warehouse operating and central administrative costs, as a percent of net sales, negatively impacted SG&A by approximately 56 basis points, resulting primarily from lower sales levels and higher employee health care costs. Higher stock based compensation expense had a negative impact of one basis point. In addition, we recorded an adjustment to the net realizable value of the cash surrender value of employee life insurance contracts, which negatively impacted SG&A, as a percent of net sales, by two basis points. The net realizable value of the insurance contracts is largely based on 24 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) changes in investment assets underlying the policies and is subject to conditions generally affecting equity and debt markets. In 2008, we recorded a $16 reserve in connection with a legal settlement, which positively impacted the comparison to current years SG&A expense, as a percent of net sales, by two basis points. SG&A expenses, as a percent of net sales, for 2009 were adversely impacted by the decrease in the price of gasoline, as it produced a decline in sales dollars without a comparative reduction in labor or other administrative costs. Foreign currencies, particularly in Canada, the United Kingdom, and Korea, weakened against the U.S. dollar, which positively impacted SG&A for 2009 by approximately $217. Preopening Expenses 2010 2009 2008 Preopening expenses $ 26 $ 41 $ 57 Warehouse openings, including relocations 14 19 34 Preopening expenses include costs incurred for startup operations related to new warehouses and the expansion of operations at existing warehouses. Preopening expenses can vary due to the timing of the warehouse opening relative to our year end, whether the warehouse is owned or leased, and whether the opening is in an existing, new, or international market. The 2009 preopening expense included costs related to several international warehouses that opened in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. Provision for Impaired Assets and Closing Costs, Net 2010 2009 2008 Warehouse closing expenses $ 6 $ 9 $ 9 Impairment of long lived assets 2 8 10 Net gains on the sale of real property (19 ) Provision for impaired assets & closing costs, net $ 8 $ 17 $ This provision primarily includes costs related to: impairment of long lived assets; future lease obligations of warehouses that have been closed or relocated to new facilities; accelerated depreciation, based on the shortened useful life through the expected closing date on buildings to be demolished or sold and that are not otherwise impaired; and gains and losses resulting from the sale of real property, largely comprised of former warehouse locations. 2010 vs. 2009 The net provision for impaired assets and closing costs was $8 in 2010, compared to $17 in 2009. The provision in 2010 included charges of $6 for warehouse closing expenses and impairment charges of $2. 2009 vs. 2008 The net provision for impaired assets and closing costs was $17 in 2009, compared to a nominal amount in 2008. The provision in 2009 included charges of $9 for warehouse closing expenses, and impairment charges of $8, primarily related to the closing of our two Costco Home locations in July 2009. The impairment charge in 2008 primarily related to a warehouse in Michigan that was demolished and rebuilt. 25 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) At the end of both 2010 and 2009, the reserve for warehouse closing costs was $5, and primarily related to future lease obligations. Interest Expense 2010 2009 2008 Interest expense $ 111 $ 108 $ 103 Interest expense primarily relates to our $900 of 5.3% and $1,100 of 5.5% Senior Notes (2007 Senior Notes) issued in 2007. Interest Income and Other, Net 2010 2009 2008 Earnings of affiliates and other, net $ 65 $ 31 $ 49 Interest income 23 27 96 Interest Income and other, net $ 88 $ 58 $ 145 2010 vs. 2009 The decrease in interest income is due to lower interest rates on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances. Interest income also includes a $12 other than temporary impairment loss recognized on certain securities within our investment portfolio in 2009. No impairment was recognized in 2010. The increase in earnings of affiliates and other is primarily due to an increase in earnings from our 50% owned joint venture in Mexico. Costco Mexicos earnings increased due to stronger sales and the Mexican peso strengthening against the U.S. dollar. The net gain on foreign currency transactions was $13 in 2010, but was not significant in 2009. These amounts generally relate to the difference between the foreign exchange rate in effect when title to merchandise inventory is transferred and the rate at the time of payment. In addition, there was a favorable $1 mark to market adjustment in 2010 compared to a negative $5 adjustment in 2009, related to our forward foreign exchange contracts. See Derivatives section for more information. 2009 vs. 2008 The decrease in interest income was largely due to lower interest rates on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances resulting from a change in policy to invest primarily in U.S. government and agency securities, which earn lower interest rates. In addition, we recognized $12 of other than temporary impairment losses on certain securities within our investment portfolio in 2009 compared to an impairment loss of $5 in 2008. The decrease in the earnings of affiliates was primarily attributable to lower earnings by our investment in Costco Mexico. Costco Mexicos earnings were lower in 2009, primarily due to the peso weakening against the U.S. dollar. In addition, there was a negative $5 mark to market adjustment in 2009 compared to a favorable $6 adjustment in 2008, related to our forward foreign exchange contracts. 26 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Provision for Income Taxes 2010 2009 2008 Income tax expense $ 731 $ 628 $ 716 Effective tax rate 35.6 % 36.4 % 35.6 % The decline in the effective tax rate from 2009 to 2010 is primarily attributable to a change in the mix of earnings between domestic and international operations. The 2009 effective tax rates also include the unfavorable impact of a write down on investments that were non deductible for tax purposes. The lower tax rate in 2008 was primarily attributable to discrete benefits recognized during the year. Net Income Attributable to Costco (Net Income) 2010 2009 2008 Net income $ 1,303 $ 1,086 $ 1,283 Net income per diluted share $ 2.92 $ 2.47 $ 2.89 Shares used to calculate diluted net income per diluted share (000s) 445,970 440,454 444,240 Diluted net income per share increase / (decrease) 18 % (15 %) 22 % 2010 vs. 2009 Net income for 2010 increased to $1,303, or $2.92 per diluted share, from $1,086, or $2.47 per diluted share, during 2009, representing an 18% increase in diluted net income per share. As previously discussed, foreign currencies, particularly in Canada, Korea and Japan, strengthened against the U.S. dollar, which positively impacted net income for 2010 by approximately $61 after tax, or $0.14 per diluted share. Various factors, discussed in detail above (including sales, membership fees, gross margin, and selling, general and administrative expenses), contributed to the increase in net income for 2010. 2009 vs. 2008 Net income for 2009 decreased to $1,086, or $2.47 per diluted share, from $1,283, or $2.89 per diluted share, during 2008, representing a 15% decrease in diluted net income per share. As previously discussed, foreign currencies, particularly in Canada, the United Kingdom and Korea, weakened against the U.S. dollar, which negatively impacted net income for 2009 by approximately $83 after tax, or $0.19 per diluted share. Various factors, discussed in detail above (including sales, membership fees, gross margin, and selling, general and administrative expenses), contributed to the decrease in net income for 2009. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The following table itemizes components of our most liquid assets at the end of 2010 and 2009 (dollars in millions, except per share data): 2010 2009 Cash and cash equivalents $ 3,214 $ 3,157 Short term investments 1,535 570 Total $ 4,749 $ 3,727 27 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from warehouse operations and cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances, which were $4,749 and $3,727 at the end of 2010 and 2009, respectively. Of these balances, approximately $862 and $758 at the end of 2010 and 2009, respectively, represented debit and credit card receivables, primarily related to sales in the week prior to the end of our fiscal year. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $2,780 in 2010 compared to $2,092 in 2009. This net increase of $688 was primarily attributable to a $371 decrease in our net investment in merchandise inventories (merchandise inventories less accounts payable), an increase in net income of $224, and a $141 increase from the change in our other current operating assets and liabilities. Net cash used in investing activities totaled $2,015 in 2010 compared to $1,101 in 2009, an increase of $914. This increase relates primarily to a $1,113 decrease in cash provided by the net investment in short term investments, partially offset by a $195 decrease in cash used for purchase of property and equipment. Net cash used in financing activities totaled $719 in 2010 compared to $439 in 2009, an increase of $280. This increase was primarily attributable to a $482 increase in cash used to repurchase common stock, a $78 increase in repayments of long term debt and a $42 increase in dividends paid. These were partially offset by a $124 increase in the net proceeds from stock based awards and, a $116 increase in the net proceeds from short term borrowings. The effect of exchange rate changes, increased cash by $11 in 2010, compared to a decrease of $14 in 2009. This increase was primarily due to the strengthening of foreign currencies, primarily in Canada, Korea, and Japan during 2010. Dividends In April 2010, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash dividend from $0.18 to $0.205 per share. Our quarterly cash dividends paid in 2010 totaled $0.77 per share, as compared to $0.68 per share in 2009. Contractual Obligations Our commitments at year end to make future payments under contractual obligations were as follows, as of August 29, 2010: Payments Due by Fiscal Year Contractual obligations 2011 2012 to2013 2014 to2015 2016 andthereafter Total Purchase obligations (merchandise)(1) $ 4,492 $ 1 $ $ $ 4,493 Long term debt(2) 111 1,073 126 1,379 2,689 Operating leases(3) 162 312 282 1,572 2,328 Purchase obligations (property, equipment, services and other)(4) 246 63 309 Construction commitments 186 186 Capital lease obligations(2) 10 20 22 256 308 Other(5) 6 4 2 26 38 Total $ 5,213 $ 1,473 $ 432 $ 3,233 $ 10,351 28 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) (1) Includes open merchandise purchase orders. (2) Includes contractual interest payments. (3) Operating lease obligations exclude amounts commonly referred to as common area maintenance, taxes, and insurance and have been reduced by $173 to reflect sub lease income. (4) The amounts exclude certain services negotiated at the individual warehouse or regional level that are not significant and generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty. (5) Consists of $26 in asset retirement obligations, $9 in deferred compensation obligations and includes $3 of current unrecognized tax benefits relating to uncertain tax positions. The total amount excludes $38 of noncurrent unrecognized tax benefits due to uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash payments. Expansion Plans Our primary requirement for capital is the financing of land, buildings, and equipment costs for new and remodeled warehouses. To a lesser extent, capital is also required for initial warehouse operations and working capital. While there can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized and plans are subject to change upon further review, it is our current intention to spend approximately $1,600 during fiscal 2011 for real estate, construction, remodeling, and equipment for warehouses and related operations. These expenditures are expected to be financed with a combination of cash provided from operations and existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. We plan to open up to 31 new warehouses in 2011, including one to two relocations of existing warehouses to larger and better located facilities. Additional Equity Investments in Subsidiaries and Joint Ventures Our investments in the Costco Mexico joint venture and in other unconsolidated joint ventures that are less than majority owned are accounted for under the equity method. We did not make any capital contributions to Costco Mexico (a 50% owned joint venture) in 2010, 2009, or 2008. 29 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Bank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs Credit FacilityDescription ExpirationDate Credit Line Usage atAugust 29, 2010 ApplicableInterestRate Entity Total ofall CreditFacilities Stand byLetter ofCredit(LC) &Letter ofGuaranty CommercialLC Short TermBorrowing AvailableCredit U.S. UncommittedStandby LC N/A $ 22 $ 22 $ $ $ N/A U.S. UncommittedCommercial LC N/A 50 9 41 N/A Australia(1) Guarantee Line N/A 9 9 N/A Canada(1)(3) Multi PurposeLine N/A 28 16 12 2.25 % Japan(1) Revolving Credit March 11 41 13 28 0.61 % Japan(1) Bank Guaranty March 11 18 18 N/A Japan(1) Revolving Credit February 11 41 13 28 0.61 % Japan(2) Commercial LC N/A 1 1 N/A Korea(1) Multi PurposeLine March 11 10 2 8 3.63 % Taiwan Multi PurposeLine January 11 22 5 17 2.63 % Taiwan Multi PurposeLine July 11 16 3 13 2.65 % United Kingdom UncommittedMoney MarketLine N/A 31 31 3.05 % United Kingdom UncommittedOverdraft Line N/A 46 46 1.50 % United Kingdom(2) Letter ofGuarantee N/A 3 3 N/A United Kingdom Commercial LC N/A 3 1 2 N/A TOTAL $ 341 $ 70 $ 9 $ 26 $ 236 (1) The U.S. parent company, Costco Wholesale Corporation, guarantees this entitys credit facility.

In November 2009, our Japanese subsidiary paid the outstanding principal and interest balances totaling $33 related to the 0.88% promissory notes due November 2009, originally issued in November 2002. In June 2008, our Japanese subsidiary entered into a ten year term loan in the amount of $35, with a variable rate of interest of Yen TIBOR (6 month) plus a 0.35% margin (0.84% and 0.95% at the end of 2010 and 2009, respectively) on the outstanding balance. Interest is payable semi annually in December and June and principal is due in June 2018. In October 2007, our Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes through a private placement in the amount of $77, bearing interest at 2.695%. Interest is payable semi annually, and principal is due in October 2017. We guarantee all of the promissory notes issued by our Japanese subsidiary. In February 2007, we issued $900 of 5.3% Senior Notes due March 15, 2012 (2012 Notes) at a discount of $2 and $1,100 of 5.5% Senior Notes due March 15, 2017 (2017 Notes) at a discount of $6 (together the 2007 Senior Notes). Interest on the 2007 Senior Notes is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The discount and issuance costs associated with the Senior Notes are being amortized to interest expense over the terms of those notes. At our option, we may redeem the 2007 Senior Notes at any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount of the 2007 Senior Notes to be redeemed, or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, we will be required to make an offer to purchase the 2007 Senior Notes at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase, upon certain events as defined by the terms of the 2007 Senior Notes. In August 1997, we sold $900 principal amount at maturity 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes (Zero Coupon Notes) due in August 2017. The Zero Coupon Notes were priced with a yield to maturity of 3.5%, resulting in gross proceeds to the Company of $450. The remaining Zero Coupon Notes outstanding are convertible into a maximum of 943,000 shares of Costco Common Stock shares at an initial conversion price of $22.71. Holders of the Zero Coupon Notes may require us to purchase the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of purchase) in August 2012. At our option, we may redeem the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of redemption) any time after August 2002. As of August 29, 2010, $859 in principal amount of Zero Coupon Notes had been converted by note holders to shares of Costco Common Stock, of which the principal converted during 2010, 2009 and 2008 is detailed in the table below: 2010 2009 2008 Principal converted during period $ 1 $ 25 $ 1 Principal converted, including the related debt discount $ 1 $ 19 $ 0 Shares issued upon conversion (000s) 18 562 13 Derivatives We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in the normal course of our business, which we manage, in part, through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts seeking to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on known future expenditures denominated in a foreign 32 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) currency. The contracts are intended primarily to hedge U.S. dollar merchandise inventory expenditures. Currently, these contracts do not qualify for derivative hedge accounting. We seek to mitigate risk with the use of these contracts and do not intend to engage in speculative transactions. These contracts do not contain any credit risk related contingent features. We seek to manage the counterparty risk associated with these contracts by limiting transactions to counterparties with which we have established banking relationships. There can be no assurance, however, that this practice effectively mitigates counterparty risk. The contracts are limited to less than one year. See Note 1 and Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report, for additional information related to these contracts. We are exposed to fluctuations in energy prices, particularly electricity and natural gas, which we seek to partially mitigate through the use of fixed price contracts for approximately 26% of our warehouses and other facilities in the U.S. and Canada. We also enter into variable priced contracts for some purchases of natural gas, in addition to fuel for our gas stations on an index basis. These contracts generally qualify for treatment as normal purchases or normal sales and require no mark to market adjustment. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements With the exception of our operating leases, we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition or consolidated financial statements. Stock Repurchase Programs In September and November of 2007, our Board of Directors approved $300 and $1,000, respectively, of stock repurchases, which expire in August 2010 and November 2010. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an additional $1,000, which expires in July 2011, bringing total authorizations by our Board of Directors since inception of the program in 2001 to $6,800. During 2010, we repurchased 9,943,000 shares of common stock, at an average price of $57.14 per share, totaling approximately $568. During 2009, we repurchased 895,000 shares of common stock, at an average price of $63.84 per share, totaling approximately $57. The remaining amount available to be purchased under our approved plan was $1,434 at the end of 2010, $434 of which expires in November 2010. Purchases are made from time to time, as conditions warrant, in the open market or in block purchases and pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5 1. Repurchased shares are retired, in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments. We continue to review our accounting policies and evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, investments, merchandise inventory valuation, impairment of long lived assets, warehouse closing costs, insurance/self insurance liabilities, and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. 33 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Revenue Recognition We generally recognize sales, net of estimated returns, at the time the member takes possession of merchandise or receives services. When we collect payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services, the amount received is generally recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed. We provide for estimated sales returns based on historical trends in merchandise returns. Amounts collected from members that under common trade practices are referred to as sales taxes are recorded on a net basis. We evaluate whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, when we are the primary obligor, subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, influence product or service specifications, or have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded on a gross basis. If we are not the primary obligor and do not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above, we record the net amounts as commissions earned, which is reflected in net sales. Membership fee revenue represents annual membership fees paid by our members. We account for membership fee revenue, net of estimated refunds, on a deferred basis, whereby revenue is recognized ratably over the one year membership period. Our Executive members qualify for a 2% reward (which can be redeemed only at Costco warehouses), up to a maximum of $500 per year, on qualified purchases made at Costco. We account for this 2% reward as a reduction in sales, with the related liability being classified within other current liabilities. The sales reduction and corresponding liability are computed after giving effect to the estimated impact of non redemptions based on historical data. Investments Investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other than temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment. We employ a methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and our intent and ability to hold the investment. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the issuer, including industry and sector performance, operational and financing cash flow factors, and rating agency actions. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and or issuer conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments. Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, as determined primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting, and are stated using the last in, first out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail inventory method of accounting and are stated using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. We believe the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. We record an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the expected annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end. At the end of 2008, due to overall net inflationary trends, merchandise 34 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) inventories valued at LIFO were lower than the FIFO value, resulting in a $32 charge to merchandise costs. During 2009, due to overall deflationary trends, we recorded a $32 benefit to merchandise costs to adjust inventories valued at LIFO. At the end of 2010 and 2009, merchandise inventories valued at LIFO approximated FIFO after considering the lower of cost or market principle. We provide for estimated inventory losses (shrink) between physical inventory counts as a percentage of net sales. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect results of the actual physical inventory counts, which generally occur in the second and fourth quarters of the year. Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as we progress toward earning those rebates, provided they are probable and reasonably estimable. Other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of agreement, or other systematic and rational approaches. Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Warehouse Closing costs We periodically evaluate our long lived assets for indicators of impairment, such as a decision to relocate or close a warehouse facility. Our judgments are based on existing market and operational conditions. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring a downward adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value. We provide estimates for warehouse closing costs for leased and owned locations to be closed or relocated. A considerable amount of judgment is involved in determining any impairment or our net liability, particularly related to the estimated sales price of owned locations and the potential sublease income at leased locations. These estimates are based on real estate conditions in the markets and our experience in those markets. We make assumptions about the average period of time it would take to sublease the location and the amount of potential sublease income for each leased location. We reassess our liability each quarter and adjust our liability accordingly when our estimates change. Insurance/Self Insurance Liabilities We use a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance pool, to provide for potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property damage, director and officers liability, vehicle liability, and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Income Taxes At the beginning of 2008, we adopted authoritative guidance related to uncertain tax positions, which sets out criteria for the use of judgment in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items. The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Significant judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions. The benefits associated with uncertain tax positions are recorded in our consolidated financial statements only after determining a more likely than not probability that the positions will withstand challenge from tax authorities. When facts and circumstances change, we reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the consolidated financial statements as appropriate. 35 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Recent Accounting Pronouncements See discussion of Recent Accounting Pronouncements in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report. Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to financial market risk resulting from fluctuations in interest and foreign currency exchange rates. We do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions or hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment holdings that are diversified among money market funds, U.S. Government and Agency debt securities, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insured corporate notes, and corporate notes and bonds with effective maturities of generally three months to five years at the date of purchase. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and secondarily to generate yields. The majority of our short term investments are in fixed interest rate securities. These securities are subject to changes in fair value due to interest rate fluctuations. A revised investment policy was approved in December 2007 by our Board of Directors, limiting future investments to direct U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations, repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations, and U.S. Government and Government Agency Money Market funds. The investment policies of our subsidiaries are consistent with our primary objective to preserve principal and secondarily to generate yields. Our wholly owned insurance subsidiary invests in U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations, corporate notes and bonds, and asset and mortgage backed securities with a minimum overall portfolio average credit rating of AAA. All of our foreign subsidiaries investments are primarily in money market funds, investment grade securities, bankers acceptances, bank certificates of deposit and term deposits, all denominated in their local currencies. Additionally, our Canadian subsidiary may invest a portion of its investments in U.S. dollar investment grade securities and bank term deposits to meet current U.S. dollar obligations. Because most of our investments in cash and cash equivalents are short term, interest rate changes are not likely be material to our financial statements. Based on our overnight investments and bank balances within cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2010 and 2009, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $23 and $24 (pre tax), respectively, to interest income on an annual basis. For those investments that are classified as available for sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in market volatility and interest rates are reflected within stockholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive income. The nature and amount of our long and short term debt may vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As of the end of 2010, our fixed rate long term debt included: $41 principal amount at maturity of 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes carried at $32; $900 of 5.3% Senior Notes carried at $899; and $1,100 of 5.5% Senior Notes carried at $1,096, and additional notes totaling $78. Additionally, our variable rate long term debt included a 0.35% over Yen Tibor (6 month) Term Loan of $35. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt and may affect the interest expense related to the variable rate debt. See 36 Table of Contents Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report for more information on our long and short term debt. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Our foreign subsidiaries conduct limited transactions in their non functional currencies, which exposes us to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We manage these fluctuations, in part, through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts, seeking to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on known future expenditures denominated in a foreign currency. As of August 29, 2010, and August 30, 2009, we held forward foreign exchange contracts with a notional amount of $225 and $183, respectively. At the end of 2010 and 2009, fair value assets of $1 and $2, respectively, and a fair value liabilities of $3 and $4, respectively, were recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. A hypothetical 10% strengthening of the functional currency compared to the non functional currency exchange rates at August 29, 2010 and August 30, 2009 would have decreased the fair value of the contracts by $23 and $18, respectively. 
 
Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) 2009 vs. 2008 Gross margin, as a percent of net sales, increased 28 basis points compared to 2008. This increase was primarily related to a net 18 basis point increase in our core merchandise departments, primarily in food and sundries, partially offset by a decrease in softlines, and a net seven basis point increase from our warehouse ancillary businesses, primarily our gasoline and pharmacy departments. The majority of this gross margin improvement was due to our lower margin gas business having lower sales penetration, resulting from the decline in the average selling price per gallon. Increased sales penetration of the Executive Membership two percent reward program negatively affected gross margin by six basis points. In addition, gross margin was favorably impacted by nine basis points due to reversing the $32 LIFO reserve established in the prior year as we experienced net deflation, year over year, in the cost of our merchandise inventories. Foreign currencies, particularly in Canada, the United Kingdom, and Korea, weakened against the U.S. dollar, which negatively impacted gross margin in 2009 by approximately $258. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 2010 2009 2008 Selling, general and administrative expenses $ 7,840 $ 7,252 $ 6,954 SG&A as a percent of net sales 10.28 % 10.38 % 9.80 % 2010 vs. 2009 SG&A expenses, as a percent of net sales, improved ten basis points compared to 2009. If the effect of gasoline price inflation on net sales in 2010 is excluded, these expenses increased three basis points compared to 2009. Warehouse operating costs, excluding the effect of gasoline price inflation, increased seven basis points, primarily due to higher employee benefit costs, particularly employee healthcare and workers compensation. SG&A expense comparisons were positively impacted by six basis points related to: the recovery of amounts expensed in fiscal 2007 and 2008 on behalf of certain employees in Canada to cover adverse tax consequences resulting from our previously announced stock option investigation; and a charge recorded in 2009 to write down the net realizable value of the cash surrender value of employee life insurance contracts with no comparable charge this year. Foreign currencies, particularly in Canada, Korea, and Japan, strengthened against the U.S. dollar, which negatively impacted SG&A for 2010 by approximately $140. 2009 vs. 2008 SG&A expenses, as a percent of net sales, increased 58 basis points compared to 2008. Increased warehouse operating and central administrative costs, as a percent of net sales, negatively impacted SG&A by approximately 56 basis points, resulting primarily from lower sales levels and higher employee health care costs. Higher stock based compensation expense had a negative impact of one basis point. In addition, we recorded an adjustment to the net realizable value of the cash surrender value of employee life insurance contracts, which negatively impacted SG&A, as a percent of net sales, by two basis points. The net realizable value of the insurance contracts is largely based on 24 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) changes in investment assets underlying the policies and is subject to conditions generally affecting equity and debt markets. In 2008, we recorded a $16 reserve in connection with a legal settlement, which positively impacted the comparison to current years SG&A expense, as a percent of net sales, by two basis points. SG&A expenses, as a percent of net sales, for 2009 were adversely impacted by the decrease in the price of gasoline, as it produced a decline in sales dollars without a comparative reduction in labor or other administrative costs. Foreign currencies, particularly in Canada, the United Kingdom, and Korea, weakened against the U.S. dollar, which positively impacted SG&A for 2009 by approximately $217. Preopening Expenses 2010 2009 2008 Preopening expenses $ 26 $ 41 $ 57 Warehouse openings, including relocations 14 19 34 Preopening expenses include costs incurred for startup operations related to new warehouses and the expansion of operations at existing warehouses. Preopening expenses can vary due to the timing of the warehouse opening relative to our year end, whether the warehouse is owned or leased, and whether the opening is in an existing, new, or international market. The 2009 preopening expense included costs related to several international warehouses that opened in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. Provision for Impaired Assets and Closing Costs, Net 2010 2009 2008 Warehouse closing expenses $ 6 $ 9 $ 9 Impairment of long lived assets 2 8 10 Net gains on the sale of real property (19 ) Provision for impaired assets & closing costs, net $ 8 $ 17 $ This provision primarily includes costs related to: impairment of long lived assets; future lease obligations of warehouses that have been closed or relocated to new facilities; accelerated depreciation, based on the shortened useful life through the expected closing date on buildings to be demolished or sold and that are not otherwise impaired; and gains and losses resulting from the sale of real property, largely comprised of former warehouse locations. 2010 vs. 2009 The net provision for impaired assets and closing costs was $8 in 2010, compared to $17 in 2009. The provision in 2010 included charges of $6 for warehouse closing expenses and impairment charges of $2. 2009 vs. 2008 The net provision for impaired assets and closing costs was $17 in 2009, compared to a nominal amount in 2008. The provision in 2009 included charges of $9 for warehouse closing expenses, and impairment charges of $8, primarily related to the closing of our two Costco Home locations in July 2009. The impairment charge in 2008 primarily related to a warehouse in Michigan that was demolished and rebuilt. 25 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) At the end of both 2010 and 2009, the reserve for warehouse closing costs was $5, and primarily related to future lease obligations. Interest Expense 2010 2009 2008 Interest expense $ 111 $ 108 $ 103 Interest expense primarily relates to our $900 of 5.3% and $1,100 of 5.5% Senior Notes (2007 Senior Notes) issued in 2007. Interest Income and Other, Net 2010 2009 2008 Earnings of affiliates and other, net $ 65 $ 31 $ 49 Interest income 23 27 96 Interest Income and other, net $ 88 $ 58 $ 145 2010 vs. 2009 The decrease in interest income is due to lower interest rates on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances. Interest income also includes a $12 other than temporary impairment loss recognized on certain securities within our investment portfolio in 2009. No impairment was recognized in 2010. The increase in earnings of affiliates and other is primarily due to an increase in earnings from our 50% owned joint venture in Mexico. Costco Mexicos earnings increased due to stronger sales and the Mexican peso strengthening against the U.S. dollar. The net gain on foreign currency transactions was $13 in 2010, but was not significant in 2009. These amounts generally relate to the difference between the foreign exchange rate in effect when title to merchandise inventory is transferred and the rate at the time of payment. In addition, there was a favorable $1 mark to market adjustment in 2010 compared to a negative $5 adjustment in 2009, related to our forward foreign exchange contracts. See Derivatives section for more information. 2009 vs. 2008 The decrease in interest income was largely due to lower interest rates on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances resulting from a change in policy to invest primarily in U.S. government and agency securities, which earn lower interest rates. In addition, we recognized $12 of other than temporary impairment losses on certain securities within our investment portfolio in 2009 compared to an impairment loss of $5 in 2008. The decrease in the earnings of affiliates was primarily attributable to lower earnings by our investment in Costco Mexico. Costco Mexicos earnings were lower in 2009, primarily due to the peso weakening against the U.S. dollar. In addition, there was a negative $5 mark to market adjustment in 2009 compared to a favorable $6 adjustment in 2008, related to our forward foreign exchange contracts. 26 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Provision for Income Taxes 2010 2009 2008 Income tax expense $ 731 $ 628 $ 716 Effective tax rate 35.6 % 36.4 % 35.6 % The decline in the effective tax rate from 2009 to 2010 is primarily attributable to a change in the mix of earnings between domestic and international operations. The 2009 effective tax rates also include the unfavorable impact of a write down on investments that were non deductible for tax purposes. The lower tax rate in 2008 was primarily attributable to discrete benefits recognized during the year. Net Income Attributable to Costco (Net Income) 2010 2009 2008 Net income $ 1,303 $ 1,086 $ 1,283 Net income per diluted share $ 2.92 $ 2.47 $ 2.89 Shares used to calculate diluted net income per diluted share (000s) 445,970 440,454 444,240 Diluted net income per share increase / (decrease) 18 % (15 %) 22 % 2010 vs. 2009 Net income for 2010 increased to $1,303, or $2.92 per diluted share, from $1,086, or $2.47 per diluted share, during 2009, representing an 18% increase in diluted net income per share. As previously discussed, foreign currencies, particularly in Canada, Korea and Japan, strengthened against the U.S. dollar, which positively impacted net income for 2010 by approximately $61 after tax, or $0.14 per diluted share. Various factors, discussed in detail above (including sales, membership fees, gross margin, and selling, general and administrative expenses), contributed to the increase in net income for 2010. 2009 vs. 2008 Net income for 2009 decreased to $1,086, or $2.47 per diluted share, from $1,283, or $2.89 per diluted share, during 2008, representing a 15% decrease in diluted net income per share. As previously discussed, foreign currencies, particularly in Canada, the United Kingdom and Korea, weakened against the U.S. dollar, which negatively impacted net income for 2009 by approximately $83 after tax, or $0.19 per diluted share. Various factors, discussed in detail above (including sales, membership fees, gross margin, and selling, general and administrative expenses), contributed to the decrease in net income for 2009. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The following table itemizes components of our most liquid assets at the end of 2010 and 2009 (dollars in millions, except per share data): 2010 2009 Cash and cash equivalents $ 3,214 $ 3,157 Short term investments 1,535 570 Total $ 4,749 $ 3,727 27 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from warehouse operations and cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances, which were $4,749 and $3,727 at the end of 2010 and 2009, respectively. Of these balances, approximately $862 and $758 at the end of 2010 and 2009, respectively, represented debit and credit card receivables, primarily related to sales in the week prior to the end of our fiscal year. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $2,780 in 2010 compared to $2,092 in 2009. This net increase of $688 was primarily attributable to a $371 decrease in our net investment in merchandise inventories (merchandise inventories less accounts payable), an increase in net income of $224, and a $141 increase from the change in our other current operating assets and liabilities. Net cash used in investing activities totaled $2,015 in 2010 compared to $1,101 in 2009, an increase of $914. This increase relates primarily to a $1,113 decrease in cash provided by the net investment in short term investments, partially offset by a $195 decrease in cash used for purchase of property and equipment. Net cash used in financing activities totaled $719 in 2010 compared to $439 in 2009, an increase of $280. This increase was primarily attributable to a $482 increase in cash used to repurchase common stock, a $78 increase in repayments of long term debt and a $42 increase in dividends paid. These were partially offset by a $124 increase in the net proceeds from stock based awards and, a $116 increase in the net proceeds from short term borrowings. The effect of exchange rate changes, increased cash by $11 in 2010, compared to a decrease of $14 in 2009. This increase was primarily due to the strengthening of foreign currencies, primarily in Canada, Korea, and Japan during 2010. Dividends In April 2010, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash dividend from $0.18 to $0.205 per share. Our quarterly cash dividends paid in 2010 totaled $0.77 per share, as compared to $0.68 per share in 2009. Contractual Obligations Our commitments at year end to make future payments under contractual obligations were as follows, as of August 29, 2010: Payments Due by Fiscal Year Contractual obligations 2011 2012 to2013 2014 to2015 2016 andthereafter Total Purchase obligations (merchandise)(1) $ 4,492 $ 1 $ $ $ 4,493 Long term debt(2) 111 1,073 126 1,379 2,689 Operating leases(3) 162 312 282 1,572 2,328 Purchase obligations (property, equipment, services and other)(4) 246 63 309 Construction commitments 186 186 Capital lease obligations(2) 10 20 22 256 308 Other(5) 6 4 2 26 38 Total $ 5,213 $ 1,473 $ 432 $ 3,233 $ 10,351 28 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) (1) Includes open merchandise purchase orders. (2) Includes contractual interest payments. (3) Operating lease obligations exclude amounts commonly referred to as common area maintenance, taxes, and insurance and have been reduced by $173 to reflect sub lease income. (4) The amounts exclude certain services negotiated at the individual warehouse or regional level that are not significant and generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty. (5) Consists of $26 in asset retirement obligations, $9 in deferred compensation obligations and includes $3 of current unrecognized tax benefits relating to uncertain tax positions. The total amount excludes $38 of noncurrent unrecognized tax benefits due to uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash payments. Expansion Plans Our primary requirement for capital is the financing of land, buildings, and equipment costs for new and remodeled warehouses. To a lesser extent, capital is also required for initial warehouse operations and working capital. While there can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized and plans are subject to change upon further review, it is our current intention to spend approximately $1,600 during fiscal 2011 for real estate, construction, remodeling, and equipment for warehouses and related operations. These expenditures are expected to be financed with a combination of cash provided from operations and existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. We plan to open up to 31 new warehouses in 2011, including one to two relocations of existing warehouses to larger and better located facilities. Additional Equity Investments in Subsidiaries and Joint Ventures Our investments in the Costco Mexico joint venture and in other unconsolidated joint ventures that are less than majority owned are accounted for under the equity method. We did not make any capital contributions to Costco Mexico (a 50% owned joint venture) in 2010, 2009, or 2008. 29 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Bank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs Credit FacilityDescription ExpirationDate Credit Line Usage atAugust 29, 2010 ApplicableInterestRate Entity Total ofall CreditFacilities Stand byLetter ofCredit(LC) &Letter ofGuaranty CommercialLC Short TermBorrowing AvailableCredit U.S. UncommittedStandby LC N/A $ 22 $ 22 $ $ $ N/A U.S. UncommittedCommercial LC N/A 50 9 41 N/A Australia(1) Guarantee Line N/A 9 9 N/A Canada(1)(3) Multi PurposeLine N/A 28 16 12 2.25 % Japan(1) Revolving Credit March 11 41 13 28 0.61 % Japan(1) Bank Guaranty March 11 18 18 N/A Japan(1) Revolving Credit February 11 41 13 28 0.61 % Japan(2) Commercial LC N/A 1 1 N/A Korea(1) Multi PurposeLine March 11 10 2 8 3.63 % Taiwan Multi PurposeLine January 11 22 5 17 2.63 % Taiwan Multi PurposeLine July 11 16 3 13 2.65 % United Kingdom UncommittedMoney MarketLine N/A 31 31 3.05 % United Kingdom UncommittedOverdraft Line N/A 46 46 1.50 % United Kingdom(2) Letter ofGuarantee N/A 3 3 N/A United Kingdom Commercial LC N/A 3 1 2 N/A TOTAL $ 341 $ 70 $ 9 $ 26 $ 236 (1) The U.S. parent company, Costco Wholesale Corporation, guarantees this entitys credit facility.

In November 2009, our Japanese subsidiary paid the outstanding principal and interest balances totaling $33 related to the 0.88% promissory notes due November 2009, originally issued in November 2002. In June 2008, our Japanese subsidiary entered into a ten year term loan in the amount of $35, with a variable rate of interest of Yen TIBOR (6 month) plus a 0.35% margin (0.84% and 0.95% at the end of 2010 and 2009, respectively) on the outstanding balance. Interest is payable semi annually in December and June and principal is due in June 2018. In October 2007, our Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes through a private placement in the amount of $77, bearing interest at 2.695%. Interest is payable semi annually, and principal is due in October 2017. We guarantee all of the promissory notes issued by our Japanese subsidiary. In February 2007, we issued $900 of 5.3% Senior Notes due March 15, 2012 (2012 Notes) at a discount of $2 and $1,100 of 5.5% Senior Notes due March 15, 2017 (2017 Notes) at a discount of $6 (together the 2007 Senior Notes). Interest on the 2007 Senior Notes is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The discount and issuance costs associated with the Senior Notes are being amortized to interest expense over the terms of those notes. At our option, we may redeem the 2007 Senior Notes at any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount of the 2007 Senior Notes to be redeemed, or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, we will be required to make an offer to purchase the 2007 Senior Notes at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase, upon certain events as defined by the terms of the 2007 Senior Notes. In August 1997, we sold $900 principal amount at maturity 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes (Zero Coupon Notes) due in August 2017. The Zero Coupon Notes were priced with a yield to maturity of 3.5%, resulting in gross proceeds to the Company of $450. The remaining Zero Coupon Notes outstanding are convertible into a maximum of 943,000 shares of Costco Common Stock shares at an initial conversion price of $22.71. Holders of the Zero Coupon Notes may require us to purchase the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of purchase) in August 2012. At our option, we may redeem the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of redemption) any time after August 2002. As of August 29, 2010, $859 in principal amount of Zero Coupon Notes had been converted by note holders to shares of Costco Common Stock, of which the principal converted during 2010, 2009 and 2008 is detailed in the table below: 2010 2009 2008 Principal converted during period $ 1 $ 25 $ 1 Principal converted, including the related debt discount $ 1 $ 19 $ 0 Shares issued upon conversion (000s) 18 562 13 Derivatives We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in the normal course of our business, which we manage, in part, through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts seeking to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on known future expenditures denominated in a foreign 32 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) currency. The contracts are intended primarily to hedge U.S. dollar merchandise inventory expenditures. Currently, these contracts do not qualify for derivative hedge accounting. We seek to mitigate risk with the use of these contracts and do not intend to engage in speculative transactions. These contracts do not contain any credit risk related contingent features. We seek to manage the counterparty risk associated with these contracts by limiting transactions to counterparties with which we have established banking relationships. There can be no assurance, however, that this practice effectively mitigates counterparty risk. The contracts are limited to less than one year. See Note 1 and Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report, for additional information related to these contracts. We are exposed to fluctuations in energy prices, particularly electricity and natural gas, which we seek to partially mitigate through the use of fixed price contracts for approximately 26% of our warehouses and other facilities in the U.S. and Canada. We also enter into variable priced contracts for some purchases of natural gas, in addition to fuel for our gas stations on an index basis. These contracts generally qualify for treatment as normal purchases or normal sales and require no mark to market adjustment. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements With the exception of our operating leases, we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition or consolidated financial statements. Stock Repurchase Programs In September and November of 2007, our Board of Directors approved $300 and $1,000, respectively, of stock repurchases, which expire in August 2010 and November 2010. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an additional $1,000, which expires in July 2011, bringing total authorizations by our Board of Directors since inception of the program in 2001 to $6,800. During 2010, we repurchased 9,943,000 shares of common stock, at an average price of $57.14 per share, totaling approximately $568. During 2009, we repurchased 895,000 shares of common stock, at an average price of $63.84 per share, totaling approximately $57. The remaining amount available to be purchased under our approved plan was $1,434 at the end of 2010, $434 of which expires in November 2010. Purchases are made from time to time, as conditions warrant, in the open market or in block purchases and pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5 1. Repurchased shares are retired, in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments. We continue to review our accounting policies and evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, investments, merchandise inventory valuation, impairment of long lived assets, warehouse closing costs, insurance/self insurance liabilities, and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. 33 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Revenue Recognition We generally recognize sales, net of estimated returns, at the time the member takes possession of merchandise or receives services. When we collect payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services, the amount received is generally recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed. We provide for estimated sales returns based on historical trends in merchandise returns. Amounts collected from members that under common trade practices are referred to as sales taxes are recorded on a net basis. We evaluate whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, when we are the primary obligor, subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, influence product or service specifications, or have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded on a gross basis. If we are not the primary obligor and do not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above, we record the net amounts as commissions earned, which is reflected in net sales. Membership fee revenue represents annual membership fees paid by our members. We account for membership fee revenue, net of estimated refunds, on a deferred basis, whereby revenue is recognized ratably over the one year membership period. Our Executive members qualify for a 2% reward (which can be redeemed only at Costco warehouses), up to a maximum of $500 per year, on qualified purchases made at Costco. We account for this 2% reward as a reduction in sales, with the related liability being classified within other current liabilities. The sales reduction and corresponding liability are computed after giving effect to the estimated impact of non redemptions based on historical data. Investments Investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other than temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment. We employ a methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and our intent and ability to hold the investment. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the issuer, including industry and sector performance, operational and financing cash flow factors, and rating agency actions. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and or issuer conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments. Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, as determined primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting, and are stated using the last in, first out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail inventory method of accounting and are stated using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. We believe the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. We record an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the expected annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end. At the end of 2008, due to overall net inflationary trends, merchandise 34 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) inventories valued at LIFO were lower than the FIFO value, resulting in a $32 charge to merchandise costs. During 2009, due to overall deflationary trends, we recorded a $32 benefit to merchandise costs to adjust inventories valued at LIFO. At the end of 2010 and 2009, merchandise inventories valued at LIFO approximated FIFO after considering the lower of cost or market principle. We provide for estimated inventory losses (shrink) between physical inventory counts as a percentage of net sales. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect results of the actual physical inventory counts, which generally occur in the second and fourth quarters of the year. Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as we progress toward earning those rebates, provided they are probable and reasonably estimable. Other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of agreement, or other systematic and rational approaches. Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Warehouse Closing costs We periodically evaluate our long lived assets for indicators of impairment, such as a decision to relocate or close a warehouse facility. Our judgments are based on existing market and operational conditions. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring a downward adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value. We provide estimates for warehouse closing costs for leased and owned locations to be closed or relocated. A considerable amount of judgment is involved in determining any impairment or our net liability, particularly related to the estimated sales price of owned locations and the potential sublease income at leased locations. These estimates are based on real estate conditions in the markets and our experience in those markets. We make assumptions about the average period of time it would take to sublease the location and the amount of potential sublease income for each leased location. We reassess our liability each quarter and adjust our liability accordingly when our estimates change. Insurance/Self Insurance Liabilities We use a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance pool, to provide for potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property damage, director and officers liability, vehicle liability, and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Income Taxes At the beginning of 2008, we adopted authoritative guidance related to uncertain tax positions, which sets out criteria for the use of judgment in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items. The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Significant judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions. The benefits associated with uncertain tax positions are recorded in our consolidated financial statements only after determining a more likely than not probability that the positions will withstand challenge from tax authorities. When facts and circumstances change, we reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the consolidated financial statements as appropriate. 35 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Recent Accounting Pronouncements See discussion of Recent Accounting Pronouncements in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report. Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to financial market risk resulting from fluctuations in interest and foreign currency exchange rates. We do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions or hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment holdings that are diversified among money market funds, U.S. Government and Agency debt securities, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insured corporate notes, and corporate notes and bonds with effective maturities of generally three months to five years at the date of purchase. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and secondarily to generate yields. The majority of our short term investments are in fixed interest rate securities. These securities are subject to changes in fair value due to interest rate fluctuations. A revised investment policy was approved in December 2007 by our Board of Directors, limiting future investments to direct U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations, repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations, and U.S. Government and Government Agency Money Market funds. The investment policies of our subsidiaries are consistent with our primary objective to preserve principal and secondarily to generate yields. Our wholly owned insurance subsidiary invests in U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations, corporate notes and bonds, and asset and mortgage backed securities with a minimum overall portfolio average credit rating of AAA. All of our foreign subsidiaries investments are primarily in money market funds, investment grade securities, bankers acceptances, bank certificates of deposit and term deposits, all denominated in their local currencies. Additionally, our Canadian subsidiary may invest a portion of its investments in U.S. dollar investment grade securities and bank term deposits to meet current U.S. dollar obligations. Because most of our investments in cash and cash equivalents are short term, interest rate changes are not likely be material to our financial statements. Based on our overnight investments and bank balances within cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2010 and 2009, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $23 and $24 (pre tax), respectively, to interest income on an annual basis. For those investments that are classified as available for sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in market volatility and interest rates are reflected within stockholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive income. The nature and amount of our long and short term debt may vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As of the end of 2010, our fixed rate long term debt included: $41 principal amount at maturity of 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes carried at $32; $900 of 5.3% Senior Notes carried at $899; and $1,100 of 5.5% Senior Notes carried at $1,096, and additional notes totaling $78. Additionally, our variable rate long term debt included a 0.35% over Yen Tibor (6 month) Term Loan of $35. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt and may affect the interest expense related to the variable rate debt. See 36 Table of Contents Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report for more information on our long and short term debt. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Our foreign subsidiaries conduct limited transactions in their non functional currencies, which exposes us to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We manage these fluctuations, in part, through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts, seeking to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on known future expenditures denominated in a foreign currency. As of August 29, 2010, and August 30, 2009, we held forward foreign exchange contracts with a notional amount of $225 and $183, respectively. At the end of 2010 and 2009, fair value assets of $1 and $2, respectively, and a fair value liabilities of $3 and $4, respectively, were recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. A hypothetical 10% strengthening of the functional currency compared to the non functional currency exchange rates at August 29, 2010 and August 30, 2009 would have decreased the fair value of the contracts by $23 and $18, respectively. 
 
Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) changes in investment assets underlying the policies and is subject to conditions generally affecting equity and debt markets. In 2008, we recorded a $16 reserve in connection with a legal settlement, which positively impacted the comparison to current years SG&A expense, as a percent of net sales, by two basis points. SG&A expenses, as a percent of net sales, for 2009 were adversely impacted by the decrease in the price of gasoline, as it produced a decline in sales dollars without a comparative reduction in labor or other administrative costs. Foreign currencies, particularly in Canada, the United Kingdom, and Korea, weakened against the U.S. dollar, which positively impacted SG&A for 2009 by approximately $217. Preopening Expenses 2010 2009 2008 Preopening expenses $ 26 $ 41 $ 57 Warehouse openings, including relocations 14 19 34 Preopening expenses include costs incurred for startup operations related to new warehouses and the expansion of operations at existing warehouses. Preopening expenses can vary due to the timing of the warehouse opening relative to our year end, whether the warehouse is owned or leased, and whether the opening is in an existing, new, or international market. The 2009 preopening expense included costs related to several international warehouses that opened in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. Provision for Impaired Assets and Closing Costs, Net 2010 2009 2008 Warehouse closing expenses $ 6 $ 9 $ 9 Impairment of long lived assets 2 8 10 Net gains on the sale of real property (19 ) Provision for impaired assets & closing costs, net $ 8 $ 17 $ This provision primarily includes costs related to: impairment of long lived assets; future lease obligations of warehouses that have been closed or relocated to new facilities; accelerated depreciation, based on the shortened useful life through the expected closing date on buildings to be demolished or sold and that are not otherwise impaired; and gains and losses resulting from the sale of real property, largely comprised of former warehouse locations. 2010 vs. 2009 The net provision for impaired assets and closing costs was $8 in 2010, compared to $17 in 2009. The provision in 2010 included charges of $6 for warehouse closing expenses and impairment charges of $2. 2009 vs. 2008 The net provision for impaired assets and closing costs was $17 in 2009, compared to a nominal amount in 2008. The provision in 2009 included charges of $9 for warehouse closing expenses, and impairment charges of $8, primarily related to the closing of our two Costco Home locations in July 2009. The impairment charge in 2008 primarily related to a warehouse in Michigan that was demolished and rebuilt. 25 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) At the end of both 2010 and 2009, the reserve for warehouse closing costs was $5, and primarily related to future lease obligations. Interest Expense 2010 2009 2008 Interest expense $ 111 $ 108 $ 103 Interest expense primarily relates to our $900 of 5.3% and $1,100 of 5.5% Senior Notes (2007 Senior Notes) issued in 2007. Interest Income and Other, Net 2010 2009 2008 Earnings of affiliates and other, net $ 65 $ 31 $ 49 Interest income 23 27 96 Interest Income and other, net $ 88 $ 58 $ 145 2010 vs. 2009 The decrease in interest income is due to lower interest rates on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances. Interest income also includes a $12 other than temporary impairment loss recognized on certain securities within our investment portfolio in 2009. No impairment was recognized in 2010. The increase in earnings of affiliates and other is primarily due to an increase in earnings from our 50% owned joint venture in Mexico. Costco Mexicos earnings increased due to stronger sales and the Mexican peso strengthening against the U.S. dollar. The net gain on foreign currency transactions was $13 in 2010, but was not significant in 2009. These amounts generally relate to the difference between the foreign exchange rate in effect when title to merchandise inventory is transferred and the rate at the time of payment. In addition, there was a favorable $1 mark to market adjustment in 2010 compared to a negative $5 adjustment in 2009, related to our forward foreign exchange contracts. See Derivatives section for more information. 2009 vs. 2008 The decrease in interest income was largely due to lower interest rates on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances resulting from a change in policy to invest primarily in U.S. government and agency securities, which earn lower interest rates. In addition, we recognized $12 of other than temporary impairment losses on certain securities within our investment portfolio in 2009 compared to an impairment loss of $5 in 2008. The decrease in the earnings of affiliates was primarily attributable to lower earnings by our investment in Costco Mexico. Costco Mexicos earnings were lower in 2009, primarily due to the peso weakening against the U.S. dollar. In addition, there was a negative $5 mark to market adjustment in 2009 compared to a favorable $6 adjustment in 2008, related to our forward foreign exchange contracts. 26 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Provision for Income Taxes 2010 2009 2008 Income tax expense $ 731 $ 628 $ 716 Effective tax rate 35.6 % 36.4 % 35.6 % The decline in the effective tax rate from 2009 to 2010 is primarily attributable to a change in the mix of earnings between domestic and international operations. The 2009 effective tax rates also include the unfavorable impact of a write down on investments that were non deductible for tax purposes. The lower tax rate in 2008 was primarily attributable to discrete benefits recognized during the year. Net Income Attributable to Costco (Net Income) 2010 2009 2008 Net income $ 1,303 $ 1,086 $ 1,283 Net income per diluted share $ 2.92 $ 2.47 $ 2.89 Shares used to calculate diluted net income per diluted share (000s) 445,970 440,454 444,240 Diluted net income per share increase / (decrease) 18 % (15 %) 22 % 2010 vs. 2009 Net income for 2010 increased to $1,303, or $2.92 per diluted share, from $1,086, or $2.47 per diluted share, during 2009, representing an 18% increase in diluted net income per share. As previously discussed, foreign currencies, particularly in Canada, Korea and Japan, strengthened against the U.S. dollar, which positively impacted net income for 2010 by approximately $61 after tax, or $0.14 per diluted share. Various factors, discussed in detail above (including sales, membership fees, gross margin, and selling, general and administrative expenses), contributed to the increase in net income for 2010. 2009 vs. 2008 Net income for 2009 decreased to $1,086, or $2.47 per diluted share, from $1,283, or $2.89 per diluted share, during 2008, representing a 15% decrease in diluted net income per share. As previously discussed, foreign currencies, particularly in Canada, the United Kingdom and Korea, weakened against the U.S. dollar, which negatively impacted net income for 2009 by approximately $83 after tax, or $0.19 per diluted share. Various factors, discussed in detail above (including sales, membership fees, gross margin, and selling, general and administrative expenses), contributed to the decrease in net income for 2009. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The following table itemizes components of our most liquid assets at the end of 2010 and 2009 (dollars in millions, except per share data): 2010 2009 Cash and cash equivalents $ 3,214 $ 3,157 Short term investments 1,535 570 Total $ 4,749 $ 3,727 27 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from warehouse operations and cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances, which were $4,749 and $3,727 at the end of 2010 and 2009, respectively. Of these balances, approximately $862 and $758 at the end of 2010 and 2009, respectively, represented debit and credit card receivables, primarily related to sales in the week prior to the end of our fiscal year. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $2,780 in 2010 compared to $2,092 in 2009. This net increase of $688 was primarily attributable to a $371 decrease in our net investment in merchandise inventories (merchandise inventories less accounts payable), an increase in net income of $224, and a $141 increase from the change in our other current operating assets and liabilities. Net cash used in investing activities totaled $2,015 in 2010 compared to $1,101 in 2009, an increase of $914. This increase relates primarily to a $1,113 decrease in cash provided by the net investment in short term investments, partially offset by a $195 decrease in cash used for purchase of property and equipment. Net cash used in financing activities totaled $719 in 2010 compared to $439 in 2009, an increase of $280. This increase was primarily attributable to a $482 increase in cash used to repurchase common stock, a $78 increase in repayments of long term debt and a $42 increase in dividends paid. These were partially offset by a $124 increase in the net proceeds from stock based awards and, a $116 increase in the net proceeds from short term borrowings. The effect of exchange rate changes, increased cash by $11 in 2010, compared to a decrease of $14 in 2009. This increase was primarily due to the strengthening of foreign currencies, primarily in Canada, Korea, and Japan during 2010. Dividends In April 2010, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash dividend from $0.18 to $0.205 per share. Our quarterly cash dividends paid in 2010 totaled $0.77 per share, as compared to $0.68 per share in 2009. Contractual Obligations Our commitments at year end to make future payments under contractual obligations were as follows, as of August 29, 2010: Payments Due by Fiscal Year Contractual obligations 2011 2012 to2013 2014 to2015 2016 andthereafter Total Purchase obligations (merchandise)(1) $ 4,492 $ 1 $ $ $ 4,493 Long term debt(2) 111 1,073 126 1,379 2,689 Operating leases(3) 162 312 282 1,572 2,328 Purchase obligations (property, equipment, services and other)(4) 246 63 309 Construction commitments 186 186 Capital lease obligations(2) 10 20 22 256 308 Other(5) 6 4 2 26 38 Total $ 5,213 $ 1,473 $ 432 $ 3,233 $ 10,351 28 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) (1) Includes open merchandise purchase orders. (2) Includes contractual interest payments. (3) Operating lease obligations exclude amounts commonly referred to as common area maintenance, taxes, and insurance and have been reduced by $173 to reflect sub lease income. (4) The amounts exclude certain services negotiated at the individual warehouse or regional level that are not significant and generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty. (5) Consists of $26 in asset retirement obligations, $9 in deferred compensation obligations and includes $3 of current unrecognized tax benefits relating to uncertain tax positions. The total amount excludes $38 of noncurrent unrecognized tax benefits due to uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash payments. Expansion Plans Our primary requirement for capital is the financing of land, buildings, and equipment costs for new and remodeled warehouses. To a lesser extent, capital is also required for initial warehouse operations and working capital. While there can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized and plans are subject to change upon further review, it is our current intention to spend approximately $1,600 during fiscal 2011 for real estate, construction, remodeling, and equipment for warehouses and related operations. These expenditures are expected to be financed with a combination of cash provided from operations and existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. We plan to open up to 31 new warehouses in 2011, including one to two relocations of existing warehouses to larger and better located facilities. Additional Equity Investments in Subsidiaries and Joint Ventures Our investments in the Costco Mexico joint venture and in other unconsolidated joint ventures that are less than majority owned are accounted for under the equity method. We did not make any capital contributions to Costco Mexico (a 50% owned joint venture) in 2010, 2009, or 2008. 29 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Bank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs Credit FacilityDescription ExpirationDate Credit Line Usage atAugust 29, 2010 ApplicableInterestRate Entity Total ofall CreditFacilities Stand byLetter ofCredit(LC) &Letter ofGuaranty CommercialLC Short TermBorrowing AvailableCredit U.S. UncommittedStandby LC N/A $ 22 $ 22 $ $ $ N/A U.S. UncommittedCommercial LC N/A 50 9 41 N/A Australia(1) Guarantee Line N/A 9 9 N/A Canada(1)(3) Multi PurposeLine N/A 28 16 12 2.25 % Japan(1) Revolving Credit March 11 41 13 28 0.61 % Japan(1) Bank Guaranty March 11 18 18 N/A Japan(1) Revolving Credit February 11 41 13 28 0.61 % Japan(2) Commercial LC N/A 1 1 N/A Korea(1) Multi PurposeLine March 11 10 2 8 3.63 % Taiwan Multi PurposeLine January 11 22 5 17 2.63 % Taiwan Multi PurposeLine July 11 16 3 13 2.65 % United Kingdom UncommittedMoney MarketLine N/A 31 31 3.05 % United Kingdom UncommittedOverdraft Line N/A 46 46 1.50 % United Kingdom(2) Letter ofGuarantee N/A 3 3 N/A United Kingdom Commercial LC N/A 3 1 2 N/A TOTAL $ 341 $ 70 $ 9 $ 26 $ 236 (1) The U.S. parent company, Costco Wholesale Corporation, guarantees this entitys credit facility.

In November 2009, our Japanese subsidiary paid the outstanding principal and interest balances totaling $33 related to the 0.88% promissory notes due November 2009, originally issued in November 2002. In June 2008, our Japanese subsidiary entered into a ten year term loan in the amount of $35, with a variable rate of interest of Yen TIBOR (6 month) plus a 0.35% margin (0.84% and 0.95% at the end of 2010 and 2009, respectively) on the outstanding balance. Interest is payable semi annually in December and June and principal is due in June 2018. In October 2007, our Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes through a private placement in the amount of $77, bearing interest at 2.695%. Interest is payable semi annually, and principal is due in October 2017. We guarantee all of the promissory notes issued by our Japanese subsidiary. In February 2007, we issued $900 of 5.3% Senior Notes due March 15, 2012 (2012 Notes) at a discount of $2 and $1,100 of 5.5% Senior Notes due March 15, 2017 (2017 Notes) at a discount of $6 (together the 2007 Senior Notes). Interest on the 2007 Senior Notes is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The discount and issuance costs associated with the Senior Notes are being amortized to interest expense over the terms of those notes. At our option, we may redeem the 2007 Senior Notes at any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount of the 2007 Senior Notes to be redeemed, or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, we will be required to make an offer to purchase the 2007 Senior Notes at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase, upon certain events as defined by the terms of the 2007 Senior Notes. In August 1997, we sold $900 principal amount at maturity 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes (Zero Coupon Notes) due in August 2017. The Zero Coupon Notes were priced with a yield to maturity of 3.5%, resulting in gross proceeds to the Company of $450. The remaining Zero Coupon Notes outstanding are convertible into a maximum of 943,000 shares of Costco Common Stock shares at an initial conversion price of $22.71. Holders of the Zero Coupon Notes may require us to purchase the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of purchase) in August 2012. At our option, we may redeem the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of redemption) any time after August 2002. As of August 29, 2010, $859 in principal amount of Zero Coupon Notes had been converted by note holders to shares of Costco Common Stock, of which the principal converted during 2010, 2009 and 2008 is detailed in the table below: 2010 2009 2008 Principal converted during period $ 1 $ 25 $ 1 Principal converted, including the related debt discount $ 1 $ 19 $ 0 Shares issued upon conversion (000s) 18 562 13 Derivatives We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in the normal course of our business, which we manage, in part, through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts seeking to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on known future expenditures denominated in a foreign 32 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) currency. The contracts are intended primarily to hedge U.S. dollar merchandise inventory expenditures. Currently, these contracts do not qualify for derivative hedge accounting. We seek to mitigate risk with the use of these contracts and do not intend to engage in speculative transactions. These contracts do not contain any credit risk related contingent features. We seek to manage the counterparty risk associated with these contracts by limiting transactions to counterparties with which we have established banking relationships. There can be no assurance, however, that this practice effectively mitigates counterparty risk. The contracts are limited to less than one year. See Note 1 and Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report, for additional information related to these contracts. We are exposed to fluctuations in energy prices, particularly electricity and natural gas, which we seek to partially mitigate through the use of fixed price contracts for approximately 26% of our warehouses and other facilities in the U.S. and Canada. We also enter into variable priced contracts for some purchases of natural gas, in addition to fuel for our gas stations on an index basis. These contracts generally qualify for treatment as normal purchases or normal sales and require no mark to market adjustment. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements With the exception of our operating leases, we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition or consolidated financial statements. Stock Repurchase Programs In September and November of 2007, our Board of Directors approved $300 and $1,000, respectively, of stock repurchases, which expire in August 2010 and November 2010. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an additional $1,000, which expires in July 2011, bringing total authorizations by our Board of Directors since inception of the program in 2001 to $6,800. During 2010, we repurchased 9,943,000 shares of common stock, at an average price of $57.14 per share, totaling approximately $568. During 2009, we repurchased 895,000 shares of common stock, at an average price of $63.84 per share, totaling approximately $57. The remaining amount available to be purchased under our approved plan was $1,434 at the end of 2010, $434 of which expires in November 2010. Purchases are made from time to time, as conditions warrant, in the open market or in block purchases and pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5 1. Repurchased shares are retired, in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments. We continue to review our accounting policies and evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, investments, merchandise inventory valuation, impairment of long lived assets, warehouse closing costs, insurance/self insurance liabilities, and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. 33 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Revenue Recognition We generally recognize sales, net of estimated returns, at the time the member takes possession of merchandise or receives services. When we collect payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services, the amount received is generally recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed. We provide for estimated sales returns based on historical trends in merchandise returns. Amounts collected from members that under common trade practices are referred to as sales taxes are recorded on a net basis. We evaluate whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, when we are the primary obligor, subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, influence product or service specifications, or have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded on a gross basis. If we are not the primary obligor and do not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above, we record the net amounts as commissions earned, which is reflected in net sales. Membership fee revenue represents annual membership fees paid by our members. We account for membership fee revenue, net of estimated refunds, on a deferred basis, whereby revenue is recognized ratably over the one year membership period. Our Executive members qualify for a 2% reward (which can be redeemed only at Costco warehouses), up to a maximum of $500 per year, on qualified purchases made at Costco. We account for this 2% reward as a reduction in sales, with the related liability being classified within other current liabilities. The sales reduction and corresponding liability are computed after giving effect to the estimated impact of non redemptions based on historical data. Investments Investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other than temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment. We employ a methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and our intent and ability to hold the investment. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the issuer, including industry and sector performance, operational and financing cash flow factors, and rating agency actions. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and or issuer conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments. Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, as determined primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting, and are stated using the last in, first out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail inventory method of accounting and are stated using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. We believe the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. We record an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the expected annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end. At the end of 2008, due to overall net inflationary trends, merchandise 34 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) inventories valued at LIFO were lower than the FIFO value, resulting in a $32 charge to merchandise costs. During 2009, due to overall deflationary trends, we recorded a $32 benefit to merchandise costs to adjust inventories valued at LIFO. At the end of 2010 and 2009, merchandise inventories valued at LIFO approximated FIFO after considering the lower of cost or market principle. We provide for estimated inventory losses (shrink) between physical inventory counts as a percentage of net sales. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect results of the actual physical inventory counts, which generally occur in the second and fourth quarters of the year. Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as we progress toward earning those rebates, provided they are probable and reasonably estimable. Other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of agreement, or other systematic and rational approaches. Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Warehouse Closing costs We periodically evaluate our long lived assets for indicators of impairment, such as a decision to relocate or close a warehouse facility. Our judgments are based on existing market and operational conditions. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring a downward adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value. We provide estimates for warehouse closing costs for leased and owned locations to be closed or relocated. A considerable amount of judgment is involved in determining any impairment or our net liability, particularly related to the estimated sales price of owned locations and the potential sublease income at leased locations. These estimates are based on real estate conditions in the markets and our experience in those markets. We make assumptions about the average period of time it would take to sublease the location and the amount of potential sublease income for each leased location. We reassess our liability each quarter and adjust our liability accordingly when our estimates change. Insurance/Self Insurance Liabilities We use a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance pool, to provide for potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property damage, director and officers liability, vehicle liability, and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Income Taxes At the beginning of 2008, we adopted authoritative guidance related to uncertain tax positions, which sets out criteria for the use of judgment in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items. The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Significant judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions. The benefits associated with uncertain tax positions are recorded in our consolidated financial statements only after determining a more likely than not probability that the positions will withstand challenge from tax authorities. When facts and circumstances change, we reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the consolidated financial statements as appropriate. 35 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Recent Accounting Pronouncements See discussion of Recent Accounting Pronouncements in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report. Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to financial market risk resulting from fluctuations in interest and foreign currency exchange rates. We do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions or hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment holdings that are diversified among money market funds, U.S. Government and Agency debt securities, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insured corporate notes, and corporate notes and bonds with effective maturities of generally three months to five years at the date of purchase. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and secondarily to generate yields. The majority of our short term investments are in fixed interest rate securities. These securities are subject to changes in fair value due to interest rate fluctuations. A revised investment policy was approved in December 2007 by our Board of Directors, limiting future investments to direct U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations, repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations, and U.S. Government and Government Agency Money Market funds. The investment policies of our subsidiaries are consistent with our primary objective to preserve principal and secondarily to generate yields. Our wholly owned insurance subsidiary invests in U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations, corporate notes and bonds, and asset and mortgage backed securities with a minimum overall portfolio average credit rating of AAA. All of our foreign subsidiaries investments are primarily in money market funds, investment grade securities, bankers acceptances, bank certificates of deposit and term deposits, all denominated in their local currencies. Additionally, our Canadian subsidiary may invest a portion of its investments in U.S. dollar investment grade securities and bank term deposits to meet current U.S. dollar obligations. Because most of our investments in cash and cash equivalents are short term, interest rate changes are not likely be material to our financial statements. Based on our overnight investments and bank balances within cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2010 and 2009, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $23 and $24 (pre tax), respectively, to interest income on an annual basis. For those investments that are classified as available for sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in market volatility and interest rates are reflected within stockholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive income. The nature and amount of our long and short term debt may vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As of the end of 2010, our fixed rate long term debt included: $41 principal amount at maturity of 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes carried at $32; $900 of 5.3% Senior Notes carried at $899; and $1,100 of 5.5% Senior Notes carried at $1,096, and additional notes totaling $78. Additionally, our variable rate long term debt included a 0.35% over Yen Tibor (6 month) Term Loan of $35. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt and may affect the interest expense related to the variable rate debt. See 36 Table of Contents Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report for more information on our long and short term debt. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Our foreign subsidiaries conduct limited transactions in their non functional currencies, which exposes us to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We manage these fluctuations, in part, through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts, seeking to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on known future expenditures denominated in a foreign currency. As of August 29, 2010, and August 30, 2009, we held forward foreign exchange contracts with a notional amount of $225 and $183, respectively. At the end of 2010 and 2009, fair value assets of $1 and $2, respectively, and a fair value liabilities of $3 and $4, respectively, were recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. A hypothetical 10% strengthening of the functional currency compared to the non functional currency exchange rates at August 29, 2010 and August 30, 2009 would have decreased the fair value of the contracts by $23 and $18, respectively. 
 
Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) At the end of both 2010 and 2009, the reserve for warehouse closing costs was $5, and primarily related to future lease obligations. Interest Expense 2010 2009 2008 Interest expense $ 111 $ 108 $ 103 Interest expense primarily relates to our $900 of 5.3% and $1,100 of 5.5% Senior Notes (2007 Senior Notes) issued in 2007. Interest Income and Other, Net 2010 2009 2008 Earnings of affiliates and other, net $ 65 $ 31 $ 49 Interest income 23 27 96 Interest Income and other, net $ 88 $ 58 $ 145 2010 vs. 2009 The decrease in interest income is due to lower interest rates on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances. Interest income also includes a $12 other than temporary impairment loss recognized on certain securities within our investment portfolio in 2009. No impairment was recognized in 2010. The increase in earnings of affiliates and other is primarily due to an increase in earnings from our 50% owned joint venture in Mexico. Costco Mexicos earnings increased due to stronger sales and the Mexican peso strengthening against the U.S. dollar. The net gain on foreign currency transactions was $13 in 2010, but was not significant in 2009. These amounts generally relate to the difference between the foreign exchange rate in effect when title to merchandise inventory is transferred and the rate at the time of payment. In addition, there was a favorable $1 mark to market adjustment in 2010 compared to a negative $5 adjustment in 2009, related to our forward foreign exchange contracts. See Derivatives section for more information. 2009 vs. 2008 The decrease in interest income was largely due to lower interest rates on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances resulting from a change in policy to invest primarily in U.S. government and agency securities, which earn lower interest rates. In addition, we recognized $12 of other than temporary impairment losses on certain securities within our investment portfolio in 2009 compared to an impairment loss of $5 in 2008. The decrease in the earnings of affiliates was primarily attributable to lower earnings by our investment in Costco Mexico. Costco Mexicos earnings were lower in 2009, primarily due to the peso weakening against the U.S. dollar. In addition, there was a negative $5 mark to market adjustment in 2009 compared to a favorable $6 adjustment in 2008, related to our forward foreign exchange contracts. 26 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Provision for Income Taxes 2010 2009 2008 Income tax expense $ 731 $ 628 $ 716 Effective tax rate 35.6 % 36.4 % 35.6 % The decline in the effective tax rate from 2009 to 2010 is primarily attributable to a change in the mix of earnings between domestic and international operations. The 2009 effective tax rates also include the unfavorable impact of a write down on investments that were non deductible for tax purposes. The lower tax rate in 2008 was primarily attributable to discrete benefits recognized during the year. Net Income Attributable to Costco (Net Income) 2010 2009 2008 Net income $ 1,303 $ 1,086 $ 1,283 Net income per diluted share $ 2.92 $ 2.47 $ 2.89 Shares used to calculate diluted net income per diluted share (000s) 445,970 440,454 444,240 Diluted net income per share increase / (decrease) 18 % (15 %) 22 % 2010 vs. 2009 Net income for 2010 increased to $1,303, or $2.92 per diluted share, from $1,086, or $2.47 per diluted share, during 2009, representing an 18% increase in diluted net income per share. As previously discussed, foreign currencies, particularly in Canada, Korea and Japan, strengthened against the U.S. dollar, which positively impacted net income for 2010 by approximately $61 after tax, or $0.14 per diluted share. Various factors, discussed in detail above (including sales, membership fees, gross margin, and selling, general and administrative expenses), contributed to the increase in net income for 2010. 2009 vs. 2008 Net income for 2009 decreased to $1,086, or $2.47 per diluted share, from $1,283, or $2.89 per diluted share, during 2008, representing a 15% decrease in diluted net income per share. As previously discussed, foreign currencies, particularly in Canada, the United Kingdom and Korea, weakened against the U.S. dollar, which negatively impacted net income for 2009 by approximately $83 after tax, or $0.19 per diluted share. Various factors, discussed in detail above (including sales, membership fees, gross margin, and selling, general and administrative expenses), contributed to the decrease in net income for 2009. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The following table itemizes components of our most liquid assets at the end of 2010 and 2009 (dollars in millions, except per share data): 2010 2009 Cash and cash equivalents $ 3,214 $ 3,157 Short term investments 1,535 570 Total $ 4,749 $ 3,727 27 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from warehouse operations and cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances, which were $4,749 and $3,727 at the end of 2010 and 2009, respectively. Of these balances, approximately $862 and $758 at the end of 2010 and 2009, respectively, represented debit and credit card receivables, primarily related to sales in the week prior to the end of our fiscal year. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $2,780 in 2010 compared to $2,092 in 2009. This net increase of $688 was primarily attributable to a $371 decrease in our net investment in merchandise inventories (merchandise inventories less accounts payable), an increase in net income of $224, and a $141 increase from the change in our other current operating assets and liabilities. Net cash used in investing activities totaled $2,015 in 2010 compared to $1,101 in 2009, an increase of $914. This increase relates primarily to a $1,113 decrease in cash provided by the net investment in short term investments, partially offset by a $195 decrease in cash used for purchase of property and equipment. Net cash used in financing activities totaled $719 in 2010 compared to $439 in 2009, an increase of $280. This increase was primarily attributable to a $482 increase in cash used to repurchase common stock, a $78 increase in repayments of long term debt and a $42 increase in dividends paid. These were partially offset by a $124 increase in the net proceeds from stock based awards and, a $116 increase in the net proceeds from short term borrowings. The effect of exchange rate changes, increased cash by $11 in 2010, compared to a decrease of $14 in 2009. This increase was primarily due to the strengthening of foreign currencies, primarily in Canada, Korea, and Japan during 2010. Dividends In April 2010, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash dividend from $0.18 to $0.205 per share. Our quarterly cash dividends paid in 2010 totaled $0.77 per share, as compared to $0.68 per share in 2009. Contractual Obligations Our commitments at year end to make future payments under contractual obligations were as follows, as of August 29, 2010: Payments Due by Fiscal Year Contractual obligations 2011 2012 to2013 2014 to2015 2016 andthereafter Total Purchase obligations (merchandise)(1) $ 4,492 $ 1 $ $ $ 4,493 Long term debt(2) 111 1,073 126 1,379 2,689 Operating leases(3) 162 312 282 1,572 2,328 Purchase obligations (property, equipment, services and other)(4) 246 63 309 Construction commitments 186 186 Capital lease obligations(2) 10 20 22 256 308 Other(5) 6 4 2 26 38 Total $ 5,213 $ 1,473 $ 432 $ 3,233 $ 10,351 28 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) (1) Includes open merchandise purchase orders. (2) Includes contractual interest payments. (3) Operating lease obligations exclude amounts commonly referred to as common area maintenance, taxes, and insurance and have been reduced by $173 to reflect sub lease income. (4) The amounts exclude certain services negotiated at the individual warehouse or regional level that are not significant and generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty. (5) Consists of $26 in asset retirement obligations, $9 in deferred compensation obligations and includes $3 of current unrecognized tax benefits relating to uncertain tax positions. The total amount excludes $38 of noncurrent unrecognized tax benefits due to uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash payments. Expansion Plans Our primary requirement for capital is the financing of land, buildings, and equipment costs for new and remodeled warehouses. To a lesser extent, capital is also required for initial warehouse operations and working capital. While there can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized and plans are subject to change upon further review, it is our current intention to spend approximately $1,600 during fiscal 2011 for real estate, construction, remodeling, and equipment for warehouses and related operations. These expenditures are expected to be financed with a combination of cash provided from operations and existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. We plan to open up to 31 new warehouses in 2011, including one to two relocations of existing warehouses to larger and better located facilities. Additional Equity Investments in Subsidiaries and Joint Ventures Our investments in the Costco Mexico joint venture and in other unconsolidated joint ventures that are less than majority owned are accounted for under the equity method. We did not make any capital contributions to Costco Mexico (a 50% owned joint venture) in 2010, 2009, or 2008. 29 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Bank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs Credit FacilityDescription ExpirationDate Credit Line Usage atAugust 29, 2010 ApplicableInterestRate Entity Total ofall CreditFacilities Stand byLetter ofCredit(LC) &Letter ofGuaranty CommercialLC Short TermBorrowing AvailableCredit U.S. UncommittedStandby LC N/A $ 22 $ 22 $ $ $ N/A U.S. UncommittedCommercial LC N/A 50 9 41 N/A Australia(1) Guarantee Line N/A 9 9 N/A Canada(1)(3) Multi PurposeLine N/A 28 16 12 2.25 % Japan(1) Revolving Credit March 11 41 13 28 0.61 % Japan(1) Bank Guaranty March 11 18 18 N/A Japan(1) Revolving Credit February 11 41 13 28 0.61 % Japan(2) Commercial LC N/A 1 1 N/A Korea(1) Multi PurposeLine March 11 10 2 8 3.63 % Taiwan Multi PurposeLine January 11 22 5 17 2.63 % Taiwan Multi PurposeLine July 11 16 3 13 2.65 % United Kingdom UncommittedMoney MarketLine N/A 31 31 3.05 % United Kingdom UncommittedOverdraft Line N/A 46 46 1.50 % United Kingdom(2) Letter ofGuarantee N/A 3 3 N/A United Kingdom Commercial LC N/A 3 1 2 N/A TOTAL $ 341 $ 70 $ 9 $ 26 $ 236 (1) The U.S. parent company, Costco Wholesale Corporation, guarantees this entitys credit facility.

In November 2009, our Japanese subsidiary paid the outstanding principal and interest balances totaling $33 related to the 0.88% promissory notes due November 2009, originally issued in November 2002. In June 2008, our Japanese subsidiary entered into a ten year term loan in the amount of $35, with a variable rate of interest of Yen TIBOR (6 month) plus a 0.35% margin (0.84% and 0.95% at the end of 2010 and 2009, respectively) on the outstanding balance. Interest is payable semi annually in December and June and principal is due in June 2018. In October 2007, our Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes through a private placement in the amount of $77, bearing interest at 2.695%. Interest is payable semi annually, and principal is due in October 2017. We guarantee all of the promissory notes issued by our Japanese subsidiary. In February 2007, we issued $900 of 5.3% Senior Notes due March 15, 2012 (2012 Notes) at a discount of $2 and $1,100 of 5.5% Senior Notes due March 15, 2017 (2017 Notes) at a discount of $6 (together the 2007 Senior Notes). Interest on the 2007 Senior Notes is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The discount and issuance costs associated with the Senior Notes are being amortized to interest expense over the terms of those notes. At our option, we may redeem the 2007 Senior Notes at any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount of the 2007 Senior Notes to be redeemed, or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, we will be required to make an offer to purchase the 2007 Senior Notes at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase, upon certain events as defined by the terms of the 2007 Senior Notes. In August 1997, we sold $900 principal amount at maturity 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes (Zero Coupon Notes) due in August 2017. The Zero Coupon Notes were priced with a yield to maturity of 3.5%, resulting in gross proceeds to the Company of $450. The remaining Zero Coupon Notes outstanding are convertible into a maximum of 943,000 shares of Costco Common Stock shares at an initial conversion price of $22.71. Holders of the Zero Coupon Notes may require us to purchase the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of purchase) in August 2012. At our option, we may redeem the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of redemption) any time after August 2002. As of August 29, 2010, $859 in principal amount of Zero Coupon Notes had been converted by note holders to shares of Costco Common Stock, of which the principal converted during 2010, 2009 and 2008 is detailed in the table below: 2010 2009 2008 Principal converted during period $ 1 $ 25 $ 1 Principal converted, including the related debt discount $ 1 $ 19 $ 0 Shares issued upon conversion (000s) 18 562 13 Derivatives We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in the normal course of our business, which we manage, in part, through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts seeking to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on known future expenditures denominated in a foreign 32 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) currency. The contracts are intended primarily to hedge U.S. dollar merchandise inventory expenditures. Currently, these contracts do not qualify for derivative hedge accounting. We seek to mitigate risk with the use of these contracts and do not intend to engage in speculative transactions. These contracts do not contain any credit risk related contingent features. We seek to manage the counterparty risk associated with these contracts by limiting transactions to counterparties with which we have established banking relationships. There can be no assurance, however, that this practice effectively mitigates counterparty risk. The contracts are limited to less than one year. See Note 1 and Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report, for additional information related to these contracts. We are exposed to fluctuations in energy prices, particularly electricity and natural gas, which we seek to partially mitigate through the use of fixed price contracts for approximately 26% of our warehouses and other facilities in the U.S. and Canada. We also enter into variable priced contracts for some purchases of natural gas, in addition to fuel for our gas stations on an index basis. These contracts generally qualify for treatment as normal purchases or normal sales and require no mark to market adjustment. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements With the exception of our operating leases, we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition or consolidated financial statements. Stock Repurchase Programs In September and November of 2007, our Board of Directors approved $300 and $1,000, respectively, of stock repurchases, which expire in August 2010 and November 2010. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an additional $1,000, which expires in July 2011, bringing total authorizations by our Board of Directors since inception of the program in 2001 to $6,800. During 2010, we repurchased 9,943,000 shares of common stock, at an average price of $57.14 per share, totaling approximately $568. During 2009, we repurchased 895,000 shares of common stock, at an average price of $63.84 per share, totaling approximately $57. The remaining amount available to be purchased under our approved plan was $1,434 at the end of 2010, $434 of which expires in November 2010. Purchases are made from time to time, as conditions warrant, in the open market or in block purchases and pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5 1. Repurchased shares are retired, in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments. We continue to review our accounting policies and evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, investments, merchandise inventory valuation, impairment of long lived assets, warehouse closing costs, insurance/self insurance liabilities, and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. 33 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Revenue Recognition We generally recognize sales, net of estimated returns, at the time the member takes possession of merchandise or receives services. When we collect payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services, the amount received is generally recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed. We provide for estimated sales returns based on historical trends in merchandise returns. Amounts collected from members that under common trade practices are referred to as sales taxes are recorded on a net basis. We evaluate whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, when we are the primary obligor, subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, influence product or service specifications, or have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded on a gross basis. If we are not the primary obligor and do not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above, we record the net amounts as commissions earned, which is reflected in net sales. Membership fee revenue represents annual membership fees paid by our members. We account for membership fee revenue, net of estimated refunds, on a deferred basis, whereby revenue is recognized ratably over the one year membership period. Our Executive members qualify for a 2% reward (which can be redeemed only at Costco warehouses), up to a maximum of $500 per year, on qualified purchases made at Costco. We account for this 2% reward as a reduction in sales, with the related liability being classified within other current liabilities. The sales reduction and corresponding liability are computed after giving effect to the estimated impact of non redemptions based on historical data. Investments Investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other than temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment. We employ a methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and our intent and ability to hold the investment. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the issuer, including industry and sector performance, operational and financing cash flow factors, and rating agency actions. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and or issuer conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments. Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, as determined primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting, and are stated using the last in, first out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail inventory method of accounting and are stated using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. We believe the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. We record an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the expected annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end. At the end of 2008, due to overall net inflationary trends, merchandise 34 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) inventories valued at LIFO were lower than the FIFO value, resulting in a $32 charge to merchandise costs. During 2009, due to overall deflationary trends, we recorded a $32 benefit to merchandise costs to adjust inventories valued at LIFO. At the end of 2010 and 2009, merchandise inventories valued at LIFO approximated FIFO after considering the lower of cost or market principle. We provide for estimated inventory losses (shrink) between physical inventory counts as a percentage of net sales. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect results of the actual physical inventory counts, which generally occur in the second and fourth quarters of the year. Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as we progress toward earning those rebates, provided they are probable and reasonably estimable. Other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of agreement, or other systematic and rational approaches. Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Warehouse Closing costs We periodically evaluate our long lived assets for indicators of impairment, such as a decision to relocate or close a warehouse facility. Our judgments are based on existing market and operational conditions. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring a downward adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value. We provide estimates for warehouse closing costs for leased and owned locations to be closed or relocated. A considerable amount of judgment is involved in determining any impairment or our net liability, particularly related to the estimated sales price of owned locations and the potential sublease income at leased locations. These estimates are based on real estate conditions in the markets and our experience in those markets. We make assumptions about the average period of time it would take to sublease the location and the amount of potential sublease income for each leased location. We reassess our liability each quarter and adjust our liability accordingly when our estimates change. Insurance/Self Insurance Liabilities We use a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance pool, to provide for potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property damage, director and officers liability, vehicle liability, and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Income Taxes At the beginning of 2008, we adopted authoritative guidance related to uncertain tax positions, which sets out criteria for the use of judgment in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items. The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Significant judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions. The benefits associated with uncertain tax positions are recorded in our consolidated financial statements only after determining a more likely than not probability that the positions will withstand challenge from tax authorities. When facts and circumstances change, we reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the consolidated financial statements as appropriate. 35 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Recent Accounting Pronouncements See discussion of Recent Accounting Pronouncements in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report. Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to financial market risk resulting from fluctuations in interest and foreign currency exchange rates. We do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions or hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment holdings that are diversified among money market funds, U.S. Government and Agency debt securities, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insured corporate notes, and corporate notes and bonds with effective maturities of generally three months to five years at the date of purchase. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and secondarily to generate yields. The majority of our short term investments are in fixed interest rate securities. These securities are subject to changes in fair value due to interest rate fluctuations. A revised investment policy was approved in December 2007 by our Board of Directors, limiting future investments to direct U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations, repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations, and U.S. Government and Government Agency Money Market funds. The investment policies of our subsidiaries are consistent with our primary objective to preserve principal and secondarily to generate yields. Our wholly owned insurance subsidiary invests in U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations, corporate notes and bonds, and asset and mortgage backed securities with a minimum overall portfolio average credit rating of AAA. All of our foreign subsidiaries investments are primarily in money market funds, investment grade securities, bankers acceptances, bank certificates of deposit and term deposits, all denominated in their local currencies. Additionally, our Canadian subsidiary may invest a portion of its investments in U.S. dollar investment grade securities and bank term deposits to meet current U.S. dollar obligations. Because most of our investments in cash and cash equivalents are short term, interest rate changes are not likely be material to our financial statements. Based on our overnight investments and bank balances within cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2010 and 2009, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $23 and $24 (pre tax), respectively, to interest income on an annual basis. For those investments that are classified as available for sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in market volatility and interest rates are reflected within stockholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive income. The nature and amount of our long and short term debt may vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As of the end of 2010, our fixed rate long term debt included: $41 principal amount at maturity of 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes carried at $32; $900 of 5.3% Senior Notes carried at $899; and $1,100 of 5.5% Senior Notes carried at $1,096, and additional notes totaling $78. Additionally, our variable rate long term debt included a 0.35% over Yen Tibor (6 month) Term Loan of $35. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt and may affect the interest expense related to the variable rate debt. See 36 Table of Contents Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report for more information on our long and short term debt. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Our foreign subsidiaries conduct limited transactions in their non functional currencies, which exposes us to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We manage these fluctuations, in part, through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts, seeking to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on known future expenditures denominated in a foreign currency. As of August 29, 2010, and August 30, 2009, we held forward foreign exchange contracts with a notional amount of $225 and $183, respectively. At the end of 2010 and 2009, fair value assets of $1 and $2, respectively, and a fair value liabilities of $3 and $4, respectively, were recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. A hypothetical 10% strengthening of the functional currency compared to the non functional currency exchange rates at August 29, 2010 and August 30, 2009 would have decreased the fair value of the contracts by $23 and $18, respectively. 
 
Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Provision for Income Taxes 2010 2009 2008 Income tax expense $ 731 $ 628 $ 716 Effective tax rate 35.6 % 36.4 % 35.6 % The decline in the effective tax rate from 2009 to 2010 is primarily attributable to a change in the mix of earnings between domestic and international operations. The 2009 effective tax rates also include the unfavorable impact of a write down on investments that were non deductible for tax purposes. The lower tax rate in 2008 was primarily attributable to discrete benefits recognized during the year. Net Income Attributable to Costco (Net Income) 2010 2009 2008 Net income $ 1,303 $ 1,086 $ 1,283 Net income per diluted share $ 2.92 $ 2.47 $ 2.89 Shares used to calculate diluted net income per diluted share (000s) 445,970 440,454 444,240 Diluted net income per share increase / (decrease) 18 % (15 %) 22 % 2010 vs. 2009 Net income for 2010 increased to $1,303, or $2.92 per diluted share, from $1,086, or $2.47 per diluted share, during 2009, representing an 18% increase in diluted net income per share. As previously discussed, foreign currencies, particularly in Canada, Korea and Japan, strengthened against the U.S. dollar, which positively impacted net income for 2010 by approximately $61 after tax, or $0.14 per diluted share. Various factors, discussed in detail above (including sales, membership fees, gross margin, and selling, general and administrative expenses), contributed to the increase in net income for 2010. 2009 vs. 2008 Net income for 2009 decreased to $1,086, or $2.47 per diluted share, from $1,283, or $2.89 per diluted share, during 2008, representing a 15% decrease in diluted net income per share. As previously discussed, foreign currencies, particularly in Canada, the United Kingdom and Korea, weakened against the U.S. dollar, which negatively impacted net income for 2009 by approximately $83 after tax, or $0.19 per diluted share. Various factors, discussed in detail above (including sales, membership fees, gross margin, and selling, general and administrative expenses), contributed to the decrease in net income for 2009. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The following table itemizes components of our most liquid assets at the end of 2010 and 2009 (dollars in millions, except per share data): 2010 2009 Cash and cash equivalents $ 3,214 $ 3,157 Short term investments 1,535 570 Total $ 4,749 $ 3,727 27 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from warehouse operations and cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances, which were $4,749 and $3,727 at the end of 2010 and 2009, respectively. Of these balances, approximately $862 and $758 at the end of 2010 and 2009, respectively, represented debit and credit card receivables, primarily related to sales in the week prior to the end of our fiscal year. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $2,780 in 2010 compared to $2,092 in 2009. This net increase of $688 was primarily attributable to a $371 decrease in our net investment in merchandise inventories (merchandise inventories less accounts payable), an increase in net income of $224, and a $141 increase from the change in our other current operating assets and liabilities. Net cash used in investing activities totaled $2,015 in 2010 compared to $1,101 in 2009, an increase of $914. This increase relates primarily to a $1,113 decrease in cash provided by the net investment in short term investments, partially offset by a $195 decrease in cash used for purchase of property and equipment. Net cash used in financing activities totaled $719 in 2010 compared to $439 in 2009, an increase of $280. This increase was primarily attributable to a $482 increase in cash used to repurchase common stock, a $78 increase in repayments of long term debt and a $42 increase in dividends paid. These were partially offset by a $124 increase in the net proceeds from stock based awards and, a $116 increase in the net proceeds from short term borrowings. The effect of exchange rate changes, increased cash by $11 in 2010, compared to a decrease of $14 in 2009. This increase was primarily due to the strengthening of foreign currencies, primarily in Canada, Korea, and Japan during 2010. Dividends In April 2010, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash dividend from $0.18 to $0.205 per share. Our quarterly cash dividends paid in 2010 totaled $0.77 per share, as compared to $0.68 per share in 2009. Contractual Obligations Our commitments at year end to make future payments under contractual obligations were as follows, as of August 29, 2010: Payments Due by Fiscal Year Contractual obligations 2011 2012 to2013 2014 to2015 2016 andthereafter Total Purchase obligations (merchandise)(1) $ 4,492 $ 1 $ $ $ 4,493 Long term debt(2) 111 1,073 126 1,379 2,689 Operating leases(3) 162 312 282 1,572 2,328 Purchase obligations (property, equipment, services and other)(4) 246 63 309 Construction commitments 186 186 Capital lease obligations(2) 10 20 22 256 308 Other(5) 6 4 2 26 38 Total $ 5,213 $ 1,473 $ 432 $ 3,233 $ 10,351 28 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) (1) Includes open merchandise purchase orders. (2) Includes contractual interest payments. (3) Operating lease obligations exclude amounts commonly referred to as common area maintenance, taxes, and insurance and have been reduced by $173 to reflect sub lease income. (4) The amounts exclude certain services negotiated at the individual warehouse or regional level that are not significant and generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty. (5) Consists of $26 in asset retirement obligations, $9 in deferred compensation obligations and includes $3 of current unrecognized tax benefits relating to uncertain tax positions. The total amount excludes $38 of noncurrent unrecognized tax benefits due to uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash payments. Expansion Plans Our primary requirement for capital is the financing of land, buildings, and equipment costs for new and remodeled warehouses. To a lesser extent, capital is also required for initial warehouse operations and working capital. While there can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized and plans are subject to change upon further review, it is our current intention to spend approximately $1,600 during fiscal 2011 for real estate, construction, remodeling, and equipment for warehouses and related operations. These expenditures are expected to be financed with a combination of cash provided from operations and existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. We plan to open up to 31 new warehouses in 2011, including one to two relocations of existing warehouses to larger and better located facilities. Additional Equity Investments in Subsidiaries and Joint Ventures Our investments in the Costco Mexico joint venture and in other unconsolidated joint ventures that are less than majority owned are accounted for under the equity method. We did not make any capital contributions to Costco Mexico (a 50% owned joint venture) in 2010, 2009, or 2008. 29 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Bank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs Credit FacilityDescription ExpirationDate Credit Line Usage atAugust 29, 2010 ApplicableInterestRate Entity Total ofall CreditFacilities Stand byLetter ofCredit(LC) &Letter ofGuaranty CommercialLC Short TermBorrowing AvailableCredit U.S. UncommittedStandby LC N/A $ 22 $ 22 $ $ $ N/A U.S. UncommittedCommercial LC N/A 50 9 41 N/A Australia(1) Guarantee Line N/A 9 9 N/A Canada(1)(3) Multi PurposeLine N/A 28 16 12 2.25 % Japan(1) Revolving Credit March 11 41 13 28 0.61 % Japan(1) Bank Guaranty March 11 18 18 N/A Japan(1) Revolving Credit February 11 41 13 28 0.61 % Japan(2) Commercial LC N/A 1 1 N/A Korea(1) Multi PurposeLine March 11 10 2 8 3.63 % Taiwan Multi PurposeLine January 11 22 5 17 2.63 % Taiwan Multi PurposeLine July 11 16 3 13 2.65 % United Kingdom UncommittedMoney MarketLine N/A 31 31 3.05 % United Kingdom UncommittedOverdraft Line N/A 46 46 1.50 % United Kingdom(2) Letter ofGuarantee N/A 3 3 N/A United Kingdom Commercial LC N/A 3 1 2 N/A TOTAL $ 341 $ 70 $ 9 $ 26 $ 236 (1) The U.S. parent company, Costco Wholesale Corporation, guarantees this entitys credit facility.

In November 2009, our Japanese subsidiary paid the outstanding principal and interest balances totaling $33 related to the 0.88% promissory notes due November 2009, originally issued in November 2002. In June 2008, our Japanese subsidiary entered into a ten year term loan in the amount of $35, with a variable rate of interest of Yen TIBOR (6 month) plus a 0.35% margin (0.84% and 0.95% at the end of 2010 and 2009, respectively) on the outstanding balance. Interest is payable semi annually in December and June and principal is due in June 2018. In October 2007, our Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes through a private placement in the amount of $77, bearing interest at 2.695%. Interest is payable semi annually, and principal is due in October 2017. We guarantee all of the promissory notes issued by our Japanese subsidiary. In February 2007, we issued $900 of 5.3% Senior Notes due March 15, 2012 (2012 Notes) at a discount of $2 and $1,100 of 5.5% Senior Notes due March 15, 2017 (2017 Notes) at a discount of $6 (together the 2007 Senior Notes). Interest on the 2007 Senior Notes is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The discount and issuance costs associated with the Senior Notes are being amortized to interest expense over the terms of those notes. At our option, we may redeem the 2007 Senior Notes at any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount of the 2007 Senior Notes to be redeemed, or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, we will be required to make an offer to purchase the 2007 Senior Notes at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase, upon certain events as defined by the terms of the 2007 Senior Notes. In August 1997, we sold $900 principal amount at maturity 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes (Zero Coupon Notes) due in August 2017. The Zero Coupon Notes were priced with a yield to maturity of 3.5%, resulting in gross proceeds to the Company of $450. The remaining Zero Coupon Notes outstanding are convertible into a maximum of 943,000 shares of Costco Common Stock shares at an initial conversion price of $22.71. Holders of the Zero Coupon Notes may require us to purchase the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of purchase) in August 2012. At our option, we may redeem the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of redemption) any time after August 2002. As of August 29, 2010, $859 in principal amount of Zero Coupon Notes had been converted by note holders to shares of Costco Common Stock, of which the principal converted during 2010, 2009 and 2008 is detailed in the table below: 2010 2009 2008 Principal converted during period $ 1 $ 25 $ 1 Principal converted, including the related debt discount $ 1 $ 19 $ 0 Shares issued upon conversion (000s) 18 562 13 Derivatives We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in the normal course of our business, which we manage, in part, through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts seeking to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on known future expenditures denominated in a foreign 32 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) currency. The contracts are intended primarily to hedge U.S. dollar merchandise inventory expenditures. Currently, these contracts do not qualify for derivative hedge accounting. We seek to mitigate risk with the use of these contracts and do not intend to engage in speculative transactions. These contracts do not contain any credit risk related contingent features. We seek to manage the counterparty risk associated with these contracts by limiting transactions to counterparties with which we have established banking relationships. There can be no assurance, however, that this practice effectively mitigates counterparty risk. The contracts are limited to less than one year. See Note 1 and Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report, for additional information related to these contracts. We are exposed to fluctuations in energy prices, particularly electricity and natural gas, which we seek to partially mitigate through the use of fixed price contracts for approximately 26% of our warehouses and other facilities in the U.S. and Canada. We also enter into variable priced contracts for some purchases of natural gas, in addition to fuel for our gas stations on an index basis. These contracts generally qualify for treatment as normal purchases or normal sales and require no mark to market adjustment. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements With the exception of our operating leases, we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition or consolidated financial statements. Stock Repurchase Programs In September and November of 2007, our Board of Directors approved $300 and $1,000, respectively, of stock repurchases, which expire in August 2010 and November 2010. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an additional $1,000, which expires in July 2011, bringing total authorizations by our Board of Directors since inception of the program in 2001 to $6,800. During 2010, we repurchased 9,943,000 shares of common stock, at an average price of $57.14 per share, totaling approximately $568. During 2009, we repurchased 895,000 shares of common stock, at an average price of $63.84 per share, totaling approximately $57. The remaining amount available to be purchased under our approved plan was $1,434 at the end of 2010, $434 of which expires in November 2010. Purchases are made from time to time, as conditions warrant, in the open market or in block purchases and pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5 1. Repurchased shares are retired, in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments. We continue to review our accounting policies and evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, investments, merchandise inventory valuation, impairment of long lived assets, warehouse closing costs, insurance/self insurance liabilities, and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. 33 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Revenue Recognition We generally recognize sales, net of estimated returns, at the time the member takes possession of merchandise or receives services. When we collect payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services, the amount received is generally recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed. We provide for estimated sales returns based on historical trends in merchandise returns. Amounts collected from members that under common trade practices are referred to as sales taxes are recorded on a net basis. We evaluate whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, when we are the primary obligor, subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, influence product or service specifications, or have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded on a gross basis. If we are not the primary obligor and do not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above, we record the net amounts as commissions earned, which is reflected in net sales. Membership fee revenue represents annual membership fees paid by our members. We account for membership fee revenue, net of estimated refunds, on a deferred basis, whereby revenue is recognized ratably over the one year membership period. Our Executive members qualify for a 2% reward (which can be redeemed only at Costco warehouses), up to a maximum of $500 per year, on qualified purchases made at Costco. We account for this 2% reward as a reduction in sales, with the related liability being classified within other current liabilities. The sales reduction and corresponding liability are computed after giving effect to the estimated impact of non redemptions based on historical data. Investments Investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other than temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment. We employ a methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and our intent and ability to hold the investment. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the issuer, including industry and sector performance, operational and financing cash flow factors, and rating agency actions. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and or issuer conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments. Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, as determined primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting, and are stated using the last in, first out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail inventory method of accounting and are stated using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. We believe the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. We record an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the expected annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end. At the end of 2008, due to overall net inflationary trends, merchandise 34 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) inventories valued at LIFO were lower than the FIFO value, resulting in a $32 charge to merchandise costs. During 2009, due to overall deflationary trends, we recorded a $32 benefit to merchandise costs to adjust inventories valued at LIFO. At the end of 2010 and 2009, merchandise inventories valued at LIFO approximated FIFO after considering the lower of cost or market principle. We provide for estimated inventory losses (shrink) between physical inventory counts as a percentage of net sales. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect results of the actual physical inventory counts, which generally occur in the second and fourth quarters of the year. Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as we progress toward earning those rebates, provided they are probable and reasonably estimable. Other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of agreement, or other systematic and rational approaches. Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Warehouse Closing costs We periodically evaluate our long lived assets for indicators of impairment, such as a decision to relocate or close a warehouse facility. Our judgments are based on existing market and operational conditions. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring a downward adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value. We provide estimates for warehouse closing costs for leased and owned locations to be closed or relocated. A considerable amount of judgment is involved in determining any impairment or our net liability, particularly related to the estimated sales price of owned locations and the potential sublease income at leased locations. These estimates are based on real estate conditions in the markets and our experience in those markets. We make assumptions about the average period of time it would take to sublease the location and the amount of potential sublease income for each leased location. We reassess our liability each quarter and adjust our liability accordingly when our estimates change. Insurance/Self Insurance Liabilities We use a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance pool, to provide for potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property damage, director and officers liability, vehicle liability, and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Income Taxes At the beginning of 2008, we adopted authoritative guidance related to uncertain tax positions, which sets out criteria for the use of judgment in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items. The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Significant judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions. The benefits associated with uncertain tax positions are recorded in our consolidated financial statements only after determining a more likely than not probability that the positions will withstand challenge from tax authorities. When facts and circumstances change, we reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the consolidated financial statements as appropriate. 35 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Recent Accounting Pronouncements See discussion of Recent Accounting Pronouncements in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report. Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to financial market risk resulting from fluctuations in interest and foreign currency exchange rates. We do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions or hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment holdings that are diversified among money market funds, U.S. Government and Agency debt securities, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insured corporate notes, and corporate notes and bonds with effective maturities of generally three months to five years at the date of purchase. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and secondarily to generate yields. The majority of our short term investments are in fixed interest rate securities. These securities are subject to changes in fair value due to interest rate fluctuations. A revised investment policy was approved in December 2007 by our Board of Directors, limiting future investments to direct U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations, repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations, and U.S. Government and Government Agency Money Market funds. The investment policies of our subsidiaries are consistent with our primary objective to preserve principal and secondarily to generate yields. Our wholly owned insurance subsidiary invests in U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations, corporate notes and bonds, and asset and mortgage backed securities with a minimum overall portfolio average credit rating of AAA. All of our foreign subsidiaries investments are primarily in money market funds, investment grade securities, bankers acceptances, bank certificates of deposit and term deposits, all denominated in their local currencies. Additionally, our Canadian subsidiary may invest a portion of its investments in U.S. dollar investment grade securities and bank term deposits to meet current U.S. dollar obligations. Because most of our investments in cash and cash equivalents are short term, interest rate changes are not likely be material to our financial statements. Based on our overnight investments and bank balances within cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2010 and 2009, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $23 and $24 (pre tax), respectively, to interest income on an annual basis. For those investments that are classified as available for sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in market volatility and interest rates are reflected within stockholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive income. The nature and amount of our long and short term debt may vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As of the end of 2010, our fixed rate long term debt included: $41 principal amount at maturity of 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes carried at $32; $900 of 5.3% Senior Notes carried at $899; and $1,100 of 5.5% Senior Notes carried at $1,096, and additional notes totaling $78. Additionally, our variable rate long term debt included a 0.35% over Yen Tibor (6 month) Term Loan of $35. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt and may affect the interest expense related to the variable rate debt. See 36 Table of Contents Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report for more information on our long and short term debt. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Our foreign subsidiaries conduct limited transactions in their non functional currencies, which exposes us to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We manage these fluctuations, in part, through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts, seeking to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on known future expenditures denominated in a foreign currency. As of August 29, 2010, and August 30, 2009, we held forward foreign exchange contracts with a notional amount of $225 and $183, respectively. At the end of 2010 and 2009, fair value assets of $1 and $2, respectively, and a fair value liabilities of $3 and $4, respectively, were recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. A hypothetical 10% strengthening of the functional currency compared to the non functional currency exchange rates at August 29, 2010 and August 30, 2009 would have decreased the fair value of the contracts by $23 and $18, respectively. 
 
Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from warehouse operations and cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances, which were $4,749 and $3,727 at the end of 2010 and 2009, respectively. Of these balances, approximately $862 and $758 at the end of 2010 and 2009, respectively, represented debit and credit card receivables, primarily related to sales in the week prior to the end of our fiscal year. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $2,780 in 2010 compared to $2,092 in 2009. This net increase of $688 was primarily attributable to a $371 decrease in our net investment in merchandise inventories (merchandise inventories less accounts payable), an increase in net income of $224, and a $141 increase from the change in our other current operating assets and liabilities. Net cash used in investing activities totaled $2,015 in 2010 compared to $1,101 in 2009, an increase of $914. This increase relates primarily to a $1,113 decrease in cash provided by the net investment in short term investments, partially offset by a $195 decrease in cash used for purchase of property and equipment. Net cash used in financing activities totaled $719 in 2010 compared to $439 in 2009, an increase of $280. This increase was primarily attributable to a $482 increase in cash used to repurchase common stock, a $78 increase in repayments of long term debt and a $42 increase in dividends paid. These were partially offset by a $124 increase in the net proceeds from stock based awards and, a $116 increase in the net proceeds from short term borrowings. The effect of exchange rate changes, increased cash by $11 in 2010, compared to a decrease of $14 in 2009. This increase was primarily due to the strengthening of foreign currencies, primarily in Canada, Korea, and Japan during 2010. Dividends In April 2010, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash dividend from $0.18 to $0.205 per share. Our quarterly cash dividends paid in 2010 totaled $0.77 per share, as compared to $0.68 per share in 2009. Contractual Obligations Our commitments at year end to make future payments under contractual obligations were as follows, as of August 29, 2010: Payments Due by Fiscal Year Contractual obligations 2011 2012 to2013 2014 to2015 2016 andthereafter Total Purchase obligations (merchandise)(1) $ 4,492 $ 1 $ $ $ 4,493 Long term debt(2) 111 1,073 126 1,379 2,689 Operating leases(3) 162 312 282 1,572 2,328 Purchase obligations (property, equipment, services and other)(4) 246 63 309 Construction commitments 186 186 Capital lease obligations(2) 10 20 22 256 308 Other(5) 6 4 2 26 38 Total $ 5,213 $ 1,473 $ 432 $ 3,233 $ 10,351 28 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) (1) Includes open merchandise purchase orders.

(5) Consists of $26 in asset retirement obligations, $9 in deferred compensation obligations and includes $3 of current unrecognized tax benefits relating to uncertain tax positions. The total amount excludes $38 of noncurrent unrecognized tax benefits due to uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash payments. Expansion Plans Our primary requirement for capital is the financing of land, buildings, and equipment costs for new and remodeled warehouses. To a lesser extent, capital is also required for initial warehouse operations and working capital. While there can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized and plans are subject to change upon further review, it is our current intention to spend approximately $1,600 during fiscal 2011 for real estate, construction, remodeling, and equipment for warehouses and related operations. These expenditures are expected to be financed with a combination of cash provided from operations and existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. We plan to open up to 31 new warehouses in 2011, including one to two relocations of existing warehouses to larger and better located facilities. Additional Equity Investments in Subsidiaries and Joint Ventures Our investments in the Costco Mexico joint venture and in other unconsolidated joint ventures that are less than majority owned are accounted for under the equity method. We did not make any capital contributions to Costco Mexico (a 50% owned joint venture) in 2010, 2009, or 2008. 29 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Bank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs Credit FacilityDescription ExpirationDate Credit Line Usage atAugust 29, 2010 ApplicableInterestRate Entity Total ofall CreditFacilities Stand byLetter ofCredit(LC) &Letter ofGuaranty CommercialLC Short TermBorrowing AvailableCredit U.S. UncommittedStandby LC N/A $ 22 $ 22 $ $ $ N/A U.S. UncommittedCommercial LC N/A 50 9 41 N/A Australia(1) Guarantee Line N/A 9 9 N/A Canada(1)(3) Multi PurposeLine N/A 28 16 12 2.25 % Japan(1) Revolving Credit March 11 41 13 28 0.61 % Japan(1) Bank Guaranty March 11 18 18 N/A Japan(1) Revolving Credit February 11 41 13 28 0.61 % Japan(2) Commercial LC N/A 1 1 N/A Korea(1) Multi PurposeLine March 11 10 2 8 3.63 % Taiwan Multi PurposeLine January 11 22 5 17 2.63 % Taiwan Multi PurposeLine July 11 16 3 13 2.65 % United Kingdom UncommittedMoney MarketLine N/A 31 31 3.05 % United Kingdom UncommittedOverdraft Line N/A 46 46 1.50 % United Kingdom(2) Letter ofGuarantee N/A 3 3 N/A United Kingdom Commercial LC N/A 3 1 2 N/A TOTAL $ 341 $ 70 $ 9 $ 26 $ 236 (1) The U.S. parent company, Costco Wholesale Corporation, guarantees this entitys credit facility.

In November 2009, our Japanese subsidiary paid the outstanding principal and interest balances totaling $33 related to the 0.88% promissory notes due November 2009, originally issued in November 2002. In June 2008, our Japanese subsidiary entered into a ten year term loan in the amount of $35, with a variable rate of interest of Yen TIBOR (6 month) plus a 0.35% margin (0.84% and 0.95% at the end of 2010 and 2009, respectively) on the outstanding balance. Interest is payable semi annually in December and June and principal is due in June 2018. In October 2007, our Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes through a private placement in the amount of $77, bearing interest at 2.695%. Interest is payable semi annually, and principal is due in October 2017. We guarantee all of the promissory notes issued by our Japanese subsidiary. In February 2007, we issued $900 of 5.3% Senior Notes due March 15, 2012 (2012 Notes) at a discount of $2 and $1,100 of 5.5% Senior Notes due March 15, 2017 (2017 Notes) at a discount of $6 (together the 2007 Senior Notes). Interest on the 2007 Senior Notes is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The discount and issuance costs associated with the Senior Notes are being amortized to interest expense over the terms of those notes. At our option, we may redeem the 2007 Senior Notes at any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount of the 2007 Senior Notes to be redeemed, or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, we will be required to make an offer to purchase the 2007 Senior Notes at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase, upon certain events as defined by the terms of the 2007 Senior Notes. In August 1997, we sold $900 principal amount at maturity 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes (Zero Coupon Notes) due in August 2017. The Zero Coupon Notes were priced with a yield to maturity of 3.5%, resulting in gross proceeds to the Company of $450. The remaining Zero Coupon Notes outstanding are convertible into a maximum of 943,000 shares of Costco Common Stock shares at an initial conversion price of $22.71. Holders of the Zero Coupon Notes may require us to purchase the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of purchase) in August 2012. At our option, we may redeem the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of redemption) any time after August 2002. As of August 29, 2010, $859 in principal amount of Zero Coupon Notes had been converted by note holders to shares of Costco Common Stock, of which the principal converted during 2010, 2009 and 2008 is detailed in the table below: 2010 2009 2008 Principal converted during period $ 1 $ 25 $ 1 Principal converted, including the related debt discount $ 1 $ 19 $ 0 Shares issued upon conversion (000s) 18 562 13 Derivatives We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in the normal course of our business, which we manage, in part, through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts seeking to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on known future expenditures denominated in a foreign 32 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) currency. The contracts are intended primarily to hedge U.S. dollar merchandise inventory expenditures. Currently, these contracts do not qualify for derivative hedge accounting. We seek to mitigate risk with the use of these contracts and do not intend to engage in speculative transactions. These contracts do not contain any credit risk related contingent features. We seek to manage the counterparty risk associated with these contracts by limiting transactions to counterparties with which we have established banking relationships. There can be no assurance, however, that this practice effectively mitigates counterparty risk. The contracts are limited to less than one year. See Note 1 and Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report, for additional information related to these contracts. We are exposed to fluctuations in energy prices, particularly electricity and natural gas, which we seek to partially mitigate through the use of fixed price contracts for approximately 26% of our warehouses and other facilities in the U.S. and Canada. We also enter into variable priced contracts for some purchases of natural gas, in addition to fuel for our gas stations on an index basis. These contracts generally qualify for treatment as normal purchases or normal sales and require no mark to market adjustment. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements With the exception of our operating leases, we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition or consolidated financial statements. Stock Repurchase Programs In September and November of 2007, our Board of Directors approved $300 and $1,000, respectively, of stock repurchases, which expire in August 2010 and November 2010. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an additional $1,000, which expires in July 2011, bringing total authorizations by our Board of Directors since inception of the program in 2001 to $6,800. During 2010, we repurchased 9,943,000 shares of common stock, at an average price of $57.14 per share, totaling approximately $568. During 2009, we repurchased 895,000 shares of common stock, at an average price of $63.84 per share, totaling approximately $57. The remaining amount available to be purchased under our approved plan was $1,434 at the end of 2010, $434 of which expires in November 2010. Purchases are made from time to time, as conditions warrant, in the open market or in block purchases and pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5 1. Repurchased shares are retired, in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments. We continue to review our accounting policies and evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, investments, merchandise inventory valuation, impairment of long lived assets, warehouse closing costs, insurance/self insurance liabilities, and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. 33 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Revenue Recognition We generally recognize sales, net of estimated returns, at the time the member takes possession of merchandise or receives services. When we collect payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services, the amount received is generally recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed. We provide for estimated sales returns based on historical trends in merchandise returns. Amounts collected from members that under common trade practices are referred to as sales taxes are recorded on a net basis. We evaluate whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, when we are the primary obligor, subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, influence product or service specifications, or have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded on a gross basis. If we are not the primary obligor and do not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above, we record the net amounts as commissions earned, which is reflected in net sales. Membership fee revenue represents annual membership fees paid by our members. We account for membership fee revenue, net of estimated refunds, on a deferred basis, whereby revenue is recognized ratably over the one year membership period. Our Executive members qualify for a 2% reward (which can be redeemed only at Costco warehouses), up to a maximum of $500 per year, on qualified purchases made at Costco. We account for this 2% reward as a reduction in sales, with the related liability being classified within other current liabilities. The sales reduction and corresponding liability are computed after giving effect to the estimated impact of non redemptions based on historical data. Investments Investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other than temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment. We employ a methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and our intent and ability to hold the investment. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the issuer, including industry and sector performance, operational and financing cash flow factors, and rating agency actions. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and or issuer conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments. Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, as determined primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting, and are stated using the last in, first out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail inventory method of accounting and are stated using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. We believe the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. We record an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the expected annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end. At the end of 2008, due to overall net inflationary trends, merchandise 34 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) inventories valued at LIFO were lower than the FIFO value, resulting in a $32 charge to merchandise costs. During 2009, due to overall deflationary trends, we recorded a $32 benefit to merchandise costs to adjust inventories valued at LIFO. At the end of 2010 and 2009, merchandise inventories valued at LIFO approximated FIFO after considering the lower of cost or market principle. We provide for estimated inventory losses (shrink) between physical inventory counts as a percentage of net sales. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect results of the actual physical inventory counts, which generally occur in the second and fourth quarters of the year. Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as we progress toward earning those rebates, provided they are probable and reasonably estimable. Other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of agreement, or other systematic and rational approaches. Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Warehouse Closing costs We periodically evaluate our long lived assets for indicators of impairment, such as a decision to relocate or close a warehouse facility. Our judgments are based on existing market and operational conditions. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring a downward adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value. We provide estimates for warehouse closing costs for leased and owned locations to be closed or relocated. A considerable amount of judgment is involved in determining any impairment or our net liability, particularly related to the estimated sales price of owned locations and the potential sublease income at leased locations. These estimates are based on real estate conditions in the markets and our experience in those markets. We make assumptions about the average period of time it would take to sublease the location and the amount of potential sublease income for each leased location. We reassess our liability each quarter and adjust our liability accordingly when our estimates change. Insurance/Self Insurance Liabilities We use a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance pool, to provide for potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property damage, director and officers liability, vehicle liability, and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Income Taxes At the beginning of 2008, we adopted authoritative guidance related to uncertain tax positions, which sets out criteria for the use of judgment in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items. The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Significant judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions. The benefits associated with uncertain tax positions are recorded in our consolidated financial statements only after determining a more likely than not probability that the positions will withstand challenge from tax authorities. When facts and circumstances change, we reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the consolidated financial statements as appropriate. 35 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Recent Accounting Pronouncements See discussion of Recent Accounting Pronouncements in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report. Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to financial market risk resulting from fluctuations in interest and foreign currency exchange rates. We do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions or hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment holdings that are diversified among money market funds, U.S. Government and Agency debt securities, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insured corporate notes, and corporate notes and bonds with effective maturities of generally three months to five years at the date of purchase. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and secondarily to generate yields. The majority of our short term investments are in fixed interest rate securities. These securities are subject to changes in fair value due to interest rate fluctuations. A revised investment policy was approved in December 2007 by our Board of Directors, limiting future investments to direct U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations, repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations, and U.S. Government and Government Agency Money Market funds. The investment policies of our subsidiaries are consistent with our primary objective to preserve principal and secondarily to generate yields. Our wholly owned insurance subsidiary invests in U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations, corporate notes and bonds, and asset and mortgage backed securities with a minimum overall portfolio average credit rating of AAA. All of our foreign subsidiaries investments are primarily in money market funds, investment grade securities, bankers acceptances, bank certificates of deposit and term deposits, all denominated in their local currencies. Additionally, our Canadian subsidiary may invest a portion of its investments in U.S. dollar investment grade securities and bank term deposits to meet current U.S. dollar obligations. Because most of our investments in cash and cash equivalents are short term, interest rate changes are not likely be material to our financial statements. Based on our overnight investments and bank balances within cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2010 and 2009, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $23 and $24 (pre tax), respectively, to interest income on an annual basis. For those investments that are classified as available for sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in market volatility and interest rates are reflected within stockholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive income. The nature and amount of our long and short term debt may vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As of the end of 2010, our fixed rate long term debt included: $41 principal amount at maturity of 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes carried at $32; $900 of 5.3% Senior Notes carried at $899; and $1,100 of 5.5% Senior Notes carried at $1,096, and additional notes totaling $78. Additionally, our variable rate long term debt included a 0.35% over Yen Tibor (6 month) Term Loan of $35. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt and may affect the interest expense related to the variable rate debt. See 36 Table of Contents Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report for more information on our long and short term debt. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Our foreign subsidiaries conduct limited transactions in their non functional currencies, which exposes us to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We manage these fluctuations, in part, through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts, seeking to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on known future expenditures denominated in a foreign currency. As of August 29, 2010, and August 30, 2009, we held forward foreign exchange contracts with a notional amount of $225 and $183, respectively. At the end of 2010 and 2009, fair value assets of $1 and $2, respectively, and a fair value liabilities of $3 and $4, respectively, were recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. A hypothetical 10% strengthening of the functional currency compared to the non functional currency exchange rates at August 29, 2010 and August 30, 2009 would have decreased the fair value of the contracts by $23 and $18, respectively.

These expenditures are expected to be financed with a combination of cash provided from operations and existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. We plan to open up to 31 new warehouses in 2011, including one to two relocations of existing warehouses to larger and better located facilities. Additional Equity Investments in Subsidiaries and Joint Ventures Our investments in the Costco Mexico joint venture and in other unconsolidated joint ventures that are less than majority owned are accounted for under the equity method. We did not make any capital contributions to Costco Mexico (a 50% owned joint venture) in 2010, 2009, or 2008. 29 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Bank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs Credit FacilityDescription ExpirationDate Credit Line Usage atAugust 29, 2010 ApplicableInterestRate Entity Total ofall CreditFacilities Stand byLetter ofCredit(LC) &Letter ofGuaranty CommercialLC Short TermBorrowing AvailableCredit U.S. UncommittedStandby LC N/A $ 22 $ 22 $ $ $ N/A U.S. UncommittedCommercial LC N/A 50 9 41 N/A Australia(1) Guarantee Line N/A 9 9 N/A Canada(1)(3) Multi PurposeLine N/A 28 16 12 2.25 % Japan(1) Revolving Credit March 11 41 13 28 0.61 % Japan(1) Bank Guaranty March 11 18 18 N/A Japan(1) Revolving Credit February 11 41 13 28 0.61 % Japan(2) Commercial LC N/A 1 1 N/A Korea(1) Multi PurposeLine March 11 10 2 8 3.63 % Taiwan Multi PurposeLine January 11 22 5 17 2.63 % Taiwan Multi PurposeLine July 11 16 3 13 2.65 % United Kingdom UncommittedMoney MarketLine N/A 31 31 3.05 % United Kingdom UncommittedOverdraft Line N/A 46 46 1.50 % United Kingdom(2) Letter ofGuarantee N/A 3 3 N/A United Kingdom Commercial LC N/A 3 1 2 N/A TOTAL $ 341 $ 70 $ 9 $ 26 $ 236 (1) The U.S. parent company, Costco Wholesale Corporation, guarantees this entitys credit facility.

In November 2009, our Japanese subsidiary paid the outstanding principal and interest balances totaling $33 related to the 0.88% promissory notes due November 2009, originally issued in November 2002. In June 2008, our Japanese subsidiary entered into a ten year term loan in the amount of $35, with a variable rate of interest of Yen TIBOR (6 month) plus a 0.35% margin (0.84% and 0.95% at the end of 2010 and 2009, respectively) on the outstanding balance. Interest is payable semi annually in December and June and principal is due in June 2018. In October 2007, our Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes through a private placement in the amount of $77, bearing interest at 2.695%. Interest is payable semi annually, and principal is due in October 2017. We guarantee all of the promissory notes issued by our Japanese subsidiary. In February 2007, we issued $900 of 5.3% Senior Notes due March 15, 2012 (2012 Notes) at a discount of $2 and $1,100 of 5.5% Senior Notes due March 15, 2017 (2017 Notes) at a discount of $6 (together the 2007 Senior Notes). Interest on the 2007 Senior Notes is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The discount and issuance costs associated with the Senior Notes are being amortized to interest expense over the terms of those notes. At our option, we may redeem the 2007 Senior Notes at any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount of the 2007 Senior Notes to be redeemed, or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, we will be required to make an offer to purchase the 2007 Senior Notes at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase, upon certain events as defined by the terms of the 2007 Senior Notes. In August 1997, we sold $900 principal amount at maturity 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes (Zero Coupon Notes) due in August 2017. The Zero Coupon Notes were priced with a yield to maturity of 3.5%, resulting in gross proceeds to the Company of $450. The remaining Zero Coupon Notes outstanding are convertible into a maximum of 943,000 shares of Costco Common Stock shares at an initial conversion price of $22.71. Holders of the Zero Coupon Notes may require us to purchase the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of purchase) in August 2012. At our option, we may redeem the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of redemption) any time after August 2002. As of August 29, 2010, $859 in principal amount of Zero Coupon Notes had been converted by note holders to shares of Costco Common Stock, of which the principal converted during 2010, 2009 and 2008 is detailed in the table below: 2010 2009 2008 Principal converted during period $ 1 $ 25 $ 1 Principal converted, including the related debt discount $ 1 $ 19 $ 0 Shares issued upon conversion (000s) 18 562 13 Derivatives We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in the normal course of our business, which we manage, in part, through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts seeking to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on known future expenditures denominated in a foreign 32 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) currency. The contracts are intended primarily to hedge U.S. dollar merchandise inventory expenditures. Currently, these contracts do not qualify for derivative hedge accounting. We seek to mitigate risk with the use of these contracts and do not intend to engage in speculative transactions. These contracts do not contain any credit risk related contingent features. We seek to manage the counterparty risk associated with these contracts by limiting transactions to counterparties with which we have established banking relationships. There can be no assurance, however, that this practice effectively mitigates counterparty risk. The contracts are limited to less than one year. See Note 1 and Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report, for additional information related to these contracts. We are exposed to fluctuations in energy prices, particularly electricity and natural gas, which we seek to partially mitigate through the use of fixed price contracts for approximately 26% of our warehouses and other facilities in the U.S. and Canada. We also enter into variable priced contracts for some purchases of natural gas, in addition to fuel for our gas stations on an index basis. These contracts generally qualify for treatment as normal purchases or normal sales and require no mark to market adjustment. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements With the exception of our operating leases, we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition or consolidated financial statements. Stock Repurchase Programs In September and November of 2007, our Board of Directors approved $300 and $1,000, respectively, of stock repurchases, which expire in August 2010 and November 2010. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an additional $1,000, which expires in July 2011, bringing total authorizations by our Board of Directors since inception of the program in 2001 to $6,800. During 2010, we repurchased 9,943,000 shares of common stock, at an average price of $57.14 per share, totaling approximately $568. During 2009, we repurchased 895,000 shares of common stock, at an average price of $63.84 per share, totaling approximately $57. The remaining amount available to be purchased under our approved plan was $1,434 at the end of 2010, $434 of which expires in November 2010. Purchases are made from time to time, as conditions warrant, in the open market or in block purchases and pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5 1. Repurchased shares are retired, in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments. We continue to review our accounting policies and evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, investments, merchandise inventory valuation, impairment of long lived assets, warehouse closing costs, insurance/self insurance liabilities, and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. 33 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Revenue Recognition We generally recognize sales, net of estimated returns, at the time the member takes possession of merchandise or receives services. When we collect payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services, the amount received is generally recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed. We provide for estimated sales returns based on historical trends in merchandise returns. Amounts collected from members that under common trade practices are referred to as sales taxes are recorded on a net basis. We evaluate whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, when we are the primary obligor, subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, influence product or service specifications, or have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded on a gross basis. If we are not the primary obligor and do not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above, we record the net amounts as commissions earned, which is reflected in net sales. Membership fee revenue represents annual membership fees paid by our members. We account for membership fee revenue, net of estimated refunds, on a deferred basis, whereby revenue is recognized ratably over the one year membership period. Our Executive members qualify for a 2% reward (which can be redeemed only at Costco warehouses), up to a maximum of $500 per year, on qualified purchases made at Costco. We account for this 2% reward as a reduction in sales, with the related liability being classified within other current liabilities. The sales reduction and corresponding liability are computed after giving effect to the estimated impact of non redemptions based on historical data. Investments Investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other than temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment. We employ a methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and our intent and ability to hold the investment. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the issuer, including industry and sector performance, operational and financing cash flow factors, and rating agency actions. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and or issuer conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments. Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, as determined primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting, and are stated using the last in, first out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail inventory method of accounting and are stated using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. We believe the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. We record an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the expected annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end. At the end of 2008, due to overall net inflationary trends, merchandise 34 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) inventories valued at LIFO were lower than the FIFO value, resulting in a $32 charge to merchandise costs. During 2009, due to overall deflationary trends, we recorded a $32 benefit to merchandise costs to adjust inventories valued at LIFO. At the end of 2010 and 2009, merchandise inventories valued at LIFO approximated FIFO after considering the lower of cost or market principle. We provide for estimated inventory losses (shrink) between physical inventory counts as a percentage of net sales. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect results of the actual physical inventory counts, which generally occur in the second and fourth quarters of the year. Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as we progress toward earning those rebates, provided they are probable and reasonably estimable. Other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of agreement, or other systematic and rational approaches. Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Warehouse Closing costs We periodically evaluate our long lived assets for indicators of impairment, such as a decision to relocate or close a warehouse facility. Our judgments are based on existing market and operational conditions. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring a downward adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value. We provide estimates for warehouse closing costs for leased and owned locations to be closed or relocated. A considerable amount of judgment is involved in determining any impairment or our net liability, particularly related to the estimated sales price of owned locations and the potential sublease income at leased locations. These estimates are based on real estate conditions in the markets and our experience in those markets. We make assumptions about the average period of time it would take to sublease the location and the amount of potential sublease income for each leased location. We reassess our liability each quarter and adjust our liability accordingly when our estimates change. Insurance/Self Insurance Liabilities We use a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance pool, to provide for potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property damage, director and officers liability, vehicle liability, and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Income Taxes At the beginning of 2008, we adopted authoritative guidance related to uncertain tax positions, which sets out criteria for the use of judgment in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items. The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Significant judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions. The benefits associated with uncertain tax positions are recorded in our consolidated financial statements only after determining a more likely than not probability that the positions will withstand challenge from tax authorities. When facts and circumstances change, we reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the consolidated financial statements as appropriate. 35 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Recent Accounting Pronouncements See discussion of Recent Accounting Pronouncements in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report. Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to financial market risk resulting from fluctuations in interest and foreign currency exchange rates. We do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions or hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment holdings that are diversified among money market funds, U.S. Government and Agency debt securities, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insured corporate notes, and corporate notes and bonds with effective maturities of generally three months to five years at the date of purchase. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and secondarily to generate yields. The majority of our short term investments are in fixed interest rate securities. These securities are subject to changes in fair value due to interest rate fluctuations. A revised investment policy was approved in December 2007 by our Board of Directors, limiting future investments to direct U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations, repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations, and U.S. Government and Government Agency Money Market funds. The investment policies of our subsidiaries are consistent with our primary objective to preserve principal and secondarily to generate yields. Our wholly owned insurance subsidiary invests in U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations, corporate notes and bonds, and asset and mortgage backed securities with a minimum overall portfolio average credit rating of AAA. All of our foreign subsidiaries investments are primarily in money market funds, investment grade securities, bankers acceptances, bank certificates of deposit and term deposits, all denominated in their local currencies. Additionally, our Canadian subsidiary may invest a portion of its investments in U.S. dollar investment grade securities and bank term deposits to meet current U.S. dollar obligations. Because most of our investments in cash and cash equivalents are short term, interest rate changes are not likely be material to our financial statements. Based on our overnight investments and bank balances within cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2010 and 2009, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $23 and $24 (pre tax), respectively, to interest income on an annual basis. For those investments that are classified as available for sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in market volatility and interest rates are reflected within stockholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive income. The nature and amount of our long and short term debt may vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As of the end of 2010, our fixed rate long term debt included: $41 principal amount at maturity of 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes carried at $32; $900 of 5.3% Senior Notes carried at $899; and $1,100 of 5.5% Senior Notes carried at $1,096, and additional notes totaling $78. Additionally, our variable rate long term debt included a 0.35% over Yen Tibor (6 month) Term Loan of $35. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt and may affect the interest expense related to the variable rate debt. See 36 Table of Contents Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report for more information on our long and short term debt. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Our foreign subsidiaries conduct limited transactions in their non functional currencies, which exposes us to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We manage these fluctuations, in part, through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts, seeking to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on known future expenditures denominated in a foreign currency. As of August 29, 2010, and August 30, 2009, we held forward foreign exchange contracts with a notional amount of $225 and $183, respectively. At the end of 2010 and 2009, fair value assets of $1 and $2, respectively, and a fair value liabilities of $3 and $4, respectively, were recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. A hypothetical 10% strengthening of the functional currency compared to the non functional currency exchange rates at August 29, 2010 and August 30, 2009 would have decreased the fair value of the contracts by $23 and $18, respectively.

During 2010, we repurchased 9,943,000 shares of common stock, at an average price of $57.14 per share, totaling approximately $568. During 2009, we repurchased 895,000 shares of common stock, at an average price of $63.84 per share, totaling approximately $57. The remaining amount available to be purchased under our approved plan was $1,434 at the end of 2010, $434 of which expires in November 2010. Purchases are made from time to time, as conditions warrant, in the open market or in block purchases and pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5 1. Repurchased shares are retired, in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments. We continue to review our accounting policies and evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, investments, merchandise inventory valuation, impairment of long lived assets, warehouse closing costs, insurance/self insurance liabilities, and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. 33 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Revenue Recognition We generally recognize sales, net of estimated returns, at the time the member takes possession of merchandise or receives services. When we collect payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services, the amount received is generally recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed. We provide for estimated sales returns based on historical trends in merchandise returns. Amounts collected from members that under common trade practices are referred to as sales taxes are recorded on a net basis. We evaluate whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, when we are the primary obligor, subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, influence product or service specifications, or have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded on a gross basis. If we are not the primary obligor and do not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above, we record the net amounts as commissions earned, which is reflected in net sales. Membership fee revenue represents annual membership fees paid by our members. We account for membership fee revenue, net of estimated refunds, on a deferred basis, whereby revenue is recognized ratably over the one year membership period. Our Executive members qualify for a 2% reward (which can be redeemed only at Costco warehouses), up to a maximum of $500 per year, on qualified purchases made at Costco. We account for this 2% reward as a reduction in sales, with the related liability being classified within other current liabilities. The sales reduction and corresponding liability are computed after giving effect to the estimated impact of non redemptions based on historical data. Investments Investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other than temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment. We employ a methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and our intent and ability to hold the investment. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the issuer, including industry and sector performance, operational and financing cash flow factors, and rating agency actions. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and or issuer conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments. Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, as determined primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting, and are stated using the last in, first out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail inventory method of accounting and are stated using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. We believe the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. We record an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the expected annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end. At the end of 2008, due to overall net inflationary trends, merchandise 34 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) inventories valued at LIFO were lower than the FIFO value, resulting in a $32 charge to merchandise costs. During 2009, due to overall deflationary trends, we recorded a $32 benefit to merchandise costs to adjust inventories valued at LIFO. At the end of 2010 and 2009, merchandise inventories valued at LIFO approximated FIFO after considering the lower of cost or market principle. We provide for estimated inventory losses (shrink) between physical inventory counts as a percentage of net sales. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect results of the actual physical inventory counts, which generally occur in the second and fourth quarters of the year. Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as we progress toward earning those rebates, provided they are probable and reasonably estimable. Other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of agreement, or other systematic and rational approaches. Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Warehouse Closing costs We periodically evaluate our long lived assets for indicators of impairment, such as a decision to relocate or close a warehouse facility. Our judgments are based on existing market and operational conditions. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring a downward adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value. We provide estimates for warehouse closing costs for leased and owned locations to be closed or relocated. A considerable amount of judgment is involved in determining any impairment or our net liability, particularly related to the estimated sales price of owned locations and the potential sublease income at leased locations. These estimates are based on real estate conditions in the markets and our experience in those markets. We make assumptions about the average period of time it would take to sublease the location and the amount of potential sublease income for each leased location. We reassess our liability each quarter and adjust our liability accordingly when our estimates change. Insurance/Self Insurance Liabilities We use a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance pool, to provide for potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property damage, director and officers liability, vehicle liability, and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Income Taxes At the beginning of 2008, we adopted authoritative guidance related to uncertain tax positions, which sets out criteria for the use of judgment in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items. The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Significant judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions. The benefits associated with uncertain tax positions are recorded in our consolidated financial statements only after determining a more likely than not probability that the positions will withstand challenge from tax authorities. When facts and circumstances change, we reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the consolidated financial statements as appropriate. 35 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Recent Accounting Pronouncements See discussion of Recent Accounting Pronouncements in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report. Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to financial market risk resulting from fluctuations in interest and foreign currency exchange rates. We do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions or hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment holdings that are diversified among money market funds, U.S. Government and Agency debt securities, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insured corporate notes, and corporate notes and bonds with effective maturities of generally three months to five years at the date of purchase. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and secondarily to generate yields. The majority of our short term investments are in fixed interest rate securities. These securities are subject to changes in fair value due to interest rate fluctuations. A revised investment policy was approved in December 2007 by our Board of Directors, limiting future investments to direct U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations, repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations, and U.S. Government and Government Agency Money Market funds. The investment policies of our subsidiaries are consistent with our primary objective to preserve principal and secondarily to generate yields. Our wholly owned insurance subsidiary invests in U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations, corporate notes and bonds, and asset and mortgage backed securities with a minimum overall portfolio average credit rating of AAA. All of our foreign subsidiaries investments are primarily in money market funds, investment grade securities, bankers acceptances, bank certificates of deposit and term deposits, all denominated in their local currencies. Additionally, our Canadian subsidiary may invest a portion of its investments in U.S. dollar investment grade securities and bank term deposits to meet current U.S. dollar obligations. Because most of our investments in cash and cash equivalents are short term, interest rate changes are not likely be material to our financial statements. Based on our overnight investments and bank balances within cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2010 and 2009, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $23 and $24 (pre tax), respectively, to interest income on an annual basis. For those investments that are classified as available for sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in market volatility and interest rates are reflected within stockholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive income. The nature and amount of our long and short term debt may vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As of the end of 2010, our fixed rate long term debt included: $41 principal amount at maturity of 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes carried at $32; $900 of 5.3% Senior Notes carried at $899; and $1,100 of 5.5% Senior Notes carried at $1,096, and additional notes totaling $78. Additionally, our variable rate long term debt included a 0.35% over Yen Tibor (6 month) Term Loan of $35. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt and may affect the interest expense related to the variable rate debt. See 36 Table of Contents Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report for more information on our long and short term debt. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Our foreign subsidiaries conduct limited transactions in their non functional currencies, which exposes us to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We manage these fluctuations, in part, through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts, seeking to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on known future expenditures denominated in a foreign currency. As of August 29, 2010, and August 30, 2009, we held forward foreign exchange contracts with a notional amount of $225 and $183, respectively. At the end of 2010 and 2009, fair value assets of $1 and $2, respectively, and a fair value liabilities of $3 and $4, respectively, were recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. A hypothetical 10% strengthening of the functional currency compared to the non functional currency exchange rates at August 29, 2010 and August 30, 2009 would have decreased the fair value of the contracts by $23 and $18, respectively.

In November 2009, our Japanese subsidiary paid the outstanding principal and interest balances totaling $33 related to the 0.88% promissory notes due November 2009, originally issued in November 2002. In June 2008, our Japanese subsidiary entered into a ten year term loan in the amount of $35, with a variable rate of interest of Yen TIBOR (6 month) plus a 0.35% margin (0.84% and 0.95% at the end of 2010 and 2009, respectively) on the outstanding balance. Interest is payable semi annually in December and June and principal is due in June 2018. In October 2007, our Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes through a private placement in the amount of $77, bearing interest at 2.695%. Interest is payable semi annually, and principal is due in October 2017. We guarantee all of the promissory notes issued by our Japanese subsidiary. In February 2007, we issued $900 of 5.3% Senior Notes due March 15, 2012 (2012 Notes) at a discount of $2 and $1,100 of 5.5% Senior Notes due March 15, 2017 (2017 Notes) at a discount of $6 (together the 2007 Senior Notes). Interest on the 2007 Senior Notes is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The discount and issuance costs associated with the Senior Notes are being amortized to interest expense over the terms of those notes. At our option, we may redeem the 2007 Senior Notes at any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount of the 2007 Senior Notes to be redeemed, or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, we will be required to make an offer to purchase the 2007 Senior Notes at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase, upon certain events as defined by the terms of the 2007 Senior Notes. In August 1997, we sold $900 principal amount at maturity 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes (Zero Coupon Notes) due in August 2017. The Zero Coupon Notes were priced with a yield to maturity of 3.5%, resulting in gross proceeds to the Company of $450. The remaining Zero Coupon Notes outstanding are convertible into a maximum of 943,000 shares of Costco Common Stock shares at an initial conversion price of $22.71. Holders of the Zero Coupon Notes may require us to purchase the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of purchase) in August 2012. At our option, we may redeem the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of redemption) any time after August 2002. As of August 29, 2010, $859 in principal amount of Zero Coupon Notes had been converted by note holders to shares of Costco Common Stock, of which the principal converted during 2010, 2009 and 2008 is detailed in the table below: 2010 2009 2008 Principal converted during period $ 1 $ 25 $ 1 Principal converted, including the related debt discount $ 1 $ 19 $ 0 Shares issued upon conversion (000s) 18 562 13 Derivatives We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in the normal course of our business, which we manage, in part, through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts seeking to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on known future expenditures denominated in a foreign 32 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) currency. The contracts are intended primarily to hedge U.S. dollar merchandise inventory expenditures. Currently, these contracts do not qualify for derivative hedge accounting. We seek to mitigate risk with the use of these contracts and do not intend to engage in speculative transactions. These contracts do not contain any credit risk related contingent features. We seek to manage the counterparty risk associated with these contracts by limiting transactions to counterparties with which we have established banking relationships. There can be no assurance, however, that this practice effectively mitigates counterparty risk. The contracts are limited to less than one year. See Note 1 and Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report, for additional information related to these contracts. We are exposed to fluctuations in energy prices, particularly electricity and natural gas, which we seek to partially mitigate through the use of fixed price contracts for approximately 26% of our warehouses and other facilities in the U.S. and Canada. We also enter into variable priced contracts for some purchases of natural gas, in addition to fuel for our gas stations on an index basis. These contracts generally qualify for treatment as normal purchases or normal sales and require no mark to market adjustment. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements With the exception of our operating leases, we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition or consolidated financial statements. Stock Repurchase Programs In September and November of 2007, our Board of Directors approved $300 and $1,000, respectively, of stock repurchases, which expire in August 2010 and November 2010. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an additional $1,000, which expires in July 2011, bringing total authorizations by our Board of Directors since inception of the program in 2001 to $6,800. During 2010, we repurchased 9,943,000 shares of common stock, at an average price of $57.14 per share, totaling approximately $568. During 2009, we repurchased 895,000 shares of common stock, at an average price of $63.84 per share, totaling approximately $57. The remaining amount available to be purchased under our approved plan was $1,434 at the end of 2010, $434 of which expires in November 2010. Purchases are made from time to time, as conditions warrant, in the open market or in block purchases and pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5 1. Repurchased shares are retired, in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments. We continue to review our accounting policies and evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, investments, merchandise inventory valuation, impairment of long lived assets, warehouse closing costs, insurance/self insurance liabilities, and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. 33 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Revenue Recognition We generally recognize sales, net of estimated returns, at the time the member takes possession of merchandise or receives services. When we collect payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services, the amount received is generally recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed. We provide for estimated sales returns based on historical trends in merchandise returns. Amounts collected from members that under common trade practices are referred to as sales taxes are recorded on a net basis. We evaluate whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, when we are the primary obligor, subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, influence product or service specifications, or have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded on a gross basis. If we are not the primary obligor and do not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above, we record the net amounts as commissions earned, which is reflected in net sales. Membership fee revenue represents annual membership fees paid by our members. We account for membership fee revenue, net of estimated refunds, on a deferred basis, whereby revenue is recognized ratably over the one year membership period. Our Executive members qualify for a 2% reward (which can be redeemed only at Costco warehouses), up to a maximum of $500 per year, on qualified purchases made at Costco. We account for this 2% reward as a reduction in sales, with the related liability being classified within other current liabilities. The sales reduction and corresponding liability are computed after giving effect to the estimated impact of non redemptions based on historical data. Investments Investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other than temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment. We employ a methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and our intent and ability to hold the investment. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the issuer, including industry and sector performance, operational and financing cash flow factors, and rating agency actions. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and or issuer conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments. Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, as determined primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting, and are stated using the last in, first out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail inventory method of accounting and are stated using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. We believe the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. We record an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the expected annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end. At the end of 2008, due to overall net inflationary trends, merchandise 34 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) inventories valued at LIFO were lower than the FIFO value, resulting in a $32 charge to merchandise costs. During 2009, due to overall deflationary trends, we recorded a $32 benefit to merchandise costs to adjust inventories valued at LIFO. At the end of 2010 and 2009, merchandise inventories valued at LIFO approximated FIFO after considering the lower of cost or market principle. We provide for estimated inventory losses (shrink) between physical inventory counts as a percentage of net sales. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect results of the actual physical inventory counts, which generally occur in the second and fourth quarters of the year. Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as we progress toward earning those rebates, provided they are probable and reasonably estimable. Other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of agreement, or other systematic and rational approaches. Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Warehouse Closing costs We periodically evaluate our long lived assets for indicators of impairment, such as a decision to relocate or close a warehouse facility. Our judgments are based on existing market and operational conditions. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring a downward adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value. We provide estimates for warehouse closing costs for leased and owned locations to be closed or relocated. A considerable amount of judgment is involved in determining any impairment or our net liability, particularly related to the estimated sales price of owned locations and the potential sublease income at leased locations. These estimates are based on real estate conditions in the markets and our experience in those markets. We make assumptions about the average period of time it would take to sublease the location and the amount of potential sublease income for each leased location. We reassess our liability each quarter and adjust our liability accordingly when our estimates change. Insurance/Self Insurance Liabilities We use a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance pool, to provide for potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property damage, director and officers liability, vehicle liability, and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Income Taxes At the beginning of 2008, we adopted authoritative guidance related to uncertain tax positions, which sets out criteria for the use of judgment in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items. The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Significant judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions. The benefits associated with uncertain tax positions are recorded in our consolidated financial statements only after determining a more likely than not probability that the positions will withstand challenge from tax authorities. When facts and circumstances change, we reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the consolidated financial statements as appropriate. 35 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Recent Accounting Pronouncements See discussion of Recent Accounting Pronouncements in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report. Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to financial market risk resulting from fluctuations in interest and foreign currency exchange rates. We do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions or hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment holdings that are diversified among money market funds, U.S. Government and Agency debt securities, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insured corporate notes, and corporate notes and bonds with effective maturities of generally three months to five years at the date of purchase. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and secondarily to generate yields. The majority of our short term investments are in fixed interest rate securities. These securities are subject to changes in fair value due to interest rate fluctuations. A revised investment policy was approved in December 2007 by our Board of Directors, limiting future investments to direct U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations, repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations, and U.S. Government and Government Agency Money Market funds. The investment policies of our subsidiaries are consistent with our primary objective to preserve principal and secondarily to generate yields. Our wholly owned insurance subsidiary invests in U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations, corporate notes and bonds, and asset and mortgage backed securities with a minimum overall portfolio average credit rating of AAA. All of our foreign subsidiaries investments are primarily in money market funds, investment grade securities, bankers acceptances, bank certificates of deposit and term deposits, all denominated in their local currencies. Additionally, our Canadian subsidiary may invest a portion of its investments in U.S. dollar investment grade securities and bank term deposits to meet current U.S. dollar obligations. Because most of our investments in cash and cash equivalents are short term, interest rate changes are not likely be material to our financial statements. Based on our overnight investments and bank balances within cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2010 and 2009, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $23 and $24 (pre tax), respectively, to interest income on an annual basis. For those investments that are classified as available for sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in market volatility and interest rates are reflected within stockholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive income. The nature and amount of our long and short term debt may vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As of the end of 2010, our fixed rate long term debt included: $41 principal amount at maturity of 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes carried at $32; $900 of 5.3% Senior Notes carried at $899; and $1,100 of 5.5% Senior Notes carried at $1,096, and additional notes totaling $78. Additionally, our variable rate long term debt included a 0.35% over Yen Tibor (6 month) Term Loan of $35. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt and may affect the interest expense related to the variable rate debt. See 36 Table of Contents Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report for more information on our long and short term debt. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Our foreign subsidiaries conduct limited transactions in their non functional currencies, which exposes us to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We manage these fluctuations, in part, through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts, seeking to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on known future expenditures denominated in a foreign currency. As of August 29, 2010, and August 30, 2009, we held forward foreign exchange contracts with a notional amount of $225 and $183, respectively. At the end of 2010 and 2009, fair value assets of $1 and $2, respectively, and a fair value liabilities of $3 and $4, respectively, were recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. A hypothetical 10% strengthening of the functional currency compared to the non functional currency exchange rates at August 29, 2010 and August 30, 2009 would have decreased the fair value of the contracts by $23 and $18, respectively. 
 
Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Financing Activities In April 2010, our Japanese subsidiary paid the outstanding principal and interest balances totaling $44 related to the 0.92% promissory notes due April 2010, originally issued in April 2003. In November 2009, our Japanese subsidiary paid the outstanding principal and interest balances totaling $33 related to the 0.88% promissory notes due November 2009, originally issued in November 2002. In June 2008, our Japanese subsidiary entered into a ten year term loan in the amount of $35, with a variable rate of interest of Yen TIBOR (6 month) plus a 0.35% margin (0.84% and 0.95% at the end of 2010 and 2009, respectively) on the outstanding balance. Interest is payable semi annually in December and June and principal is due in June 2018. In October 2007, our Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes through a private placement in the amount of $77, bearing interest at 2.695%. Interest is payable semi annually, and principal is due in October 2017. We guarantee all of the promissory notes issued by our Japanese subsidiary. In February 2007, we issued $900 of 5.3% Senior Notes due March 15, 2012 (2012 Notes) at a discount of $2 and $1,100 of 5.5% Senior Notes due March 15, 2017 (2017 Notes) at a discount of $6 (together the 2007 Senior Notes). Interest on the 2007 Senior Notes is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The discount and issuance costs associated with the Senior Notes are being amortized to interest expense over the terms of those notes. At our option, we may redeem the 2007 Senior Notes at any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount of the 2007 Senior Notes to be redeemed, or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, we will be required to make an offer to purchase the 2007 Senior Notes at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase, upon certain events as defined by the terms of the 2007 Senior Notes. In August 1997, we sold $900 principal amount at maturity 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes (Zero Coupon Notes) due in August 2017. The Zero Coupon Notes were priced with a yield to maturity of 3.5%, resulting in gross proceeds to the Company of $450. The remaining Zero Coupon Notes outstanding are convertible into a maximum of 943,000 shares of Costco Common Stock shares at an initial conversion price of $22.71. Holders of the Zero Coupon Notes may require us to purchase the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of purchase) in August 2012. At our option, we may redeem the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of redemption) any time after August 2002. As of August 29, 2010, $859 in principal amount of Zero Coupon Notes had been converted by note holders to shares of Costco Common Stock, of which the principal converted during 2010, 2009 and 2008 is detailed in the table below: 2010 2009 2008 Principal converted during period $ 1 $ 25 $ 1 Principal converted, including the related debt discount $ 1 $ 19 $ 0 Shares issued upon conversion (000s) 18 562 13 Derivatives We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in the normal course of our business, which we manage, in part, through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts seeking to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on known future expenditures denominated in a foreign 32 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) currency. The contracts are intended primarily to hedge U.S. dollar merchandise inventory expenditures. Currently, these contracts do not qualify for derivative hedge accounting. We seek to mitigate risk with the use of these contracts and do not intend to engage in speculative transactions. These contracts do not contain any credit risk related contingent features. We seek to manage the counterparty risk associated with these contracts by limiting transactions to counterparties with which we have established banking relationships. There can be no assurance, however, that this practice effectively mitigates counterparty risk. The contracts are limited to less than one year. See Note 1 and Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report, for additional information related to these contracts. We are exposed to fluctuations in energy prices, particularly electricity and natural gas, which we seek to partially mitigate through the use of fixed price contracts for approximately 26% of our warehouses and other facilities in the U.S. and Canada. We also enter into variable priced contracts for some purchases of natural gas, in addition to fuel for our gas stations on an index basis. These contracts generally qualify for treatment as normal purchases or normal sales and require no mark to market adjustment. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements With the exception of our operating leases, we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition or consolidated financial statements. Stock Repurchase Programs In September and November of 2007, our Board of Directors approved $300 and $1,000, respectively, of stock repurchases, which expire in August 2010 and November 2010. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an additional $1,000, which expires in July 2011, bringing total authorizations by our Board of Directors since inception of the program in 2001 to $6,800. During 2010, we repurchased 9,943,000 shares of common stock, at an average price of $57.14 per share, totaling approximately $568. During 2009, we repurchased 895,000 shares of common stock, at an average price of $63.84 per share, totaling approximately $57. The remaining amount available to be purchased under our approved plan was $1,434 at the end of 2010, $434 of which expires in November 2010. Purchases are made from time to time, as conditions warrant, in the open market or in block purchases and pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5 1. Repurchased shares are retired, in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments. We continue to review our accounting policies and evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, investments, merchandise inventory valuation, impairment of long lived assets, warehouse closing costs, insurance/self insurance liabilities, and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. 33 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Revenue Recognition We generally recognize sales, net of estimated returns, at the time the member takes possession of merchandise or receives services. When we collect payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services, the amount received is generally recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed. We provide for estimated sales returns based on historical trends in merchandise returns. Amounts collected from members that under common trade practices are referred to as sales taxes are recorded on a net basis. We evaluate whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, when we are the primary obligor, subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, influence product or service specifications, or have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded on a gross basis. If we are not the primary obligor and do not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above, we record the net amounts as commissions earned, which is reflected in net sales. Membership fee revenue represents annual membership fees paid by our members. We account for membership fee revenue, net of estimated refunds, on a deferred basis, whereby revenue is recognized ratably over the one year membership period. Our Executive members qualify for a 2% reward (which can be redeemed only at Costco warehouses), up to a maximum of $500 per year, on qualified purchases made at Costco. We account for this 2% reward as a reduction in sales, with the related liability being classified within other current liabilities. The sales reduction and corresponding liability are computed after giving effect to the estimated impact of non redemptions based on historical data. Investments Investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other than temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment. We employ a methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and our intent and ability to hold the investment. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the issuer, including industry and sector performance, operational and financing cash flow factors, and rating agency actions. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and or issuer conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments. Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, as determined primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting, and are stated using the last in, first out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail inventory method of accounting and are stated using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. We believe the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. We record an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the expected annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end. At the end of 2008, due to overall net inflationary trends, merchandise 34 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) inventories valued at LIFO were lower than the FIFO value, resulting in a $32 charge to merchandise costs. During 2009, due to overall deflationary trends, we recorded a $32 benefit to merchandise costs to adjust inventories valued at LIFO. At the end of 2010 and 2009, merchandise inventories valued at LIFO approximated FIFO after considering the lower of cost or market principle. We provide for estimated inventory losses (shrink) between physical inventory counts as a percentage of net sales. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect results of the actual physical inventory counts, which generally occur in the second and fourth quarters of the year. Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as we progress toward earning those rebates, provided they are probable and reasonably estimable. Other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of agreement, or other systematic and rational approaches. Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Warehouse Closing costs We periodically evaluate our long lived assets for indicators of impairment, such as a decision to relocate or close a warehouse facility. Our judgments are based on existing market and operational conditions. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring a downward adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value. We provide estimates for warehouse closing costs for leased and owned locations to be closed or relocated. A considerable amount of judgment is involved in determining any impairment or our net liability, particularly related to the estimated sales price of owned locations and the potential sublease income at leased locations. These estimates are based on real estate conditions in the markets and our experience in those markets. We make assumptions about the average period of time it would take to sublease the location and the amount of potential sublease income for each leased location. We reassess our liability each quarter and adjust our liability accordingly when our estimates change. Insurance/Self Insurance Liabilities We use a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance pool, to provide for potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property damage, director and officers liability, vehicle liability, and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Income Taxes At the beginning of 2008, we adopted authoritative guidance related to uncertain tax positions, which sets out criteria for the use of judgment in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items. The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Significant judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions. The benefits associated with uncertain tax positions are recorded in our consolidated financial statements only after determining a more likely than not probability that the positions will withstand challenge from tax authorities. When facts and circumstances change, we reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the consolidated financial statements as appropriate. 35 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Recent Accounting Pronouncements See discussion of Recent Accounting Pronouncements in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report. Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to financial market risk resulting from fluctuations in interest and foreign currency exchange rates. We do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions or hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment holdings that are diversified among money market funds, U.S. Government and Agency debt securities, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insured corporate notes, and corporate notes and bonds with effective maturities of generally three months to five years at the date of purchase. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and secondarily to generate yields. The majority of our short term investments are in fixed interest rate securities. These securities are subject to changes in fair value due to interest rate fluctuations. A revised investment policy was approved in December 2007 by our Board of Directors, limiting future investments to direct U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations, repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations, and U.S. Government and Government Agency Money Market funds. The investment policies of our subsidiaries are consistent with our primary objective to preserve principal and secondarily to generate yields. Our wholly owned insurance subsidiary invests in U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations, corporate notes and bonds, and asset and mortgage backed securities with a minimum overall portfolio average credit rating of AAA. All of our foreign subsidiaries investments are primarily in money market funds, investment grade securities, bankers acceptances, bank certificates of deposit and term deposits, all denominated in their local currencies. Additionally, our Canadian subsidiary may invest a portion of its investments in U.S. dollar investment grade securities and bank term deposits to meet current U.S. dollar obligations. Because most of our investments in cash and cash equivalents are short term, interest rate changes are not likely be material to our financial statements. Based on our overnight investments and bank balances within cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2010 and 2009, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $23 and $24 (pre tax), respectively, to interest income on an annual basis. For those investments that are classified as available for sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in market volatility and interest rates are reflected within stockholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive income. The nature and amount of our long and short term debt may vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As of the end of 2010, our fixed rate long term debt included: $41 principal amount at maturity of 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes carried at $32; $900 of 5.3% Senior Notes carried at $899; and $1,100 of 5.5% Senior Notes carried at $1,096, and additional notes totaling $78. Additionally, our variable rate long term debt included a 0.35% over Yen Tibor (6 month) Term Loan of $35. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt and may affect the interest expense related to the variable rate debt. See 36 Table of Contents Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report for more information on our long and short term debt. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Our foreign subsidiaries conduct limited transactions in their non functional currencies, which exposes us to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We manage these fluctuations, in part, through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts, seeking to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on known future expenditures denominated in a foreign currency. As of August 29, 2010, and August 30, 2009, we held forward foreign exchange contracts with a notional amount of $225 and $183, respectively. At the end of 2010 and 2009, fair value assets of $1 and $2, respectively, and a fair value liabilities of $3 and $4, respectively, were recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. A hypothetical 10% strengthening of the functional currency compared to the non functional currency exchange rates at August 29, 2010 and August 30, 2009 would have decreased the fair value of the contracts by $23 and $18, respectively.

We record an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the expected annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end. At the end of 2008, due to overall net inflationary trends, merchandise 34 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) inventories valued at LIFO were lower than the FIFO value, resulting in a $32 charge to merchandise costs. During 2009, due to overall deflationary trends, we recorded a $32 benefit to merchandise costs to adjust inventories valued at LIFO. At the end of 2010 and 2009, merchandise inventories valued at LIFO approximated FIFO after considering the lower of cost or market principle. We provide for estimated inventory losses (shrink) between physical inventory counts as a percentage of net sales. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect results of the actual physical inventory counts, which generally occur in the second and fourth quarters of the year. Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as we progress toward earning those rebates, provided they are probable and reasonably estimable. Other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of agreement, or other systematic and rational approaches. Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Warehouse Closing costs We periodically evaluate our long lived assets for indicators of impairment, such as a decision to relocate or close a warehouse facility. Our judgments are based on existing market and operational conditions. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring a downward adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value. We provide estimates for warehouse closing costs for leased and owned locations to be closed or relocated. A considerable amount of judgment is involved in determining any impairment or our net liability, particularly related to the estimated sales price of owned locations and the potential sublease income at leased locations. These estimates are based on real estate conditions in the markets and our experience in those markets. We make assumptions about the average period of time it would take to sublease the location and the amount of potential sublease income for each leased location. We reassess our liability each quarter and adjust our liability accordingly when our estimates change. Insurance/Self Insurance Liabilities We use a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance pool, to provide for potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property damage, director and officers liability, vehicle liability, and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Income Taxes At the beginning of 2008, we adopted authoritative guidance related to uncertain tax positions, which sets out criteria for the use of judgment in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items. The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Significant judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions. The benefits associated with uncertain tax positions are recorded in our consolidated financial statements only after determining a more likely than not probability that the positions will withstand challenge from tax authorities. When facts and circumstances change, we reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the consolidated financial statements as appropriate. 35 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Recent Accounting Pronouncements See discussion of Recent Accounting Pronouncements in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report. Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to financial market risk resulting from fluctuations in interest and foreign currency exchange rates. We do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions or hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment holdings that are diversified among money market funds, U.S. Government and Agency debt securities, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insured corporate notes, and corporate notes and bonds with effective maturities of generally three months to five years at the date of purchase. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and secondarily to generate yields. The majority of our short term investments are in fixed interest rate securities. These securities are subject to changes in fair value due to interest rate fluctuations. A revised investment policy was approved in December 2007 by our Board of Directors, limiting future investments to direct U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations, repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations, and U.S. Government and Government Agency Money Market funds. The investment policies of our subsidiaries are consistent with our primary objective to preserve principal and secondarily to generate yields. Our wholly owned insurance subsidiary invests in U.S. Government and Government Agency obligations, corporate notes and bonds, and asset and mortgage backed securities with a minimum overall portfolio average credit rating of AAA. All of our foreign subsidiaries investments are primarily in money market funds, investment grade securities, bankers acceptances, bank certificates of deposit and term deposits, all denominated in their local currencies. Additionally, our Canadian subsidiary may invest a portion of its investments in U.S. dollar investment grade securities and bank term deposits to meet current U.S. dollar obligations. Because most of our investments in cash and cash equivalents are short term, interest rate changes are not likely be material to our financial statements. Based on our overnight investments and bank balances within cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2010 and 2009, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $23 and $24 (pre tax), respectively, to interest income on an annual basis. For those investments that are classified as available for sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in market volatility and interest rates are reflected within stockholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive income. The nature and amount of our long and short term debt may vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As of the end of 2010, our fixed rate long term debt included: $41 principal amount at maturity of 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes carried at $32; $900 of 5.3% Senior Notes carried at $899; and $1,100 of 5.5% Senior Notes carried at $1,096, and additional notes totaling $78. Additionally, our variable rate long term debt included a 0.35% over Yen Tibor (6 month) Term Loan of $35. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt and may affect the interest expense related to the variable rate debt. See 36 Table of Contents Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report for more information on our long and short term debt. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Our foreign subsidiaries conduct limited transactions in their non functional currencies, which exposes us to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We manage these fluctuations, in part, through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts, seeking to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on known future expenditures denominated in a foreign currency. As of August 29, 2010, and August 30, 2009, we held forward foreign exchange contracts with a notional amount of $225 and $183, respectively. At the end of 2010 and 2009, fair value assets of $1 and $2, respectively, and a fair value liabilities of $3 and $4, respectively, were recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. A hypothetical 10% strengthening of the functional currency compared to the non functional currency exchange rates at August 29, 2010 and August 30, 2009 would have decreased the fair value of the contracts by $23 and $18, respectively.
